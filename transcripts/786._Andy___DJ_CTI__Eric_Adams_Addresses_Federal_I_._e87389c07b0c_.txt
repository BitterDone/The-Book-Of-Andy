made for fucking animals I don't get it all right anyway what's up man nothing much man it's we got a lot of talk about a lot of cover as always I wanted to bring this follow up because I've actually this guy has become like a an underdog and I like underdogs I do too you know and and I and I like this guy and I think he got the short end of the stick here we'll follow up story going back up to Detroit Detroit judge who put teen and handcuffs during field trip is demoted to speeding tickets come on bro no way bro bro let's talk about it a Detroit judge who was temporarily removed after ordering a teenager into jail clothes and handcuffs during a field trip is back on the bench but assigned to speeding tickets and other relatively minor offenses judge Kenneth King lost courtroom duties in August and was ordered to into social emotional training by the chief judge at 36th district court instead of handling key hearings and major felonies he returned this week to the court's traffic division quote we appreciate his efforts in preparing for this role and wish him success as he transitions into this new responsibility judge William Macon Quinoe Maconico judge William Maconico said in a written statement King's attorney Todd Perkins said the judge is willing to work anywhere at the court quote he truly understands and whole heartily embraces the concept of teamwork Perkins said Thursday and again we covered it on the show you know trying to teach us kid lesson I think listen this is it it's fucked up for what that man did this is bullshit bullshit he was trying to help that girl realize that there's certain situations in life where you've got to have your shit together and being in court is one of them and uh you know the parents came out if you're unfamiliar with the story and basically made a victim out of this girl and said she was traumatized that's all anybody has to say anymore as all that was traumatized by your words or whatever listen dude that ain't my fucking problem and that ain't his problem that's a you problem okay this guy was trying to do good he was trying to help her and now he's getting crucified and having his career affected over something that I think most of us can agree that you know we've had happened to us in some way shape or form or maybe it happened in school and it was a little bit different but we've all been made examples of at some point in time and I would say that most of us deserved it at that time it's how you choose to respond yeah bro and like going home and saying I'm a victim because I he's picking on me when you're falling asleep in his courtroom and you know it's frustrating dude and and it's wrong it's just wrong yeah this is a good man who's trying to do good things and trying to help clean up the youth and now you know and kudos to him for taking on the chin and all that but like bro he shouldn't have to that's that's not right no that I mean okay we're complaining that he's a little too hard okay all right cool so let's remove like I mean it's not like Detroit is not having any crime issues you know I'm saying so let's remove him from from prosecuting actual criminals then like that makes sense like that's not gonna affect the the criminality of Detroit like yeah it's fine let's put him on fucking speeding tickets makes zero sense man I just wanted to follow up on that I stand with I do too bro judge king man I do too he's a good man yeah it's fucked up did these parents shouldn't be able to claim trauma and all this shit like bro it's out of control okay it's the the trauma claim uh it used to just be called shit that happened to you you know saying like now it's got to have this special label and we got to have special uh considerations and privileges and people use it as an excuse all the time dude and it's it's way out of control yeah way out of control bro trauma is a guy like Derek Wida who busts down doors over in Iraq gets his fucking legs shot off trauma is having to kill 40 people so you could save the dead bodies of your four friends that you get the metal of honor for that's trauma dude you don't get over shit like that trauma is not I got yelled at in the courtroom by a judge because I was falling asleep that is not trying to mean this respectful yeah that's bullshit and like dude I don't I think most people are over this shit they're over this overly soft touchy feeling nonsense bullshit that is not congruent with the way life really is life is hard life is hard okay if you're gonna claim I got trauma response on every little thing then bro go stay in your house get yourself one of those bubbles and put a helmet on and roll around the yard and fucking just stay in the fuck away from everybody else bro please yeah like if your trauma is that bad that you know everything someone says triggers you bro that's a you problem that's not a society problem that's where we're getting in trouble with all this shit we're getting in trouble because we're trying to create or the entire world around the a vast minority of people yeah one of the dangers of that too bro like I mean it really hurts the ability to fucking talk about the truth because people are so affected by oh you can't even have an opinion anymore if you have an opinion of anything it's you know I mean dude it's I mean you can you're just gonna hear about it yeah but I don't I mean it is what it is yeah I think everybody should be speaking their mind I think everybody should be having an opinion and like I said you know many times before this idea of cancelling people and and censoring people and political correctness is a social weapon that keeps people who would otherwise speak truth from speaking truth and that's what allows the enemy to encroach on our rights that's what allows culture to be deluded that's what allows national pride to be you know demoralized and deconstructed and you know look at what's going on in the world how many people look bro look at all the downloads we get on the podcast and then look versus how many people comment on the podcast right you see what I'm saying right like look look how many downloads we get to how many shares we get now I'm not complaining because we have a great career but if everybody shared the shit it'd be totally different right the narrative would be different in society but why aren't they well they aren't because they say you know like now I get it there's a lot of people that hear me and they're like fuck that guy that's fine but I'm talking about the people who are regular listeners I'm talking about the people who show up every every week every show and don't share the show because they're afraid they're gonna offend somebody out there in the real world like dude that is the reason we are where we are and I'm not picking anybody I'm not saying that we need to share the show that's not what I'm saying I'm saying our unwillingness to speak truth about things that are happening in society is what's created the situation that we're having to deal with currently and if everybody would just understand that if we speak up in unison it would be a lot harder for people to do the things that are happening we can stop these things and and turn this around but it's gonna take participation from everybody dude oh not too percent and you won't get a trophy for it guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think man let us know with that big step and let's get into these headlines we got some wild stuff happening yeah um remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find all that stuff linked there for your headline number one hello number one reads historic federal indictment against mayor atoms claims he took 123 thousand dollars in free luxury travel and rickety perks huh this is what they're getting him on huh interesting oh I have a lot to say here oh interesting this is interesting let's dive into it mayor Eric Adams took bribes including 123 thousand dollars in free flights and other rickety perks from foreign nationals and exchange for favors according to a bombshell federal indictment unsealed by Manhattan prosecutors Thursday the five-count indictment the first against a sitting New York City mayor details an alleged decade-long pattern of corruption by atoms that includes fraudulently obtaining ten million dollars in public campaign funds now the revelations came after the mayor was indicted by a grand jury on conspiracy wire fraud and bribery charges amid the long-running federal probe quote in 2014 Eric Adams the defendant became Brooklyn borough president thereafter for nearly a decade Adams sought and accepted improper valuable benefits such as luxury international travel including from wealthy foreign business people and at least one Turkish government official sinking to gain influence over him the 57 page indictment charges quote as Adams prominence and power grew his foreign national benefactors sought to cash in on their corrupt relationships with him particularly when in 2021 they became clear that Adams would become New York City's mayors the file filing continues quote Adams agreed providing favorable treatment and exchange for the elicit benefits he received the article continues saying in the sprawling indictment prosecutors laid bear in a ledge scheme that helped Adams underwrite his 2021 mayoral campaign while showering him with free hotel rooms flights on turkeys national airline and meals at high end restaurants and exchange Adams allegedly pressured big apple officials to wave inspections and push through approval for the Turkish consulate uh... and Manhattan the indictment charges now uh... here's a list this is included in the federal indictment will link that on the website for you guys uh... but yeah i mean this this indictment goes back to 2016 when payments started coming through um... talking about free upgrades the business class on round trips and flights uh... from new work to india um... other business trips private jet trips hostels stays um... all of this crazy uh... or you know maybe not crazy stuff like i mean here's one picture in the federal indictment uh... this is a hotel room in turkey that they alleged was paid for by the turkish government um... looks nice see i thought i thought we've stayed in better oh we have but i mean that's still nice i'm staying way worse brother my fucker i came from the time where there was like a quarter machine on the side of the bed and it just vibrating shit yeah wait you never seen one of the bro wait wait wait that's a motel bro that you know how i know you were never really broke wait because you don't know what the fuck i'm talking about or i'm young man no they still got them that's a fuck if you stay in a shitty ass motel with the doors on the outside uh... i've been in those lots of them that have a vibrating bed that you put quarters in why would you need a vibrate i don't know it's some weird sex shit i never understood what is it you put it that's not that wasn't the point that was the i'm saying i've stayed in worse rooms than that a lot worse that's nice all right um his owner also allegedly quote compounded his gains from the illegal campaign contributions by gaming the city's matching funds program uh... which provides a generous match for small dollar donations the courts uh... paper state atoms campaign received more than ten million dollars in matching funds as a result of the phone is to certifications the indictment alleges which means that he would have to have received ten million dollars separately so combining both of those we're talking at least twenty million dollars um that has been given now here's a weird thing that that happened okay um and again guys we i try to do my best to you know look through this shit research this shit me we present the dots as they appear right and i would like you guys to help me understand uh... and it kind of explain this weird thing that has happened um this is Thursday when we're recording the show and aoc is involved in this somehow and i think it's weird okay because she made a call publicly on twitter for eric atoms to resign before the indictment was even released here's a tweet time-stepping everything she says quote i do not see how mayor atoms can continue governing governing new york city the flood of resident nations and vacancies are threatening government function non-stop investigations will make it impossible to recruit and retain a qualified administration for the good of the city he should resign uh and then links to new york times article in which new york times has covered her uh beliefs and points on this topic now that was released at two thirteen p.m um on the twenty fifth the indictment came out today um how did you know what did you know how did you know that within twenty four hours of releasing that tweet that this indictment would have been wrote out now eric atoms he replied of course uh... called her no show congresswoman saying that quote i don't listen to those comments that come from a you know just basically a no show congresswoman she's not doing constituent services in her district uh... adam soda local tv reporter wednesday evening uh... when asked to respond to the popular left-flank politician calling on him to resign uh... and he has since made a statement uh... he has no plans to resign uh... even after the indictments have been released and he had a video clip let's uh... check this out uh... new york uh miss new york city mayor eric atoms addresses federal indictment here's a clip my fellow new york is it is now my belief that the federal government intends to charge me with crimes if so these charges will be entirely false based on lies but they would not be surprising i always knew that if i stood my ground for all of you that i would be a target and a target i became for months leaks and rumors have been aimed at me and it's him to undermine my credibility and paint me as guilty just this past week they searched the home of our new police commissioner looking for documents from twenty years ago just one week after he joined my administration enough i will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit if i'm charged i know i am innocent i will request an immediate trial so the new york is can hear the truth york is no my story they know where i come from i have been fighting injustice my entire life that fight has continued as your mayor despite our police when the federal government did nothing as it's broken immigration policies overloaded our shelter system with no relief i put the people of new york before party and politics now if i am charged many may say i should resign because i cannot manage the city while fighting the case i can also understand every day new york is would be concerned that i cannot do my job while i face accusation but i have been facing these lies for months since i begin to speak out for all of you and their investigation started yet the city has continued to improve make no mistake you elected me to lead this city and lead it i will i humbly ask for your prayers and your patience as we see this through god bless you and god bless the city of new york thank you there's no intention to step down all right now now there's a couple of interesting things here um you know obviously the money coming out of turkey turkeys allegedly supposed to be one of our NATO allies one of our strongest NATO allies um this is from the embassy itself and the state department saying quote turkey in the United States are North Atlantic treaty organization NATO allies and longstanding partners we have a proud history of working together in times of crisis and on regional security and prosperity so i mean it's interesting i don't believe and we'll get into some discussion of course man but i personally don't see this being this turkey that i don't think that's no of course not it there has to be something deeper um and you know ultimately my biggest question is let's say even if that is true okay cool when we'll get you Joe Biden well for doing the exact same shit or any of these other politicians for doing the exact same shit they're all exchanging influence for money that's the whole point we've been saying this on the show for years and years and years Joe Biden's taken tens of millions of dollars from different countries including china um and we have evidence of this that was censored out of the public domain back in uh 2020 right before the election with the hunter Biden laptop and we've had proof of this for a long time nothing happens and the only difference between eric atoms and Joe Biden is that eric i Adams turned his back to the democrat narrative of you know mass immigration because the people at the top the three letter agencies the Biden administration Kamala Harris all these people they understand very clearly why they're bringing these migrants in they understand that long term it's the only way for them to maintain power and keep power and when one of their own turns their back they don't have to go looking far for things to persecute or prosecute them for because they all know what they are all doing and so my take on this is you know i'm not a big fan of eric atoms there's been i will say out for a democrat mayor there's been some things that he's done that i've been like all right that's that seems reasonable there's been some things he's done that i've been like no that doesn't seem reasonable but out of all the democrat mayors that i've seen he's the only one in my opinion that i've seen in the last number of years that actually speaks up on both sides of the issue to what he believes is right so and you know i'm sure new york people have a much more informed and a much better opinion about this dude but from what i can see from here he seems to be somewhat fair i still don't like him i still wouldn't want him as my mayor however this seems to be exactly what they're doing to Donald Trump it seems to be exactly what they do to anybody who turns their back on their narrative um this other guy that was up remember a few months ago that had the gold bars in his closet bottom end uh yeah eminent uh yeah like the anytime these people turn against their own people this is what happens you know they got the receipts they keep the receipts bro yes they all know what they're guilty of and they will allow you to do it until you until you fuck up correct that's exactly what's going on that's how i read it and what i read this as retaliation for is him speaking out on the migrant crisis on how it's affecting the communities and uh you know i think he's telling the exact truth i think he does care about new york people uh and that's that so you know i think you and i are seeing it the same way man you know everybody knows that that they got the hand in the cookie jar until it's time for them you know to turn their backs on someone then they pretend like that's the only one that was doing it when they're all doing it and aoc's no different either dude oh she's got her hand in a couple of cookie jar yeah you know but i mean i think but that's the other point too by them doing this type of shit uh you know and and cracking down on their gotems that that sends the message to all the other people with their hands in the cookie jar yeah don't blow the whistle you better stay fucking them you better shut up that's right and like it's a dangerous game we play but by again my issue is though here man Joe Biden of course we've been covering this for years yeah right like the proof is there 24 million dollars no no no they admitted they admitted it a few months ago bro it's been brought out in hearings after hearings fucking hunter Biden admitted that yeah my dad it was the big guy that they were being referred to like it's all been out it's all been out and like the problem I have here is like you know this involved a country and if you need any more proof this is the the biggest thing about it man like Joe Biden it was China and a lot of it came from Ukraine right we're making plenty plenty of policy decisions that this administration has made has been in direct benefit of those two countries direct benefit right China and Ukraine and if you need any more proof it's like you know Joe Biden you know they again allegedly 24 million dollars from 2016 to 2019 is what was funneled in between 20 different shell companies they had lined out that's just one person's testimony that's Tony Bob Linsky who was on television before the 2020 election with Tucker Carlson saying all of this stuff and everybody said he was lying and then we have 51 intelligence officials signed a piece of paper that said that all these dudes are lying about this what's going to happen to those people right right right but like I mean again like I mean we obviously there's this pay for play scheme going on with Ukraine and like at the same time Joe Biden has been making decisions that takes our money not his money our money taxpayer citizens dollars and gives it right back to this fucking country so he's getting 24 million just free click and clear and then sending billions of our dollars correct it's did it again to fucking today it's eight billion dollars eight million fucking dollars yeah you can't row it's money washing okay and and and it's a way they steal money and what's interesting here you know and we've said this a number of times but people it just doesn't seem to click with people if you pay attention to who gave Joe Biden the most money which was China and then you pay attention to all the moves that he's made over the last four years leaving the border wide open draining our strategic oil supplies leaving a huge amount of military equipment in Ukraine or I mean in Afghanistan depleting our armory reserves sending equipment and munitions to Ukraine this shit in the Middle East I mean we could go on and on and on letting crime run rampant not reporting crime now think of all that stuff and a lot of people think like oh Joe Biden's just this old senile guy well if you were China and you were paying this man money what are you paying him money for right you are paying him money in my speculation to decrease the strength and the conditions of the United States America so that it benefits China and if we really think about that this is treasonous behavior this is a man who's sworn of to do what's in the best interests of you and me and everybody else that lives here who has taken money and done the opposite he's not some nice old man he's not some senile old man he may be senile but yeah but this guy is a 100% trader to the country of this country period he's taking money making decisions and by the way it's their whole administration they they get paid they make decisions that are not in the interest of we the peasants according to them it hurts us it hurts our way of life we are tax slaves we have to deal with the crime we have to deal with the migrants we have to deal with the shitty economy we have to deal with all of this stuff because they want to make some money and dude that's what we're dealing with and that is treason that is not what this country is based upon that is not what this what we're supposed to have here in the United States and Eric Adams just crossed the line and their hammering him the same way that hammer anybody else you know what I mean that's the other part of it too you know we wonder like well okay well why haven't they you know done this and like we know we get these congressional hearings and nothing fucking happens it's because it's on both sides they're all doing it you know I'm saying so like I'm not I can't call you out for the same shit that I'm doing like no I don't want to fuck up my shit you know I'm saying because like what like who's gonna call me out now right like and we're all doing it right and and like you know my my point is is like the accountability it has to be a cry from the people man it has to come from us if we don't want these people to be held accountable then all right cool just be quiet keep doing your same stuff you know yeah but gay America people are gonna pay the price for that that's what I'm saying I keep you paying your outrageous gas prices keep paying your fucking grocery bills and it'll be watching the migrants get $30,000 on their ebt cards while you send your family off to work three different jobs so that you can afford to feed your American family it's bullshit it's wild man wild guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments but that being said let's go cruise some of these comments man we got some interesting here the interesting ones here this first comment comes from at Sarah Lee C6 I French onion soup in Bridgerton I'm with DJ of course she is I've got a lot of

really non-binary you know what's so funny about non-binary people what is that they don't understand that by saying that they're non-binary they're actually binary yeah it doesn't even make sense yeah they must have eat onions too I'm either this or that yeah you know what that's called I'm none of them well that means you're this bro and you know what else off topic it's like the same people say oh you know genitalia does not define gender well then why the fuck are cutting it off you know saying like why are you doing that so why does cut it off affirm that you're the other one then it's a good question to have I know it's a good question much logic there makes way too much binary sense yeah but yeah let's dive into this because I don't there is some interesting stuff happening you know I think it's important we know the dynamics between Biden and Harris right and that you know there was a coup that happened inside of this current administration the second one in four years where they push this man out right love hate Biden whatever they push the man out okay it's very obvious but there are some interesting dynamics that are happening between these two and I think there might be you know we always talk about what's going on possibly happened before the election man and let's just dive into this because there's some interesting stuff happening this headline that's article reads Joe Biden Kamala Harris announced new executive actions on Thursday to address gun violence an election year move that builds the president's legacy on issues that and provides Harris with a fresh opportunity to highlight her leadership as vice president during a White House event Thursday Biden is expected to sign an executive order designed to address the trauma inflicted on children by active shooter drills in schools as well as tackle the threat of machine gun conversion devices where which are small devices that can be made with 3d printer and turn a handgun into a fully automatic weapon now the actions are timed to this week's one year anniversary of Biden's creation of the first ever office of gun violence prevention which he launched in part to identify additional ways to tackle gun violence from the executive branch without Congress the joint Biden Harris appearance one of a handful since the president turned his reelection campaign over to her in July will highlight Harris's role overseeing the White House office of gun violence prevention it also provides an opportunity for her to lean into her leadership on an issue in her official capacity as vice president while giving her fresh policies to tout on the campaign trail so you have that happen all right and i feel like obviously between these two and they're you know there's circles that they individually have there's some massive division going on right and i think Biden's kind of pushing himself into a place now where he's like fuck her whatever we got to do fuck her right like how about we give her you mean like putting on Trump's hat or carrying it onto the airplane front everybody or like you know making her be vocal on one of the most divisive topic conversations in the country two months before the fucking election you know i'm saying like you're forcing her into a position to talk about an address gun rights and things like that like i mean it's very interesting dynamics that happen that are happening there um you know i'm all that's happening Kamala is getting pressed on the current situation of the economy in the country on msnbc where the seven on reads Kamala Harris struggles to answer economic questions on msnbc so vice president Kamala Harris gave her first solo interview Wednesday on cable news as the democratic party's nominee for president and failed to answer questions even in a friendly interview by msnbc's Stephanie rule rule who faced criticism for comments friday in which she had defended Harris from having to face questions about her policies axterics pointed questions and even fact check some of her repeated talking points when Harris tried to claim falsely as she has in the past that quote Donald Trump left us with the worst economy since the Great Depression um it was in fact growing when he left office rule noted quote it was during covid and employment was so high because we shut down the government we shut down the country let's check this clip out expanding that child tax credit or you mentioned housing before giving that extra money for our first home if you can't raise corporate taxes or if GOP takes control of the senate where do you get the money to do that do you still go forward with those plans and borrow well but we're going to have to raise corporate taxes and we're going to have to raise we're going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires pay their fair share that's just it it's about paying their fair share i'm not mad at anyone for achieving success but everyone should pay their fair share and it is not right that the teachers and the firefighters that i meet every day across our country are paying a higher tax then the richest people in our country that's not true if he was in charge of taxes he would have paid more but how do you find that line to make sure corporations are paying their fair share but they're not leaving our country well listen i work with a lot of CEOs i have spent a lot of time with CEOs and i'm going to tell you that the business leaders who are actually part of the engine of america's economy agree that people should pay their fair share they also agree that when we look at a plan such as mine that is about investing in the middle class investing in new industries investing in bringing down costs invest in entrepreneurs like small businesses but the overall economy is stronger and everyone benefits that's not true at all that's not true nothing she said was yeah as you expect check multiple times during that interview um to which even ruled uh in a follow up uh i guess uh conversation on MSNBC had this to say talk about that answer i do but here's what's a little tricky she doesn't answer the question around if the GOP is controlling the senate if she can't raise corporate taxes where is she going to get the money from is you know to expand the child's tax credit and do all the things she wants to do and she says we just have to do it and that's great and that's a campaign promise but but the issue is if it means we're just going to borrow again then what we're doing is we're just never addressing the deficit and back in the days when you were a proud Republican debts and deficits mattered they still matter let me tell you what her policy before you get on with this is going to do okay just gonna shit rolls down hold on AI is taking over okay AI is starting to be combined with robotics two years ago when AI first started coming out i said the people are going to start moving into the trades because the trades are immune from AI i was incorrect about that statement because now they're infusing AI with robotics Elon Musk is making humanoid robots that will be able to do every single fucking job that any tradesmen can do okay so that's not even immune so what's going to happen here is if she raises corporate tax is that the gu- the the and she knows this because she's a fucking communist okay the reason that she is not stating what it is she believes for the economy is because if she said it everybody would go vote for Trump tomorrow and even if they hated him because it's so damaging to not just American workforce but human workforce all right and so what's happening here what will happen is if she raises tax on corporations they will start to look for ways to streamline operation which means they'll bring in new technology they will replace human jobs with AI and they will cut that part of their business out so that they can pay more tax which will create more unemployment which creates a more dependent voting class that will vote for her that is entirely what's going to happen if she is to do what she says she's going to do and that is her plan intentionally she knows that's the plan she's not she the reason she's not answering questions is because if she says hey we're going to raise corporate tax and that's going to create more unemployment which is going to create dependency on people voting for the government for support which is what I want because that's the party I belong to people aren't going to vote for her that's real man and the shit rolls downhill you make it harder on the fucking corporations in the business owner well listen fucking ten years ago we didn't have that option DJ I didn't have an option ten years ago to replace workforce with AI okay now that's a real option all right so saying this ten years ago meant fuck we're going to have to squeeze it out we're going to have to figure out how to do it saying it now is just forcing the adoption of AI and forcing the American people into a lower class unemployed system where they will be equal yes but they will be equally impoverished you know that's that is exactly what's going on here and you listen I'm just telling you well the interesting thing that happens or that also happened with this and this goes back we covered this a little bit yesterday when Joe Biden went on the view but there was something else very important thing that that he said that I think is super important for people to realize and pay attention to from Trump Warren posted this actually Biden said quote as vice president there wasn't a single thing that I did that she couldn't do and so I was able to delegate her responsibility on everything from foreign policy to domestic policy Joe is Kamala Kamala Joe bro come on man it doesn't take common that takes that you have to it takes minimal amounts of common sense to understand that yeah like these people standing on stage Tim walls and Kamala Harris saying when day one we're going to do this everybody in the audience even the people that are clapping for him are thinking well why don't you do it now right all right right well this was but that's why I was saying it's leading to this you know this this dynamic that's shifting with between them to like he's trying to like really just push her out on her own well I think I think you're right I think he's I think he's exposing her vulnerabilities 100 potentially and I think you know and then he's doing the same old game he's been doing which is all I fucking didn't know what I said right I mean Roji he's somewhere today didn't even know what city was in you know but with that being said I first see before the election that they're going to have an Eric Adams level event with Joe Biden and they'll just get him the fuck out the way completely possibly I mean we're within 40 something days now I mean dude I don't know I will say this some big stuff's going to happen in the next 40 days yeah big stuff and I personally you know look guys if you've been listening for a long time I've been saying that this was going to happen I've said they were either going to bring back a pandemic okay which they tried didn't nobody went along with it they're going to do a war which they're trying very hard to do right now um or you know they were going to try to kill Trump which they've tried twice yep okay so now that none of that stuff has actually worked I predict a big black swan event which black swan event is a negative event like 9-11 which really adjusts the course of history and I believe that it's going to be orchestrated by intelligence agencies across the world to keep this man the western intelligent agencies to keep this man out of office yeah and it's weird last little piece on this too we're the war we're the war mongers bro oh no no it's not fucking China and it's not it's not Iran it's not Russia no it's fucking us yep okay so the rest of those eastern countries they don't want Kamala Harrison like they they paint it in this country like they want Kamala Harrison so they can fucking take up bro these guys they don't want to send their people to get killed they don't want war they don't want all this shit we're the ones to instigate all this shit we're the ones and everybody else's country fucking up their shit yep okay um and it's not them no well I'm in dude and dude that's not me like being a traitor to the United States there's a big difference between loving your country and loving your government right and I think everybody knows that our our country and our government do not represent each other no current now no well I mean if you want even more proof bro like to that point uh the mayor and London just today said uh you know made a statement saying that you know we should not allow the Americans should not allow Trump back in office and when pushed on why it's like oh well because he's gonna make he's gonna fuck up the NATO funds and the percentages and what we have to pay we'll have to pay more here yeah yeah bro they wanted to be on our backs bro they wanted to be on your back and on my back and on all these other people's back and those people saying oh the rich got to pay their share mother fucker they the way they frame that they they they're talking about people like me when it's the people that own the biggest companies in the world the fortune 100 companies that figure out how to not pay shit and they're not talking about those people you know why because those are the people that fund their campaigns those are their friends those are the people they rub elbows with and hobnob with at the met you know the these people are looking to tax the peasant class the wealthy part of the peasant class which you know relatively isn't even wealthy because the wealthy part of the elite class there are hundreds of billions of dollars worth of wealth a wealthy guy in regular peasant class like a real wealthy guy might be worth a few million dollars you see what I'm saying they want to tax more that's right and they won't mention those guys's names because like you said I mean they're protecting them because they know if they do mention the name those motherfuckers on the media bro they own everything if they do you think these people are looking at their buddies saying hey you're gonna pay your fair share no no dude you gonna pay your fair share my donations this year that's what the fuck they're saying yeah and not only but but dude they it's an intentional play to raise taxes to a point where companies cannot operate and then they have to remove the human element from their production line from their offices from customer service from sales from fulfillment everything as much as possible so that they can reduce their costs and operate these people understand that AI can do that and instead of them thinking well that's going to really hurt people that's gonna hurt people's you know job it's gonna eliminate the American dream these people are just greedy people who say well fuck we can squeeze an extra fucking 20% out of them now because we got to say aye right so they're forcing companies to fire their human capital which is gonna come down to the consumer legitimately choosing companies that make a commitment towards human capital which you know we're you know all my companies are like that yeah but that puts them that's how that opens up a whole another lane of competition too because those businesses that do adapt the robots and AI's and shit like let's be real this is nothing against humans but like yeah the shit's more efficient right and so now you got companies having to compete with efficiency now I know and it's like if all these other companies are doing shit 30 times more fucking efficient and you know you know I'm saying it's like it's like the old company that's still using the fucking manual cash right now but but we're using brand new POS machines but look at the average humans willingness to jump all over technology right and and adopt it right look at the average household who has regular jobs and they're like fuck look how cool chat GPT is look how cool this is I can write a paper with it they're not thinking what it's gonna actually do to them it's gonna create a scenario where you're obsolete and when you're obsolete the government's gonna have to support you but you think they're gonna support you by like paying you a good salary and make it sure you have a great lifestyle bro you're gonna be porous fuck well that and that's the wind of communism like they're trying to put us in the situation where it's a lose-lose for us it's a win-win for them because those businesses that can't afford that they don't adapt they crumble they fall aside that's less fucking employment for the country or like the whole shot to say on the show okay well what happens when those businesses go overseas then okay well we just talk okay cool then we just won't fucking supply United States like it's a win-win in the eyes of communism 100% and that's the danger yes yes your company either fails which creates unemployment I think people need to understand they're intentionally creating unemployment right it's intentional they you you you fail your business which creates unemployment you have fire employees which creates unemployment or you move your country or your company across the world which creates unemployment okay that's dependency on the government yes that's what they need because they want to maintain the mirage of a quote unquote democracy and some sort of fair voting system here in America which we all know is compromised they want to they want to create and keep that facade going as a free society and the only way they can do that is by creating enough people this is what the migrations about enough people that are gonna vote for free shit Obama started this back in 2008 saying oh we're gonna give everybody free cell phones um-hmm Obama phone yeah yeah people are gonna vote for all this free shit and you know they're not gonna have anything as a result of it they're using humans laziness and greed against them to get what they want yeah that's the real shit man guys jump in on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three we talked about this said we keep you guys up to date and keep some tabs on this conversation let's let's talk about it um there was uh this this this scary monster under the bed of a government shutdown happening well that has been avoided um with some great sacrifices let's look at this uh headline reads Senate passes funding bill without save act avoiding potential shutdown um in my opinion the right has bent the knee to the left and uh this opens the door to a very dangerous uh position in the next 40 days when it comes to our elections this is not a good thing not a good thing at all it's diving to it uh the Senate passed a short term spending bill on Wednesday avoiding a partial government shutdown at the end of the month and allowing lawmakers up for reelection to head home early to campaign by a vote of 78 to 18 senators approved a spending bill that will keep funding steady until December 20th known as a continuing resolution or CR uh passed in the house hours before being taken to the floor in the upper chamber with representatives approving the spending bill 341 to 82 132 Republican House members voted in favor the bill saw 82 votes against it all of which were cast by Republicans those are the Republicans that are fighting for this country by the way well i mean it's better than none which is what we had fucking eight years ago yeah um lawmakers avoided a partial shutdown with only days of spare despite a GOP demand that the safeguard American voter eligibility act or the save act be included several Republicans in Congress had insisted the save act be attached to the spending bill including summons the Senate the save act would require proof of citizenship in order to register to vote a short term bill that included that measure failed in the House representatives when speaker Mike Johnson uh brought it for a vote last week effectively killing hopes for a continuing resolution with the save act attached um and again these are the same people the same Democrats the same left that you know vetoed and and and opposed the bill to deport illegal immigrants who committed sex crimes in this country it's the same exact people voted both uh no on this one but then yes to make sure that those same exact people they don't want to deport can vote that's a fucked up thing but the House voted down the stopgap bill 202 to 220 uh with several Republicans voting against it than two voting present uh three vulnerable Democrats voted in favor of it um a CR with a save act had also been backed by former president Donald Trump who urged Republicans not to accept a spending deal that did not include it but while Trump encouraged it Republicans both publicly and privately worried that their party would be blamed for a shutdown um and with that being said you know so this bill you know the stopgap bill spending bill passes cool they can you know keep still in our money and then they can go and promise you make more promises in your communities and shit to vote for them um but who's gonna be voting for them because it's not just gonna be Americans and they're already starting to show their cards man look at this headline representative time Tiffany reveals duplicate absentee ballots have no barcode representative time Tiffany from Wisconsin revealed that thousands of duplicate absentee ballots contained no barcode on them after officials in Madison County said the duplicate ballots had the barcode so in a in a post on Twitter Tiffany wrote that officials in the Madison clerk's office has stated that because the duplicate ballots had identical barcodes they would not be allowed to be submitted Tiffany's post came a day after he called for an investigation after Madison officials revealed that 2200 duplicate ballots had been sent out to roughly 10 warts this is uh his tweet that he posted yesterday um saying quote developing although the Madison clerk's office claims the voting system does not allow a ballot with the same barcode to be submitted my office has proof that there is no barcode on the actual ballots here is a picture of the absentee ballots no barcodes um and so in a response to the news that more than 2000 duplicate ballots have been sent out to several warts Tiffany wrote a letter addressed to Meribeth Witzel-Bale the clerk of Madison stating that she was uh that he was alarmed at the news quote like many Wisconsinites I was alarmed by recent reports that around 2000 duplicate ballots have been sent out by your office Tiffany wrote the clerk's office has sent issued a six sentence statement claiming without providing any significant details that this quote unquote error affected an isolated number of voters in a single ward and was quickly caught and corrected um Tiffany continued on to question how the error have been discovered what the exact number of duplicate ballots since out had been and whether the clerk's office had reached out to law enforcement officials to investigate whether this error was the result of simple incompetence or deliberate nefarious act this can't just be swept under the rug tiffinny toad fox news and the statement quote the people responsible for this need to be held accountable we've been saying they're gonna cheat of course they're already starting to fucking do it yeah they should listen these people should all go to jail forever forever and ever and ever imagine the ego so on someone as an individual that believes that they and their political viewpoints are so superior that they are willing to subvert an election process that is for the common good of everybody else right so basically you think that your views are so important and so right that you can cheat thinking that that's okay like it's so disrespectful it's a hero mentality bro they think they're saving the fucking country right because that's what these people are pumping them up to think well it's the same reason why Trump keeps having to deal with this shit you know they keep saying Trump's a threat Trump's a threat Trump's a threat all these people that are cheating all these people that are printing these ballots all these people they all deserve life in prison and I hope that's what they get I hope that's what they get but you know our lawmakers haven't done shit in the last four years they had four years to do this why didn't they actually fix the system right why well my only conclusion is the reason that the Republicans didn't work harder to fix the system is probably because they also benefit from the system in some way shape or form so well they don't want to be the next air of Adams yeah for sure that's how I see it man yeah hey before we move on from this topic do you have that clip of that FBI will so blower I can get out of it can we throw that in show please yeah because this this is an important clip that people need to see before next week you talk about the where you like saying like yeah where is voice is cracking in shit prepare yourself yeah you better hurry up my dots eat your candy but I'll see this candy you owe nothing that shit real quick the many he grabbed that microphone I'm just gonna say but no no it was mine but you don't want to admit to this shit this is his he bought this shit please do not lie like this on national fucking podcast I can't fucking stand you all right let's play this clip and we'll talk about this topic three point five and everybody on the minority party there's some talk they're fearing what Donald Trump would do in the next administration why they look at the guy who's been before we get into this this is an FBI whistleblower okay so this guy is an FBI agent who's blowing the whistle on some of the shit going on inside the FBI so let's play it who's been persecuted by the FBI and everybody in the room understands it mr. Alan do you have comments you wish to make I give you about a minute minute and a half and then I want to turn the rest of my time mr. Jordan yes sir I would just say that I consider the hearing today my last act of service as a public servant for the United States of America and I'll give you my professional opinion I was an intel professional for our country for many years and I would give recommendations and I'd also look at indications and warnings so I would offer this to the American people is my warning to them so this is a warning is the American people I say I personally have no confidence that the FBI will rain in its own conduct I've been persecuted along with Garrett Steve and Kyle and countless other whistleblowers it is my opinion that the bureau used a reprisal and fear to control the workforce and it's been a seemingly effective tactic I personally believe that there are no current effective checks and balances against them conducting walless action with any type of correction in a legitimate time frame I welcome the work of the IG but I think any type of walless action there's no legitimate time frame to rain them back in their ability to overclassify information can allow them to stone wall forever so the American people you have a duty as a citizen to vote and I strongly urge you to do so it's how you participate in the American experience I know people have doubts about election integrity but you must vote it is your claim state your claim and don't forfeit it willingly have your voice heard my other recommendations are in the natural order first vote the second is the second amendment arm yourself and know how to defend yourself make three to four friends in your neighborhood and promise to come to each others mutual aid and times of harm hardship and during the great depression people stocked up a pantry so I think that's a good practice especially in our economic times and make sure you have three to four months of food as a person of faith I'd say pray the rosary go to the first Friday devotions that's for everybody all my brothers and sisters of all faiths and I know I'm Catholic and read the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and live it every day and that's all I have to say thank you for the time you know mr. Allen the fact that there are servants like you who have born up under persecution that a lot of political leaders in this country do not care about is the thing that heartens the American people and I'm confident the American people were will resolve the situation did you hear the fear in that man's voice scarry shit bro yeah that is a true patriot that is what an American looks like all of you people in the three letter agencies whichever one all of you guys in the secret service that know what's going on but you're afraid to say shit we need way more of that very quickly we need every single person that is in these agencies that knows what's going on to come out and make that public right now that cannot hurt all of you they will not get all of you and if you don't come out that man will probably be killed okay we like he said that is from the inside we are under the control of very select very powerful individuals who him by his own admission from the inside says there is no confidence in the fact that they will police themselves or re-embrace themselves in from what they are doing these people are these people are not just collecting intelligence on the enemy they are collecting intelligence on American citizens they are putting American citizens on domestic watchlaces they are spying on American citizens and they are creating a scenario where the the the idea of a representative republic is a mirage okay we are controlled by these agencies these agencies do not care what you or I or any of these other people might struggle with or what you're struggling with or what your neighbor is struggling with they care about maintaining the mirage of a representative republic getting us to go out and think that we're free when in reality it's a few hundred people at the top that are calling all the place and you heard what that man said go out and vote okay if you do not vote and you do not get every single person that you know to go vote with you you are basically going to hand this country over to a communist regime that is going to ruin your life and make it impossible for your kids to have a good life okay and it's it's going to take decades to get back if we're lucky if you go listen to what the president of El Salvador talks about he talks about how they had to go through two wars they had to lose a million lives to get their country back out of communism all right now we have a choice here we can either go the route of El Salvador and elect someone who's going to clean up the streets clean up the roads clean up fucking everything in the country and make it look good or we go the role of the old El Salvador and we go through the next 20 30 40 years of being one of the poorest most decrepit most crime written societies on the planet all right and that's our choice and if you guys and I'm talking especially to you rural guys you rural people think that it's not going to come to you they're going to come to you they are going to make it impossible for you to do business you guys who farm they're already doing it you already see it they're already making the cost of fertilizer the cost of raw materials the cost of fuel the taxes that they put on you the regulations they put on you to grow crops they're already doing it okay so all of you guys whether you live in the city the suburbs or the rural areas need to be on the phone talking to every single person you know saying hey we have to vote are you voting are you voting are you voting right together make it a party go vote drink beer the rest of the day I don't give a shit but if we don't go vote because people keep saying oh the elections rigged it's rigged it's rigged it's rigged it's rigged that's what they said in El Salvador too that's how the communist got in power they demoralized the voter base to not participate they legally inserted themselves not illegally legally inserted themselves into power and ruined the country and that's what's going to happen here okay so when that man who is on the inside of the FBI is telling you this and not some crazy conspiracy podcaster youtuber whatever people call me these days you should listen go fucking vote and make sure that every single person you know votes as well yeah man that's real shit bro that's scary to hear I saw this video man that's a brave dude bro dude that's a brave man like it's not bullshit what he's saying like when he said they're not trying to rain themselves in the like when he talked about the IG for the FBI the inspector general who is supposed to be this non bias person that keeps the FBI in line investigates different shit that has seemed corrupt going back to the J6 shit you know I'm saying like we know for a fact there were FBI agents undercover not only a couple there were a whole bought a shit tone but guess what the IG doesn't want to fucking release or even just admit to how many were there what he talks about that's what he said the overclassification of information allows them to stone wall indefinitely you know and so it's like dude he's not talking out of his ass man and he's risking a whole fuck a lot he's risking his life his family's life his kids life whatever he's got he's risking and that's why it's important and I know because you guys reach out to us okay I know there's a lot of you guys in the FBI I know there's a lot of you guys in the CIA there's guys in the FBI they don't like us and the CIA they don't like us but most of you do okay and if you see what's going on you're not speaking up you're complicit in the downfall of this country it is time to grow a fucking set of nuts and speak to fuck up like this man did guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you think down in the comments with that being said let's get
