I know you're ready to kill somebody for this great. Let's split it. That's fine. All right. I can only drink half the shit anyway. Real talk. All these motherfuckers around the office. They down those bro. I can't do it. Man. I'll stay up all night talking shit on the, but maybe actually not be a bad idea. We'll do it 24 hour stream session. I'll tell you what. If you have one of these, it's fucking good. Bro, I wrote like some that that's my that's number one right now. I said I don't run ads on the show. But if I did, I mean, we definitely be for this amazing first form energy. Grape smash. Now what's the other one? Because there was another one came out with summer eight summer eight. Yeah. I haven't tried that one yet. Me neither because I don't care because it's a great. Real grapes number one. Yeah. I think we both got the summer eight over there. What do you think of that? You guys like that one? I think the grapes better probably. You do? Yeah. What's what's that one like? Like what's a taste like summer eight? Starberry lemonade. Oh, that sounds good. Yeah, that does sound good. But bro, that grape is fucking taste like cool. A bro nailed it. Yeah. Should a well now grapes. Man should have called it grape drank. Bro, I listen. I was going to suggest that grape drink or DJ's juice purple, purple juice. Yeah. Either one of those will work. But the shit's fucking amazing. It's great. Good job. Thank you. Proud of you. Team did a good job. Yeah. For sure, man. I am part of the team though. Yeah. Had a great weekend, man. Weekend was great, man. Yeah. Yeah. It was fucking awesome. It was. We actually did live the weekend in our time. We actually did. Yeah. Bro, it was awesome. It's fucking great. So much fun, dude. It was so cool seeing everybody. You know, one thing about the first form community, dude, is that you know if someone shows up wearing that one P, they're a good motherfucker. And dude, just to be around those people for three, four days, it just charges you up, man. Well, you just get a different sense that like, you know, seeing a follower account doesn't give you. Right? Like you know that these people, you're physically seeing these people and you know for a fact that we're all on the same page. Yeah. For sure, dude. It's, it's cool, man. You know, it made me think too, like, you know, one of the reasons that we're in this predicament in society is because people are using social media as an outlet for their rage and for their dissatisfaction for things. And they believe that posting a meme or making a comment is like getting it done. Like that's it. Yeah, dude. And like I actually started thinking about this this weekend, you know, what if there was no social? What if there was no internet? And these people were doing these things? What would you do then? That's what we should be doing. Whatever that is, that's what we should be doing. You know, getting engaged, organizing in person, getting together and talking about strategies, not just about what's wrong, but what we need to do moving forward and what are individual roles in that are. And I thought that was cool because that's what I talked about at Summer Smash on Saturday. And and seem like people were definitely with it. For sure. But people got to understand man, we all play an individual role in this. And it's not to post memes or just talk shit on the internet. You know, we have to get activated. We have to get engaged. And for those of you that are wondering, you know, what should I do? Well, pretend you didn't have Instagram. Pretend you didn't have social media. Pretend there was no internet. What would you do then? What would you do if you're reading stories about all this criminal activity that has to do with like COVID or all of these things going on in the world? What would you do? Do that. You see what I'm saying? Bro, shit, man. You got to cake somebody to do. I did. Bro, steep. You know, a lot of you guys don't know. I've been good friends with Steve Aoki for a long time. And he let me cake someone. I don't think he's ever let people cake know. Yeah. Yeah. I think I know. The guys who were handing in the cakes they tried to stop me. They're good dudes. Yeah. Yeah. Super good dude. But I was like, this was his name. Yeah. Dude, those guys were awesome. Yeah. Bro, he is a first club. That whole team first class people for sure, bro. First. I can't imagine having a type of schedule. Well, dude, no shit. No, he fucking left here at what 10 o'clock, 10, almost 10. There. And he played a show in Vegas at 1 a.m. Which is 3 a.m. R. Time. That's what I'm saying. But like that. Well, it's insane. Yeah. Dude, he's a hard working dude. You ever seen his Netflix documentary? No. You should watch it. No. Dude, he does like what 250 shows a year. Bro, he's the hardest working artist in show business. No question. Not even comparable. It's like he's a million miles ahead of it. What everybody else is willing to do. And what's cool about him, dude, is he's just a normal guy that likes to have fun and help people have fun. And he's just a good fucking dude. Like pickleball apparently. Bro, he likes all sports. He's a pretty good athlete. Yeah, he is. And dude, he, but dude, it was cool because I mean, dude, I got a, I had to watch, I had to rewatch his videos of caking people because he like kind of just like, you know, he's not trying to, like I went out there trying to decapitate people. You went full, you went a little aggressive. Full of girl. Yeah. And I, well, it's got to be manual. Get one shot at that. But dude, did you know, did you know who I got? No, it was fucking Gabe and Matt. You're in the office. So there was that girl up on that dude's shoulders. There was two girls. Now she kind of like ducked it. I know. But dude, I threw that motherfucker's hardest I could. I think they clocked that thing at like 106. But he ended up smoking our dudes. Hey, it was funny. That's definitely a memory I'll never forget. For sure. Yeah. For sure. Fucking awesome weekend. Now, we got a lot of stuff to cover. Like I said, guys, this is a super important episode. You guys have to make sure that you guys help us out support us. Sure, this message, get this message out because there's a lot of crazy shit going on that we got to talk about. Have to address it. But first, we got a, we got mentioned again. We did. Yeah. We're Maxine Waters. She mentioned who? She mentioned us. No, she did. Yeah. She called us domestic terrorists. Well, I mean, yeah, that's almost like that's almost my name. Everybody's got to be son. Bro, they're the domestic terrorists. This lady's unhinged, man. No, motherfucker. They everything they say everybody notices it now. I'm not bringing anything that anybody's attention. But everything they say is projection and everything they do is what they're doing. And if you want to know who the actual domestic terrorists are, look at the people who point their finger at patriotic Americans, people that they've used to fight wars, people that they've celebrated in Memorial Day, in Veterans Day, and Fourth of July for hundreds of years. And they call them domestic terrorists. The people who do that are the domestic terrorists. 1000% man. And then that's what Maxine Waters is. She, she did an interview where she called Trump supporters domestic terrorists. And this was on MSNBC. And she was discussing the guilty verdict for Trump in New York. Here's the clip, man. Let's see what she has to say. I am going to spend some time with the criminal justice system, with the justice system, asking them, tell us what's going on with the domestic terrorists. Are they preparing a civil war against us? Should we be concerned about our safety? What is he doing with this divisive language? It is dangerous. And we're going to have to make sure that we understand that we're not at risk with this man talking in the way that he's doing. Oh, you're a risk, bitch. I would mean our, we aren't risk with the way that she's talking. Well, is this she the one that said it like go get people's faces and all that stuff back in 2020? She 100% is. Yeah. Now they're going to scare it, dude. No, they're terrifying. Yeah. And real talk, lady, you're lucky that we have restraint. You're lucky we have restraint. These people are losing, they're losing big. They're, they're fucking freaking a fuck out. And I think it's hilarious. I think it's great. Yeah, fuck this lady should be scared. Yeah. She got Buddhist gotchas in her pocket. No, she don't. She got, she's got fucking, where there's original lace with sign eyes. She probably gets a little kids. These people are evil, dude. I would love nothing more. She sparks the Hollywood Halloween candy. I would love nothing. Yes, she's one of those people. I would love nothing more to see. These people get held accountable for they have to get that thing they will. Yeah, I think they will. It's on the void. I unavoidable. I think I think one way or another. Yeah. But so yeah, Max and water's dumbass of the day. Congratulations, lady. Thanks for the shot out. She's about 200 years old, bro. She's dumbass of the century. Guys, remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for sale.com. You guys can find all of this stuff linked there. We'll keep that stuff for you there with that being said headline. Number one, let's just get right into the spice. Yeah, right into the, the shatakis. Yeah, let's stay away from those white people with no spice. Yeah. Yeah, now I'll be that racist. Listen, the PowerPoint might get stolen. If I don't get it. See, that was racist. You know, every time I run with you, I got to check for my wallet. Oh, you all got to take a shit. We all look at each other. Everybody's got the world. This is growth right here. I want to confess to a crime. Okay, I did steal your cigar lighter. Which one? The silver one. Oh, yeah, I do have it. Well, see, this is how I know you're a shitty criminal because that's my shittiest lighter. Well, intentional. I got home, bro. I was talking empty in my pockets. I said, fuck, black people still on lighters. There are those. And like, it's fun. First of all, let's be real. Black people steal and lie. Stealing lighters is not a black thing. Still, lighters is a just steel American tradition. Yeah, just stealing might even be a European tradition too. It might be a world thing. Yeah, lighters are meant to be stolen. Wow, it was just stealing in generals of black. That's all I was saying. All my bikes, all my bikes going up. We're stolen by black people. I swear to God. So are DJs. My two, my two actually, I just thought it was weird. Does it feel like he's a little bitter about that? It does. He's still holding on to that. What's happened? Have a writer for me, too. See shot. You got to get without another bike, bro. So he coves down. We got healed this man. Bro, no, I was just maybe think, bro, because you accused me of stealing your lighters a couple of times. Oh, I did it. Yeah, you did. No, no, that one big one. And it was right down the table. Which one? In the lounge, a blue big. You're just like, DJ, I'm still missing that one. No, it's only. Anyways, guys, head on number one, man, we got to get into this. So at 10 a.m. Eastern time, 9 a.m. Central time, where we recording. Mr. Anthony Fauci was called to Congress to testify. And it is some heat going on there. Let's connect some dots. So yes, so he's testifying on COVID-19 origins, the United States response, some of the trust, the science that was put out. And of course, we got some, we got, we got some receipts for you guys, of course. But before he even made it in to the room, he's getting, he's getting some, some pretty hot heckling going on. Here's a quick video of him just entering the building. Oh, look at this fucking rat. Hey, Tony, are you sad that you're in the number three spot as an oppression murdering people throughout the entire world after Stalin and Hitler? Sir, how many people do you think you murder based on your policies a lot with light pens at the White House Corona virus? Who's saying that? It's guy on the right. He's got a migraine. How much did light pens know about your involvement in taking not only millions of dollars according to the documentation, but also use subsequently funding the whole unsuspective virology that ended up destroying American, American economy, as well as destroying millions of people, whether it was through the Milo-Pervais making jacks, the DNA mutilation injections that were never approved by the FDA. There was a big switch. It was legally distinct, meaning you were forcing the injections of emergency use authorized products into our military service members that destroyed our readiness. Hammered. Hey, that's what, hey, listen, you ever seen that video where that they're that pedophile that raped and murdered that guy's kid walking through into the courtroom and he's on the pay phone. On the pay phone. The other. He turns around and blows his brains out. That would have been better. Yeah, I mean, but this is pretty good. It's pretty good. Yeah, he got him the number three threats humanity after Stalin and I forget the other names. It's Stalin and Mao. I mean, now listen, so, so, so that's him just getting in the building. He gets in a major retailer green. She opens up. She refuses to even call him a doctor. She says, quote, you're not a doctor. You're Mr. Fauci in my few minutes. She said after referencing the report, throwing the subcommittees into disarray over whether she had violated hearing rules, preventing members from making personal attacks. I thought that was pretty cool. But here's a thing. Right. Now they get this guy on there. And of course, the left is always going to try to protect their own. They have this Congresswoman Mrs. Dingel fitting. Tries to do this like pull on the purse strings. Fauci tries to drop a few fake tears. Here's this clip. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to ask you about it. But I think the American people need to know what we are doing. To those who are serving the common good and public health. I think it's important to make clear the harms that you and your loved ones have suffered because of these deeply irresponsible accusations. Because you know what? You're human, just like the rest of us. So Dr. Fauci, can you please share with us the nature of the threats you have received since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic? Here comes the waterworks. Yes, there have been everything from harassment by emails, texts, letters of myself, my wife, my three daughters. There have been credible death threats leading to the arrests of two individuals. Incredible death threats mean someone who clearly was on their way to kill me. And it's required my having protective services essentially all the time. It is very troublesome to me. It is much more troublesome because they've involved my wife and my three daughters. Waterworks. At these moments, how do you feel? Terrible. Do you continue to receive threats today? Yes, I do. Every time someone gets up and says I responsible for the death of people throughout the world, the death threats go up. Okay, motherfucker, you mean just like how we all got death threats? You mean how you said, oh, we deserve work with this pandemic are them vaccinated? Oh, you mean how I have to have security detail because I talked about this shit when you said that we were killing people and then we were fucking dude, fuck you. You want the receipt, Andy? Do we have them? Of course we got them, guys. Here is all of this is the last combination of about three years here at worth of mainstream media. And the threats that they have made against the American people who decided to exercise their own. You mean you mean all the fucking businesses this dude's closed, all the fucking children that are ruined because of the school closures? Dude, fuck you. You deserve everything you're getting and way more way more. Yeah, check this out. You are the unvaccinated. You are the problem. It is the unvaccinated who are the problem period and of story. The only people that you can blame, the only people you can blame, this isn't shaming, this is the truth. Maybe they should be shamed by the unvaccinated. Just have to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. Anyone you came into contact with will blame you as will the rest of us who have done the right thing by getting vaccinated. Because frankly we know that we can't trust the unvaccinated. I think it's time to get our moral house in order Anderson. It's the unvaccinated who are the threat. All this vaccinated folks are going to start wearing masks to protect the unvaccinated folks. It's called a Christian value. You're basically punishing the vaccinated for the the sins of the unvaccinated. People are not behaving honorably. The unvaccinated are basically saying, well, it's open season for me. I can do whatever I want as well. The unvaccinated are basically beating their breasts running around the country saying, we don't care, we're living free and so forth. We've been patient, but our patient is wearing thin. The unvaccinated, a group that includes children and people acting like children. And the rest of us are starting to get pissed off. The vaccinated feel the unvaccinated are making me upset or angry. This is not about freedom or personal choice. Well, my freedom is being kind of disturbed here. No, screw your freedom. The other day, how would stern way then with a much different approach? Take a look. When are we going to stop putting up with the idiots in this country and just say you now it's mandatory to get vaccinated? They're freedom. You're treading on our freedom and you're making other people sick. And really you're killing other people. The anti-vaxxers, they seem to have a thing for death and home remedies. The anti-maskers turn anti-vaxxers are not just putting their own lives at risk. That was the good issue. We could just say that we can watch them compete to win places show in the Darwin Awards. We have to start doing things for the greater good of society and not for idiots who think that they can do their own research. Don't get me started on the lunatics who won't take any of the COVID vaccines. Life is too short to be an ass. Life is way too short to be ignorant of the promise of something that is helping people worldwide. Maybe you're doing it because you're disconnected or disorganized. Maybe you have some sympathetic psychological reasons. But maybe you're just being anti-social. Oh, you can't shame them. You can't call them stupid. You can't call them silica. Yes, they are. Those who are not vaccinated will end up paying the price. The unvaccinated should be taxed. They should pay more for healthcare. We need to start looking at the choice to remain unvaccinated the same as we look at driving while intoxicated. We're going to see and I've said, oh, listen, two types of America. Dr. Fauci said that if hospitals get any more over-private, they're going to have to make some very tough choices about who gets an ICU bed. And that choice doesn't seem so tough to me. Vaccinated person having a heart attack, yes, come right on in. We'll take care of you. Unvaccinated guy who gobbled horse goo, rest in peace, weezy. Pointing back to the unvaccinated who are really creating a problem in this country, every death that we are seeing from COVID could have been prevented. Literally, the only people die are the unvaccinated. And for those of you spreading misinformation, shame on you, shame on you. I don't know how some of you sleep at night. Well, we sleep good while a lot of you guys are dead. Yeah, it's funny. You know, vaccinated person coming in with a heart attack since arresting. Yeah, it's interesting. Now, I want to point this out real quick, Gandy, because this is important. All right. Where these all of you know, everybody we just saw in that little clip was this all of their own personal feelings, right? Where were they made to say these things? Were they just reading off a teleprompter? I don't know. What's the truth? How about the United States government gave media companies more than a couple hundred of them over a billion dollars in one year to push this propaganda? That's our taxpayer dollars. That means we funded this propaganda machine. That they used our money to pay these people to basically scare us and fear us and to inject in these crazy things. And it wasn't just us that made it wasn't just these media companies that made money off of this stuff, right? Got to vouchy himself. Three quarters of a billion dollars pushing this propaganda. That's how much he made off of this, pushing these lies, spreading these all of this stuff is all out right now. And then more information is coming out more and more. We were not wrong. We were never wrong. We were never wrong. Oxford University just released a study. Myocarditis and periocarditis only appear after COVID vaccination, not after COVID infection. Every single day is getting very, very clear what happened who were the players and who's responsible for this. Anyway, we got on this. It's the same thing that I've been saying for the last three and a half years, four years. This is crimes against humanity. Every single person that was involved with it, every single person that funded it, every single person that organized it, every single person that made the decisions, every single person that went along with it for money. I'm not talking about the people out here, the citizens who were fooled or coerced or forced, but every single person that was involved in organizing this should be tried for crimes against humanity. And in my opinion, executed, that's my opinion. Okay, this was the biggest scam perpetrated in the history of humankind. All right, we have to understand the internet that has not been around that long. We've never had to deal with as humans propaganda the way that we have with the internet involved in it, where you have influencers being paid to say things as if they are facts. You know, if we have influencers that work for your company, your private company, they have to disclose that they're being paid or the FTC will fucking get you. These people didn't do that. They just paid people to say things as if they were fact. And this entire thing, it ruined lives, it ruined families, it ruined futures, it ruined generational businesses. It took trillions of dollars out of the middle class economy of business owners and shifted it to the biggest companies in the world, the people who were friends with these people. It ruined kids. People had to watch their loved ones die on zoom. Anybody who stood up for it went through complete hell for the last four years, ask to be how I know. Okay, I have to have security because fucking people come to my house trying to fuck with me over this for the last four years. They come to my place of business. And now the Fouchie saying, oh, I had two people, bro, I rested 13 mother fuckers last year trying to fuck with me. And more than that, the year before. Okay. So this guy can suck a fucking dick. And he deserves to be gutted on national TV brave heart style for what he did for a sign to everybody else that this kind of shit will never be tolerated again. That's what I think. That's what I have on it. This guy is a fucking super doctor evil criminal at the highest level. And all his cohorts, the world economic forum, the WHO humanity needs to rise up and hold these people accountable. That's what I think. I mean, this could have all been avoided by the way. You're going to tell me that two dumb fucks from Missouri figured this out three and a half years ago. But these guys are just now figuring it out. No, bro, they were all leveraged. They were all pressured. All of the people in Washington, all you Republicans, all you people, you guys are the pussy's. All right. You sat by and let these people do this. In fact, you have a, you have a role of respite. Now, I don't think that those people should be treated the same as the people who actually came up with it. But the fact that none of you guys in Washington, DC actually stood up for this in a real way. You're not at least questioned. Yeah. I mean, what do you have, Rand Paul? Yeah, Rand Paul saying some shit. Everybody else was too scared. Everybody else didn't want to stand out. Bro, including Donald Trump. Donald Trump went along with it. You guys can fucking get mad at me. All you want about that. But he went along with it and shut the country down. Did all this shit. And now, you know, here we are like, bro, that was I like Trump. But that was a cowardly move. Never in the history. Have we done that? No, never. And I'm old enough to know that. Now, we can flip that around and look at and say, okay, well, now we can see all this shit very clearly. But look at the damage it's been done. You know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, sure, you can argue. We don't know what Trump is leveraged on. We don't know if you know what the back. Get that. But this dude, this dude made 700 and his, him and his buddies got paid $710 million. And royalties. The media companies got over a billion dollars from the federal government. The federal government forced Twitter and meta and all the social media brands outside of TikTok to censor anyone saying anything outside the ordinary Joe Rogan, myself, other people were saying Iver Mectin from literally fuck what? May or June of 2020. And we were getting destroyed. They tried to ruin Joe Rogan's life over it. Like bro, they knew that shit worked. They edited a video and put a fucking grayscale over it. They made him look yellow and sick to try to convince him. Bro, like bro, bro, they fucking, they put the front like the America's frontline doctors, that coalition of doctors who was telling that they were like, hey man, the hospitals are empty. Hey, you know what? Iver Mectin hears this. Hydroxychloroquine helps with this. They went to Capitol Hill. You know what they did in those? They arrested them. They took their medical licenses away. They ruined their lives. They ruined their reputation. All the while, the evidence for Iver Mectin being effective was there. And the reason they wouldn't allow people to talk about it is because if they found out that there was an actual cure or an actual therapeutic treatment for it, they couldn't keep the state of emergency, which was the lockdown. Right. The state of emergency was put in place because there was no therapeutic treatment. That's right. We have to use this vaccine. That's the only choice you have. Bro, they use this, they use this whole thing to lock down the country, get the mail-in votes for the election, steal the wealth of the middle class, divide people, like, and now it's blowing up in their fucking faces. And a whole bunch of more shit, dude. But yeah, you know, guess what? I told you so, motherfuckers. All you motherfuckers that came at me and said, you're dangerous. You're this, you're that blah, blah, blah. No, you're dangerous. You're dangerous. And here's another thing I'll say to any of you listening, if you have people around you that screamed at you and called you names and told you that you don't deserve rights, blah, blah, blah. Those people are dangerous. Those people are dangerous to you. They're dangerous to your family because they are easily manipulated and thirst for power and control over you. People were loving going to the grocery store and screaming at people. They were loving going on Twitter and saying, these people don't wear masks, blah, blah, blah. When people would talk about camps in Australia or the camps that were being built in Canada or the FEMA camps that were being built in the state of Washington and the state of New York. People cheered and they said, unvaccinated people belong there. And if you were to take that narrative of that video that we just watched and project it down the line, where do you think they were trying to get you to go? They were going to genocide people that wouldn't take the vaccine. They were going to put them in camps globally and fucking murder them. And your neighbors who fucking went along with it, you better remember who they are because the next time this comes around, they're just as dangerous. Okay. So don't forgive and forget. Keep in mind who those people are. Keep in mind who did that shit. Keep in mind all your quote unquote friends and family who wouldn't allow you to come over for Thanksgiving or Christmas and who screamed at you and who killed the relationship between you. Those people are dangerous. They are dangerous to you. They are dangerous to your family. And if given the chance again, they will do the same thing. Unless they have actually publicly stood up and said, dude, I got played because there's so many people still hanging on to this. We still go out in society and motherfuckers wear masks and shit. They think they're right. You see what I'm saying? These people are dangerous, dude. And you better forget. You better not forget who they are. These are the same people that in fucking 1930s when they were rounding up the Jews. They were saying, there's a Jew. There's a Jew. There's a Jew. And these ironically are the same people who say, oh, never do that. I'd be on the right side of history. No, you prove that you are on the wrong side of history. And you better remember who was and who you know who was because those motherfuckers will turn on you again. And if someone comes along and they want to rally you off to some fucking camp, those people will be all for it again. Well, what's the next lie? Right? Yeah. Right. Now, now if they if they stood up and they said, hey, I was I was wrong. I got played. That's different story. But if they're standing firm in their beliefs, you know, these people who are still saying, oh, the vaccine injuries are that's misinformation. You're such a liar. You're a right wing far right blah, blah, blah. Fuck you. Okay. I'm fucking tired of these people. And I know you guys are too. And we need to stand up and get right in their fucking faces and say, hey, each shit. Yeah. That's real shit. Man, guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think with that being said. Let's go check out some of these comments, bro. We've got a got some interesting ones. Cool. Guys, this first comment comes from at Javiana Johnson. And he's always been jealous of DJ's beard. Well, it is pride month. What the fuck is that? Who did this shit? We all know who did that. But I didn't know, bro. Why would I do that to myself? Because it's pride month. Okay. Yeah. Yep. It gave me a carry cut, man. Yeah. That's fucked up. Yep. That is fucked up. Yeah. Why would you do that? You did this shit? Yep. All right. We got another one here. As as Missums, as Missums, as Missums. This dude is a swollen amygdala with a beard. talking about you. That's how much you know. How you know. But I talk about you. How you know, he's not talking about you. He's a swollen amygdala. Also, I am. I mean, right. The shit that these people come up with. I mean, maybe that's right. That could be right. I do feel a little mad all the time. Like I feel madder than I should all the time. No, you're not a gay to say because they got out of the teeth and no toothbrush. That's what it is. I mean, I can't say anything. It is what it is. Got me. We got another one here. I don't even know how to read this. It's just a generic username, but it probably makes sense with the age of this person. Let's check out this comment here. It says quote, I'm 63 obese and on day 16 of 75 heart. I work out. So doctor approved. I want to do more. But I let myself go for decades. I found quote, the heart of the program on day three. I'm a Navy vet. And I really like what I'm experiencing. Thank you for this program to which at Caleb Fleming, 1607 replied, I'm on day 70. I barely even have to think about it now. You've got this from one veteran to another. You're doing the right thing. Yeah, man. That's awesome. That's fucking cool. Yeah. I love that, dude. I love. I love like. It's never been like to me because I've always struggled with my fitness and physique. My whole life, especially being overweight. It's funny because a lot of people in the fitness industry are very much so like, you got to be fucking ripped and jacked and this and that and broke. It ain't about that, man. It's about where you are and it's about getting better day in and day out. And you know, this is this is how it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be people who recognize they have a big change to make who are taking the steps day by day by day no matter where they started from. And then other people supporting that. And this is what it's all about right here, man. I love this. That's fucking great. Yeah. One last one real quick just to tie this all up at Avery Ackinson 167 says, don't be a Lizzo. Show the show. It'd be hard to be a Lizzo. That's a full-time job. I mean, I would have to fucking eat 24 hours a day. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, we appreciate it. I have endless supply of bananas to sticking girls vaginas. Oh, all right. That's what she did. Oh, you thought that was a. Oh, that was going to be where he was going. That one, though. That's what she did. She made allegedly made girls on her team stick bananas in their vaginas. She did. No, that is a factual statement. I mean, you're the one that's racist, bro, not me. I'm repeating facts. You're the drawing conclusions and parallels between bananas. What? Just sticking to vaginas. Got it. You know, like bananas. I love bananas. Andy. Bro, there's something wrong with you. It is a secret, bro. Listen, you take honey nut Cheerios, guys up some bananas, throw them bitches on top. Little honey. Hey, here, that's good. My mom used to do that with kids. Fire or shit. My mom used to do that for us when we were kids. Fire. I wasn't a shit. Fire. 1000. Yeah. That's a good one. Guys, we appreciate it for being real ass fans. Thank you guys for all the likes, comments, the shares, love. Keep liking. Keep commenting. Make sure you guys hit subscribe on the tube to stay up today with the newest episodes of drop. That being said, let's keep the show moving. Go ahead, line number two. Speaking of criminals, jury selection kicks off and Hunter Biden's federal gun crime trial. This is an interesting stuff. I know we covered this a little bit. You had Biden do that surprise visit to Hayley Biden. Bro, before you get into this, yeah, do you think it? Do you do you not think that's reasonable that these people who did that should be made an example of? I think they need to be made the ultimate example. I mean, bro, prison is not enough. Prison is not enough. I don't want to like listen, the only tax payer dollars I want going to handling these people are to get teens in woodshippers, bro. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. Like dude, you guys let me know what you think because like dude, putting these people in prison, they all they get is slaps on the wrist for anything they did. Well, they only got a couple of years to live anywhere. No, dude, listen, for things like this to not happen, there has to be examples made. People have to know what happens when you do this after World War Two. They had a Nuremberg trials where they fucking hung the media who lied. They hung the people who perpetrated these things. How is this any different than that? It's not. This is actually a whole different realm worse because it was global. It wasn't just contained a one little thing. Right. Right. It's fucking crazy, dude. Anyway. Yeah. Yeah. So, Hunter Biden's gun trial, that starts today. A couple of fast facts. So, Hunter Biden is charged with making a false statement during the purchase of a firearm as well as possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance. Hunter faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if he is convicted on all counts. Jury selection begins and Hunters Delaware trial on Monday. Now, it should be noted. Delaware is their hometown. All right. That's where they're from. That's their state. That's where they're from. So, a lot of money gets pumped into Delaware from Biden's. That's already been pointed out. So, it'll be interesting how this plays out. I know they have already kicked off in the wide deer, which is the jury selection. They already kicked off one person because they said that Trump was falsely prosecuted. I thought that was interesting. But yeah. So, he's faced in 42 years of all, if you include the tax charges as well. It's how many he's looking at max of 17 years, just on the tax stuff and then another 25 on the gun stuff. You got Dr. Jill Biden. She's in the trial in the courtroom with him. Today, Joe, you know, 10% for the big guy. He's not there today. But Joe Biden is there, which is weird because Hunter Biden fucking hates her. Right? Like I mean, we got some text messages that came out. These were exposed. These were all on the laptop as well, where he called her a quote, selfish, silly, entitled, cunt, end quote. He fucking hates her. He also told her quote, go fuck yourself. Punter said in mockery of Dr. Jill Biden's acclaimed teaching prowess quote, I sorted you. He meant supported my GM family, including some of the costs you should have used your salary to lay pay for the last 24 years. Hunter said in the rant to which she then displayed Hunter's artwork in the White House office. So yes, so she's there. Now, super interesting because there's something there's a weird dynamic here that's happening. And out of the White House, you know, they keep talking about, you know, everybody's obviously understanding this is political prosecution. The shit that's going on with Trump, it's undeniable. Why else is obviously saying that it's not even though, you know, they're having campaign, you know, spokesperson events right outside of the Trump's courthouse, right? Like it's not Biden's response when he was asked about it. He fucking laughed. The grin. Yeah. Fucking evil smile. They know it is, bro. Everybody knows it is. They know it is. But do these people in the country have been pacified? Like I said, at the beginning of the show, to rant and wave on social media as opposed to behaving as if social media didn't exist. What would you do if your country was being destroyed by these people and you couldn't just post memes about it? What would you do? That's what needs to be done. Yeah. Yeah. And so you got that stuff going on on the Trump case now mean violence, by the way, I don't clarify that. Yeah. I'm not saying violence. That's not where we're at yet. But like, bro, we need to get involved. Mm-hmm. A lot more than just posting memes. Now, speaking of the Trump case, there has been an update there. Apparently Donald Trump's calling on the Supreme Court to step in. So July 11th is when he's supposed to be getting sentenced. He made a truth statement here saying, quote, the sentencing, quote, unquote, for not having done anything wrong will be conveniently for the fascists four days before the Republican National Convention, a radical left Soros back DA who ran on the platform of quote, I will get Trump in quote, reporting to an, uh, an acting local judge appointed by the Democrats was highly conflicted. We'll make a decision, uh, which will determine the future of our nation. The United States Supreme Court must decide. Um, so that's a move. It's possible. We'll see what happens. Um, but, but here's the weird thing. Did you see that apparently, um, Trump's about to blow the whistle. He says if he gets back into the White House, if he gets a second term, he's born the whistle on the line of 9-11 stuff and the, uh, Epstein files. Did you see that? No. Oh, yeah, bro. He's, uh, he's, uh, he's writing you at first. Well, that should, wasn't out yet. You got, you got, yeah, I think everything wasn't fully out yet. Now as far as 9-11, he probably could have blew the whistle on. I think the biggest thing, bro, is that like, you know, I do believe in, in full transparency. I think we need to know fucking everything. Everything. You know, full D class because do we don't have any trust in anything anymore? 100. Nobody can believe anything these people say. So the only way to regain trust is for full declassification of what they know 100%. You know, I think the only, the only, my only thing, and I, and I do understand it to a certain degree, bro, is that it's like taking somebody who's never seen outside, who's never seen the light, like the sunlight, bro. And then just fucking full, full blown by it. Yeah. Well, it's going to be like, bro, I think, I mean, you talk about mass chaos. You don't think most people know this shit by now? I mean, they, most people know that JFK was assassinated by people within our own country. You don't think that people know that 9-11 was fucking, I think it's one thing to think. And then it's another thing to 100% without about, know it. I mean, you don't think that Epstein was some sort of intelligence operation to blackmail the most powerful people on earth to spread. What do you think they get people to do those narratives? They don't just pay them. It's called the stick and the carrot. They pay them. And then if they won't take the money, they threaten them. Yeah. Yeah. So his trumps, his trumps on what he's, what he's promising for a second term. Would you declassify the 9-11 files? Yeah. Would you declassify JFK files? Yeah. I did, I did a lot of it. Would you declassify the Epstein files? Yeah. Yeah. I would. Attorney General. Yeah. I mean, it seems very, very simple to him. Yeah. Anything. Why didn't you? Why didn't you? Why didn't you? That's my problem. Why didn't you? Well, you ain't knowing. Yeah. What was the hold up? What do you think is going to happen in the Hunter Biden ship? Nothing. What do you think he did? I wonder is it like. Biden can pardon him, right? I mean, Look, wouldn't that be a direct conflict? What do you mean when you say what do you think is going to happen? Normally, I would say that these people like, dude, if we had a real justice system, these people like Fauci, all the people I mean, Claus Schwab, the real economic forum, the WHO, with Tedros, all these people across the nation's, There's only like a thousand, two thousand people that created that whole thing those if we had justice system And we had people across the globe that actually had a big old nut sack like we used to these people would already be hung So when you say what what do I think is gonna happen to them? I don't think anything's gonna happen to them because the people who Representing us supposedly in our government don't do anything they go on there They say some harsh words. They write a harsh letter. They say some statement. They don't actually do anything The thing just keeps going and going and going and that's where Americans get frustrated. There's no accountability. There should be zero zero privilege or immunity for these people for what they've done and Doons above the law no and all these people in the Republican Party who act like they actually care Dude, they don't because they say they do and they say these things like we saw this statement today by Marjorie Taylor Green Yeah, sounds good. What the fuck are you gonna do? You know, you tell Fauci he committed crimes against humanity Rand Paul said the same thing so to do for Texas. What's the dude from Texas name? The governor no fucking you know, whatever it doesn't matter multiple people have gone on And said these things over and over and over again, but you had nothing happens and the reason nothing happens is because all these people are on the same team They're all in on the same bullshit. They're all in on the same insider trading. They all make money They're all that none of them will tell on each other or prosecute each other unless it's Donald Trump because Donald Trump is the only guy who's not part of their little game Hopefully, okay, because that's where I get my little doubts from right? It's like dude Why didn't you do any of this stuff already? Why do you not direct the American people and what to do? Why don't you tell us what we should be doing? Why when you have a hundred thousand people in front of the entire country on every T.C. TV station? Don't you tell the American the America people are waiting for instructions? They're waiting for someone to say this is what we're doing do this. He hasn't done that so You know what I'm saying like that if you're a real leader bro, why aren't you doing that? Why aren't you directing America people like I've offered more leadership on this show to solutions than he has I Say what people need to be doing they need to be getting activated They need to be living a life personal excellence They need to be changing the culture. They need to not be a fat fuck. They need to fucking be healthy They need to put intelligent things in their brain They need to be personally excellent because everything these people want is a subservient slave class And the only reason the only way they can get that is if we're poor unhealthy sick taking all the drugs Eating all their food consuming all their data making them rich and we should be the antipysis to that that is big solution in the culture That's a long-term solution the other short-term solutions to get engaged in your local politics Get engaged your local school boards. Where's Trump saying any of that? It's fair. It's very very fair. Okay, so that's my that's my gripe All right, you have these guys going on there and and this is not dislike Trump This is it we should be able to be critical of people. You should be that's my criticism of him Yeah, you know, and for you those of you who say oh you guys just Your worship Trump. No not at all just because you fucking think someone is a better option than someone else Doesn't mean you worship them. Okay, you're presented with a pile of shit or you're presented with a cheese sandwich You're gonna choose this cheese sandwich now it ain't a filet miny-on, but You know what I'm saying? I like cheese. Yeah, like I'm definitely not eating the shit You know saying like so you know that that's what we got to look at and there's a lot of things that I love about Trump and there's a lot of things that give me question marks and That doesn't mean I'm not gonna vote for him. It doesn't mean I'm gonna be like one of these dumb fucks who's like ooh Don't vote. What are you? What's wrong with your brain? Right, I'm gonna write in them. Okay, you you can say this and it sounds real nice Oh, when you vote you're giving them the power and you're you're inadvertently Subservient to them know this shit bro There's a reality out here And here's the reality if Biden stays in power you are going to suffer your life is going to suffer your incomes going to suffer You might get put in some sort of camp who knows who knows what these people are gonna do Okay, now you can live in this dream world and say I'm not gonna vote because I'm not gonna participate in this tyranny All right, so what if they cheat again and your vote would have been for Trump and and that evidence would have created a scale at which they couldn't cheat Over you see what I'm saying. All right, you gave him enough to fudge dude That's the thing we there has to be such a landslide of votes that they can't cheat over it And then you let him get in office and he improves a couple things and then we figure out where to go from there that is a reasonable person's Thought process. Yeah, 100% man like dude you understand what I'm saying you have to fucking have evidence that they're doing the things they're doing to hold them accountable Right not voting actually feeds them on the other side. Yeah Even if you don't believe in the vote even if you don't believe in the way that the system set up the only way you could change By stopping the bleeding right now. Mm-hmm. You see what I'm saying 100% bro. I can say this dude The way that things are going If they cheat again, bro, I think there's gonna be big problems I think people will rise up because the evidence of how much more momentum is with Trump than with Biden They can say the poll stuff every day on TV they could say oh he's leading by 10 points bullshit Trump has 200 fucking thousand people showing up at his rallies. This dude has seven Okay, Trump drives down the road and everywhere he goes there's people 50 people deep along the streets This dude walks down the street with a fucking ice cream cone people yell at him say fuck you Okay, so Don't give me that shit the dude didn't get 81 million votes It was a fucking coup. That's what happened They lied they cheated and now they've used the last four years to destroy this country and our way of life And if they get another four years and they cheat again Which they won't because I think if they try to do it this time they will end up in the fucking gallows now by the Justice system but by the citizens Yeah, it's real shit man Well guys, let's give him to our third and final headline head on number three Player who hit Caitlin Clark responds to calls for an enforcer Now this is you know, it's a very interesting situation, but we got some really good shit happening here Which I think is important to bring up because you know Racism does exist right not in the way that people talk about it But yeah racism can absolutely exist and it's important when people call that shit out for what it is and that's exactly what's happened in here So let's check into this as the hits on Caitlin Clark keep piling up one of the most frequently proposed solutions is that the Indiana fever needs to get Themselves and enforcer to protect Clark calls for the acquisition of a player who may Whose main role is to dish out punishment grew this weekend after the Chicago skies Shinniti Carter sent Clark crashing to the floor and they completely unprovoked attacked did you see this video? No, oh watch this shit They breathed doubled off the corner her jumper is good Kennedy Carter now which no points off the bench And Fran Clark Play was well over yeah, I mean that's clearly what's was called the question is will they call it? As you call her bitch she said yo bitch Yeah, um in fact None other than frequently penalized warriors for drema green himself weighed in on the topic And they commented originally posted on the Instagram green said quote Indiana better go invest in an enforcer fast to which Chinniti I'm pretty sure I'm pronouncing that right chinniti spells like yeah, she's piece of shit. Yeah, Kennedy Chinniti whatever She she made a tweet saying we grown as fuck and y'all talking about enforcer man get the fuck out of here hoop or shut up Now I want to ask you this because you know you play sports. I play sports right like you know The the fresh meat as they're called on the field or whatever it is right like there There is an adjustment there for sure right low guy on the totem pole. There is a part of that in sports for sure Right now. I don't know what you were taught. I was always taught between whistles. That's what I was taught right I don't know if there's an argument to be made that this is just an adjustment of a new player. She's new to the WNBA I don't know Or is this something more sinister Caitlin's been you know nobody like they've all been hating her because of how she was drafted A contract she makes but she's a damn good fucking player and she's getting zero recognition Because of that And what what what she got on that? Well, I mean is this is this happening all the time? I mean we're you just got in the start Yeah, but look dude. I mean That's a dirty play. Yeah, that's all I see it for I see it as dirty play, you know um I think them when you want to bring up racism the more racist thing I think that's a dirty play I don't think that's racism okay, go go Steven A Smith Doesn't agree things it was absolutely racist a component there he did yeah, he's even a smith did yeah He said chinny's fucked up and it's wrong Well, I don't know. I don't know what she says or who she is or who she stands for was WNBA here We see this play happening sports all the time this happens in hockey this happens in football this happens in baseball sure, yes, so to say that's racist I Mean who fucking knows what was the conversation, but I'll tell you what I do think is racist is when the announcers Start talking about how she has white privilege in the WNBA right because she's not She's not a lesbian and she is white right that that's the racism, okay? I'm tired of hearing sexism listen. I'm tired of hearing that shit everybody's tired of it Okay, white people you do not have to feel guilty for being fucking white if people come at you and say Hey, you fucking white tell them to fucking eat shit Okay, I'm fucking tired of it all white people are tired of it There's a complete anti-white bias in the media and it's been going on for way too long And there's no reason that anybody should apologize for something that they were born as all right So the racism comes from these announcers who are beating the shit to death you go out The real world nobody gets a fuck about any of this nobody gets a fuck about white people or black people or any of this shit This is all made up narrative shit for television and ratings and people that think they're in the fucking civil rights area Which has already been solved 50 fucking years ago. Well, that's the question, bro Why don't they want you to care about this shit so much It's ridiculous is is is is to distract you from all the other actual shit that's happening right now in this country. Well, look dude Listen I listen and I'm I'm fucking tired of hearing it. I'm tired of hearing white people are bad I'm tired of hearing white people this white people that fuck white people Just about white blah blah blah blah blah fuck you okay. How about that? That's racism I'm sick of hearing it I don't give a fuck if you're black and you're criticizing white people for being white or your white and you're criticizing black people for being black or you're whatever if you judge someone by the color of their skin the pigment of their skin You are a world-class Piece of fucking shit. That's my stance on all of it and white people in general need to quit Apologizing for being fucking white You guys are acting like a bunch of bitches. Okay. It's not a it's not a bad thing to say to say hey fuck you stand up for yourself. Yeah 100% it's not right who it doesn't matter who it comes from whatever direction is going to be right Oh, you could be right you're calling us my fucker my parents were my grandpa Immigrants they weren't even here for fucking slavery. I wouldn't if you want a fucking really get into it My ancestors were fucking slaves of black people in Sicily right Fuck I'm sick of hearing it. No sick of hearing it. I think I think I think he is too much Steven A Smith's been changing his tune a lot. Yeah, you know why cuz he sound he's listen. I'd be real Steven A Smith is a big fucking propagator of the division. It's happening now And he's done it for a decade and now he's starting to fucking realize that he fucked up Which I can respect but I'm not gonna sit here and pretend like Steven A Smith hasn't caused a lot of this. Yeah, especially in sports He's been Steven A Smith has been this you know Anti-white Everything's racist for 10 15 20 years. Yep. Okay, so now he's starting to get it and I can respect that but You know, you should have got a long time ago. It's not okay for anyone to discriminate Against anyone for the color of their fucking skin dude Like you think of the These like think how fucking stupid you have to be to look at someone and think That person's black or that person's white and then think less of them and then to openly say it like they talk about Caitlin Clark like these these black women and you've seen these these reports right Like where these whip these black women are like yeah, you know, she's a great player, but blah blah blah blah blah blah blah She has privilege cuz she's white. Oh, so cuz she's white What she's better a basketball? I'm pretty sure most of the motherfuckers in basketball are black Let's talk about diversity Okay, are we gonna fucking are you guys gonna start putting white people on NBA teams? Where's the talk about that? Oh, no, nope, you know why there's no talk about that cuz white people don't give fuck about that They know white people are actually the least racist motherfucking people on the planet because they have never been allowed To base their identity and race if I was to say I'm proud for being white my entire life It would be considered racist But if you were to say I'm proud to be black it's celebrated right if an Asian says I'm proud to be Asian is celebrated If a gay person says I'm proud to be gay it's celebrated So why can white people not say I'm proud to be white? I don't want to say that by the way don't give a fuck But the point is there's a double standard there and because that double standard exists white people don't have the Thoughts of their own race the same way that everybody else does because they've been taught that it's not okay to feel that way All right So when we look at the whole that real shit man Yeah, so when we look at the whole dynamic of what's going on here you have one race of people who are bullied and Told their racists who are actually people who never say a fucking thing right racist about anyone because the minute they fucking Bro most white people won't even say black person right like if they say oh man this guy came up and fucking shot at me They'll say what do you look like? I don't know. He's like 510 all right Well, what else do you look like he was 30 What else do you look like look like a nice man he was wearing Nike's What else do you look like and the fact that he was black will be the last thing they say because they're afraid to be called racist Okay, so like dude we have to get past this when I'm making this shit up. That's a real headline to recover that on the show Yeah, no, it happens all the time all the time, but but dude it's It's absurd and white people aren't calling for integration in the NBA because we realized that fucking the NBA is more exciting with The guys who are playing it pretty good. Hey, man. I don't really give a fuck if they're white or they're black I want to watch some good fucking basketball Remember two years ago when they started saying they're gonna have to make hockey more diverse right like I don't care man. I don't give a fuck how many black dudes are on a hockey team bro I just want to see some fucking good hockey Same with baseball. You don't hear any white people saying there needs to be more white people in baseball Most fucking baseball players are black or Dominican I mean nobody's saying that nobody's saying that about the NFL But we have to have diversity of the workforce. Otherwise, we're racist. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, like bro You want to if you want to break down DEI and make it as Expose it for the bullshit that it is how come they never talk about it in pro sports? How come they never talk about it in college sports? Because people want to watch and they understand meritocracy They understand the best play they understand the best win they understand Competition and every mother fucking human understands it and they don't want that shit in their sports And so all of those people that say you got to have it in all these other places are full of shit They're all a bunch of fucking liars 100% man guys jumping on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments Let us know. No nobody should be judging anybody for the color of their fucking skin period That is period period poo I'm fucking over it dude. I did it bro. I did it because dude. This you know what's gonna happen dude You know like how white nationalism legitimately fucking that's right. They are trying to agree. That's right That's right 100% and that's what people got to understand This I get because I'm seeing a lot more like aggressive pro white shit on the internet And like people talking shit on people like me to say hey, there should be no racism Like dude, we should be able to be proud of who we are and what we've contributed society without being called racist every race should be able to say that Okay, but at the end of the day, we should also know that that doesn't make us better than someone else And that doesn't make us yet or worse. That's right I'm just over it dude like anybody who fucking does that shit you can fuck right off to me 100% I think it's the lowest common denominator of intelligence I think you're the dumbest motherfucker on the planet But I also believe that we should be telling the truth about what people did what right for the last fucking 15 years We've had to hear about how you know Why people didn't do any of the shit they say they did oh you mean why people didn't like legit build Europe They didn't create all these things. You know you're gonna say and now we're having shit taken away from us You know It's lies. It's not even true. Stupid shit Black people built the pyramid. You know that right Well, apparently they built everything Everything it's just so it's irritating. Yeah, my people everything but a credit score. It's irritating and by the way By the way black people represent the the smallest amount the small the smallest amount of slavery in the history of human earth More people of other races have been enslaved than black people than any other fucking there's more slaves alive today And there are Well white people went and stole black. No, they were sold by other black people half the fucking slave owners in the south were black Like dude, I'm just tired of getting the finger point here's the here's a bottom line And I want to say this too 99.9% of people in the real world don't give shit. They don't give a fuck. They're cool people That's the bottom line, but I'm so tired of hearing about it from these fucking crazy people I think everybody is I think that's why we're Jesus dude. What the fuck was that? What the fuck was that? Is that a fucking tornado? I'm sorry. I actually hurt broke because I almost shit myself at the same time damn That was about to be bad.

I'm just fucking tired of hearing it And I think everybody is and I think that's why we're seeing such a black Exodus from these Democrats, bro. Mm-hmm everybody's tired of artificial division and we have to remain We have to start telling the truth. We have to stop asking is it offensive and start asking is it true? And we have to start being honest about things because dude these people are insane and once black people and white people truly figure out that we're on the same page Oh, they're fucked those government fucks look at us like where cockroaches all of us they're fucked Everything they do is to get black people and white people to not get along because when that dynamic collides and unifies those people are fucked That's why this racism shit is neat and needs to be solved and like dude Just as I would stand up against somebody who was white and was racist towards black people black people should be standing up against this anti-white shit, dude To a ship man.

Uh, so she made a uh, so she made another one she made uh, she she's been on it Um, and she's you know, I'll be getting a little bit more heat here recently also um because she made a post um Where she's basically told everybody to stop being a weak and gay Is the clip It's a lot teedly as she's she's supposed all social media She's been watching too many goggles videos In America man, you can't be anything you want. So don't be weak in gay That's great, you know I saw some I saw Becky posted this real this morning. Did you see that real? She posted today No, we throw it up. Yeah, throw it up here. It's it's good. All right. This clip right here And And your children will join us The children the children the children. Why are you so obsessed with the children? I know you know We all know that this ain't wholesome family fun here You can be a drag queen without the approval or validation of children Why do you need that? Why does the rainbow community fight so hard for the approval of it access to children? The number one reason why people are starting to revolts against the gay community is because of this right here Because of your incessant demands for access to people's children. It's not that hard to just leave the children alone They don't want to leave the children alone Check that man's hard drive. Why do they want the children? Check that why do they constantly talk about the children And if you are gay, you should probably stand up and say this is bullshit Just like Becky is saying because Becky is gay and she doesn't want people to revolt against the gay community I don't understand what it is about gay people that allow these fucking men who are dressed up as women to Infiltrate their movement and then force their cells onto other people's children Bro, it's dangerous people are gonna start getting fucking killed real talk And so if you are gay and you are celebrating quote unquote pride month one of the four thousand fucking days that you get in a year okay Please differentiate your beliefs from these fucking people's beliefs because there's going to come a time where these people are gonna be dealt with One thousand percent man guys do tell us what you guys think Um, let us know down in the comments Thumbs up here people are yeah thumbs up people are sick of that dude.

No, and it's not gonna be punished either people are Dude, this is what happened that's right. This has happened over and over again in history Gay people have started to get gay rights pedophiles join them and it caused this big huge issue against the entire gay community. This has happened over and over and over again You guys got what you wanted people didn't give a fuck five six years ago In fact Fuck most people didn't give a fuck about the rainbow flag or nothing. They were like oh, get cool man Now it's like fuck another fucking rainbow. Yeah fuck they keep at it in colors. Well, I don't even know that it was that many colors existed I do this danger these people dude like I said before on the show you never see women dressed as men You never see women who are quote unquote trans men Wanting to shake their shit in front of little kids. It's always middle-aged men Dressed as women that are demanding access to your fucking children. Why is that the answer is obvious It is a pedophile problem and it needs to be called what it is Stop pretending these people are part of your movement. They're not No Real shit man. Yeah Guys don't be a hoe
