not much yeah it's over to you little screaming freedom over there yeah I popped this cherry blast and I had a blast that's not cherry blast I mean I citrus blast and I've been blasted I got blasted yeah is that joke I'm gonna work yeah okay yeah alright well let's get into it let's knock these out man that makes it people better I like the Q&A episodes man they're always they're always good always making people better did you spend a lot of time alone you were a kid I'm just saying like you you tell jokes then you laugh you do both parts like you only do both parts if you like spend a lot of time alone right you're getting to a little touchy subject I'm just saying I mean you know I think I think we're supposed to do one part or the other part not both okay yeah so either tell the joke and other people laugh right or just listen to jokes then I'm like that's right got it all right well let's go on with the show guys Andy man the question number one let's knock these out hey Andy I am a beginning a long horn rancher in Missouri and I'm still trying to figure out a lot of stuff I get the cake analogy and take time but when do you tweak to fit you I guess he's referring to the recipe itself for example I cannot do things that people in Texas or New York do so when do you know to start tweaking things here and there to make it fit well look I mean you have to decide what your competitive advantages are going to be and sometimes things that you can't do can turn into competitive advantages maybe you can't process the same amount of meat that they can do in Texas but maybe you can grow better cattle right what is it that you quote unquote can't do that can be turned into an asset of your brand equity into the perception that people have your brand you know in a positive way so we just have to look at things from multiple perspectives and a lot of times when people say I can't do this I can't do that this won't work for us those are actually opportunities into skies to differentiate yourself from the bigger guy right you know if you can't put out a million chickens maybe you could put out you know a thousand chickens but they're all past your days right like that's where all this shit comes from all these little competitive advantages and these marketing tweaks they actually come from companies inability to do things other ways that they have now figured out how to market the proper way so what is it about your operation that makes you unique and not knowing much about what you do just off what you told me I would think about the angle of hey we're small American farmers trying to produce the best beef that we possibly can or the best long horns that we possibly can this is why we do it this way that we're not some big mega corporation we're a small time operations run by family like you have to lean into the things that you are and figure out how to tell that story so that you know it makes sense so the answer is you know once you're set up and once you know how to operate the exos of the business you have to figure out you know what is it about you that makes you different that will resonate with the customer and that takes some creative thinking I don't know the answer to that because I'm not familiar with your business directly yeah for sure I mean I mean think about it with you or I got two questions on this man like is it true the things in business like they're cycles they're almost like trends in society right like we're like back in the day everybody were champion the like now everybody's wearing champion again are the things in business that kind of like come and go but they're always still the same and I accept because you know when you started as to to retail store there's there was the other big wig companies out there right and like you just decided to do things that they were no longer doing right to bring a new trend back now you know here we are 25 years later I feel like that same trend is starting to come back of like focusing on the people first yeah that in person interaction something what what is the truth with cycles in business like that I mean when you're a small guy you got to look at what the big guy should be doing that they're not doing and you got to fill that hole you know what I'm saying like there's things that bigger companies can't do you know most companies don't you know they they leave on the table things that are obvious because they're they take effort to do right they're not building great relationships with their end customer they're not doing things that would keep their customers loyal they're not they're basically selling them a product and then saying well I hope you come back again sometime and so there's a lot of things that these big companies don't do that as a small company you can do to make people feel value to make people feel a part of your brand and to make people loyal to your brand and if you're a small entrepreneur those are the things you have to do to be competitive so you have to look what do I wish the big guys would do for me and then you need to take those things and do them for your customers so a great way to do this would be to analyze your competition see what they're doing see what it's like to buy from them and then the parts that you don't like you make 10 times better with your company so that's that's how we have to look at it yeah I love that man but what is the big what's what's the name of the biggest ranch the the beef ranch in that in Texas king ranch is it king ranch I thought it was like three sixes or three three or something like that I don't know I think that's from a yellow stone oh triple or four sixes or something like that yeah I think it's a real range is a real ranch yeah yeah all right I like it man guys any question number two Andy you recently said that anyone in leadership who can replicate themselves and teach others what they know can write their own checks usually those people in leadership are also very driven and ambitious can you teach that can you ignite that fire or is it something that people either have or don't have how do you look at ambition I think you can encourage people to have ambition I think you can show them that they have potential I think you can paint the picture for them but ultimately it's up to them to have it and you know sometimes people have it sometimes people don't have it I personally would not hire anyone that didn't have it on their own right and this is the purpose of asking what their goals are what their dreams are what they're trying to accomplish what their long-term endgame looks like because you want to figure out how big that person's dreams are and if they come in and they paint some picture of some you know average existence I would stay away from those kind of people because they're going to be complacent the fastest so it's about looking for people that have the natural propensity to have ambition to have drive to have the will to win on their own and then you know cultivating that and helping that develop over the course of time you know you could sit 10 people in a room and give them all the same information you can give them all the same lessons you can give them all the same you know quote unquote how to skills and they're all going to produce different levels of results that are based around their own personal drive their own ambition their own goals their own wants their own you know dreams of their life and you know that's something that unfortunately people tend to have or not have to a varying degree right some people are very ambitious some people are moderate some people are low ambition and the best thing that you can do is to keep away from the low ambition people and try to fill your team with high ambition people that are that way naturally if you if you think you're going to convince low ambition people to be high ambition people you're going to waste most of your time and you're going to be incredibly frustrated so you have to look in their background for things that show that they have ambition have they built anything before they tried anything before have they been on teams before how do they perform on those teams right all of these things give you insight to the kind of person that you're actually bringing on the team so you have to ask questions they have to be relevant questions and you have to look for that natural driving ambition because yeah you can show it to people you can you know speak until you're blue in the face about the potential that someone has but for them to get off the bench and go chase it that's a totally different thing so I don't think you can force someone or or really teach someone to have that's that hunger they either have it or they don't and usually when people don't have it it's because they haven't had it hard enough in life they haven't had a real difficult situation in life they never actually had to be on their own or be be someone who's taking care of you know their family or have real pressure on their shoulders and those people have driving ambition because they understand the reality of life but I think unfortunately we have a lot of people in this country who have had it too good too easy for too long and for that reason they lack the ambition in the drive because all they've ever been exposed to is the comfort and so when we think about like you know who the most successful people in the world it goes back to what I said on Monday's real talk the most successful people on the world are usually people that have incredibly difficult fucking backgrounds and and the reason that they are ambitious and they are have high drive is because they had that that window of negativity that could have lasted in their childhood it could have been in high school it could have been when they were young adult when they had to really perform and step up and be reliable to themselves which has caused them to realize that nobody's coming nobody's gonna save them mom and dad aren't paying for your shit you know daddy Trump's not paying for your shit nobody's taking care of you bro you know what I'm saying and once you realize that because you look around and there ain't anybody around to handle your shit you know the hunger and the drive and all that sort of comes naturally and so what we see is you know people who typically have everything handed to them they don't have much drive and this is funny because a lot of people in business will complain about you know the Steve down the street he had rich parents yeah so what dude that's gonna hurt him that helps you it helps you that you didn't have that opportunity it helps you that you didn't have the soft upbringing it helps you that you had to struggle it helps you that your parents didn't pay for shit for you because you understand how to be hungry when that person who had everything handed to them can never possibly understand that because they never went through it so when we look at the things that go on in our lives and we decide how to make them work for us one of the things that works the most for us is us understanding that you know we had it hard before and we understand what that's like which automatically makes us ambitious hungry and driven to avoid that place of discomfort again right if you've never been uncomfortable how do you know to avoid or what it's worth to avoid the place of discomfort you can you see what I'm saying yeah yeah let me actually do something did you've met thousands of people right you you've met people you know way up there on the line or you've met people that are just starting to climb right have you ever and obviously we don't have to say names but have you ever met anybody that you know they had all this ambition like they had it like they were they were fucking killers and then it just goes away yeah for sure what what comfort like yeah like look dude there's different levels of entrepreneurs there's people who you know they want to open franchises because they're a little bit scared of running their own business so they got to have you know some direction then there's entrepreneurs who work to earn enough money and once they get comfortable they stop working and usually that leads them getting back to the place where they start in the first place because they don't realize how long their life actually is and they haven't made nearly enough money to live the quality of life that they want so those people tend to make a lot of money go back to where they were make some more money go back to where they were and then the people who are the people who stay wealthy who stay winning who stay on track those are people who they're not even doing it for the money they're doing it for the fucking win like these are the real driven championship caliber people like they're they're not showing Elon Musk and showing up to make money you don't give a fuck you change in the world okay like I don't show up here to make money I don't even take a fucking paycheck from this company you know what I'm saying I'm here to fucking build something cool real consistent long-term winners are not playing the game for money they're playing the game for impact they're playing the game for purpose they're playing the game for creating something that hasn't been created before and because those people play that game for that reason money's never an issue for them so they don't go back and forth they just continue to build and build and build and build and build and build you know but yeah that's pretty much the three classes of how it works no I love it man guys any question about three Andy what are some general guidelines on forgiveness and giving people second chances how does Andy do it and what have you learned from it man that's a deep question yeah you know you know I don't know that I have this part figured out if I'm being honest because I tend to give people chances that end up showing me later that they never deserve a chance to start with you know that I can't tell you how many people out there that I've helped or that I've stood behind or that I've done extra things for that end up fucking me over and acting like I never did shit for them I mean bro it's a lot of people there's a lot of people that go on the internet and pretend like I never did shit and I never helped them and I never fucking was there for them that I've literally been there for in their worst fucking moments and so I get taken advantage of because my heart's very big for people but I don't think I would change it because I think the net positive meaning the good people that I am surrounded by on a daily basis where I get to come in you know to this building and build and create and do things with people that are cool and good people and creative people and high skill people that actually care I think that's the trade I think the trade is that when you have a good heart and you forgive people and you're willing to work with people because you believe in people yeah you're gonna get fucked over by people for sure it's gonna be part of the process but do karma usually handles those people and the end result is that you're surrounded by the highest quality people all the time anyway right so I don't think it's I think it's the juices work the squeeze so to speak and it's just the collateral damage that you deal with from being a forgiving person but in terms of like where the line is you know typically how I think about it is is this to this person you know do something wrong because they thought it was the right thing to do that matters right like was this just an honest mistake yeah what were they trying to do something good just didn't work out was it a moral issue or a character issue you know if so you know that's something that I really don't try to forgive right like if it's something that's outside the line of cultural values that I agree with like let's say stealing or doing something like that you know I don't forgive those things but if it's something with good intent and that's truly what it is you know I try to try to look past those things and look at those things as an investment in their education so I think you know every scenario when it comes to forgiveness is independent and I think there's a fine line between looking the other way or giving someone a pass and letting people walk all over you and and and sometimes you're gonna feel like you're airing too far on one side or the other but I think at the end of the day you know you don't want to be polarized in that position because if you're polarized like I don't forgive people or I forgive everybody the result is going to be bad either way that's bad karma on each side yeah right so like you've got to just walk that line the way that you think is best and it's a case by case scenario I also think about things like how many deposits has this person made and good will versus how many withdrawals have they made you know like if you're work with someone for 15 years and then they make one bad withdrawal against all the good positives they put in is it really fair to fucking crush their whole life because of that you know because as the owner as the CEO you have the ability to do that you have the ability to fucking take and give and you know I think that's a responsibility that comes with it should come with a lot of consideration for that person situation and thought and I think you know when you really care about someone those can be hard hard decisions to make because sometimes the right decision is to move them off the team because they're holding the rest of the people back right like you got someone who you like who's a good person who's just incompetent can't do the job well okay that's cool but like now you're hurting everybody else by being here so that's another that's another way you have to look at it so there's all these different ways that have to be weighed out from an individual standpoint when you're making decisions about you know who to give a pass to who not to give a pass to but ultimately I think most of the time it comes down to how many deposits have they made versus how many withdrawals have they made how many good things have they done versus how many bad things have they done what was the nature of the thing that they did was in an honest mistake or was it bad intent right where they trying to be malicious if so you know it may not matter how many deposits that person made so there's just all kinds of things and I don't think there's a set answer it says this is when you forgive right or this is when you give a pass and this is when you don't I you have to evaluate all those and you have to look outside of you just simply liking the person you know and we have to redefine what liking even means like when we're in a business context and that person that you like a lot is coming into the office and making your life super fucking hard are they showing that they care about you or like you you see what I'm saying right right so so like just because you could say oh we're friends and we can joke around we can tell jokes if you're making my life harder bro you don't love me the way you say you do right you see what I'm saying so we got to we got to we got to be like that too and and look at actions not just words so I ultimately I think you know um this is a nuanced skill set that you derive over the course of time I don't think that you ever truly have a solid set and stone rule um and I think you evaluate these situations as they come one at a time and you make the best decisions that you can and and over the course of time you become much better at making those decisions um but they never get easy that's never any it's always a stressful thing because as the the operator of the company if you if you're not a shit bag you realize that they they have you know what if they have a family what if they have kids what if it those are things that people don't realize that true entrepreneurs that give a fuck about their company think about like bro I come in here dude and I got the backs of everybody's fucking job and everybody's family and all their fucking kids I got all of my back bro every single fucking day that's real shit and I take that real serious that's why I come here every day that's why I don't you don't see me in fucking Florida on a fucking boat or whatever right like I'm here every day because I care about what the fuck we're doing I care about the people we have I care about their families and yeah we're a high performing team yeah I'm gonna ask a lot of you but there's also a lot of opportunity as well yeah for sure so I think one thing too that I I love uh your outlook on is because I feel like you know it's a lot of times is just people's expectations are kind of skewed and I want you to touch on this a little bit because it's like I feel like a lot of people have this like fear or like unrealistic expectation that either nobody supposed to like fuck them over or like you know do anything like like doing thing bad or they have the opposite fear of like you know of doing anything because of that fear does that make sense it's like how do we get rid of this like this expectation that like nobody's gonna fuck you over well I mean that's your that's your ego you're if you think that everybody's just gonna operate and play nice with you and and do good because you know because you're you that's just you overvaluing yourself people and you know in nature people do things that aren't even about you they'll do things that are about them which is usually where the the quote unquote fucked over part comes from usually people don't fuck people over because they hate the other person it's because they're doing something selfish that serves them and not the other person in an environment where we're supposed to be serving the team and so you know when we think about what this actually means what it actually means is is that you know we have to lower our own perception of ourselves to make ourselves realize that like bro like you know these are normal things that happened to every single person they're gonna happen to you they're gonna happen to me they're gonna happen to everybody and we have to chuck them up to the cost of doing business and if we do business long enough you're gonna have people do wrong by you if you are in business long enough you're gonna have family not believing you you're gonna have friends laugh at you you're gonna fall on your face and be embarrassed you're gonna make mistakes that cost a lot of money you're gonna lose friends you're gonna lose partners you're gonna lose boyfriends you're gonna lose girlfriends you're gonna lose the belief of people when you fall down like these are all things that happen as a normal part of the journey to success especially in entrepreneurship and business and to think that you're gonna get there without that shit is is is fucking delusional it's delusional thinking and I don't know what you know a lot of people won't even go down the path because they're afraid of that stuff happening when that stuff is going to happen like you can't avoid you cannot avoid looking stupid you cannot avoid being laughed at you cannot avoid making mistakes you cannot avoid your family making fun of you you cannot avoid your friends deciding that you're a loser because you work all the time and won't go out and fucking party with them you can't you know avoid your girlfriend saying that you're a loser because you're not making any money right like you these are things that happen that's a normal part of business that's why you have to build yourself into someone who is resilient enough and mentally tough enough and has the fortitude and the grit and the belief and all of the things required to push through these difficult times that most people aren't even willing to go through there is nobody that you look up to that became that person without a tremendous amount of hardship there's nobody that you look up to that became a successful you know inspiration to you without going through a lot of pain when you think of the stories and the people that inspire you the reason they inspire you is because what they went through to get where they are not because of just where they are all right and that's you too you have the ability to make an incredible success story but you're not making it because you're afraid of all these things that are going to happen no matter what happening and that's making you freeze up and bro there's all these people that have all this potential to be successful to contribute to create to build that we don't even know what they were supposed to do on this earth because they were too afraid to go think of all the amazing ideas think of all the the cures to disease think of all the inventions think of all the entertainment think of all the the music and all of the art and all of the things that would have been created if the people were just courageous enough to go down the path and they never did we've lost more amazing things than we have available to us because of that fear over the course of human history you see what I'm saying so we have to really understand that like wrote these people that you think are great aren't great because they're great they're great because they went and you're not great because you won't go and dude the things that you have to go through those are all character building things these are things that make us like every hardship that I have had to go through everything that I've had to deal with getting stabbed in the face being broke multiple times getting laughed at getting made fun of being told no a million times being told I'm never going to be able to do that having nobody believe all these fucking things bro I'm glad they happened to me because they made me who the fuck I am now and you guys listen to the show and you think I got some sort of superpower I'm super power bro I just show the fuck up every day and I don't let shit stop me and that's that and if you do the same you're going to become an inspiration the people around you at whatever level you want to take it to I'm a firm believer in everybody's potential being virtually unlimited now is DJ going to become LeBron James no but when we talk about you know it's a start yeah right yeah but like there's limits right yeah but there's also way more areas where there's no limits if you're willing to put in the time and you know basically do the the fucking two things that need to happen which is one you need to be able to learn from your mistakes the first time or the second time you make them at the latest ideally the first time and second you have to be able to go through and deal with all the shit and not quit and if you could do those two things you can improve your skill set and you could push down the path it's impossible not to win over time it might take somebody a little bit longer because they started in a little bit lower place but that's that's reality if you started out with nothing guess what you're gonna have to go further that's that's the reality we can't artificially set the start point in the end point that's how it works if you started off with not much you're gonna have to go further and that's what you have to accept but you also have to understand that you have things that the other people don't have like I mentioned earlier if you started out at a low place in life you're gonna have the hunger to stay the fuck away from there much longer than the person who grew up in the fucking middle upper class or the upper class and had everything fucking handed to them they're driving a Porsche and they're 16 shit like those people don't have the hunger they're fucking soft and you asked me before like what makes people not go it's comfort so if that person's been comfortable their whole life what the fuck are they what do they have by going anyway they're not they're not gonna ever go so you are blessed to be born in a shitty situation because you know what it's like to have a shitty life and you're willing to work and fight and claw and scratch and do anything required to to not be that and dude so like if you're someone who's sitting there and you're like oh it's not fair because I don't have this or that bro you're missing the fucking point you were gifted the best possible gift you could ever have which is the experience of a life that you don't want which creates the desire and the drive and the hunger for a life that you want that the other people you're competing with will never have because they never experienced it so like quit bitching about it and quit crying about it and start recognizing what a massive advantage that is over everybody else I love it guys Andy that was uh that was three yep let's go out pay to fee I see you guys on CTI
