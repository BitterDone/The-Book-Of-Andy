You guys got me all messed up. Alright. We got real talk. This is the worst throughout the week. We like to start the week off with some good personal development how to be better type content but throughout the week we're gonna have different kinds of content. We're gonna shows within the show. Alright we're gonna have real talk. Real talk is five to twenty minutes and we give you some real talk. Then we're gonna have CTI that stands for Cruz the Internet. That is become our most popular show. We put up topics on the screen. We talk about what's going on. We speculate and watch true and what's not true. Then we talk about how we the people all of us have to solve these problems going on in the world. Other times we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus where someone who has completed the 75 hard program is not a challenge. It is a program comes on the show talks about how they were before how they are now and how they use the 75 hard program to get control of their life. You're unfamiliar with 75 hard it is the world's most popular mental transformation program and it is free.

It's designed to be repeated year after year after year. So only program of it's kind and you get it for free at episode 208 on the audio feed only. Now there is a book. The book is available at Andy for cella.com. It's called the book on mental toughness. It will cover the entire live hard program and 10 extra chapters on mental toughness. Why it's important. Why you need to cultivate it and how to cultivate it along with case studies of very famous people that you know who talk about why they use how they use mental toughness to become who they are. Now one thing you're notice about our show is we are one of the only shows that does not run ads. I'm quite certain that we are the biggest show in the world that doesn't run ads and I don't do that because I have real businesses and I'm a successful person and I don't want to take money from people that are going to try to tell me what to do. I do this out of service. I do this to get the message out and I don't want to be censored. I don't want to be controlled. I don't want to be leveraged and for exchange for that we have this thing we call the fee. The fee is you got to help us get the show out. You got to share the show. We're constantly battling censorship, traffic, bands, traffic throttles and we need your help to get the show. So it's a show that makes you think, makes you laugh, gives you a new perspective. It's something that you think needs to be heard. Do us a favor help us get the show out there. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. All right. What's up, dude? It's going on brother. Now the man. Yeah.

I'm coming to the party. Oh, man. All right. Let's get into this. All right. Andy, I got three good ones for you, man. Let's knock these out. Guys, Andy question number one. Thank you for the show. It's really the sole reason I make it to the gym, the majority of days. I'm a commercial insurance broker and struggle motivating the account managers, my company hires and assigns to me. They are awesome people. Smart, loyal, have the ability to understand things, but I have to tell them basically to do their job. What they need to do when to do it. How to do it? I've made checklist. I've invested hours teaching them the why, the how, always including the benefits of them long term for living up to a certain standard of service and catching up on their work and receive positive feedback. But these people are just always behind. And I'm always picking up the slack doing the job for them. Instead of doing what I'm great at, which is nurturing existing relationships and developing new relationships to land more clients. I desperately need advice on how successful off entrepreneurs get through this phase by sucking it up and being there for their team. But with what strategy to come out on the other side with a competent team that knows what they're doing. Andy, any feedback on this? What we got? Yeah, for sure. And that's a difficult situation because as a sales trainer or as a leader, as a manager, we're always going to want more output from our people. And oftentimes because we know how to execute the job, we assume that they know how to execute the job because what's easy for us, we assume should be easy for them. And we tend to forget the years and years and years and years of experience that we have put in to develop that skill set that now feels easy. So that's something to keep in mind. The next thing to keep in mind, is that you have to understand that being a life coach, a personal development coach for your team is absolutely necessary. A lot of leaders and managers, the small business, they say, well, if they want to get better, they'll go get better on their own. And there's some truth to that. You have to go get better on your own if you're part of a team. However, it is also your job as the leader to sit down with these people or in a group setting, teach them the skills over and over and over again. Oftentimes, because things come so easy to us, because we've had the reps, we don't realize that they haven't had the reps. And what happens is, we get tired of saying the same thing over and over and over again. And they haven't heard it enough. And so we start to look at them like, man, you're not getting it. When in reality, we just haven't taught it to them enough. And they haven't practiced enough to be great at it. Outside of that, we have the situation in which you said you do, but I don't know how well you do it. But you said you explain to them why this is important to them. Because people are intrinsically inspired, not motivated, inspired to do great work. If you show them what great work means to them. And so a lot of times people will paint this crazy, you know, and valid mission out in front, but they leave out the part of what it's going to mean to them. Okay. And inherently, people are selfish. Whether they want to act like it or not or claim it or not, the first thing that goes through most people's mind is, okay, if I do all of this, I become graded at what's in it for me. And so you have to sit down with these people and almost start it like, okay, what are your goals for your life? What are you trying to achieve? One of the things we do here is we ask people to make a vision board. Because the vision board, after being made, at least brings their focus of what life should be into something that is like visible, right? Most people spend more time planning their dinner on Saturday night than they do their life. So just going through the exercise of having someone cut out pictures and put things that mean something and kind of create a visual that represents their life gives them an idea of how much they have to earn and how much success they have to gain. And until you do that, most people really don't have a grasp of that. They just kind of go. And then they end up with not much. And they're like, well, why didn't I end up with much? Because the people who ended up with all the things that you wanted, they didn't just get that stuff. They decided a long time ago, this is what I want. And then they created that for themselves. And so just going through simple exercises, starting at the basics, what are you trying to do with your life? Who are you trying to become? What are you trying to create? Where are you trying to live? What kind of car are you trying to drive? What kind of family do you want? Do you want to take your family on vacation to, you know, lake, local lake, or do you want to take your family on vacation to Europe? All right. How do you want to get there? Yeah, we got to, they got to know where they're going before you can get them to understand how to get there and what's required. And so oftentimes people who are training these people don't go far enough back to get them to make a decision about where they want to be, which the next decision is how do I get there? And then the next decision after that is what are the specific techniques about how to get there? And then the next thing after that is how do I get the reps to get good at this so I can get there? And these are all phases of the learning process. So I would make sure you're covering all three of those. Make sure that you're doing it well. Stay patient. Don't forget that the things that are easy for you are not easy for someone even who's been doing it one, two or three years. I have people who've been working around me for three years that still only really understand a fraction of what I could understand after 25 years of building something from the ground up. So things that are very obvious to me may not be obvious to them even with some experience. So we have to get comfortable repeating the same things over and over and over and be patient with people's ability to pick that up and put it into play. And here's the good part. When you make that investment in time and you sit down with someone and you actually help them and you actually coach them, they usually become pretty good, bro. And then when they become pretty good, you use them as an example to the other people about how it should look and what it should be. And eventually that person's going to create a life, they're going to have a nice house, they're going to have the things they want. And they're going to appreciate you for sitting down and showing them the path. Well, you know, one thing I think about two men is is not everybody learns the same, right? Like there's auditory learners, there's visual learners, hands on learners, right? Like what, how did you adjust to that? I guess, you know, when you started expanding your team, right? Like how did you, I mean, because you started off with, you know, one store and then you start expanding, you got over 500 employees. So how does that look in the Graham scheme of things? Because everybody doesn't learn the same. That's the importance of spending the time going through it over and over and over again. Because if they're here and you talk about it and you're drawn on the whiteboard, that's audio and visual writing. And then they have to get the experience of going out and doing the reps. So as long as you're repeating it over and over again in that way, you're going to cover the basis. And quite honestly, it's up to them to take the information. And some people just aren't going to do it, bro. Some people, a lot of people are very, very, very ambitious with their words and very, very, very unambitious with their actions. And that's what ends up costing them everything that they want. So you never go up to someone and say, Hey, what kind of house do you want to live in? And they say, I want a little piece of shit. Everybody wants a nice house. Everybody wants a nice car. Everybody wants a nice life. So you can't expect all of these people's words to line up with their actions. So you have to be able to see is this person really living the message that they say they want? Are their goals really their goals are, are they full of shit? And that's where we have to get to and you get there by paying attention to them. You know, I say this one thing on the vision boards and I think it's really, really cool when anybody that's ever been to, you know, hear headquarters, you walk through and everybody has their vision boards up. And I think that just does something to the culture too because it's like, you walk through here. Oh, look, that I see with this guy once. I see with his dreams and goals. I know that he wants something in life and I look over here at this one. Oh, this person wants something over here too. It build, it kind of, it really builds a culture there. Well, there's, there's also this too, right? We have 500 people. It's impossible to really know everybody on a deep level because of so many people, right? So all of us sort in a big organization, you know, you have your little groups, you know, you know, these 10 people, you know, these 10 people, you know, these 10 people, I try to know everybody the best I can, but it's a lot on top of everything else, right? So one of the cool things about a vision board is that, you know, people over here in this department, people over here in this department can connect over the things that are on their board because they're like, Oh, dude, you like that car? That's one of my favorite cars. That's what I want. Dude, oh, you like that kind of house. I love that kind of house. And it creates these little conversations that do, like you said, how glue the culture and create better relationships inside the building. Yeah. I love that you address the point of like, you know, most people are in it for a selfish reasons and that that's okay. It is okay. From a leadership standpoint, you got to learn how to, how to mold that. That's right. Bro, listen, it's, it's totally okay that you're supposed to. You're supposed to work so you could take care of your own shit. That's why the fuck you're supposed to do it. Now on top of that, it should be if you want to feel fulfilled and you want to feel good about what you do, it should be something you believe in. It should be something you enjoy. You should enjoy the people that you work around. Those are things that matter because you spend most of your time in that environment. And you know, I see a lot of young people make the mistake of being in a place that they really like and then taking a step backwards in terms of, I don't know, quality of life to make a dollar extra over here, right? Temporarily. And that's something to consider, dude. You know, your place of business or where you work, you spend most of your time. So you have to be in a situation where, you know, you like the people that you're around and you like what you do and you believe in the mission. But ultimately at the end of the day, you know, you should be, I think everybody is at a base level concerned about themselves and their family first. And that's just reality. And the people that try to paint it as not that are highly manipulative. You know what I'm saying? Like there's a lot of owners and leaders and they try to like, they try to like act like it's not that what, no, it is that way. It's fucking that way, bro. And that's okay. Like that's how to use that and make sure my job is to take your, your goals and your dreams and figure out how to make those a reality in here. And then once we figure it out together, I say, hey, this is what you got to do to get there. You see what I'm saying? I love it. I love it. Guys, Andy, question number two. What's up, Andy and DJ? I'm a 24 year old guy who became a full time traveling health insurance agent back in March. And I've been running a mobile detailing business for about six years. I'm getting ready to move to the big city of Atlanta from a one red light little town to build out my own branch of the insurance brokerage. I know this is not a relationship counseling podcast or any bullshit like that. But I wanted the honest opinion from a successful businessman who I'm sure has made tons of sacrifices to be where he is. I've been in a relationship for about a year with the girl who lives about two hours away from me now that I was consistently seeing biweekly. But since starting insurance, I've rarely been seeing her due to the fact that I travel every week or two out of state. Now that I'm moving and she's not ready to make a big move, I have a choice to make. Either I stick it out with her and put in the extra effort to go see her and take a take time away from both of my businesses or I move on and put the extra effort to build up my detailing businesses insurance company in my new city. I guess what what are your thoughts on this? You know, a young man trying to drive and feels like he's being held back on a relationship basis. What's your thoughts on that? Well, it's hard for me to know the context because you know, if this person is highly supportive of what you do and they contribute and make your life better and they make your journey easier and you have a healthy relationship, that would be a totally different answer than what I'm about to give. What I'm about to give is the answer for the general situation that these young men find themselves in. All right, so this could be the one. All right, this could be your queen or whatever the fuck you want to call it. You know what I'm saying? That's what everybody says these days. I think it's ridiculous. However, it is what it is. But I'm going to assume it's not because I think more men in this situation need to understand the reality of this situation. Okay, you're 24 years old. You're trying to build a business for yourself. It's hard to build a business. It's hard to build a life as a man. You will be valued based upon the results that you produce in that area. That's just the truth. Most of a man's love and appreciation comes from the utility the man has. Can they provide? Are they capable? Do they protect the family? And whether we want to say it's all these other things, it's still those things and that's reality. So you might be told it's all these other things, but I'm here to tell you that's what it is. Come find me in 10 years and tell me I'm wrong. All right, here's the other thing. It's very, very hard to do. You're going to need all the energy that you can possibly put together to make this work and make it successful. And the reality of the situation is that your selection pool for potential partners is much more limited now than it will be in eight to ten years when you've put that time in and you've become successful and you are a man of means and utility and you can provide and you can protect and you can you become a more desirable mate. And that means that your ability to select a potential partner widens. And that's where men have to be very careful because when your ability to select a potential partner widens, sometimes men because of the sexual dynamic that men grow up in make poor choices. All right, and what I mean by that is this, women and men have a completely different dynamic growing up. Women hit puberty and they have to learn to say no immediately. All right, men have the opposite of that experience. Men hit puberty and they can't find anybody to fucking do anything with them, right? They just want someone to see them naked, right? Like, like, bro, it's it's not the same thing. So men are constantly chasing women are constantly rejecting. And when you take a man and you become a man of means and you become a man of success and the potential selection pool widens, you're not very experienced at making those decisions. So I would spend this time. Yes, you can date casually. Yes, you can meet girls that will give you a real understanding of what you want versus what you don't want. But the reality of it is is your ability to find exactly what you want is going to be better in eight years once you've put in the time to build this business. And I think you're going to find a much happier situation in the long run that way. Most men, okay? Now, are there exceptions to that? Are there people that at 24 years old meet their wife or their husband and everything's perfect? And they build together? Yes, absolutely, dude. Okay? But that's just not common. Yeah, I don't I don't think that's the norm. No, it's not. Not for young men. It's not, dude. Like if we have a man who is, uh, if you throw him in the desert, bro, right? And you throw a woman in the desert, but the woman's got an all you can eat above a 24 seven 24 seven 365 days, she can fucking eat whatever the fuck she wants. Okay? She's going to be very selective about what she chooses to eat because there's unlimited supply. All right, you throw the man in the desert and there's no food. Okay? And then all of a sudden, you throw him a bunch of real bad food. Guess what? He's going to eat all of it because he's starving. All right? And that's the dynamic between men and women and people don't give that conversation enough real discussion because once a man becomes successful, it requires knowing what you're looking for and then resisting like a woman would have to her whole life, the ones that aren't going to fit and be conducive to the goals that you have. So it's very, very important that you understand this. Yeah. Yeah, you gotta go through it. Yeah. I gotta go through it. And I think one last thing I want to tell you to get your take on, you know, this this idea of this energy consumption you have, you're talking about doing something really, really difficult here. Let's talk about the distractions. Let's talk about what can what can drain that energy bank a little bit. You know, if he's trying to go after this, this big endeavor here. Well, there's two sides of that coin. If he's got to go to Atlanta and get involved in the social life because he's got a girlfriend, it's going to take energy too. So we have to talk about which one is, you know what I mean? There's that's there's weight there too. Yeah. So, but yeah, the truth of the matter is is it's going to take most of your energy. And the fact that you're aware of that is very, very good. You're ahead of most people. Most people think they can, you know, go out and have a normal social life and go out Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and still, do all the business stuff. And it's just not reality, dude. It doesn't happen. Yeah. I love it. I love it. Guys, Andy, question number three. Andy, I just finished 75 hard in the physical and mental transformation on the Bible. However, I consider myself pretty self aware and I realize I have some additional work to do in the area of indecisiveness. Through much of my reading during 75 hard, decisiveness was a key trait that kept coming up when it comes to highly successful people. I realize this is likely one of my biggest blockers to achieving the level of success I aspire to. Assuming decisiveness is a skill that can be developed much like you talk about discipline. Are there any tips or strategies you've used in the past to help become more decisive in general? Love you guys and everything you do. Yeah, look. Most of the decisions that we have to make are not going to be fatal. We have to understand that. All right. Most of the decisions that you make are even if it's the wrong one, it's not going to crush you. There's very few life decisions or business decisions that you can make that can really, really, really derail you. One of them being what we just covered in section two, marrying the wrong woman. Okay, marrying the wrong man. So realize that outside of a few key things, you know, like bro, you know, you get in a car and drive drunk and kill someone. That's a major life fuckup. There's there's very few decisions outside of those kind of decisions that that will really derail you. Okay. So oftentimes we put the weight of our decision making process on consequences that aren't reality, which means we will say, okay, I've got to make this decision or I've got to choose this. And if I choose this, I'll become a gazillionaire. And if I choose this, I'll be dead. Right? Like these are the consequences we put on these decisions when they're not real. They're not real. And so we have to be honest with ourselves about what the consequences are of these decisions. And the truth about entrepreneurship and the truth about success is making decisions quickly is important. And then making adjustments with those decisions is important. So really the the ultra ninja move that you have to have as an entrepreneur is making a decision and then recognizing quickly if it was the right or the wrong decision and then adjusting if it was the wrong one or adjusting better if it was the right one and it can be better. I believe that that is one of the key skills that successful people have that is not talked about enough. You have to make decisions fast because the current of entrepreneurship and business and the market is moving very fast. So we have to make decisions fast and then we have to recognize fast if it was the wrong decision. You know, so you're saying like that probably wasn't the right decision, but because you make it one. You make it the right. And that's how you do it. You don't just make a decision and turn your head and let it just go down the path, bro. You make the decision. You go, you know, you tip toe out on there and you take the feedback. You say, okay, I think I think that past going to hold us. I think this is going to work. You take three or four more steps. You take three or four more steps and then you start running. All right. And that's how you kind of feel it out and you watch real close right after you made a decision with extreme detail. Was this right or was this wrong? And if it gives you indicators that it's wrong right away, you have to like see if it's wrong twice or three times because it could be just that one guy or that one person or that one thing. So you want to be quick, but not too quick. And I know this is super confusing. But there's this is an art form. All right. And this is something that you learn from doing this over and over and over again. So having a nuanced approach to decision making that's not black and white and the ability to observe feedback and adjust the feedback quickly, I believe is one of the most important entrepreneur success skills that you could possibly possess. Okay. So don't be afraid to make the decision because most likely it's not going to be fatal to you or your business. And if you do make the wrong decision and you watch it, you'll be able to see it was the wrong decision quickly and you'll quickly be able to make this other decision or redirect in that direction. You see what I'm saying? Would you say that most people's problem is that they just make no decision. Yes. Yes. That's why the decision making should be quick. Right. If you start to look at it, you get what's called paralysis of analysis. You'll look at this. You'll look at this. You'll look at this. You'll look at this. Here's what here. Here's how I would do it. Look at this. Look at this. It's that a week later, I check it a day later, I check it. How's that going? Right. When I make a decision here, all right. We like, let's just say hypothetically, let's just say Salon, I, are talking a decision over and he's deferring to me. What should we do? And he'll say we could do this or we could do this. 99% of the time my answer will come out right away. And I'll say, I think we should do that. And then he'll say, what about this? And I'll say, well, this is why this is what I think. And so we'll choose one and then we'll pay attention. And if it ends up not being the right one, we just go ahead and change it. And I think that's we have to understand, like we're not married to these decisions forever. There's very few decisions that we make that cannot be adjusted. And the ability to adjust it is something that you're going to have to learn to do, bro. Entrepreneurship is fluid. It's not rigid. It's adjusting quickly. It's adapting fast. A lot of winning the game of business is adaptation quicker than the other guy, which you got to make. Yeah, you have to make the decision, bro. And most of the reason people can't make the decisions is because they put an unrealistic consequence attached to this to the decision because they're nervous or they're worried or they can't afford to lose money. So they put these enormous weights on their shoulders and then they just choose nothing. And if you choose nothing, you get nothing. And that's just the way it works. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. I love it, man. Well, guys, Andy, that was three. All right, guys, a little quicker show than normal today, but that's so you can get out there and kick some ass. So let's go do that this week. We'll see you tomorrow with CTI. Remember, don't be a hub. Just show.
