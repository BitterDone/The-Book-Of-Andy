headlines head on number one Andy you ever been to a black church i don't think so oh good why did you need about six hours bro oh wow that's just like a Catholic a true Catholic oh bro listen i remember growing up bro i took a nap yeah but bro you guys got fucking cool music and like everybody's dancing and fucking clapping on beaten shit you go to fucking white church and everybody nobody knows what the fuck to do everybody's awkward in and out in like an hour bro yeah that's because we can't take it anymore is that what it is yeah everybody's awkward as fuck they make you turn around and talk to people that you don't know and they're fucking weird like bro it's weird bro i'll tell you right now bro black church is about eight hours it's probably fun the whole time bro i remember i remember going to black church being i took a nap once like three hours i woke up i was still going on they should fast-forward a guy that's where the guy bro we had like intermissions you know i'm saying i'm gonna fuck this we're not to the food court and shit came back in and we're right back into it man well hey man well Biden's at black church today i thought that was interesting Biden will visit church where black people were killed to lay out election stakes and perils of hate he's back at it yeah right back at it so uh president Joe Biden throw that race car he's on it home yeah they're dealing they kind of backfire don't know uh president Joe Biden once americans zagras the extraordinary stakes of this year's presidential elections as he sees them as part of that effort he's he's revisiting some of the nation's worst traumas to highlight what can happen when hate is allowed to fester on monday Biden had the Charleston South Carolina to mother-am annual am e-church the site of a 2015 racist massacre in which nine black church goers were shot to death during bible study now hold on Andy who was who's president 2015 uh i believe that was uh berry uh what's his name saying berry who's saying yeah it wasn't trump though all samol bomba right it wasn't trump now i'm 2015 right okay just make it sure the event comes after a blunt speech by the democratic president on the eve of the anniversary of the j-6 2021 riot at the u.s. capital in which he uh excoriated former president Donald trump for quote unquote glorifying rather than condemning political violence um ap news continues saying it's a grim way to kick off a presidential campaign particularly for a man known for his unfailing optimism and belief that american achievements are limitless but as campaign advisors and aides say it's necessary to lay out the stakes in unequivocal terms particularly after a few years without the cultural saturation of trump's words and actions and it's an effort to set up the contrast they hope will be paramount to voters in 2024 but yeah so he goes that except they ain't mind it no they're not and uh yeah he calls calls trump a loser quote unquote loser um slams him for his actions after 2020 elections saying quote uh losers are taught to concede when they lose he's a loser but right before that he gets heckled by some uh pro-Palestinian protesters here's the clip without the truth there's no light without light there's no path from this darkness that's alright that's alright that's alright that's alright i love the way just remember i love the faces i like the black people around do you look look at them wait look at her bro she's straight up she's straight up like you better shut the fuck up right now she's about to uh bro she's about to take that fan of swathe the she's about to whoop ass you need to not worry about ceasefire you worry about that lady yeah i like his pissed she hot but uh but dude look at that face bro she is pissed off yeah she's about to smack somebody yeah we're here to thank some newsweek uh who's typically a pretty left-leaning uh outlet you know Biden's trying all the race cards and all that but newsweek just comes out with this new article uh helan reads Donald Trump poised to win more black votes than any republican in history shocking um and they're expected anywhere from 14 to 13 uh 30 percent of the black vote it's it's i think it's like 60 percent it's a shame that it's even that low yeah based upon race like it's insane dude it shows a collective thinking and group think amongst a racial dynamic no you know what i'm saying like we don't vote man hold on that's the problem you couldn't go to any other dynamic and say this percentage of this race votes and have to be like 80 percent of the fucking 90 percent of the race right like black people got to wait to fuck up dude like you got to understand that if you continue to vote the way you voted you're going to continue to get what you're getting and what you're getting in fair and everybody agrees with that but the reality is if you want to change it you're gonna have to change your perspective which starts with understanding true history of these parties the the democrat party is it can is has done every single fucking racist thing that this country has ever been founded ever happened in this country every single one the response before all of it yeah the big things the slavery to fucking anti civil rights that the all the segregation all of these things come from democrats oh but he the party that free to slaves was called the radical republicans okay like holy shit dude like at what point in time can we get everybody to understand hey we probably shouldn't keep doing the same thing because it's fucking our shit up we should probably think about why we why this is happening and the reason it's happening which i said four million fucking times is you vote based upon shit that they tell you and the shit your friends say which your friends don't know shit okay and and they come in and they say the white man's a source your problems republicans are to source your problems we're gonna fix your shit vote for us and we'll fix it change hope right but what happens every time more and more bad shit oh it changes all right yeah for the worst you know but dude like what is this with like what is this yeah I mean I think it is core but I guess true psychological warfare it's it's psychological manipulation it's been going on for a hundred abuse it's what it is it's psychological abuse yeah dude you train the dog to not bite the hand that quote-unquote feeds it into sad fucked up relationship dude it's it's annoying as fuck yeah to the point where I mean it's not so common it's common like now but I mean bro even three years ago look back three four years ago bro like they were so trained at the point where anybody who who with any black person that would try to speak out on that they were to fucking attack they still do that you know they try to do it doesn't work now yeah now it's much now but I mean bro three four years ago shit was hot you know like that but that's how deep that psychological fucking manipulation rolls bro I don't know man like at some point you got to be able to look at your current situation look at the history of what you know walk the timeline back yeah man yeah and like be like fuck these people who just fucked us up worse and worse and worse and now they're trying to replace us because we're waking up that they've been fucking us up exactly exactly it's like bro a hundred percent of black people should vote against Joe Biden whatever they decide to vote it should be against him that's a fact a hundred percent should be 14 percent or 30 percent should be a hundred percent because those motherfuckers have zero interest in building the black communities or black culture or any of the shit the black people give a fuck about which from my perspective or what I've heard from the black people that I know and talk to they listen to the show bro they just want to be treated like normal fucking Americans bro they want opportunity they don't want their fucking schools to look like shit they don't want war zones for neighborhoods they want to be treated like a normal community they want police and they're cracking down on crime like dude this this whole like social justice warrior fucking I'm gonna be offended for you bullshit that comes from fucking rich white people bro the vote Democrat no like it's fucked up maybe like you don't matter the color man like it hit like here's something that's like not being reported right now because I got to follow up thing I want to get into but right outside of Chicago it's a little suburb called Harvey Harvey Illinois and this is like it's starting to circulate some in some places but this mayor black mayor right is basically created his own little dictatorship bro like he shut down it makes all the businesses no matter what you are what you do shut down it like midnight but this motherfucker just they have like these apartment complexes he literally just boarded people inside of their homes to condemn the entire complex and nobody talking about it now if that was a was a Democrat yeah black Democrat don't fit the narrative so you can't talk about it that's going on right now just crazy stuff man but look bro for us to go for us to fix what's going on in this country people have to stop looking at it as like black people white people Indian people like all this artificial identity politics racial divide this is the reason they get what they want we can this is why everybody gets fucked over and dude we can't have unity amongst Americans without the black communities waking up that is a big problem a big problem is the black community holding out for these Democrats because bro you've been voting Democrat for 50 fucking years what's happened nothing what's happened it's got no it's not nothing bro it's gotten way worse it's gotten way worse dude fathers have been removed from the fucking household intentionally crime has been allowed to fester intentionally money is filtered out of these these communities intentionally stolen intentionally so much so that these black communities these inner city urban communities when people do this there's like well that's what they do yeah you quit vote quivon for them holy shit man like bro we have to wake the fuck up yeah this is not black and white shit with this is Americans versus a bunch of tyrants dude yep it's good evil man it's good evil that was coming across this article I thought was very very very very very interesting I want to get your thoughts on it as we wrap up headline number one this report comes out from jp morgan okay and we'll make sure we link this stuff for you guys but it's titled pillow talk okay now let's take a 40 plus page document right here's a table of contents but the interesting piece in this article is you got to that last little table of content on page 39 it's titled top 10 surprises for 2024 in honor of Byron ween um yeah so this so this this this was written by this guy he's one of the top analysts for uh JP Morgan but he wrote he wrote this out top 10 surprises for 2024 and I just want to go through a couple and this is kind of like his his foreshadowing of what's happening in his opinion with all the data and everything um so number one he's saying that the US dollar is going to remain stable right okay all right cool uh he says the DOJ the FTC is going to win a big anti-trust case um against uh against like all the big uh google and amazon meta t-mobile right all that good stuff that's cool his third prediction though this is interesting um prediction number three says president Biden withdraws sometime between super Tuesday and the November election citing health reasons Biden passes the torch to a replacement candidate named by the democratic national committee since arrester yeah who's been saying that for years very very interesting yeah it's going to be Michelle Obama you know why you think Michelle Obama's out doing all these podcasts all these press releases all these yeah man it's it's it's rolling in and they're going to try to play some gigantic racial divide in in some around summertime again it's what it's looking like man yeah um he also predicts that there's going to be this massive boycott of EV vehicles um he's starting to see that he's saying the driverless car backlash is coming um saying in the few places where full level five autonomous cars are being tested in real world conditions they have blocked ambulances on their way to the hospital hampered other emergency responders caused accidents increased congestions and run over pedestrians and basically saying that you know there's going to be a massive public boycott of these EV vehicles come at sometime this year um lays out some stuff for Argentina uh says the Russian Ukraine war is going to keep going on but no ceasefire uh all the way through 2024 here's another interesting prediction now if you go to number nine um he says due to the due to retirement of despatchable power generation and under investment and pipelines gas storage and when the realization major US cities will face electricity outages and or natural gas outages which are much worse predicting that we're going to have these rolling blackouts and power outages and um natural gas outages very very interesting stuff very very interesting stuff and it's final prediction was that there's going to be this new um covid vaccine that you'll be able to inhale rather than taking a shot um michael symbolized yeah he passed away right uh no no this is the guy that wrote the article he wrote the article in an honor of biren got uh lion who passed away at the age of 90 who's been doing these like predictions every year yeah just interesting I'd say some of those are probably spot on yeah you know the consumer data shows that people are rejecting uh electric vehicles um a lot of the companies are reinvesting money back into uh traditional fossil fuel gas diesel engines um consumers are pissed off about all this promises of electric vehicle and then these things that they don't do we're reading story at for story of people getting stranded all over the place it's highly inconvenient nobody wants it they fucking sound like shit they look like shit they right people who drive like shit huh people who drive them look like shit yeah uh no but really do there is a there is a consumer backlash of uh against all of these things and you know that's real uh I do believe that Joe Biden will they will try to somehow pass the torch with no primary or they're they're trying to they're trying to keep control from their voters um even the democrats like you're gonna vote for who we tell you that's right it's not about who the democrats want like if democrats real if they were allowed to have a primary I think most democrats will vote for somebody like rfk okay but you know they're not gonna and that's why rfk running as an independent is interesting because I believe that a lot of would be Biden voters are gonna vote for him and nobody that's gonna vote for trump is gonna vote for him trump people are fucking trump people so uh you know and in terms of you know how they're gonna try position michelle obama I think it's gonna be around some big racial divide you know these people are known for you know manifesting tragedy whenever they need one you know what I mean sorry convenient yeah so I would my prediction is you know some sort of big potential you know race division type thing uh throughout the year I think they're gonna try it over and over again and I think we got to be smarter than that you know white people black people everybody's gotta realize they're on the same team they gotta realize that with that you know with unity those people have no power over us and they're gonna try to divide us every which way possible they're gonna try to create chaos between along the lines of racial division as much as possible because that's their only way to get what they want and so these people are opposite of unifiers and I think the people of the united states of america are tired of being divided I think if I think if somebody were to come along and actually call for unity in the right way that person would that person would run away with everything um but you know I think there's a lot of truth to some of these predictions that he's making in my opinion you know to say the dollar is is gonna continue to be strong and shit that's bullshit okay you have every other country in the fucking world joining bricks all right like the the dollars in trouble and I still stand by what I said a few weeks ago which is I think they're intentionally going to hyper inflate the dollar while moving all of all of uh you know all of their personal assets into actual hard assets and then when the digital currency is world out they moving back into digital currency and I mean we can see that by the way they put in money to last few years and the way they continue to try to print money so I think there's a lot of things that could be true but I think there's a lot of things that that are BS and this guy's report um but we're gonna have to wait and see yeah guys tell us what you guys think jump down in the comments section let us know downtown let us know what you guys yeah I mean we're gonna have to have two things this year man we're gonna have to have unity and we're gonna have to have non-compliance okay those are the two things that are gonna that are gonna create a situation where the people of America Americans come out on top in this situation it's it's civil disobedience which doesn't mean writing it means not reacting to their their division tactics not burning shit down but also not complying to their fucking bullshit rules they're gonna try to put through okay and then secondly realizing that we're all of us are out here on the same team white people black people you know Native Americans Asians anybody who's an American we're on the same team and these people are not on our team and so we're gonna have to be smart in them and if we fail to be smarter than them and we react every time they want us to react and we we comply when they tell us to jump we're gonna lose we get upset whenever they try to racially divide us or take something that happens in this country literally thousands of times a year and make it like it's its own fucking big huge tragedy or they create some sort of racial tragedy I mean dude look they're gonna do everything this is my opinion they're gonna do everything they can to create recreate the George Floyd situation again and people are gonna have to be smart enough not to buy and into it otherwise broke it could cost us everything forever you know so we need unity and we need not compliance and that's the answer you know people keep saying which what do we do what do we do we work on being the best version of ourselves we set the standard we set the example for everybody to be and then when they tell us to be a scared we don't be scared when they tell us to jump we don't jump when they tell us to do this or comply to this we say fuck you and then we work together as people and they won't have it they can't they lose all their power that way you have to be very loud about it yeah and until people figure that out bro they're gonna continue to have power over us yeah what's that man guys let's know down in the comments what you guys think about this headline and with that being said let's keep this cruise moving let's head to the comments section cruise the comments this comment comes from at Keystone Plumber says Plumber here when we hang him probably 90 times soon I mean really it's hard

want to be fired they're not gonna get fired no they won't let Sam guy stole all those people's clothes did like 10 things before he finally got fired yeah yeah so defense secretary Lloyd Austin was in an intensive care unit for days but is now recovering and resumed full duties last night according to new reports Austin was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Monday following complications with an elective medical procedure pending on press secretary major general pet writer revealed an statement Friday the news was kept from the press for days due to quote medical and personal privacy issues writer said amid heightened tensions in the Middle East this week when a US strike killed four members of the Iran Alain Iraqi militia group and bad dad and two suicide and I ran left at least 103 people dead as Israel's bombardment of God's would continue says according to political Pentagon reporter Lara Seligman Austin remained in hospital Saturday and resumed full duties last night quote I don't have any updates to provide at this time in terms of when he'll be discharged but we'll be sure to keep you and others yeah the US won't fucking do anything about it because they got all this blackmail just like they have on the Epstein people on every mother fucker in power ms. I does yep so they won't say shit about it that's why they all get up there and say mmm Israel's our greatest friend there are best friend and there are best friend then why do they want to send all those refugees does instead taking themselves yeah that's stupid man yes so so so this guy Lloyd Austin man he just up now I tried to look into like elective surgeries right he's probably gonna stick cut off well that's that that isn't a that's an popular thing with these people listen these are some of their nicks there's bariatric surgery hip replacement that's an elective no he's fucking getting his fucking Peter cut off well a breast reduction he could have been getting elacic he's a fat dude he could have been getting a breast gender confirmation surgeries those are elective and titty fucking worked on listen dude I'm done yeah we're just fucking go full blast I mean listen let it let it let it let it unleash I voted you got his dip dip cut off and they didn't cut it all the way off so you had to say in a fucking ER a couple of you comes out as trans bro oh holy fuck I don't miss very often bro I'm saying man this is can't be like no shadamas of the year my fucker this is don't miss information over here I'm not now I'm speculating when I say that and I'm just saying would it surprise you would it surprise you if he had complications of getting his penis cut off no hanging around these people me neither no I wouldn't surprise well how fucking mentally fucking how how I'm mentally abused you have to be to get to a point where you cut off your fucking penis very holy shit man very like I ain't saying I'm a perfect motherfucker but they're never been a problem listen bro I got my own problems but the very thing hold on I'm listening this I got some serious fucking problems with my life dude I've had some bad ones in my life I you know it ain't never that bad fuck it ain't never that bad bro like it ain't never there's never been a time where I'm like fuck dude you know it's cut it off I think all my problems will get better if I cut off my dick like like dude like let's just be real how fucking fuck like fuck does your mind do they just throw it away like what happens to that what happens to it they probably do some ritual or eat or something man my what happens to it man like where does it go it goes to say place all that money goes for his crypto assets it goes nowhere here's Lloyd Austin's a new delivery man oh so he has no plans to resign yeah from a quote from major general general Pat writer quote secretary Austin has no plans to resign so this guy leaves doesn't fucking tell anybody anyway what what we like okay I feel like there's a practical application to this okay because like you do need to like taking like okay like if fucking you know will so if we went to hospital and got his dick cut off but didn't tell you but didn't tell me he was getting it cut off bro you got you know you got the new transformation challenge going on like wheels needed in the office he needs to be here he doesn't tell you doesn't say anything to anybody just just goes away and just goes and then we find out that the reason why was because he cut off his winner yeah what would I do I mean what am I legally allowed to do yeah that's a protected class I can't do anything yeah I don't fuck bro yeah it's fucked up I'll tell you this is real shit if my team here ran the fucking wirehouse bro we'd have a fucking country oh fuck yeah maybe the best country in a fucking world road streets would be clean everybody be making money everybody be ripped everybody have big dicks like it'd be fucking amazing dude we drive in Bogotese what sounds good don't it yeah vote for me yeah so 2024 uh but yeah apparently he was also this same time the Biden was on vacation now now this is where like the true implications the issues come into place on this right bro I ain't playing no we really could run this shit no way fucking better than any of these other idiots oh we have our two listen dude I could do better in Trump too that's real shit I could do better in all these guys we're just still young enough to do yeah um with my team yeah I could do it no no yeah bro could you imagine Jason could you imagine me having deal with their team oh fuck that dude comes walking in the fucking wirehouse with this fucking fake fingernails and shit you know what's saying like what would happen to this guy oh no my tailor bro we would have to you two we would have to you two ball of it you guys alike me my fucker would be full transparency dude you'll know exactly what's going on it'll I'll turn the fucking white house into an Epstein mansion you guys to just watch the rooms we'll subscribe it listen hold on bro hold on you got a camera and microphone in every room we'll open up a subscription service well doing on only fans will become the we'll listen listen bro we'll become the richest only fans creator of all time in one fucking day fuck man I was thinking about putting mfc out cl on only fans where are you room yeah dude in charging and being dude I'd be the number one only fans creator in fucking one day overnight I put that in my bio number one only fans creator bro you have some people so disappointed bro they clicked the low way dude I don't want to get better what better way to troll only fans people then become the number one creator talking about personal development man we should do it um no but like so on this on this Lloyd Austin stuff right so here's the real implications so you got Biden and Lloyd out okay for four to six days okay first first couple of days listen man it's irrelevant here's why do you really think these are the people running the country no do you really believe that those two old men who could barely function are running the country in any way shape or form honestly just figure it hold on dude real talk let us know in the comments do you really believe that these old senile people are calling the shots in this country or do you believe that someone else is pulling the strings because I don't believe they're calling the shots that's my opinion I don't think it matters if he's an intensive care for four days or fucking a hundred days or a thousand days I don't think it matters because they're not calling the shots look at Biden's head bro look at that side profile fucking head his brain has fucking already gone away his head yes his head is shrinking on the back there's no back of his head like that's not just weird head shape that's like his brains collapsed what this apple sauce what the fuck are they even talking about bro what are they talking about like imagine this conversation right here okay I'll be Austin you'll be Biden mr. president yes I have an elective surgery coming up oh good no more dicks for you I think we might jump on this this this new thing oh shit it'll help our poll numbers get you off we're better have a black trans man in our in our first black trans man first black trans everything everything's first yeah I'm the first I'm the how about I'm the first mother fucker get the job done about that you like that's my slogan dude when you guys fuck when I run for shit I'm gonna be the first mother fucker get the job done I love that's my fucking campaign slogan proved yes I love it well for cello fucking 2028 first MF where you get the job done how about that we all like the first how about that that's a good first I like it yeah it's stringy I like it bro I don't think any of these other people including Trump are gonna do what's required to fix this country I really don't all the way this is gonna take a cultural revolution of good-hearted patriotic Americans becoming the bad mother fuckers they've always supposed to have been yeah and then electing a leader from that group who is reprimanded yes that's what it's going to take it's going to these these old disgusting elderly fucking rich out of touch corrupt people are not gonna fix it dude no we better hope that it ain't Biden and that it is Trump so we can survive another fucking four years but after that bro it's gonna have to come from from a pool of patriots just to jump in on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think yeah I really want to know guys I really do who's pulling the street yes do you believe that these guys are calling the shots like do you believe that by him being in intensive care we're in somehow a more vulnerable position well how could we be more vulnerable our weapons are in Europe our strategic oil as low we have millions of invaders coming across the border we have ultimate division in the streets we have crime unprecedented rates we have ridiculous amounts of inflation we have more money printed in the last three years than has been printed fucking almost in the whole history the United States like what the fuck do you mean vulnerable like this one guy in the hospital because this fucking dick got infected somehow makes us more vulnerable you're fucking crazy dude we're already on a platter to be conquered yeah we're already there dude you should have said this clip guy infected well that could be true too who knows dude I just can't imagine being I just I just can't imagine it yeah I can't imagine my life being so fucking fucked up like I'd blow my brains out before I come off my dick like for real dude huh most of them usually do well that's a truth yeah that's a fucking statistical fact it's like 46% of trans people and then they say oh we'll have in the surgery is gonna make shit better well I don't know go ask the detransitioners that we're looking at that data because it doesn't dude it doesn't get any better and the problem is is that these people who I have real empathy for but not the activists I don't have any empathy for the activists of this I have empathy for the actual victims of this these young people are these these lonely people are these people who have never fit in who have been conditioned to believe that they will fit in if they do this drastic thing take hormones change their genitalia and all the sudden they'll fit in bro these people for whatever reason there's a there a lot of them are mentally fucking ill man and they're not getting real treatment of any sort a real treatment would be like hey dude come here look man I know you're different I know you're fucked up I know that you feel alone but here let's let's work on trying to fix some of these things so that you can be more functional in the real world bro like we live in this crazy world now this digital reality that isn't real that people get completely wrapped up in and they build their entire identity into this like phone and all of the shit and it's not even real life dude it's fucking fake shit and dude I just I don't know man like if you really care about people like like like these people like to say they do you know the the progressive left especially they love to fucking you know ride on the coattails of trans empathy if you really cared about those people bro you would get them real treatment not just say hey go get a surgery you know fix your whole life that's that that's what you do to people that you don't give fuck about like that like like think about this somebody comes to you with some real problems all right real problems and you're like man you know I don't know I would just do this why are you saying it like that because you don't get actually give a fuck and they're annoying to you they're annoying you and this is what happens to these trans people these trans people go to a therapist or they go to someone and they get seen two times and they're like you know what you should just look into having transition surgery and they're not doing that because they care they're doing that because it washes them of the responsibility of actually working with someone and actually having to care about someone and then also they get fucking financial bonuses for doing these surgeries so like dude it's very lucrative but like at the at the end of the day you know I sometimes people criticize me they're like you don't care about these people know actually I care a lot about people in general not these people are those people are white people are black people are gay people I care about people and if we are really going to care about people this would include treatment for mental illness and making people realize that they have something wrong with their perception of reality and trying to correct it not or if we have to maybe institutionalizing them until they figure it out or until we can work with them so they don't hurt themselves but like just say or somebody else yeah bro like who's doing all the fucking violence and all the shootings see dude they try to pin this shit on the fucking conservatives or right wing people when in reality bro these left wing fucking Marxist communist fucks in our school system and in media are conditioning the left the young left people to be radical violent people okay and that's reality the the violence is happening in society is not happening from conservatives conservatives are sitting on their hands bro conservatives are sitting regular people people who don't identify with left or right common sense people who also believe in America who believe in two A and conservative people and Republicans and all the people left or to the right of center they all have guns dude lots of them they own most of the guns those are not the people committing these crimes and what's what's interesting to me is that that's not being identified is that there's great restraint being shown by and by the way there needs to be okay there has to be hold on there needs to be I want to say this because people sometimes are like dude when are you going to get everybody organ out and look dude they're they're that's not what connect that you have to understand these people are waiting for a real violent insurrection a real one and that January 6th shit was just a warm up for how they're going to behave so if you were to recreate that scenario with actual guns and let's say instead of a million people was five million people their immediate reaction is going to be to unleash the military on those people kill as many of them as possible because they're all in one spot and then pull the rest out of society pull them out of their homes look at what they post look at what they say and and put those people in camps or prison or fucking get rid of them so that they don't have this problem anymore so any dumb fuck out there considering doing some sort of violent action you should rethink it because they've already thought of it they already understand that violence is a probability if they continue to push and their response is going to be to remove those people from society in prison murder kill capture whatever they've already shown this they have people sitting in solitary confinement with no trial for fucking four years now all right three years now that's why I was also so important for them to re re-resign the the surveillance state yeah but look dude this is their plan I'm telling you dude I am a strategy I am strategically intelligent when it comes to big picture shit that's why I'm able to see this two years ahead of everybody else that is the plan they are trying to instigate violence and what we need to give them instead is fucking unfuck withable unity between everybody okay and by the way unity is not everybody unity is 80% of people there's going to be 20% of people who are going to side with them there has to be unity amongst common sense Americans all right and we're not going to get every single person and that has to be understood but that unity and that non-compliance that non-reactivity is going to be what helps us win this this idea like a this idea of organized violence and all this shit dude that'll ruin America forever at least at this point in time now I'm not saying there won't come a time for that I'm not saying there's potentially an out of time for that but I'm telling you that between now and the election they're trying to instigate that so that we are able to be abused and killed and captured and imprisoned without any sort of trial or anything to remove resistance for them to stay in power that's what they're going to do and it's going to be done they're going to try to instigate it in a million different ways they're already marching this old disgusting piece of shit up here running commercials saying half the country is terrorist man they're doing it it's just January what do you think they're going to do for the next fucking nine months you know I'm saying they're going to 10 months they're going to run hard with that divisive message and dude I as long as nobody complies and like shows because the minute someone shows and does those things then they say look we told you and then they hammered out and by the way they have all the resources right now they have all the military they have a bunch of compliant military members because they use COVID and the jab to to wash out the military to wash out the police to transfer wealth from middle class to upper class to impoverished people they have intentionally weakened the nation as much as possible for them to maintain power and control their reality and I think the final step to that is going to be to instigate some sort of quote unquote revolutionary violence which we have to be smarter smart enough to not fall into and not walk into their trap you know in the meantime dude we build ourselves in the best versions of ourselves we hold the standard in our culture in our community we revive America one person at a time on the street and then hopefully we get in a situation where we get a chance in 2028 to fucking put a real leader in this country that's my opinion yeah guys gots our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads sex tape shock Jeffrey Epstein kept secret sex tapes of Prince Andrew Richard Branson and Bill Clinton until Doc's claim let's dive into this a little bit this is an interesting little little snippet that came up so Prince Andrew Richard Branson and Bill Clinton were all secretly filmed having sex by Jeffrey Epstein according to the latest batch of unsealed court dots one of the Epstein's victims Sarah Ransom claimed in the newly released files that the disgraced financier would film her quote unquote friend having sex with each of the high profile men Benny Johnson on Twitter released a screenshot of that court record we have it here in this entirety um and you can see in places uh as she talks about it first line will see spanked his penis on her bottom get spanked penis cut it off yeah sure that is a classic move though well do I call it penis spanking yeah what do you call that I call it knocking on the door oh oh fuck it's me all right uh it's me come with the back door back door for a door uh but yeah it's only reads uh when my quote when my friend had sexual intercourse with Clinton Prince Andrew and Richard Branson sex tapes were in fact filmed on each separate occasion by Jeffrey thank god she managed to get a hold of some footage of the filmed sex tapes which clearly identify the faces of Clinton Prince Andrew and Branson having sexual intercourse with her frustratingly enough Epstein was not seen in any of the footage but he was clever like that after two hours of trying to convince my friend to come forward with me I eventually managed to persuade her to send some of the video footage which she kept implicating all three men mentioned above I personally can confirm that I with my own two eyes seen the evidence of the sexual acts which clearly identifies Bill Clinton Prince Andrew Richard Branson having sexual intercourse with my friend I will be more than willing to swear under oath and testify in court over these sex tapes it will break your heart into a million tiny pieces more in when you watch this footage and I know that what I watched yesterday will haunt me for the rest of my life and she concludes it says unfortunately I cannot send you the footage without her consent due to massive consequences to her safety but I can confirm that I do have footage in my possession I have bagged up all the footage on several USB sticks and have securely sent them to various different locations throughout Europe with only one other person close to me knowing where their locations are just in case anything happens to me before the footage is released now the allegations the article continues comes as part of an ongoing document dump of legal files from Epstein victim Virginia Gufreys 2015 defamation case against the Pito's alleged Madame Galein Maxwell the 17 unsealed files containing over 100 newly unsealed pages about Epstein's sex crimes and associates are the fourth batch since the first release last Wednesday now Prince Andrew and Clinton have always strongly denied any allegations of wrongdoing over their relationship with Epstein and a new statement Branson dubbed the newly seen claims as baseless now Trump who has not been accused of anything up until now dubbed the new claims as simply false because there's also an accusation of that coming out against Trump now it should be noted and mentioned that all of this testimony this specific letter this has all been recused essentially the victim chose to self-redact and pull out and withdraw and there has been no evidence of any of these saves existing at all and she recanted on all of her statements but that doesn't stop that doesn't stop certain people from spreading the misinformation this headline reads mark ruffalo gives tepid apology for sharing fake AI generated Trump photos blames Elon Musk this false people blame everybody but themselves all time but themselves man left wing actor mark ruffalo was caught this week sharing doctored AI generated images of former president Donald Trump as a passenger headed to Jeffrey Epstein's Pito Island days later he admitted they were fake images yet instead of taking full accountability for his gullibility the disney marvel star blamed elan musk's ownership of twitter x so here's the original tweet that went out by Denise Wheeler she tweets out Trump headed to Epstein Island two different flights two different groups of little girls not as daughters not as nieces not something republicans even care about he can rape steel try to overthrow the government this is their american dream or this chick should be in jail for what she's saying like this is fake shit classic make somebody that's correct bare minimum somebody fucking made these images probably her okay go back and she writes he can rape been debunked okay you have this woman who's still this rape trial still going on in New York do you know what she said the other day there was never any physical contact but it's still hurt my feelings yeah yeah vert it was verbal rape okay this is people don't understand this because they hate Trump so bad because and by the way I'm no fucking Trump cult motherfucker like there's a problem over there with a lot of the people who just are okay with everything he does I'm not okay with everything he does but he's the best choice right now okay outside of what we have the opportunity to choose from all right the vague is not going to get a shot fucking nobody else can do it all right that's reality it's going to be Trump he's going to be the guy that we could potentially pick and that's it that's what it is so these people are taking these cases of you know the rape allegations they're misrepresenting that in the media heavily like if the court system had any legitimacy to it whatsoever Trump will be able to get like 50 billion fucking dollars for the lies that they've told about him you know the image is done yeah bro you have this person here taking fucking AI and posting it on Twitter like it's a fucking fact okay go back to that what she said try to overthrow the government that's already been debunked a thousand different ways by anybody who has common sense bro so Rogan has Jim Gaffigan on school in him on January 6th basically saying and by the way the shim gaffigans a mega live okay fucking hates Trump and they have this interesting conversation this is one of the reasons I like Joe so much because he's so much better at this like if that were me in me in this dude I would just be destroying him you're a fucking idiot I don't have the ability to like to like to have a conversation how he does and uh so he's they're having this conversation and he's like the guy's like trying to make all these fucking ridiculous points about J6 and all this shit and Rogan's basically like saying no dude uh like you were talking to one of your little friends be like hey you know bro uh they had the FBI in the crowd and there was he started to explain all these things and like dude anybody who's like at the end of it Gaffigan didn't know what to say because like he's being it's being exposed and it's like knows what's being told to correct dude and and then he comes out I think last night and fucking gross these people for being pedophiles in front of the TV what what you're gonna see is starting rats starting to jump off the shit are people who not wanting to be associated with Hollywood bro because they're realizing there's a lot of truth to this pedophile shit at at the high level of uh quote unquote elitists in this country and anyway go back to the tweet you got this woman saying he raped binda bunk that's bullshit over throw government that's bullshit too if Trump would have said hey fucking come and bring your guns bro everybody would have went and brought their guns real talk that would have happened okay and he didn't do that and in fact he called for peace the minute he thought that it was gonna get out of control he called for it on top of that he fucking asked for 20,000 fucking troops at Nancy Pelosi declined exactly okay like we go on and on and on this idea that all these police officers were killed as a lie this is a flat out fucking lie okay so these people this this Denise Wheeler here is making these people are so biased bro and dude here's the pro this is a big problem because there's a lot of people who are like I think of all the people who hate a Trump four years ago that don't anymore yeah that you know and I know a lot dude okay and the reason that these people continue to pour on these lies is because they understand that the more they get people to hate Trump the Trump delusion or whatever they call it derangements syndrome is a real thing like when you form an opinion about someone and that opinion is very strong it's very hard to like be like wait wait the opposite of all that is actually true right you see what I'm saying that's a hard bridge to cross when you've already made up your mind and so this person who's clearly making up totalized to the point of manufacturing images for people to look at has nothing to do with Trump that is manip that's that is a fucking like subversive revolutionary act like that's total propaganda and a lie and the media is participating in it and that's why you have so many people that are like well you know yeah Biden sucks but you know Trump's not any better like dude what are you talking about exactly what are you talking about why do you think that and if you ask them why they think that they will rattle off all of these things that have been debunked they will start with Russia collusion they will start he fucking over he hijacked it broke no he said they're good people on both sides of the Charlottesville uh go listen to the whole clip you see what I'm saying like we go on and on and on at every single point that these people make about them is invalid now are there points to criticize them on for sure are there put like the facts like how he was about the vaccine is unacceptable to me that's fucking bullshit okay and by the way I do give him a little bit of a little bit of grace there because the entire world was aimed at him it was an election year every single media outlet told him that this shit was real his fucking main advisor Fauci was the perpetrator of this entire thing he is telling them looking them in the fucking eye saying you better do this or they're gonna fucking die okay so he didn't know and all the people he had around him we're telling him that this was real and people were gonna die and we better do this and so you have to understand there is like there is other things than just saying oh he's a vaccine salesman you know what I'm saying now now now I wish you'd handle it differently but he didn't yeah I even now knowing where it is you could still come out I'm like all right yeah I fucked up on that one I think that's what I think that's where Trump's really missing the boat yeah I think if Trump were to come out and say look all these people were saying all these things the people I trusted the people who I never thought in a million who would who would manufacture a pandemic who would who would do this who like how like if I had my most trusted people that all came to me and they all look me in the eye and say bro if you don't make this decision these people are gonna fucking die you know what I'm saying like people will take that into account you know why people don't take that into any account is because they've never been in a leadership role no they've never let an organization hold on most people the most leadership they've ever had is like leading a fast food fucking chain okay like they worked up to assistant manager at McDonald's or some shit when you lead a big organization you cannot see the front line you cannot see the left line or the right line or the line behind you can't see shit okay you're relying on all the people around you to tell you the truth and the decisions that you make have real consequences okay so I know this because I run companies that employ over a thousand people directly and thousands and thousands of people indirectly all right so I know what the fuck this is about and dude if my people came to me and they look me in a fucking eye and they said bro if you don't do this these motherfuckers are gonna die I'm doing it because I trust them yeah and that's and that's what he's guilty of he's guilty of trusting the wrong people that's my take knowing what I know from the life I've lived in the perspective I have I think he made a wrong decision I love things the country should have never been shut down these things he should have stood in the way of these things but remember how he stood in the way of these things they would have continued to pump the data and pump the stats and run the fucking death tracker and people would have fucking lost their mother fucking minds because they did anyway you know so you know you have a lot of people because of people like Denise Wheeler here who are totally fucking brainwashed about a lot of the things this guy did now if you're an educated person and you know let's say you're not for them because of the vaccine shit I fucking I will say okay that makes sense to me you see what I'm saying but like these don't even know J6 bull crap no don't feed me this fucking narrative shit if there's reasons you don't like him like for example like a lot of people don't like him because you know he takes money from these bigger companies he says he's not gonna take money from yeah okay that's a fair argument but I mean you can just look at these fucking pictures and like come on I mean bro he he may share it right so he so he tweeted it out he says oh there's still more more more here well I was just like I wanted to read his tweet he says he tweeted out Mark Ruffel tweeted out quote gross hashtag MAGO once to paint everyone on those flights as pedophiles except the one guy who smiles in a group of young girls all headed to Epstein's fantasy island with him my bet is there are some decent Republicans left in America that may think that this is going too far well my bet is do you now agree that your parties full of fucking pedophiles motherfucker after you called him a pedophile and it shows that he's not true so let what does Mark Ruffel think today right okay so you're you were all fucking you had a big old fucking Hulk boner over fucking uh that'll trump being a pedophile right okay but now you find out that he's not and you think that those people that are all gross so now who do you stand with now what you see what I'm saying I'll tell you this though I do have a whole different uh different understanding of virgin mobile well here's the other thing though we got to be real about this she recanted those accusations right so like we can't sit here and say oh that in this case Clinton uh what Trump's good but everybody else is correct no no pressure bro this witness is until someone comes out and says here is the evidence there's a video this is the videos this is what's up I don't believe any of these people because I believe there's a lot of political motivation I mean dude look they could go pay people to say shit who knows what the fuck they're doing people could be terrified to tell the truth we there's so many things until the actual evidence comes out we're not gonna know because if we have a situation where uh let's say all of them are getting exposed of course they're gonna try to flood Trump into it too somehow someone yeah and that's what we're starting to see and so like dude you know we don't know but but to be fair we can't sit here and say oh well she's lying just about Trump no she she she's lying about Trump she's lying about all of them most likely exactly so well I think that's the thing too I'm like you know and since you know since the time of this recording you know there has been a very big push because here's what people don't understand the FBI did raid that New York uh that man had in townhouse that Epstein had he raided it yep they confiscated everything that was there yeah they got it dude they have exactly all they have all the fucking proof my fucker they had it while it was going on and here is this hold on they had it while it was going on no doubt no doubt but here is my like my sense of proof how I look at this situation if Trump really was implicated in that that shit would have been out of course release that of course so why aren't they releasing it then well they do you see what I'm saying hold on now that's another point that we could consider here they might not be releasing it because it does implicate those guys and there are tapes of that and maybe there's not a tape tape of Trump that's what I'm saying like if they're truly if truly they have those tapes release it so maybe there are tapes of the other three and not not Trump release it yeah I do look there's there's we this is what I said last week we have to have full disclosure for us to ever trust our government ever again release it like because I'm talking about full disclosure I'm talking about who shot JFK who planned it who did it why I'm talking about everything what have we mixed black like yeah yeah bro all of it all needs to come out we need to know where we stand we need to know the truth because once we know the truth then we can move forward from there but these people take it upon themselves to be the gate keepers of information and to be the gatekeepers of what we can and can't know and dude because of that we don't believe anything and that's how they want it they want us to be totally confused what's easier control someone who walks into a room with the light on and you can see all the details and or someone who rocks in a pitch black moot room and kind of like fumbles around yeah then you just go over to loudspeaker say left left right like you could control them really easy when they don't know what the fuck's going on and that's what we're dealing with here in society we're dealing with people who understand that control starts with fear and and lack of information and the way that you create more fears by reducing the amount of information they have access to so you know that's what I'm dividing them along you know racial lines what better way to get Trump out the fucking race than to drop the actual evidence that would end it because bro I'm not standing for Trump if he's involved with this shit I agree it would end it yeah so release it yeah well they would if they had it that's my point yeah that's my point that's all I'm saying they would throw they would throw those two other dudes under the bus okay you get him out yeah Bill Clinton's a fucking idiot these guys all think Bill Clinton's a moron yeah they don't like Bill Clinton no they don't like Hillary Clinton either but she's a fucking tyrant with a lot of shit on everybody okay and they think Bill Clinton's like literally like the town idiot they they they don't care about Richard Branson hmm they don't they don't fucking care about Prince Andrew if this if they really have this on Trump dude they would put it out it would be him I brought it up because they would sacrifice those three people in order to get him out of the race to save their democracy no question that that's just my take man I think you're right man you know so guys guys tell us what you guys think jump down in the comments let us know what you guys take is on this so I was a third and final headline it is time for our final segment of the show as always thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where we bring a headline in we talk about it or get one of those two options and we gotta talk about a flopper you know the flopper is Andy I mean I do I've down most people do we gotta talk about hmm I'm gonna be talking about the same thing you probably don't know what one is yeah he didn't know what the knock knock words that's not what I call it wait wait wait wait wait you call it huh what do you what do you call it I can't say I can't say hey man self-sensorship that's a form of a weapon bro yeah yeah I'm using it effectively our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads Eagles punter caught in mid-flop my Giants defender this is just great I think it's I think it's great um so this uh this is a Yahoo sports article reading yeah as any soccer player can tell you the art of flopping is a delicate one flop too much and just get laughed at flop too little and you won't draw the flag you're seeking worst of all getting caught mid-flop that's just cringe worthy for everyone involved Philadelphia Eagles punter braiden man attempted to get a little theatrical on Sunday afternoon uh and it was a wise idea backed up almost at his own in zone but you can't do a full-on flop if you can't hit the turf and the Giants can brown made sure that man's act never hit Broadway uh you can see man beginning the arm world when brown first hits him uh and if brown hat and grab man around the waist this would have been a roughing the punter flag but the official standing right at the goal line just looks on and passively the flag remaining firmly unthrowed Philadelphia struggled mightily against the Giants in the first half going down 24 to zero and looking utterly unlike the team that had posted the 10-1 record who the fuck writes these I don't know so it's not bro y'all really know how to fucking right yeah it's difficult so you guys think it's just me not be able to know it ain't they're fucking idiots you heard it really unlike like you heard it here first on really yeah it's not just DJ's grammar um but yeah here's the clip fun braiding man he's getting rushed there it looks like he wants to do the flop try to get him brown and I'm gonna do it am I gonna do what am I maybe that's pretty funny dude wait wait wait what's he that's pretty funny he's getting rushed there he did get hit yeah he's gonna do the flop he's got a flop can brown and I'm gonna do it if he hadn't tried to do that they probably would have flagged it would have flagged him yeah because he did get hit you got hit pretty hard yeah but he's see this what happens when you act like an asshole so look at this a bigger I'm saying this break you kind of look like a guy that wants to flop like he looks like he would want to flop man like look at look at this guy he's flopping on you how is this guy in the NFL man bro how do you how do your hair to look like that why weren't I helmet bro listen all I know hold on dude go back to the other one like how do you get hair like that I'm like how do you do that with a helmet shit bro you're a fucking punter you don't you don't even like you still got to put a helmet on yeah for two minutes out of a fucking two-hour game but your hair don't go back like that yeah I don't know man bro this is weird I know this first of all that kind of looks 10 years old how old is this here he looks like this is this is slave labor potentially it's fucking child labor bro that's the oldest youngest man I've never seen that's so weird yeah he looks like he's ruined a few Xbox controllers I got no comment I don't know what this this guy looks like he could have done that or he could be like a legit serial killer oh I see yeah like a American psychos done I don't think you fuck with this guy this guy this guy cut off your dick without you wanting it you should have called LeBron for a little help yeah yeah you're on those out of flop yeah but see LeBron's a big dude bro that's a pretty good one and what we got on this yeah I say thumbs up to the official for not flagging it yeah not falling not letting the sport get even more pacified yeah that's real it's a good no call yeah I agree what we call there and for the season these guys have had that's a big deal yeah it is yeah this braiding stop fucking flopping yeah bro but tell me your secret of the hair haha dude listen we're gonna talk though this okay thumbs up to the officials here first one I'll ever give you guys all right guys suck they fucking do man they think that everybody's watching these did you see that fucking Detroit Lions game a few weeks ago where they ran that two-point conversion they fucking got it called back to call it back yeah when the motherfuckers went straight up to him and fucking informed that he was yeah I saw that bro that was insane it changed the outcome of the game 100% yeah they they're not doing a they're not gonna be able to I know to play off they got they got punished yeah well they should be fired like real talk dude like these people think they're the the reason people watch you know like people hate you guys but like dude what you know real talk getting back to this shit about what's going on you know people have to realize man you know this isn't gonna get better without unity this isn't going to improve you're not going to be you're not going like there's no they're they're trying to instigate violence they're trying to instigate division the only solution for us to fixing what's going on this year is going to be like unity and legit non-compliance like whatever shit they come through or whatever they tell us or however they try to divide us we can't emotionally react we can't start these you know movements on the internet and all this shit for the next thing they're gonna try the next thing is coming very soon um you know people got to be smarter dude or otherwise they're gonna get what they want they're gonna maintain power so you know I get a lot of you guys hitting me up or saying shit in the comments and stuff talking about we need a leader to fucking revolution look dude the revolution is within you it's in your house it's in your life it's how you live it's a standards you hold it's the example you set right now American men for the most part or a bunch of fucking fat donut eating lazy motherfuckers okay we're not the bad motherfuckers that we used to be all right that's real talk for most of us okay and I say us not because I'm that way but because I'm part of us and for us to improve and us to get better it's going to take personal responsibility at an individual level especially amongst the men in this country to get their shit together all right that's the first step if you set that standard for the next four years and we will create this culture of what America should be through unity and the pursuit of excellence and holding higher standards and doing the right thing in community then we put someone in there from from from that culture okay and that's that culture can get so big bro because inherently that's what America was founded on America's had the strongest culture of nationalism in the history of probably and probably the last one thousand two thousand years people are fanatical about being American when America is right and dude we have to start living that like legitimately living it legitimately being it legitimately standing for it in our fucking house in our careers in our life and once that happens then things will start to change okay but this idea that a bunch of fucking people are gonna do violent like dude you're gonna fuck up the whole thing for everybody and you're gonna end up dead or in jail for the rest of your life and they're gonna you're gonna guarantee that they fucking win yeah so like unity mass civil disobedience tell them no stand for what you believe do not do things that you don't believe in and those two things will get us across the line at some way shape or form my opinion what do you think yeah I say you allowed man like we're talking about when we yeah that's another thing gotta use your voice use your voice speak the truth when you when you see BS like that is it's super important because like that that's gonna be if if if you silence yourself I mean we talk about you know self-sensorship and you know we we talk about plenty of times but it's at a point now where you cannot allow bullshit to cross your face and you don't you don't call it out for what it is yeah it's impossible I don't care what it is whether you see it on Instagram you see it on wherever in life and like that's the real piece yeah in public yeah calling out and it doesn't have to be this big fucking no dude I got tagged in a story this weekend from a guy who was being cool and it was very nice thing for him to say but he said Andy's unapologetic unapologetic nature of calling bullshit on all this stuff going on in the world is super inspiring it courageous and impressive or some other shit and I you know the thing that you guys got to understand is that it's not courage it's necessity like do you really think that I want to come on here after I spent my whole entire life building companies and building myself from someone who was very poor to someone who's pretty fucking well off don't you think I'd rather be enjoying those things I don't do this because it's I care about social media or likes or clicks or shares or fucking any of this shit I do this because if we don't do this what we're going like he said what are the things he said the thing with with so much on the line to lose what dude you all have just as much lose if I have not more because I've already experienced the American dream and a lot of you haven't you have a lot more to lose than me and by staying silent you're guaranteeing a loss so like we don't have a choice there is no choice here it's not about courage it's about what actually has to be done and people have to come to that understanding if you don't speak up we're going to lose and we're not just going to lose an election we're going to lose our way of life forever and that means the American dream that you may or may not be pursuing is going to be non-existent not just for you which it might be okay with you but for your kids for your grandchildren for people that you care about who actually give a fuck about building something in this country that's going to be gone and dude you know people have started understanding this is not about courage this is about we don't have a choice we don't have a choice but to use our voice we don't have a choice but to stand up we don't have a choice but to unify and if we fail those things America will cease to exist and that's the truth that's why I do this that's why I speak out that's why I say what I say that's why a lot of other people do it too a lot of other people do it because they've never had attention to success and that's their way of success but there is a core group of people that actually give a fuck about the future of this country and if you're one of those people a vote is not going to do it you voting is not going to do it you're going to have to live the standard you're going to have to be what you believe an excellent American fucking looks like and you're going to have to live that day in and day out which requires work which is why so many people are so quick to defer responsibility onto an elected official or a Hollywood icon or some sort of other person know it's you and unless you take that responsibility seriously do this country's going to cease to exist so quit thinking it's courage and start realizing it's lack of option that's why I'm I recognize this if you guys have listened to the show for any amount of time you know that I've been at least a year probably two years ahead three years ahead on fucking everything I've said and I'm telling you right now the way I see this and the way I look at it we don't have a choice to be quiet anymore if we're quiet any longer they're going to silence us forever we won't be able to do shit so people should think about that you know it's not it's not about someone else fixing it it's a this is the this is the fucking thing they've sold everybody they've sold everybody the idea that the white knight in shining armor the big brother the government can come in and fix your life that's not reality the government no matter who doesn't matter who's elected is going to fix your actual life in your house that's a huge job and because they've convinced everybody that it's some savior everybody's deferring responsibility onto somebody else or blaming it on something else instead of saying no dude I'm an American citizen I have a standard to uphold that's what being a citizen of this country is about lots of people have died for that lots of people have bled for that lots of people have have sacrificed for that and by me living less than what I'm supposed to live I'm failing all of those sacrifices and you may not care about those but there's a lot of people that do I'm one of them and if you care about them too and you're not living the standard full shit you're part of the problem well guys 80 oh god don't be a hoe try the show count it millions in the cold bad bitch who did slow got a own bank row can't fold does a no head shot case close
