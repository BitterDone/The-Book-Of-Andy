It is it is why like I've had a you know for the last three weeks Really like the last five weeks because right after the election I kind of got disconnected I was like fuck all right. I'm tired.

Have you seen it? Who in Canada in Canada now all brought hold on This is Elizabeth May as her name um, this was her response to Canada becoming the 51st State of the United States So no, no, sorry and I really also take offense sorry mr. Trump took offense to your idea That Pierre Paulie have wasn't good enough to leave the conservatives Wayne Gretzky. I mean, he's great. He is the great one He skates to where the puck is going. It's not going to mega The puck is on a Canadian ice rink and by the way mr. Trump Please before making public pronouncements that Wayne Gretzky should run for prime minister Give yourself or get yourself a briefing on the nature of parliamentary democracy a west mr parliamentary system in a constitutional monarchy where no one runs for prime minister We have elections for members of parliament We don't get to pick and choose among our billionaire friends for who gets to see the cabinet table if they're not an elected member of parliament Well, Canadian system is different from that of the United States America I suggest that mr. Trump find one of his grandchildren schoolbooks and look at the year 1776 which makes plan if you think to him about why our systems of government are different I don't want to belittle mr. Trump, but on the other hand Hey, don't have we got a deal for you you think we want to be the 51state. Yeah, but maybe california would like to be the 11th province How about it? california Oregon Washington yours you've got geography and common goes and now like that we've already got a carbon trading system between california and Quebec We've got some strong alliances on our west coast from british Columbia There's been a lot of academic papers on the idea of cascadia So california governor in new summon Washington state jay insley and newly elected governor of orric and teen at cotec help out it Want to put a referendum to your citizens because this is what you deal have we got to deal for you This is what you get free health care Universal free health care no more one-year-olds who suddenly fall off the medicate list and their parents are in the news Because they're trying to do a go-fun me so they can get their daughter to a doctor Oh I want you to take the whole time was no I think I'll deal for you Fuck you could have california Yeah, I give you 1.5 of the ship all the fucking immigrants to california and they can join canada Listen, I'll be honest. I Don't think is there really no let me be honest. How do these stupid motherfuckers get their way into the government How does this happen? We're supposed to have the best and brightest people lead our countries Not the dumbest and fattest and most fucking annoying people with their fucking purple glasses Like holy shit man It's every country it is it's every guy you know why because everybody else who's got brains and everybody else who has ability and skill and talent They're out in the country trying to make fucking money. They're trying to be rich. They're trying to build shit Because you know what you could say whatever you want but fucking life's a lot better on the back of a fucking yacht And everybody's trying to get there. I want to get holy shit man Then it leaves these people to talk about money. Yeah, man. That's sad because it's great It's crazy. You go to fucking canada. They take more of your money And then you got to deal with bullshit. You can't have no guns. Can't have any fun But here's some maple syrup. Yeah People are nice. Are they nice? Oh, yeah, bro. They're so polite. How they nice? Listen man That's Canada's problem is they're too nice too nice. They're too fucking nice and they let these fucking morons walk all over them Canada is a great country. It is beautiful. The people are amazing. Everything's amazing, but they're so passive That they allow these fucking tyrants to come in and fucking step all over them. I have nothing against the Canadian people I love the Canadian people. Yeah, I think the fucking Canada is one of the most and it is It's not even I think it's one of the most beautiful Countries on the planet. Okay with some of the best people on the planet and they're all they all have You know how we were in Colorado everybody's kind of like staring at me. Yeah besides that um They really did they did bro. Yeah, listen, I like bro. You know how like everybody That's American in Colorado is like, uh, you know go with the flow. They're kind of like that's how can the Canadian people are they're kind of like It's alright dude. We're having a good day and today's great You know they're living in the moment. They're good people But they get walked over by these fucking communist fucks like Trudeau and this lady and all this shit And you know what dude real talk. I hope Trump does fucking go in there and fucking make him part of our country because those people deserve better Well, not only that I mean this point though on the whole thing Is that we spend a shit ton of money protecting Canada. Yeah, you know, I'm saying like like I'm not talking like a couple of million a couple of billion like hundreds of billions Um, there's a lot of money that goes uh that Partnership and we getting nothing out of it might as well just take it over that's my thing I feel like especially when it comes to wars and shit bro. We do any war. We need to take over that country Like actually conquer it make that a territory and like keep it moving instead of well the fact that they I mean look I can't believe we're talking about this but like real talk the fact that there's such a fucking close ally to China It makes sense to that because they are fucking super aligned with zishi ping and if you go to van kubobro It's like a lot a lot of Chinese Nationals that live there and like bro. I don't have a problem with Chinese people I have a problem with the Chinese government. Yeah, right? Most of the Chinese people who live here are not fans of the fucking no Chinese government. That's why there's a lot of it. Yeah, but uh But they're they're so aligned that it does create a strategic soft point for Our quote unquote enemies to have access to our country and that's that's okay. They're right there. Yeah, bro I mean there's an argument to be made for that and you know if I was going to put my best and brightest on TV to speak to Donald Trump About why that's not a good idea. I would certainly have chosen somebody other than this fucking whale Oh shit guys jump it on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. I was that being said. Why do they always got fucking color glasses? Why is this always pink or red or blue or purple or some fucking stupid ass color glasses? Why is that? I don't know. Have you ever seen a conservative person where fucking those color easy colors? Yes No, they just get some fucking simple glasses that look nice. Yeah, they don't got to draw extra attention to their fucking ugly face That's what you know, I'm saying that's exactly what it is Listen, I look here not here. Listen, 2025 It's going to be full savage. Okay. Okay full savage unrelenting Real AF and then we're gonna have MSEO project, you know to teach you motherfuckers how to win We're gonna make winning great again, and we're gonna make truth great again And we're gonna make the true savages fuck and we're gonna make winning savages fuck Period, so keep an eye out for that.

He's not number two a little bit more on Canada. This was interesting Um, a little transition here. Um, do you see uh, Trudeau he resigned? I Did see that yeah, he's out. You can't fire me. I quit That's basically what he did because I mean they were right there Um, interesting uh, it was interesting how it went though I mean because they've been talking about this for a couple of weeks now that he was gonna be stepping down Um, but yeah, Justin Justin Trudeau Announced Monday that he is resigning after nearly a decade in office following mounting calls for him to step down And quote internal battles within his own left party the 53 year old who has been in power since 2015 Says uh, said he plans to stay on his post until uh, his ruling Liberal party chooses a replacement says quote I'm a fighter and I'm not someone who backs away from a fight particularly when a fight is As important as this um, and with that I resigned No shit I mean, I mean this was interesting uh, I became out of left field um, it'll be interesting to see what Canada does if there's gonna be any you know Crazy things that they decide to do um, you know, we're up until his actual departure date You know and maybe if he's taken a plan out of Biden's playbook We probably would see some stuff like that because Biden's been doing some weird shit Um, President Biden he bestows final presidential medal of freedom. So you see this I mean, it was a definitely an interesting list President Joe Biden on Saturday bestowed the presidential medal of freedom on 19 recipients his last opportunity to give out The nation's highest civilian honor ahead of his upcoming exit from the White House quote You're leaving an incredible mark on our country with insight and influence that can be felt around the globe by Instead of the White House ceremony now here's a full list um Of all of the uh the people that uh, he gave metal of freedoms uh, medals of freedom to Jose Andres bono is that the guy from you to yeah bano bano Then he just he that's not something something he just like saved a dude on the bridge or some shit like that um, I don't know Um, a couple people Hillary Hillary Rodham Clinton. That's a big name on there Michael J Fox Um, Robert F Kennedy You know, you got Bill neither science guy Uh, George Romney Rubenstein you got some George Soros look at that. I mean Listen dude Can I be real? Yeah, I thought like all right That'd be cool to win the the metal of freedom for the service that like you do to the country like as a civilian But the fact that Hillary Clinton got one and the fact that George Soros got one I would never ever ever let that shit touch my fucking body as long as I fucking live Yeah, because it's stained to know it is It's fucking completely corrupted and it makes me wonder if they are legitimately trying to ruin Remember when they let Lizzo play the fucking crystal flute. Yeah remember Thomas Jefferson's yeah, right. It's just like they're trying to Take away the meaning still Of every single important symbolic gesture or award or Recognition that we have as Americans and the fact that fucking George Soros got a metal of freedom after the destruction that he's created in this country After the immigration mass that he's created in this country after the crime mass that he's created in this country Fuck that Okay, that's how I feel oh Hillary Clinton been guzzied. I mean like bro the list goes on and on it's these are fuck these people in my opinion Our literal fucking traders and tyrants and the fact that they I mean, I don't know like I Wouldn't even if I was on that list with them. I wouldn't even show the fuck up. No No, I think I think George didn't George George Soros wasn't there. He had somebody else receiving in this place. Yeah But it does feel like that though. It feels like you know, I think also to this will be the play because obviously I think what Trump coming in you know There's been speculations and talks about what he's gonna do as far as the accountability part on you know, so you know who should get freedom metals People who fought and stood up during COVID and risk everything they had and fucking lost the shit that they had for standing up Those people should be getting freedom metals that shouldn't be celebrities or movie stars or fucking You know no offense to messy because I love messy, but like you know, what the fuck did you do for America bro? You know, I'm saying yeah like how about these people who fucking lost their careers and lost their families and lost their Their jobs and because they weren't willing to bend to tyrants. How about those people winning metals of freedom? How about people how about people that fucking like Did things for America not just fucking like this? That destroyed it. Yeah, I mean start there. I think part of that too is like you know if if there were to be some indictments that come down Of trees and in this edition. Oh, but you know she received the metal of freedom It was you know like maybe it's just a way to protect it. I don't know Did you see the video clip of her getting it? Yeah, yeah fucking huge ass fucking stupid head. Yeah, watch this Yeah That's accurate That's fucking accurate bro Bro, hey, I was getting wild. Hey, I was getting fucking wild. I don't know that's fucking accurate. It is Uh, but I mean you know, so whether it be the metal of freedom, you know, uh, is his last ditch Uh, things he's doing while he's in office. She's gonna go to hell dude. Oh for sure. He's going to burn in fucking hell for sure Oh So probably like it, I'm gonna be honest You know, came from But the uh, you know the other things that he's also doing too that that definitely have some some big implications Um, I don't know if you saw this but he's he's blocking All the new offshore drilling along most of the US coastline Um, what for two weeks. Yeah, exactly exactly. He's just like I mean, it's just dumb stuff the shit Petty shit, man. Yeah But uh, to the tune of 625 million acres of coastline Um, from future oil and gas drilling And then he also blocked this big deal between US steel and nip on They're having to sue the Biden administration over this um, you know, it's just like he's doing all of these crazy things Trump say that he was gonna do the same thing though. Well, I blocked that cell. Yeah, but for tariff reasons But he's doing it for a little bit different of a reason Um, you know, but this was Trump's response all of this to check this out done I see it just came over that Biden is banned oil oil and gas drilling across 625 million acres of US coastal territory. Look, it's ridiculous. I'll unbend it immediately I will unbend it. I have the right to unbend it immediately. What's he doing? Why is he doing it? You know, we have something that nobody else has. I mean, nobody has to the extent we have it and It'll be more by the time we finish because I'll be able to expand you know, we're gonna expand our country And it'll be more We have oil and gas and Whether you manufacture widgets or widgets or whatever you happen to be doing some countries have to work very hard to do that We do too and we will but we have oil and gas at a level that nobody else has And we're gonna take advantage of it and when I see somebody saying he's gonna ban 625 million acres. He doesn't know what that is. He doesn't even know what 625 million acres would look like And we can't let that happen to our country. So great. It's really our greatest economic asset And we're not gonna let that happen to our country Yeah, drill baby drill He's always talking shit. I know I love it. It's just like oh yeah, like it doesn't matter how serious What's fucking cool is that now people are with it You know when he was talking this crazy shit means we yeah people look good. He's fucking so unpr presidential Now they're like Because dude we all saw it slipping away And so like you know in a weird way And I don't like this because it really did hurt so many people You know so many You know middle class families so I mean look fuck dude everybody everybody felt the economic impact no matter what level you were at If you own a business you felt it in your sales if you were a middle class family you saw it in your fucking paycheck Everybody's been hurt by this administration and everybody's ready to get back to fucking winning at a at a high level And on a personal level. You know one of the greatest things that this is that that I think this is caused is it's It's uh brought to the surface The ambition and drive and hunger of the American citizen especially The young American citizen where they're like fuck yeah, I want to become wealthy out because I don't want to deal with this shit No, you know i'm saying and I think we are on the cusp of one of the greatest resurgence of American Culture in terms of what America has always been supposed to be right the pursuit of the American dream the pursuit of wealth the pursuit of freedom the pursuit of happiness These things are coming to the surface again on an individual level which is very exciting though It gets me excited, okay, because when I started podcasting in 2015 I saw this happening That's why I started podcasting. I saw the ambition sort of falling off And that scared me because I Understand how important it is to build wealth to become financially successful. I understand that the degree At which it affects not only your life, but also the lives of the people around you and how important it is because like dude Just through my journey. I've seen so many people I mean dude thousands and thousands and thousands of people Be inspired and then go create their own journey And if we want this country to be great, that's what it's gonna take It's gonna take an individual's deciding that I am going to be Representative of the American dream to every single person around me I'm going to be the dream. I'm going to be the one that people say there he is dude That's him that's the guy that started with not very much and built all of these things and because he did it I can do it too and when people decide to do that bro the culture rises and I see that happening. Yeah, I see at least The hunger and the hope and the drive coming back and do that excites me man Well do what it was is I think it put us in a put a lot of people on the personal note you're talking about They put a lot of people in the position to realize that like You can't save your way through a bad economic situation. You got to make more of fucking money. Yeah You know i'm saying it's like that's like bro. They lit some fires for sure Yeah, and it's great. Yeah, like dude. We have all these Gen Z men especially And no no no shade of the women, but We have a lot of Gen Z men who are like I'm going to fucking be rich. Yeah, I'm going to be wealthy I'm going to dedicate my 20s to building That shit is awesome dude love it or hate it. I'm going to do it. Yes And that is what's going to turn the country around because as these young men Become into their 30s and they're you know, they become millionaires and multi-millionaires All their family all their friends all their old network They see it dude and maybe they don't become millionaires Maybe they don't become multi-millionaires, but maybe they just get their shit together a little bit more Maybe they hold themselves to a little bit higher standard and all of those little things create the American culture Right, so that's exciting to me bro because I love that aspect of this country. I love the fact that somebody like me And millions of other people can think of something in their brain And actually go make it into reality and like that doesn't exist everywhere in the world bro That's why so many people want to come here and if we had gone another four years with what they want That would go away And so it's exciting to me because I realize oh, we have this four-year window to really fucking and dude I can tell you for the next four years dude. I'm going to pour my my entire Being in to help in these young people fucking figure out how to fucking win. Yeah, it's gonna I can't wait dude because that's really what I like to talk about. Yeah dude. It's gonna be fucking awesome But I mean like I said we still got you know roughly a little bit under two weeks ago before He's fully inaugurated in And so you know he's still doing some other rich. I don't know if you saw this this got released Biden administration secretly releases 11 alkydell linked prisoners Including two former bodyguards for some have been lied and from Guantanamo Bay Um, so he's just still like doing this like Unhinged shit that just makes zero fucking sense man because he's getting paid to do it. Yeah He has been paid to do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so feel that promise You know I'm saying um, it's just crazy man, but in light of all of this there's still some big things that are happening that I think are beneficial Potentially um one of those big developments. It also just came out Mark Zuckerberg Facebook's getting some some talk meta Mark Zuckerberg promises less censorship on Facebook as he scraps bias third-party fact checkers. You see this? I mean yeah, I got it sent to me a bunch of times today, but you know, let's see what he has to say. Yeah, I mean It's interesting Mark Zuckerberg has announced major changes to meta's content moderation policies and practices on Facebook Instagram Siding a desire to embrace free speech and avoid censorship Zuckerberg changes Begin with scrapping Facebook's third-party Fact check system which is notorious for its leftist bias meta the parent of parent company and Facebook Instagram and threads is undergoing a major Overhaul of its content moderation policies practices CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday that the company will end its fact checking program Plugged by severe leftist bias and replace it with a community driven system similar to excess community notes Now the changes come as a response to what Zuckerberg perceives as a quote cultural tipping point Towards prioritizing speech influenced by the recent elections. Um, so we released a video. It was like a five-minute long video We talked about this. He also. I don't know if you saw this. He put Dana White on the board of meta And so I'm sure that had something to do with it as well Um, well, I don't think Dana would have accepted a position on the board unless he was going to agree unless this week this game first. Yeah I I Feel very I don't want to speak for Dana, but I feel very confident. Yeah, well, I mean, but here's my thing man like And this is something I battle with. I don't know if you see it the same But you know, we talked about this years ago with the America first Train that would be coming through and like you know the people that didn't want to hop on it But then they want to try to hop on and once it's cool and popular You know free speech. This is something we've been talking about on the show for fucking four years now um Is this Zuckerberg just trying to jump on the fucking bandwagon and or does it even matter because you know if You know it is becoming free speech and all those stuff goes in doesn't even matter if it's viewed like that I don't know. I just battle with that man because it's just like where were you four years ago, bro Well, I mean he was trying to push an agenda. Yeah And I think he's realized that people have rejected the agenda And I think that he understands that he's Needs to make changes where people are going to reject his platforms. Yeah, and um, I don't think I think Mark Zuckerberg is very Very very very smart dude He understands the dynamic of social uh Construction in terms of dialogue probably as good as anybody Um, it's his business. It's business business for 20 plus years I mean you can't discount these things. He's not a dumbass like people think oh it's Zuckerberg's a dumbass Oh really, that's why he's like one of the richest dudes in the world the guy's smartest fuck So to me Uh, it's a wait and see you know, let's see what the let's see what he does um, you know, he I don't know he seems to be going through some sort of transformation personally You know, he's taking up jujitsu. He's he's becoming more of um Relatable figure, you know what I mean? Yeah, he's getting into he's getting into watches You know, even though he could buy every watch company. You know what I mean like um I like the direction he's going but Is Is it real and we're gonna have to wait and see because the amount of censorship that even like just people like us have had Uh, it's insane. Well, but one of the reasons I stopped posting Fuck yeah, bro. I was like that's right. Yeah, like yeah, like this is great. It's like that's cool However, like how do you we still got to like talk about the accountability? Yeah like during covid bro when when people were getting banned from Fucking meta for saying that had Drx. Clark went and I remect and were effective solutions Which they ended up being and people were you know people died because of that Um, is that third party fact checking that did that or is that meta that did that right? You know, these are things and and dude, you know I I mean are we gonna shadow ban or we're gonna traffic throttle at all because like I can tell you this My accounts are still fucking fucked up You know what I mean? That's why I went to posting Stop posting and went on Andy Graham because I was getting censored uh traffic throttle for cursing You know like what the fuck dude like let's let it rip let it rip Let it be what it is open up the traffic and the best will win and we'll have a You know a fair open dialogue as a community, you know like everybody I mean Look man When Dorsey on Twitter and You know meta was doing this shit, you know fruit for the last 10 plus years Google meta Twitter all these companies have basically worked together to craft a narrative Okay, the narrative it is the narrative they have become the controllers of The perception of reality and they've hid behind section 230 they said Well, we can do whatever we want because it's a private platform well, that's a problem because Most of the discussion happens here. So at what point do we go from this being private companies to Them controlling free speech and manipulating the perception and because of the Twitter files and the the information That's come out about all these social services the social media services We figured out that they were in fact controlling the narrative they were boosting up Viewpoints that they wanted and they were using bot networks to promote and fake traffic to promote their narrative and then suppressing opposing voices That is creating a false perception of reality in society that and that's why when we go out in the world It doesn't look like what it looks like online right like And this has been going on for a long time and the agenda that has been pushed has been a progressive far left agenda that that really follows the Guidelines of what communism is and So you know I can appreciate it dude and I and I know enough about Dana the Dana wouldn't I don't think Dana would join the board If he didn't think that this was going to happen in a reasonable way. I know he wouldn't yeah fucking know he wouldn't yeah So we're gonna have to wait and see But yeah, man, there's a lot of questions dude and and um I don't know I it's You know when someone burns you over and over and over and over again, you know over and over and over and over and over And they keep coming out and saying oh, you know, it's we're gonna change we're gonna change. We're gonna change You know, didn't he say something earlier in the year about changing all this shit? Yeah, they're there, you know like didn't you go on Rogan and say like the FBI made me do this shit But what's change bro because I could tell you this the minute I post anything fucking weird on my story my trap my view You they go they go to nothing Right, so when is this gonna change? Is it is a changing today? Well, how do you implement it right because I think that's the biggest issue Like I mean this dudes a CEO is running this you know massive conglomerate of things right and it's like You know it takes and I don't know this. I'm assuming this is all the same. I'm not the CEO you are You're right, but like I'd imagine too that like you know, you got that many he has a shit Kind of employees. Yeah, all these different apartments and shit. So it's like bro Please don't always do what you tell them to do and that's what I'm saying. So like how do you fix that? Yeah, I mean, you know It's a cultural change inside meta like you're gonna you know he has uh Thousands and thousands and thousands of progressive employees how will you are they going to be to let things just go through right How are you going to implement this like I would like to hear a little bit more about that. Yeah, you know Yeah, like oh, no, no, I mean, you know Mark Zuckerberg doesn't know what he's talking about. We're still gonna need this exercise. That's the problem Yeah, that's the problem. It has to be addressed and that's a real thing when you run a company with you know a lot of employees Yeah, I mean dude we have we have Oh, you know comparatively of small amount of employees um They do a pretty good job. I couldn't imagine running a company like Nike or Google or uh Meta and having to control that I think it would be a very hard thing to control once the culture is already set So has to be a complete rewrite bro. Yeah bro. Yeah Well, I saw this to a friend Linda wake up. Linda as you see what she posted about this. No, she's like it's a She said something like it was amazing She's like it's amazing what happens when like you know you start doing Jiu-Jitsu and you stop sunning your balls and some like that and then all of a sudden you yeah, I'm like yeah I mean, I see he's trying man. I'm a different effort. Look man I always I mean you guys It's hard for me to be hard on Zuckerberg, okay? And people get pissed to me about this because I don't just trash him You got to understand dude. This motherfucker was 22 years old and like one of the richest people in the world Okay, when I was 22 years old. I was I was a fucking idiot Okay, and I'm probably still an idiot in a lot of ways But I certainly was an idiot in most ways at 22. I thought I knew everything. I thought I was smarter than everybody And in fact those Thoughts are what kept me from really becoming successful But this guy came up with something so revolutionary and so impactful That he became one of the richest people in the world basically overnight, okay at 22 23 years old You cannot Be prepared for that like there's no manual for that. There's no manual For every single person coming out of the woodwork and wanting something from you There's no manual for every woman in the world wanting you. There's no manual for You know, how do you know who's lying and who's got your best interests in cultures? Yeah, bro And like time times times what it that was like For every other you know quote unquote rich person that you may know and times that by like a million for him because he's come One of the richest guys in the world, okay, so I Have empathy for him being a young kid Who has probably been taking advantage of who's probably been leveraged a lot Who's probably been you know tried they've tried a blackmail him maybe they have blackmail who fucking knows Real talk if they did that to him. I hope he comes out and be like yeah, they did this to me right because then I'd be like All right now now this motherfucker's telling the truth right and I think people would forgive him for that, but um You know dude who knows man. I mean That's just a lot and so I feel like it could be him Kind of getting in line with the wave of what's going on or It he could make be making genuine realizations about like how off he was and how he was misled by certain groups of people You know what I mean? Yeah, I could see it both ways man. Yeah, and I just think it's wait and see Yeah, and I really hope I really fucking hope That it's the second part I hope he was taking advantage of I hope that he Because like bro if that motherfucker does come around and becomes like uh, you know Realizes what's going on bro is gonna change the world. You know what I mean like so I don't know. I'm I'm rooting for him. Yeah, because the impact that this man can make is immense um But dude, I think it's just wait and see yeah guys jumping on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Let us know man With that being said we got one more little trip to talk about headline number three This is obviously something that uh, you know, I know they've been waiting for us to cover and talk about gotta talk about it um the uh the terrorist attacks we've had On the first of the year Some interesting stuff there not a lot. Oh, there's a lot that's come out about it But uh, there's still some interesting stuff miss. Let's talk about it Man responsible. I want you guys to look at this headline because this I think this was probably the first piece It really pissed me off looking at some of the more left-leaning Media outlets and how they're just writing these stories This is from AP news The headline reads FBI man responsible for New Year's truck attack Visited New Orleans twice before This Politico You know truck attack is what it was just just a truck attack, you know killed 14. How about terrorist responsible for New Year's Terror attack right visit New Orleans twice before to scope Out his terrorist plot exactly. How about that like dude? It's dude. I'm so sick at his fucking media outlets sympathizing with terrorists and criminals. Fuck you Okay, we are done as people sympathizing with these people bro, okay? We don't we're not you when you say man Responsible when it's a fucking terrorist right or like I saw this fucking headline the other day too. It was like babyface teenagers. Yeah, attack And bro, it's just a group of fucking black kids, you know what I'm saying? Nobody wants to identify who's doing what or what's what how about we just get back to the fucking truth Okay, if it's a fucking white dude, it's a white dude. Yeah, if it's a black dude It's a black dude if it's a fucking terrorist from other country. It's a terrorist from another country If we don't know what to do. We don't know what to do You know, Sam, but like like you have to say he's deceptive politically leading headlines are fucking insane Well, bro, but then you'd look at how they report on you know January 6th. Yeah, you know man White power Exactly dude. It's always like that unless it's fucking white people They hide it until it's like white people and then it's the fucking devil. Yeah, right white devil's fucking did you know It's like man the new balances Yeah It's sick man bro. I'm tired of it. It says a white dude. I'm tired of it And I know it's like dude all this shit does is fucking increased divisive thinking like when when you know like it just does And do we need we need to get back to what this country is actually about where we judge each other on the content of our character We don't give a fuck what color fucking anybody is and if you're bad person your bad person if you're a terrorist You're a terrorist or you're criminal. You're a criminal. I don't give a fuck what color you are. Mm-hmm. Okay Don't matter. No matter Straight to the wood shipper. That's it I mean there ain't a black people wood shipper or terrorist wood shipper or why people wood shipper It's just a wood shipper just a wood shipper and you go in it if you get that shit I mean, I think that's how America's supposed to be it'd be nice. Yeah, it'd be nice But uh, but yeah, I mean everybody's seen it. Um, you know, there's there's plenty of videos floating around You know sam su din jibar mm-hmm good old southern boy They're right Um, but yeah, the man responsible uh, you said his name's shams, shamsud din jibar um, and uh, you know, they're releasing all this information on this guy He'll 14 fucking people 14 people for no fucking reason these people are down there Have a New Year's Eve or whatever party and probably on vacation And they never go home because some fuckface who shouldn't even be in the country Besides he wants to fucking hurt him. When are we gonna stop this shit, bro When when when are we when are American men gonna stop allowing this shit Like fuck these motherfuckers. Yeah, well until you're a point, you know, like you see online I mean this was big in like 2020 right where like people were like, oh, you know, I don't like this country Well, okay, like why are those people and like to me that should be like a tell-tale sign If you say anything like, you know, like obviously this country has some things to work on right? We're not perfect Right, they don't they don't like that our country is not like their country, you know, why the fuck are you here? You know, people that are even here. I mean, this guy was an American citizen. It's like, you know You start saying some anti-American shit and Simmons GTFO go like why are we not spending taxpayer dollars to investigate those people Why are we not why are we not just uh, you know, cutting all the fucking bullshit out pain 10% tax and giving a little bit like bro, we could start a A charitable fund that people would give to All right, here's the idea cut the taxes down 10% all in Started charitable fund that people donate to that goes towards the deportation of people who speak poorly about being in America We would all donate to it. I don't know too. I donate to it adopt a fucking deportee You know instead of like these commercials where like, you know, it shows us little kids starving or places commercial about the dog Fifty-six. Serumagloccalins on there crying about this fucking dog. How about this? We put an commercial out that says adopt a fucking deportee terrorist For 25 bucks a month Bro, every American I know would fucking give it and we would just we would pay for your ticket And we send you over there and if you don't want to go over there, you go to the woodchipper. Fuck you Like bro, if you don't like it here, get the fuck out. I don't get it man. I don't get but we want to you know investigate You know Christians at church and sh**. Oh, we got fucking motherfuckers sitting in jail for J6 crazy, bro It's crazy, but this was a wild story. Yeah, so he drove his car Through Which you know, it's still unknown how even got his vehicle into the the streets down I've been down to New Orleans a few times. It's it's you know, it's pretty heavily protected. Well, he's sure Huh, no, but they got like barriers and shit to like you know, so remove the barriers. That's what I'm saying. I bro. It's just weird stuff It's weird stuff You know, but drove through and then there was like a fire fight that went on where he was fatally shot I'm died at the scene I'm right there on bourbon street man, and it's just wild But another like part that I hate about all of this man is that like you know, we know everything about this guy We know that this guy was wearing a fucking medic glasses You know what I'm saying? But we still have an assassination attempt on Donald Trump months ago and we don't know shit about it We don't know anything you mean July yeah, right nothing nothing We know nothing about it. I think we're gonna know something about it whenever he takes office bro I mean, I guarantee you he already knows like Charles. He knows the truth. He knows what you know, I'm saying It just hasn't been publicly made available You know, but it's just interesting. I know there was some talk that you know this guy was like you know I'm sure the record I still believe these people are not going to go quietly. No, no, not at all Yeah, and if they do go quietly There will be some major shit that happens during his presidency right away right? We're just like they did right You know, I mean total chaos dude You know now know there was some some myths out there that this guy was like you know He came across the border all of that stuff. That's not true. He's an American citizen. Was an American citizen Served in the army You know and you know people try to make this stuff political and you know get both sides kind of fired up um, but it's just interesting man and ISIS, you know, you had a ISIS flag on this truck um, but they have not claimed responsibility of those of yet for this the thinking of this guy was just a independent guy operating on his own I don't know. Let's check in with the FBI federal officials. This is a one of the news briefings that was done. Let's check this out Thanks to information provided by you the public This investigation is crossing state and international borders as our agents follow leads in Houston, Texas Atlanta, Georgia Tampa, Florida and internationally FBI Houston has recovered evidence at his home there and the work now shifts to our specialists at the FBI laboratories Interviews are being conducted with hundreds who have been identified as knowing key pieces of this complex evolving case We have also tracked that Jabbar traveled to Cairo, Egypt from June 22nd until July 3rd of 2023 A few days later He flew to Ontario, Canada on July 10th And returned to the US on July 13th on 2023 Our agents are getting answers as to where he went Who he met with and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here in our city in New Orleans I mean, we know so much about this guy It's just baffling the other shit you saw the stuff in Vegas That was weird Soldiers shot self and head before cyber truck exploded outside Trump's Las Vegas hotel officials say that was another weird thing That also happened first of the year And there's a lot of weird stuff going on about that emails being sent in from this guy I mean, it's just weird stuff And it's interesting just to see the response of You know both on the law enforcement side And I think now how Citizen journalism is going there a lot of the research is being done on Individuals, you know, I'm saying they're just pushing this shit out now because we can't get the truth from where the truth is supposed to be coming from Um, but that was another weird situation. What were you ever thoughts on that like I listen, I just gonna be honest, you know when I when I think I know things I say them when I think I don't know things. I said I don't know. I don't know. Yeah You know what I mean? Like a lot of my friends, you know, have have been texting me With their opinions and their thoughts and different information And it certainly seems like it's not just some dude who's you know uh Trying to do something it it seems more like it's somebody who's trying to bring attention to some things Um or someone who was you know framed up for it. I don't fucking know. Yeah, I don't know But it certainly isn't just some random dude blowing up a cyber truck. Yeah I mean one information do we have yeah, I mean not much and like I messed a thing I'm like and you look you rely try to rely man. Oh Sean Ryan's doing a bunch on it You know what I mean, but like I'll be real. I haven't I haven't been able to follow it from what I could see Honestly, I feel like there may have been some type of like manic episode that was going on with this guy um But there's been other things that again come out it's hard to know if they're true or not true But like you know, you've been sending emails trying to whistle blow on some stuff. Yeah going on to a number of different shows too trying to get out on shows um Get the word out. I dude. I don't know. It's weird. It's weird. You know, but it's interesting though What they're trying to turn the attention to right like I mean this is coming from the media Of what they want people to pay attention to and what they want people to focus on check this headline out This is from AP news Is your car spying on you What it means that Tesla shared data and the lost Vegas explosion Like that's what they're worried about. Well, that's what they're trying to get us to worry about well I think they're also trying to like make it make you on look as bad as possible exactly, you know You know, Elon and Vivek have got the entire internet stirred up over this fucking the visa shit. Yeah, bro Which is stupid. I mean, let's talk about let's talk about that because I mean look dude I understand why people are pissed off because you know for the last For eight years we've had all these fucking illegals coming across the border and people are so tired of foreigners taking over a fucking country um That they're they're highly they're highly You know pissed off sensitive to that. Yeah, I get that But if we're being honest, you know India's how many people are in India? Said fucking billion a billion and a half one point three billion. Okay, one point three billion people We have three hundred million people here in this country You know stable job That pays well Is sort of taken for granted in this country, you know a lot of people are like You know, it's a sort of a guarantee which it isn't Can go away very fast But in India there's no doubts about that in India they understand like hey man There's a billion point three people here um I've got to get my shit together or I'm not gonna fucking eat. I'm gonna be a shitting in a hole. Okay They these people understand that and so when you think about the pure number of people that are competing for positions Here versus there. It's not just a population difference. You know, how many more Engineers how many more architects how many more tech savvy people Cody people people who understand technology are coming out of India because of the sheer number of those people that are high They're high skill qualified high skill. Yeah, okay And then you have people over here that are not valuing those positions the same way because they come from a place of higher comfort level When they're born, all right, so big difference. Yeah, and so when you talk about the qualified people To do some of these higher skill tech type jobs there's going to be way more people from India, okay, and if you want America to be great wouldn't it make sense to selectively Allow these high skill people to take the high skill positions here as long as they acted in the interest of this country and not their own You see what I'm saying makes sense to me so so like if you own the fucking football team and And All the the greatest football players came from India and you were here to win championships When you sign some out of fuckers from India So so I think it's a more complex discussion than people are making it And to be to be fair I haven't heard Because I was in the midst of taking our hiatus and when I do that I unplug completely um I Had it heard what the vape said or or you want to say it? You know, and what's got everybody stirred up But I think I've got a grip on it is that no, that's pretty much the just yeah, so like I think it's a more complicated subject Than people are making it and I think we have to recognize that they're not talking about These fucking terrorists coming across the border. We're talking about high skilled people That happened to have been born in foreign countries and still trying to do it the legal way now I will say this yeah all of those motherfuckers should be fucking American citizens And if they're gonna take those jobs and they should all be Uh Behold into our same tax code because what happens to a lot of these people is they come from these other countries They don't become a citizen. They maintain a temporary visa And then they don't pay the fucking tax that they make and a lot of these big CEOs and these tech CEOs and even you know CEOs of other industries that come from other countries they play this game where they earn all this money But then they don't pay the tax into it and that's fucking bullshit Okay, if you're gonna earn your money in this country Regardless of if the tax code is fair or not, which I believe it's completely unfair It needs to go down to a 10% all-in tax on everything But everybody should pay it and there's a lot of these guys who are big shots and these big companies that Fucking they're making 15 20 million bucks a year But then because they don't become citizens. They're navigating around paying in these loophole That's not okay. Yeah, okay, and and I think anybody who fucking does that Should be retroactively taxed for the money they've earned here I think if you've earned that money in the last 20 years Then you should be retroactively taxed to do that. You know, that's my personal opinion because if you're a fool How the fuck do we as Americans have to pay we get the same job you get But you come from fucking, you know Wherever you come from and you come here and you don't pay that tax. Fuck you man. Oh, that's like dude as an American citizen I take personal offense to that stuff like dude when people because I have wealthy friends Who are not citizens of this country Who have bragged about that to me and when they when they tell me that it makes me angry It makes me not think they're my friend It makes me think they're a fucking trader to the country that's allowing them to make the money that they made and I so So you so you because you come from somewhere else you get a benefit over me the American which is my country Bro in fact, those people should probably be tax more You see what I'm saying. Yeah, so I don't like that and I think there's a lot of a lot of that Happening but I also think that if we want to build the best brightest greatest country in the world we can't expect Uh, all of our talent to come from one little neighborhood You know if you if you think of it like you're uh, like I said a football team right and you're a college football team You want to win a national title and you only recruit one little neighborhood? You're back yard. Yeah, what's gonna happen? Yeah, you're gonna get your ass beat Okay, so we have to selectively pull From the best talent across the globe for these high-skill positions. We're not talking about importing gazillions of migrants, but if we don't have people in America and by the way Maybe we should have something that if you know if you're an American citizen and you're you're a foreign citizen and you test out the same the American citizen gets preference Maybe we should have something like that But if we don't have the skill positions to play you know running back quarterback why receive the the The positions that put the fucking points on the board. We got to go get them You know what I mean? Well, I think that's it. There's the other side of that too Is the aspect which is actually going back, you know, I think it is changing but going back to what we were talking about earlier You know now we do have that drive of people wanting to be ambitious and wanting to take years that takes time to get through You know, I'm saying we're not we're not there yet. We're still lazy as fuck as a country You know, I'm saying so and dude people that come from less Comfort and and and poorer Economies and poorer countries are hungrier. Yeah, brother. They just want to more yeah And until we get people here to fucking match that and match the skill set that comes from that discomfort It would make sense if we want the country to be the best possible quickly That we recruit from there for certain things. I mean dude. I'm sorry and people get mad about that But like makes sense to me, you know, we don't have enough and in the meantime we need to be building American citizens into that So 100% man 100% it's a complex discussion dude. It's not as easy as oh fuck. Yeah, you know One of and if we were not in the situation where we had you know 15 20 million illegal fucking people in this country and people were not as sensitive it'd be a different discussion Easier discussion to have for sure 100% man You know last little thing I want to bring up here, you know, it's interesting We talked about this earlier in the show or at least alluded to it But there's something coming there's something coming And I got this on the radar just just something for people to pay attention to and just you know keep in mind you heard it here first There is apparently a new outbreak that is happening right now And of all places China um and this report came out yesterday So two days ago time is recording The media has been reporting that hospitals in China are overcrowded and a new type of respiratory virus is spreading The british daily star and independent wrote about this they write that an outbreak of a new human Met an ammonia virus or hmpv Has been recorded Taiwanese media report a high mortality rate of this Variety 43% Um and plants to introduce a state of emergency in a number of provinces in uh end of the PR See in China new strains have not been officially confirmed nor has high mortality, but they have acknowledged There's a since seasonal outbreak of the respiratory disease and studies have shown positive results For the influenza virus human met a meta NUMO virus and the rhomavirus Um and you posted this this is uh from intel slava This is the clip that is circulating going around China right now check this out You Those are you on audio is just showing doctors and suits and shit right What does that remind you of the exact same fear monitoring propaganda that they put out during covid Bro, that might be the same clip from fucking you know I wasn't the one stirring covid were showing people fall over in the streets and body bags and shit Yeah, it's very eerily the same man. This is dangerous Okay, because we just got fooled and we all realized we got fooled Who's to say that these people would not and I've said this millions of times on the show I'm not Yeah, it's but hundreds of times on the show for sure Who's to say that these people won't just real release something real You know, that's the problem of allowing these people like Fauci and the NIH and the fucking whio and all these people to do all this Biolab research and all this bullshit These motherfuckers got us by the balls because they were allowed to do this all they have to do is develop a very very very real Virus that kills people with a real vaccine that stops it and only make the vaccine available to themselves and release this shit on the world and they get what the fuck they want So it's this very dangerous all of this research is dangerous. This is where Vladimir Putin is a hundred percent on point All of these biolabs need to be considered crimes against humanity. They need to be closed They need to be destroyed all of the people who've been doing this research need to be put in fucking jail And we need to fucking read The the world of people like this that think that they can play with nature and and fuck all you know like this is not It's very dangerous. It's it's very very very dangerous very dangerous It concerns me this is one of my biggest concerns one of my biggest concerns is that these little fucking nerds Who you know bilgates and all these people Fouches and the fucking sorrows is and all these people who have now lost the culture war are now like look dude What happens when somebody bullies somebody right like They start off with a little bit like this right like give me your milk money right give me your milk money Give me give me give me give me one of those chicken nuggets Give they start off with like that right and then When you fucking say no what happens it beat your ass and they take it. Yeah, okay? So we're at the point now where they've tried to convince us They've tried to propagate us. They've tried to make us believe that this is all real and everybody's like now fuck that This is bullshit, okay? So what's the next step the next step is to fucking use that attitude against those people And the attitude of this is bullshit the attitude of this is fake or this is fake news or this isn't real So then they use that against people they release something that is Actually harmful nobody believes it and it fucking kills a billion people or more And that we are in real danger of that and it's weird to me that Nobody talks about that Like none maybe in the back of the rooms Maybe in the areas where we're not supposed to hear the classified conversations Maybe they are talking about it That's the danger that I see the danger I see is these little twerps Who think that they run the world the Hillary Clinton's the fucking fowches the bill gates is The the plowsies the caw swabs the the sorrows is like all of these people they're all being quiet. Why are they being quiet? Why are they going along? You see what I'm saying it's because they know something that we don't And it makes me nervous that this could be what it is It's a very real possibility Yeah, dude, and unless the real leaders of the world like the real leaders I'm talking about the fucking potens and the trumps and the fucking the real leaders Okay, you guys say what you want about Putin It's one of those powerful men in the world till these people come together and say we're not fucking allowing this And everybody that does this shit is going to be fucking dealt with Nothing's going to change.
