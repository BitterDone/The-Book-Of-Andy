What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realest day. The day we have Andy and DJ Cruz the mother fucking Internet. That's what we're going to do. That's what CTI stands for stands for cruise the internet is where we put topics of the day up on the screen. We speculate and what's true. What's not true. And we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in society. I'm just going to get right into it today. Don't forget to share the show. Don't be a hoe. Share the show. I'm doing what's going on man. Oh not much. Yeah. Figured I skipped that whole intro. Try to keep my voice fresh. I did it. I did it. It's a big day today. I know it's CTI. My weekly shower. Yeah. Yeah. What's going on today? There's a lot man. You know we obviously got the election today so hope you guys are all out voting in power. Yeah. I mean I would hope that people would vote especially if they listen to this show considering the fact that you know I gave up the number one entrepreneur podcast on the fucking planet to talk about this shit with you guys for the last four and a half years. And if you're sitting at home and you're just sitting there and you haven't voted you know what you need to get off your ass and go fucking vote. I don't fucking listen to my show. That's it. Like real talk. Like we come in here every fucking day, talk about the problems going on, talk about what's going on. I just got a text from somebody who I know who actually has a. I believe been on the show before a number of years ago and said what do you think is going to happen. I think this is this and this and this and this and this and I said bro fuck you like he's telling me oh well you know I think Trump's going to lose I'm like yeah Trump's going to lose because you fucking are bitching about why Trump's going to lose instead of getting motherfuckers out to vote. And so I don't want to hear shit. I don't want to hear from anybody. I don't want you listening to me. I don't want you buying my shit. I don't want you to be anything to me at all. If you're not willing to get the fuck out and go vote because that is the least amount of civic duty that we have. There have been people that have come before us who have fucking died for us to have the right to vote and a whole bunch of people out there are lagoon the vote does account the vote does account. Okay. Well let's prove that the vote doesn't count by giving so much overwhelming support to what we think it needs to be that is impossible to deny or overcome or if they do cheat then we have the evidence of all of these votes versus the lesser amount of votes on the other side. This is the most critical election the most critical day that has existed in the United States history in a very, very, very long time. If not ever and if you're going to sit on your ass and not do anything about it. I don't want anything to do with you. I don't give a fuck what you say. I don't care about your support. I don't want you to fucking listen to show. I don't want you to be a customer of mine because I do not respect people who do not respect the sacrifices and the things that have been given up for you to have the right to vote only for you to sit on your ass and do nothing. That is it. That's how I feel. That's how I feel. It's an obligation as a citizen. So turn this show off right now and go fucking vote. And then after you vote you come fucking listen to it. That's it. Well listen while you're in line. Yeah. That works too. And the amount of people that say, oh, our vote doesn't count. Our vote doesn't matter. And then they bitch nonstop about what's going on in the country. Okay. You're the fucking problem. If our vote doesn't count then why are the fucking Democrats out today, which is Monday. You're hearing this on Tuesday with 800,000 fucking people knocking on doors. Why? Why are they doing that? Are they doing that because they have total control and they can cheat? No, they're doing that because they know that votes do fucking matter. Okay. Why have there been, why has there been a billion dollars raised to circulate votes for Kamala Harris? And why? If you think they're just raising that money for fucking nothing, do you think they're running those commercials for nothing? Don't be a fucking dumbass. Turn this off right now and go fucking vote and come back when you're done. Yeah, man. That's real shit. And we got plenty to cover on the election. We'll obviously do some deep dives in that and here in just a second. But I saw this video, man. Have you ever met somebody like just real shit that is like really gullible? Like will literally believe anything? Yeah, it's called anybody that watches the mainstream media and believes anything they say whatsoever. That's really the truth. Bro, did you not see that clip I posted this weekend? It showed Trump in two different conversations. They showed the clip they showed on CNN and then they showed the full clip. Like bro, the amount of manipulation that's happening in the media. It's criminal. It is criminal. It's complete manipulation, dude. Yeah. Well, I think I found somebody worse than a mainstream media watcher and I'd love to get you take on it. Okay. So this video has the captions very simple. This guy believes anything. Let's check this out. See all the news helicopters in there? What happened? One of the seat turtles got loose from the phone up. He's you. Oh, really? Attack two kids that was on a school trip. Bit one under the freaking heads off. A little toddler. I just was talking to Don Pollock on the news right now. You serious? Yes. I was on the phone with Don Paul. The kid was killed? The kid was decapitated by a C-Turl at the zoo. I just got off the phone at action six. Oh my gosh. It's horrible. I'm on hold with Don Pollock right now. You know Don Pollock from the edge of the tree? Yeah. That's my godfather. Oh, man. Well, he's my godfather and I was the first one to hear this bad news line. And somehow in the hear this bad news line. And somehow to dingot one. How the hell did the C-Turl get it? I don't know how God loose, but listen to this shit. It ended up on the school go expressway. It made its way up there. It started it four. It got to the kid. After it, it chopped it kids head off. It got on the school go expressway and they said it was attacking cars and biting their tires off. Oh my gosh. Insane. So I don't know if you got a dog, but they say that's its favorite snack. So keep your dog away, all right? Must be Haitian. Unreal. You can't do nothing in this world, Don Mark. You can't do it. Oh my god. It's crazy. You can't have nothing nice and you can't have no pets that are going to be attacked by C-Turls. We're crying out loud. What was the kids doing close to the C-Turl? They were on the school trip. It was this. Okay, have nothing nice. Fucking C-Turls taking over everything. What are you doing by the C-Turl? I saw a C-Turl with the grocery store. I'm going to have to move now. Bro. Oh man. We're doomed bro. We're fucking doomed. For Kamala because of women's rights. I don't know what a woman is. What's a woman? I don't know. I'm not a biologist. We're meeting women. Vote for the first woman. I'm a biologist. Bro. That's what I mean. I think there's a lot of people that are like that. More than they should be. How did they fucking? So the kids dead? The C-Turls. That's bad man. Yeah. That's what we're dealing with bro. Bro, I'm serious about this clip on the Trump thing. The amount of manipulation that the media is doing at the national level is absolutely criminal. It's completely different. Like what they tried to do with them last week about the Liz Cheney comments. Did you see that? No. Where they tried to say that he called for her assassination. You didn't see that? No, I didn't see that. Yeah. He was basically saying like, dude, she wants to send everybody to war, but she would be the first person to cower if we sent her over there and she had guns in her face. And we shouldn't be sending all our kids to war. And then media flipped that into. She's Trump's calling for Cheney's assassination. Like it was insane. They did the same thing the day he made a comment at one of the rallies. I think in North Carolina, he was talking about, he was like, you know, they tried to kill him, right? They tried to assassinate him multiple times. And he's like, you know, and I guess they've changed the setup of these rallies. And he's like, now they'll have to shoot through the media to get to me. And now they're like, Trump wants all media dead. It's like, bro, like what? It's like it's sad, man. And I feel even worse for the people who believe this shit. I don't even question it at all. I don't. At this point, I don't feel bad for him. I feel like, I feel like they're willfully ignorant. I feel like they know that these are lies and they know they're being manipulated. And they can't separate their feelings for their personal feelings about Donald Trump from the issues. And so they don't care what's true or what's not true. They don't care. Yeah. Well, we know you guys care about the truth. That's why you guys listen. So let's let's let's talk about some truth. Let's connect some dots out there. Well, we can't remember if you guys want to see any of these articles, these pictures, these videos, anything that we use, we link all of this stuff on AndyFacela.com for you guys. So let me set my let's go ahead and do this cruise. Let's jump in the headline number one. So as of the time of recording, we're going to talk about, again, obviously today's election day, a lot of things are happening and moving around. We'll point some things out just to be mindful of and watch. Now there's a lot of people putting polls out there. A lot of people with the maps in China, you know, show you who they think is going to going to go there. I've been I've looked at every single fucking one of them. I would say daily, daily wire probably has the most fair, unbiased map that they're pushing out right now. And right now they're saying, and when I say fair, I mean, honest based off of like historical data and what I mean, because here's the thing, we don't know how deep that these people are aligned about fucking everything. But I look at all of them and this would, I would say this one's probably the most fair as of right now in that there's still some wiggle room there left. But it has Trump up. But the problem is is that, you know, you kind of go everywhere, it kind of just depends on where you look is, you know, who's up, who's down. Presidential election odds live, betting markets show Donald Trump lead growing. And it is on Vengeus and, you know, all of these private bets and bets that are happening there. Yeah, and it's not close there. It's like 40 points off. It's a landslide. Yeah, it's a fucking landslide. But then you go to other places like this national poll from NPR, Marius, it has Harris up four points nationally. Of course they do. They only sample people that are on their fucking own list. Right. So who listens to NPR? The public is don't listen to NPR. So they're sampling their own audience. They're paying to sample people that they already know their views. They're sampling, you know, a thousand people or less from their own audience. And this is what the fuck they get. And so you have that. And then there's some interesting things that are already coming in. Obviously early voting has been a thing across the country the last couple of weeks. And they're starting some states allow those that day to be processed and publicly available. Missouri is not one of those states, right? So like while you can early vote, it's absentee ballot. But they still don't count it and start tracking those numbers until the day of the election. But you know, we're trying to see some weird things coming out all across the country. Iowa, which is an interesting place. Apparently they're about to flip two GOP seats, GOP House seats. They have four currently four House seats are all Republican for Iowa. And now it's 50, 50. Like I mean, there's just things that are happening that just don't make sense. Well, I mean, we talked about this, bro. We talked about how they were going to make the polling seem. But we have to look at the reality. Mila Harris, when she was appointed president, nobody voted for it. She was appointed. Okay. When she was appointed the presidential candidacy, she had a 30% or less approval rating across the board no matter where you looked. The whole goal, as we stated when that happened, was to pump as much money and advertising into creating the image that the race was close. They want to create the image that the race was close so that they could potentially cheat more than what they actually have the capacity to cheat. And what I mean by that is the closer the perception in people's minds, the more believable it is that they covered the gap. So if they were putting out polls that said, you know, Trump's ahead by 15 points and then they come out on election night or two days after and say, oh, Kamala one, nobody would believe that. There'd be a fucking uproar. Okay. But what they're doing instead is they are sampling audiences that are heavily Democrat, putting the poll out there and saying, look, it's close. It's close. It's close. And even if Trump has X amount, you know, let's say fucking 10 million more votes or whatever than them, they can still fuck the system and say, oh, well, you know, that didn't actually happen. This is what happened. He's giving them leverage to do their fuckery that they've always done. And the problem is that, you know, people who aren't aware and people have short memories, they're not aware that that's what's actually happening because dude, there's no way you go from a 30% approval to beating somebody else at 51% or 52%. That's not happening, dude, with the base that he has. It's never happened. And dude, there's a couple other things that people should be aware of. And Trump's not fucking busing around all his audiences to these rallies. He's also not having mainstream acts at these rallies. Kamala has a singing actor, a rap act or a fucking whatever act at every single rally. And then when she's terrible, when she gets up and talks, those people are booing her. And they leave. Okay. So the optics don't even add up to a close race either. Now Trump did exactly what he did in 2020 where he's done X amount of rallies, fucking on every day multiple rallies with 50 to 100,000 people in attendance every single day. Kamala hasn't been able to do anything close to that. Okay. They're literally busing her people from rally to rally to rally. Okay. And then her speech is the exact same speech from rally to rally to rally. Okay. And there's evidence of this. So when we look at the optics of what's actually going on, it's very clear that Trump has the people, but I don't think that's going to matter on how they they announce it. So these and these fucking celebrities and these acts to bring an ambrow, it's probably the worst. Like I look at the shit now is such a sad, desperate attempt of just bullshit. Yeah. Like it's sad at this point. You know, like it's not even funny. No, you had fucking, you had fucking Obama out today this morning saying this is the guy that said there were very fine people at Charlottesville, mother fucker. That's been debunked for years. That day it happened. Yeah. But that's an example of how they're manipulating the media, dude. They're manipulating the meat. And I actually think the more they do this shit, the more they're pushing people to Trump. But you know, we're going to have to see what happens. Yeah, like they, NBC's actually getting hit right now because they bought Kamala on SNL the other night and she did this SNL cameo, right? But like, and it was fucking terrible. I mean, let's check this clip out real quick. Gosh, I just, I wish I could talk to someone who's been in my shoes, you know, a black South Asian one and a man running for president, preferably from the Bay area. It's so cringey. You will leave both sister. Sister. It's nice to see you Kamala. It is nice to see you Kamala. And I'm just here to remind you you got this because you can do something your opponent cannot do. You can open doors. It's cringey. All right. But they actually got in trouble for that because they offered more time to her than they did to Trump. Yeah, like no time to Trump. Yeah, that's right. And they were forced to have to play an ad, a minute and 30 second ad for Trump. I think they played it during NASCAR or something like that. But I mean, it's not even that. There's been a whole list. I like this headline. This article from Breitbart, complete list of Hollywood elites telling Americans what America they should have. You know, like throughout the campaign, especially here recently, she's brought in a bunch of these celebrities who, you know, also come from middle class families and know what the struggles are like. You know, meanwhile, there were billions of dollars. You got Oprah in there. Worth three billion. Taylor Swift in there. Worth one point six. Tyler Perry. I mean, they're bringing in all of these people to try to, you know, relate to the person who have been so far removed from society and the daily struggles of any average American that it's sad, you know, and then these, these fucking far fetched attempts. Did you see this goal? Real shit. Bro. Oh, yeah, I did see it. Could you send it to me? Bro. Yeah, it was ghetto. Bro. Yeah. Trash. All right. The campaign mocked over profanity, latent, bleaked out every other word, glorilla rap performance at Milwaukee, Rally. It kind of, it actually kind of might have been like a really f-up, so I'm going to believe I can say. Yeah. Well, it's possible. But dude, it's just sad. Like, let me check this out. It's every P.M. Friday, John is 95 degrees. I ain't got no h-a-d, I ain't got no h-a-d, I'm proud to show my body's little sluggish. I don't need that show, man. If he right here with me, the A, A, T, I don't put my socks on, I don't put my socks on. So, shit. A, C, 1000 fans can't see me do my deeds. They're the white people. They have no idea what's happening. That's f-cking hilarious. Bro, that is so funny. Just watch the white people in the back. They had no idea what was happening. They were just making sure their purses didn't get taken. You know, but there's a lot of bullshit happening. We've been covering this stuff even today, right here in our own state. We gotta give a massive shout out. Dude, our A.G. is awesome. Yeah. And he's been doing some awesome shit. Just today, the show was recorded. This headline reads, Missouri Secretary of State and Attorney General filed lawsuit to block Biden-Harris DOJ from sending un-vetted goons to polling stations at 11th hour. Do you hear about this? No. So, let's dive into this a little bit. Secretary of State, J. Ashcroft, and Attorney General Andrew Bailey on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Biden-Harris DOJ to block them from sending un-vetted goons to polling stations at 11th hour. U.S. Attorney General, Merrick Garland, tried to send un-vetted people to Missouri's polling locations again, quote, not on my watch. A.G. Bailey said on Monday. He said, quote, for the second election cycle in a row, the Department of Justice at the 11th hour has announced an intent to displace state election authorities. Absent, exceedingly clear federal authority, the state's, quote, keep for themselves the power to regulate elections. Ashcroft and Bailey wrote in a complaint reviewed by the Gateway Public, Gateway Pundit. And he put out a tweet again saying how he, they're trying to send these people into these polling locations from the federal agencies, federal level, un-vetted, unknown, to come in and watch and overs. No, the states have the responsibilities to take care of their own elections. And are these going to be semblance to the people that were down on Georgia with a water main broke? Yeah, exactly. You know what I'm saying? Exactly. It's illegal. Yeah. You can't do it. And not only that, it undermines the entire democratic election process. So you got that happen and that's interesting. And again, like I mean, we talk, I feel like we've talked off air about this situation, but it was never really publicly talked about online. I couldn't really find much, but now I'm admitting it. DC's gearing up for a possible election chaos with metal fencing around VPs home and businesses boarded up. And so they're going around putting these giant fences and concrete barriers and all of these things. I mean, what are they, what are they preparing for? They're preparing to steal the election for people to fucking riot. That's what the fuck they're preparing for. I think so too. Why do they put fences up last time? And what do they do? They're doing the same thing they did last time and they're going to do it again. This is a communist regime, dude. This is not fucking American politics that nobody voted for this woman. This woman got 0% of the vote when she ran for president the first time in the primary. Nobody voted for her. They put her in fucking 6, 90 days ago after fucking Trump was shot at and everybody hated her. And now they've they've manufactured this fake marketing image to make it seem like everybody's about it and they're not about. And they're going to fucking cheat. They're going to fucking say that she won. I've been saying this for fucking years that they're going to do whatever they got to do. And that's that. These people are guilty of crimes that they do not want to be held accountable for. If you were guilty of crimes that you didn't want to be held accountable for and it meant going to prison or it meant fucking other things, you would do whatever it takes, which is what they're going to do. So this is not going to be an easy time. And even if they allow him to win the election, they're going to give him hell through law fair and try to not certify the election. They're going to do all kinds of fucked up shit, dude. And people are going to have to not comply. People are going to have to say no. There's going to be hard decisions made by people in the military and people in the police and people of sheriff's offices and agencies and everything. And we're either going to fucking take this country back. Or we're going to lose it to communism. And if we lose this to communism, which is people think that's crazy, they don't understand. She is a communist. This country will fucking collapse. 100% in the next four years. Every single one of you, every single person listening to this, your family will be fucked. And that's the truth. Okay. You're getting. I don't know what to tell you. People think they're immune to it. People think, oh, well, if it's communist, they'll take care of meat. No, they won't. They're going to take everything for themselves. The people get nothing. They're going to control the people. And then they get rid of the people that resist them. And that's what the fuck this is about. So if you if you've seriously haven't voted yet, you better go fucking vote, dude. Because people have been saying, oh, vote like, like your life depends on it. It's because it does. It really does. And, and dude, there's a lot of people in communism. They talk about these people. They call them useful idiots. There's a lot of people out here who think this is normal political ebbs and flows. And they're going to go out and they're going to vote for Kamala. And then two years from now, there's going to be 60 million motherfucking migrants running the streets uncontrolled, unabated, making our cities unsafe, making our country unsafe, fucking rape in our women, doing all kinds of shit. Just like I said, they were going to do for the last four years. I've said this on the show. And when I first started saying to you guys, oh, your race is for saying that what's been happening in Europe, I said, oh, well, that's just Europe. Now it's been happening here. And there's, if we don't fix this now, there'll be three to four times as many of those people and we'll never get the country back. It'll never, ever, ever be salvaged. If this election goes the way they want it to go. Yeah. Trump says something interesting today too. I think he was in North Carolina. And he was like, if I don't win this election, they will jail me. Oh, yeah. He said that straight out. And I believe him. They're going to jail. No, they don't just jail them. They're going to jail everybody that supports him, every fucking media outlet that goes down. Major mainstream. Yes. Everybody who is, they're going to put him in jail and they're going, do you want to have anybody speaking up for you? It's crazy times, man. It is crazy times. It's, it's only allowed because people don't fucking understand. They say, oh, well, you know, she doesn't really say about communist. She said she's going to do this and this and this. What do you think they're going to say? Do you think they're going to stand on a podium and say, oh, guess what? I'm communist. I actually am going to do this. The reason she can't give any commitments about any of her policy is because if they she told you the real policy, you fucking be like, no way. Yeah. Yeah, man. These are these people intend on doing more and more and more of what they've already done. And that's that, dude. And people who vote for her, you know, they think, oh, I'm going to vote for women's rights. You're not even voting for women's rights because Kamala can't do anything at the federal level to fucking restore Roe versus way. Can't happen. It's already at the state level. It's already done. It's not coming back. It is what the fuck it is. You're going to have to handle it at the state level. Outside of that, if you vote for her, you're voting for yourself to burn your own life down. And that's what it is. It's either we're going to become the greatest country of all time or we're going to burn like every other third world country. And it might take a year or might take two years and might take 10 years like it took in El Salvador or took in Venezuela, but it's going to happen. Because after this, they're going to import so many people that conservative Americans and people with American values can never win an election again because they're going to let all these people vote forever. Yeah, guys, jump down to the comments. Let us know. Have you voted already? Yes or no. And if you are out there in the lines while you're listening, man, drop us some love in the comments. Let us know. Let me set us get to, let's check out some of these comments. This first comment comes from a dairy dog. It says, uh, bro did 75 trings. Who did? Some of Josh. Well, what? Yeah. That was like a double. He did a couple of faces. He was more than just 75 days. I don't know, man. He went there and came all the way back. I'm glad he's back. Yeah. Yep. Uh, this next comment comes from a. This next comment comes from young pain 031. Uh, says, uh, I just received your book in the mail the day before yesterday. I'm already on the 75 heart section looking forward to starting that challenge. Can't wait. I share every episode since I started watching about a month ago. And eating better, go on to the gym, reading as much as I can and some. The progress I've made in my life thus far has been a macular. Thank you for being real as fuck. I pray my local gas station stocks their fridges with one first form ASAP. I keep bringing the bill there. All right. Let's go. That's what we need. You guys ask what, uh, how to support the show, man, go into your local convenience store, your local grocery store and tell them, you know, if you want to be one of these first four menager drinks, but they don't have them. They better get them right. Come back. You know, that's how you support the show. I told me you're going to do that BLM discount. That's right. Yeah. Thanks for the support, young pain. Yeah, man. Appreciate it, man. Guys, we appreciate all of you, man. Not a lot of hate there today. Yeah. There wasn't much. So we do appreciate you guys over being real ass fans. Keep liking. Keep commenting. Make sure you guys are subscribed and hit that bell notification on the YouTube to stay up to date with the latest episodes from really up with that being said, let's get to our second headline. Um, I got a little bit more epoxy for you. A little more what? Apocrysthy. Apocrysthy? Yeah. And then all we get pretty much is that not a most annoying thing in the fucking world? Bro. All right. Let's see it. This is, uh, this is somebody re-nigging on their re what? Renigging. Well, that sounds racist. Well, the other, I mean, they used to call it something else, but they stopped calling it that used to be Indian giving. It used to be what? Riggin? Huh? No, Indian giving. Oh, yeah, they're going to be an Indian giver. Right? Now that I was re-nigging. Got it. Listen, I don't don't hate to play a hate the game. All right. Oh, but they, uh, they had this, uh, this, this rich white liberal. Um, just just check the clip. Dropping a legal immigrants off at a rich liberal's house. Check this out. So you would do anything for like all the illegal stuff. I think we have to be fair. Guys, this is great. I think we found a new home for you guys. What, guys? There you go. That's a little bus. Yeah. I don't understand what you just saw. Oh, there's all the immigration. They're going to move into your house. They are not. What do you mean? You just said you wanted to support everyone, though. I don't know. No, they're not. They're good. I don't want that. Like, just like you guys did before. Thank you very much. Can they stay for dinner? Wait, what we have your signature? You guys got to drive back down south back to home, people. Back to home, people. Hey, that's the fucking truth. I'm tired of you. OK, all of these people that root for this shit are not really about it. Every single person who votes for Kamala Harris should have to host migrant families in their home. Period. That's it. They all believe that someone else is going to do the job or that, you know, as long as they don't see it in their neighborhood, they get to be a good person when they go to the brunch and they get to talk to all their rich fucking friends with their pinkies up, drinking champagne, a 10 30 in the fucking morning. OK, while other places in the country got a deal with the crime, got to deal with the gangs, got to deal with the sexual assaults that happen all the time. OK, but this woman, she doesn't have to and she gets to go to brunch and say, look how good I am. I am such a noble, virtuous person. Look at me in my $700 pants and my $400 shirt. And, you know, I love people from other places. It's so culture, I love culture until it comes to her mother fucking door. Right? She doesn't have the house fucking skin. She got the house. Because these are the same people that are fucking racist, bro, under the radar. OK, they fucking vote for all the minority, quote unquote, minority causes. But yet, they're afraid to communicate or associate or even be around minority people. Right? How many black people do you think she fucking sees on a daily basis? Oh no. Fucking none, dude. None. And when she does, because of the cops, yes. Yes. That's the, that is the people we're dealing with here, dude. And these people like that woman watches MSNBC or CNN all day, she fucking hates Donald Trump. He's the anti-Christ. They believe all of these edited clips and all of this shit. But yet, when they get asked to contribute to the solution to the problem, they fucking freak the fuck out. And that's exactly the problem in this country. Yeah, bro. Like, dude, I would never vote for anything that I wasn't willing to incorporate into my existence. Right? Like I'm not voting for fucking illegal migrants. You know why? Because I don't want them to fucking house. I don't have no problems that you want to be your house. Nope. You want them fucking out? No. Z-Shine. You're from over in India, bro. You want to make your fucking place? Absolutely not. Yeah, get fucked. I got three people in my house now. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of it. You're a minority in your own house, bro. You're going to grow up and have three mad black women at your fucking house. You're fucked, dude. You might as well move in with me. I mean, if you're saying. You can rotate. Everybody here, see, we'll take you. Yeah. We'll take you. You know what? You're a citizen. You do a lot of good. You pay your taxes. You cook good. Like, peace and quiet. That's right. You tell you sometimes you're funny. I can cook. Yeah. You get cooked good. Cook good, bro. You can swim. Suddenly all your things in your house go missing. Yeah, things in my house will go missing like my snacks. We've been hosting migrants since like the 70s. It was called foreign exchange students. Oh, yeah, that's right. Yep. But I mean, like we sent them back to home. Yeah, man. Bro, at least we're not liars, man. Like you got to say whatever the fuck we, whatever you want about us. But we ain't lying. And you know we ain't. You know it's a fucking truth. On a serious note, I would like to add one thing to the whole discussion. When we pulled up that graph of all those celebrities who were advocating for Harris, how many of them came out, not even talking about help, how many of them came out and asked citizens to go and help in places which were affected by natural disaster. None. None. Not a single one. Dude, we still have North Carolina a complete fucking disaster, dude. Our government's still not taking care of these people. And by the way, they just sent another $450 fucking million on Friday over to Ukraine. Yeah, where's Lorella? That is right. Yeah. Where's fucking Julia Roberts talking about that shit or Brad Pitt or fucking anybody? Where are your mother fucking asses? How come you're not doing these PR fucking moves to North Carolina? Because bro, you don't give a fuck about actual Americans. Because dude, those are real Americans. Those are people who have been here for fucking ever. They don't give a fuck about those people. They only care about themselves and the people who fucking own them and tell them what to say. Jennifer Lopez. Jennifer Lopez making an emotional cry baby holds drama about like, oh, we should be emotional about it. We should go out and vote and supporting Harris. But then Taylor Swift, all these people who make big posts, eyeless catalytic, all that stuff. Where's the support for actual American citizens? I agree. And dude, by the way, you know, when we, when we, this is why Hollywood's failing, dude, this is why Hollywood movies are terrible. They're getting rejected. They're remaking all these movies into these woke, woke is dead, bro. And these people are fucking, they don't care. If they actually gave a fuck about people for real, and I'm not saying all of them, there's probably a few that are good people, you know, like Mel Gibson, alright? People who are not captured by the fucking cabal, okay? But the reason that those people don't say shit is because they truly don't give a fuck. And when they come out and they go to bat, like when Oprah did for Hawaii or these people, the COVID cause or whatever, the only causes they advocate for causes they are told to advocate for and they do nothing of their own heart. It's just I'm going to appease my master. My master is going to make me famous and put me in movies and I'm going to make money. And outside of that, I'm not saying shit because I don't give a fuck about anything. I like to pretend that I care. I like to get on TV with some fucking thick ass glasses and pretend like I'm intellectual, looking like I'm 100 years older than I look at my movies, right? Cause you all look like shit. Let's be real, alright? And by the way, no one cares about you anymore. You've diluted the trust. You fucked the trust of the people. You've ruined your own careers. And yes, some of you might come back, but most of you won't. And this is why people don't give a fuck about him because they can genuinely see that there is no actual integrity in these people at all. And the fact that none of those people have come out for fucking the people in North Carolina is absurd, bro, even as just a human. Like there's people I know that are giving fucking $50. You know what I'm saying? Like these people can't afford their own shit and they're giving $50 fucking bucks. My neighbor who I don't talk too much often, but is always there for help. I didn't see him for a couple days. So when he, when I saw him next, I asked like, where are you? I didn't see you much. He said like he went to those places on his own dying. Yeah. To help just to that. Just to that. Yes. To that from our team. And those people who are like worth millions and millions. Jeric Connell. You know Jeric Connell. Jeric Connell who was an executive here at first form and he moved on to other things. He's a great friend of us, great friend of mine. Fucking love the dude. His aspirations as 19 year old kid was to be a Border Patrol agent. Like this is one of the best people I fucking know because he's a service oriented individual. And bro, he's been there for like fucking three weeks now doing everything he can. Bro, this guy's not, he's not rich. You know what I'm saying? He's there living out of his fucking car, helping people. You got these fucking douchebags on TV going to bat for Kamala Harris who's ruined the fucking country. Fuck that. And he's also not in those locations helping. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they're ready to go out and stage and cry for Harris. Yeah. But they would not even put one single message asking Americans to help each other. Yeah. Not even that. Yeah. No, I know, bro. It's bizarre to me. It's not bizarre because they're controlled. These people are controlled. And if you think about the person who would sell their soul and sell their integrity for money and fame, it makes perfect sense as to why they're not saying anything because they're not told to say anything. That's right. Yep. So you got this. I thought something was interesting. I saw this clip. I thought it was just awesome. I'm just exposing the bullshit. And so let's expose some more. You got CNN. I said, Chump's been, you know, he's been going all over the country today. I think he had like, I'm going to say five or six stops a day alone in different states. Yeah. He's exhausted. Bro, he's rolling. Yeah. He's fucking, he's seen now. He's going to decline. Yeah. Yeah. Right. You know, but CNN, you know, our buddies over at CNN, we love those guys. We love them. Yeah. Fact check. Fact check. Trump begins final full day of campaign with repeat lies about immigration and jobs. Okay. What are the lies? It's interesting. Yeah. The first one, they said that, you know, Trump repeated his false claim that 21 million people crossed the border under the Biden administration, not 21 million people. It's just 11 million. Oh. So half half of that. Yeah. Okay. Well, how do we know if they're undocumented, how many people came across? How do we know there, Mr. CNN? And by the way, 11 millions too much, 1 millions too much, 1 is too much. Okay. And if you guys don't fucking get Trump in office, real shit, that 11 will be 60. All right. That's it. It's just 11 million. Yeah. It's okay. That you know, the other one was that Trump repeated his false claim that he had 571 miles of the border wall that was built on the southern border. It was just 458 miles. Repeated lies. He repeated lies. Yeah, but you know what he did do. He did say there was very fine people on both sides of a white supremacy rally. Yeah. Like Obama said this morning, where's the fact check on that bitch? Yeah, right. No, everyone find that one. You want to find that one. You know, I'm gonna tell you what, if they get in power, we're riding this shit till we go to jail. I'm just saying real, dude. I don't give a fuck. If you think you're gonna fucking stop me or stop you or stop any of these people, we ain't stopping, bro. You give us four more years to talk about shit. And if we go to jail, we go to fucking jail. Hey, you know, I get server jelly. Yeah. I'm a jelly guy. You are? Yeah, great. Great. Wait, jelly or jam? Jelly. I think I'm more of a jam guy. What's the difference? Like the real fruit? Is that the difference? Like jam has actual like the fruit chunks in it. So you want chunks? I like the chunks. Yeah. Wait, what do you mean by that? Yeah, that's right. That's gross, dude. Wait, what's gross about it? You know, like a good raspberry jam, bro. Like, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. You got those. Like you eat that ass? Okay. Alright. Alright. I'd make the dude eat some corn or something. I don't do that. They got corn and prison. I have no aspirations to eat the two, bro. I'm alright. That's going to be you and jail, bro. Today on real AF, certain DJ goes server jelly. Fuck, bro. My cellmate ate corn last night. So today, that's fucking disgusting. I know it is. It's going to be us. You got me my fucking cellmate. No, bro. No, I'm coming from the trans. With the top bunker, you want the bottom bunker? I'm getting one of the fucking trans deals. Got the over the ladies jail, dude. And it's Andrea. That's right. It's Andrea, man. The fucking minute I think I'm going to jail, I'm transitioning. Fuck that. I got no shape, dude. I mean, you got to be arrested being a mini skirt, dude. I don't give a fuck. It's ma'am. Ma'am, your testicles are showing. Yeah. Oh, man. I got my lines. And that's one of them. Hey, yeah, it's a, that's a good chest plate, man. Oh, man, bro. Where is the fact check on Obama, bro? Where are these fact checks? And I love how all of a sudden in 2020, we started getting fact checked on everything. But never their side. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. What happened? You know, but what was interesting, if we wanted to a fact check, listen to this crazy statistic here. Biden Harris delivered more migrants than jobs in October. More migrants came into this country illegally in the month of October than there were jobs created for Americans. What's that going to do? Hold on. What does that do? Let's just play a little game. You got this circle. Inside this circle, there is X amount of jobs. And then you flood it with more people than jobs. All right, what happens inside that circle? Chaos. Total fucking fuckery. Okay. Third world conditions in a matter of months, because you have people that can survive and you have more people that can't. So what happens in the situation where you have more people that can't survive than you do people who have jobs? What happens to the people who have shit? What happens? They get it. They get jacked. They get become victims of crime. And eventually, those people join the people of poverty. And that is basically what we have going on all over the country in many different places. And it's about to get way, way worse. You think we have quote unquote, gettos now? Fuck, that's going to look like Beverly Hills, bro, compared to what the fuck we're getting ready to have if certain things don't happen. It's just so mind-boggling to me, man, too. It's like, you know, CNN wants to run the fact check, oh, it's not 21 million people. It's just 11. Just like I said, bro, one's too many. It is, you know, but like, but like, hey, there's 11 million people that are here and there's kind of the, that should not be here in this country. And that's not like the, the focus of the art. How many states, look up this, look this up? How many states have a population less than 11 million people? There are only eight states that are more than 11 million people. Okay. So 42 states that that had, there's 11 million people, which is greater than the population of 42 fucking states. Really think about that, about what they just did to the country. Damn. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So how many people live in the state of Missouri? We got about a little bit over six million. Okay. So double that. Double every single mother fucking person you see going up and down the street, you see driving from here to fucking Kansas City, living in every single fucking town. Every single person you see at the gas station at the grocery store at the Cardinals game or the chiefs game and double that. And that's what they've let in. Think about that. See, when you think about it like that, it's a lot different. You see what I'm saying? Geez, man. Now think of it with 60 million, which is what the fuck it's going to be if Kamala gets in office. Bro. And like, these are not, because they always try to paint this picture too. These are, you know, these are good people. It's all dudes that are coming here to get it, you know, that they're going to be our next doctors and our next fucking like, yeah. Okay. It's over 80% men. Where are these men going to find their women to reproduce? Where do you think that's going to come from? Oh, that's going to come from your fucking women. Whether they want to or not, that's the culture these people come from. They don't come from a culture of civility. They come from a culture of fucking straight up savagery. All right. And I'm not saying all of them, there might be, there's probably some good people. Okay. Just like, there's some good people on both sides, right? There's some good, hard of people in there for sure. Like there's, it's not worth the risk of everything else to allow those, those people could come in just like Z-Shine's come in or Mendoza's come in. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, man. Guys, jumping on this conversation, let's know what you guys think. It's just 11 million. Let's go down in the comments. That being said, let's get to our third and final headline. Headline number three. You guys have actually brought this up a little bit. We've obviously covered the disasters that happen in North Carolina, Florida, things like that. I want to go across the globe, shortly, because there was a disaster that happened somewhere else. And the response, there's frustrations in both places. The response has been completely different from the people. Let's check this out. Let's go to Spain, okay? An angry Spain, steel reeling from floods faces more rain. So there was a massive flood that happened in Spain, okay? And there was some interesting things that happened. But let's dive into this a little bit. As families, along Spain's Mediterranean coasts took to the country's airwaves to plea for help finding lost loved ones in the aftermath of last week's devastating floods, the government on Monday deployed hundreds more troops to help with the search for victims according to the emergency authorities. Thousands of soldiers and police officers deployed to the region to help with rescue and recovery efforts were stymied by up to a foot more of rain in some places on Monday. Spain's meteorological agency had recorded about six inches of rain by 11 a.m. in Barcelona and warned that the city could get another five inches later in the day. Now there was a couple of issues, okay? And why the people, why the citizens of Spain were pissed off is because apparently Spain's meteorological agency started issue weather warnings, days before the storm intensified and issued a flurry of them last Tuesday morning when the rains were the heaviest. But in the regional government in Valencia, which controls the formal alert system, did not send out a text message with an alert until after 8 p.m. that day when the flood waters were already rising. So that was some miscommunication, noncommunication. I saw this on a couple, I follow a couple of people from Spain. Yeah. And I saw this in their stories. The piss is bad. It was pretty, it was bad. It's real bad. It's bad. And so the king of Spain, King Felipe, he got, he decided to try to go and do one of his press briefings, photo ops, you know what I'm saying? I'm here for the people helping out. And he got, he got booed, salt it, got eggs thrown on them, mud thrown on them, bricks were being thrown at them. Let's just watch this clip. There's a failure there. There's a failure there. Listen, that's what should happen when things like this happen. That's what should happen. The, the, listen, the ruling class of all countries is out of touch. They're completely out of touch. There's been way too long without public accountability for the way that the common person is treated across the globe. A real leader, someone who really cared about people wouldn't show up with a guy holding an umbrella for him and, you know, you, him dressed in nice clothes and shit, you know what he'd show up and fucking overalls and be shoveling the mud out of the street immediately. And that would fucking show people like, hey, dude, I care about you. And you know what? Our leaders should do things like that. I love the fact that Donald Trump gets out there and does some of these things, but he's 70 fucking eight years old, okay? But a young man or a younger person, you know, you should be doing the work first. You should be showing people how to get it done. And not for a while. Like, bro, if I was president, motherfucker, I could tell you this. I'd be in North Carolina driving my fucking bobcat, picking up shit, doing this, doing what I know how to do and how to contribute. You know what I mean? Like, that is an important optic for people to rally behind. And everybody knows, yes, I'm not going to be there for fucking two weeks. But like, bro, let's let me do my part. Let me do a little bit. Let me let's get this going. Let me help you get organized. Let me get you the funding. We'll fucking take it from here. That is important from a leader. And that's not happening anywhere globally, dude. Like people, these leaders do not represent, we need a global revolution. What the fuck we need? Because these people are super out of touch, bro. They live cushy lives. They fucking fly around to private planes. They eat steak and lobster and fucking babies probably. Okay. And fuck us how to live our lives. Yeah. They have no fucking clue, bro. They don't pump their own gas. They don't fucking know their own yard. They don't fucking talk to people who struggle ever. And then on top of that, you know, they push down these crazy fucking things. Like, this is the same place just for those who have forgotten or may have not been aware. This is the same place where that lady Irene was advocating for pedophilia. Montero. Yeah. Who said that children have the right to know that they can have sexual relationships with anyone they want based on mutual consent? She's the Spain minister of equality Irene Montero. We played the clip on show. Yeah. You know, and so it's like, you know, but I mean, that's the people. What she's saying to be clear is that little children can say I would like to have sex with that adult. And then that's legal. And then that's legal. Yes. Yes. You absolutelyット. We'll talk about it in another screen. Again, you know, you just have you just mentioned that we have received a lot of Russianzogen factories and so that we are showing them a number of things that a couple of us have ever heard when we asked the community about it to go, is this the only very much information. So I'm a book owner, right? And that's great. So so you're also a character. Yeah. I can see where I went, but I got, you know, great, you know, a style of a style. Not such a blue question, like that foreign book, it's a dangerous thing.可是 Sí comida. Wouldn't you like to ask then just something like this? You've been to Barcelona. It's fucking beautiful. They have some of the most amazing culture, architecture, people that I've ever experienced. I've been a lot of places. And it really sucks to see them struggling with some of the same shit we're dealing with here. It's nice to see them. They did a little something about it, you know, to the best of their abilities. Yeah, I mean, bro, that's the bottom line. The bottom line is, bro, these ruined elites across the globe don't care about the common people at all, bro. They don't care. They don't give a fuck if you're fucking, they don't give a shit about if children die or if there's disease, they don't look at people like people, dude, they look at people like a fungus or an infestation. And if some of them die, good, there's less of them. That's how they think. And dude, people, you guys think these people care about you. They don't fucking care about you. Due to the only reason that I even think that, and by the way, I do believe this. The only reason that I believe Donald Trump cares about us as people is because we have to look at what he gave up to do this. You know what I'm saying? This dude's flying around on fucking his own private luxury business jet. You know what I'm saying? It's not like a fucking G650. This is like a full blown airliner. All right. He's going to the most beautiful properties in the world. Oh, bitch, which by the way, he fucking owns. Okay. He's in every circle of every influential person. And now they all fucking know like him. Okay. He gave up basically a no stress lifestyle to deal with this. And you guys think he doesn't give a fuck about you. You're fucking insane. Yeah. And I don't care what they fucking say about him. That is a big deal. Your actions matter. And you know why most people can't recognize that is because most people don't know how good it is to be that wealthy. I don't understand it. Like I got a taste of it. I'm not I wasn't I'm not on Trump's level, but I'm doing pretty good. Okay. And I can tell you this. Like that's a big sacrifice. It would be a big sacrifice to give up what I do and how I do it to go take that kind of heat and do that kind of shit, especially at 70 fucking years old. You know, it's and I respect it. And I know people, you know, they think what they think. But dude, that's a big deal to me. Yeah, for sure, man. We need more of that as leaders. And we need even more leadership. We need young leaders, Vance, Rama Swami. These guys, those guys, they need to be out in the front lines as Trump's, you know, advocate and fucking, uh, you know, Syrigates to like do this work. And I think they do a good job of that. But I'm just saying like dude, you know, did you see fucking that video of Kamala and her her her fucking boyfriend or husband Doug trying to plan a tree with the shovel? Even know how to fucking hold the shovel, dude. You see Tim Walls try to shoot a gun. Do you see Tim Walls run or move or wave at people? Yeah, he's such a manly man. Tim bucks. You know, if if you know, Trump's going to send them to jail, Tim Walls transitions also. I mean, no doubt. I can't hold that against anybody. Because I would. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, we got our final second of the show. We got thumbs up or dumb as fuck. Is that three already? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we need to ask some more. Do we get people all the time? We're like, I wish the show was longer. I'm like, well, fuck you do all day. You can't listen to like how the fuck do you guys listen? And these three hour four hour shows. Yeah, I don't know either bro. You know, like people send and bro, these are some of my friends that make these shows, you know, but I just can't like Sean Ryan doing a six hour fucking interview. Like he's just, I don't, I don't have the capacity dude. I love I love those shows. I love Rogan show. I love Sean show. I love both of them. But man, that's just a long time. It's a very long. You guys want us to do three hour shows for real. I'm more like a three minutes type of person. Yeah, I heard. Yeah. All right guys, I'm thumbs up or dumb as fuck. We like bears here for some reason. I don't know why. Yeah. My bears are always in the news. Bears. Yeah, bears. That's because there's these fucking these fucking turds around here call me the bear. You're the either either. Uh, let's say don't do you know that you know that? I didn't know that. Yeah, that really. Yeah, they call you the bear. Yeah. That's the secret code name for me around here. You know that you fucking liar. I don't know that. Yeah, I have a code that kind of fucking know. Yeah. The bears out. I'm not in the you know too. See, I'm not in the main chat. I'm not in the main chat. I'm not in the chat. See how this works is somebody texts in the chat. They said the bear is out. You know what that means? Don't fucking talk to you. He's looking for the honey. Yeah. So these fucking these fucking turds around here, they think I don't fucking know and I found out like five years ago, I just kept it myself. I kind of like it. I mean, it's the worst things. It could be worse. It could be gone. Black bear. Yeah, you're stealing everybody's bike. What? What? I'm your cub. What? We like bears. Let's talk about it. Our thumbs up are dumb as fuckhead. Now reads shocking moment bear smacks woman in the face on the restaurant patio. Smacks of shit out over actually. What? Yeah. It's real. All right. Well, so you shouldn't fuck with the bear. Don't fuck with don't fuck with the bear. That's right. It's a very wise saying. You know it. What? Don't blank the bear. Don't. Don't blank the bear. Yeah. What is the goes on the blank? Don't shoot the bear. No. Don't don't poke the bear. Yeah. Yeah. Because the bear smack you in the fucking face. There's a saying to you about like the horn. You don't poke the horn. It's nice or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. But I would I would you rather poke a bear or horn. It's nice. I'm allergic to I'm not allergic to bears. I'd rather poke the horn. It's nice. I'm allergic to those. I buy. Yeah. Well, you'll die with the bear too. It's true. Yeah. I just won't poke either. Yeah. All right. Let's probably go. Let's dive into this though. A pair of diners were stunned when a black bear joined them at their table and hit a woman in the face at the Chippenic Hotel in San Pedro de Garland. Oh, how the fuck you know how to say that? What? Chip and Nique. By you can't say it's literally chip in Q. That's what I should say. Chip and Q. Chip and Q Hotel. It looks like chip and then like a Nique. All right, man. Chip and Nique. A Nique and Chip and Nique. That sounds like a porno name. It's not about with either. Reek a chip and Nique destroys. But yeah, this hotel in San Pedro de Garza Garcia, a city in northeastern Mexico state of Nuevo, neon. That's not Nuevo. That's Nuevo. Nuevo Leon. That's right. There we go. Now, wild footage shows the creature leaning on the table and nibbling at a plate of food as woman set frozen next to her male companion. A hotel worker in a security guard surrounded the table with pipes as part of an attempt to shoe the bear away. I'm an attorney. I took a swipe at the female's, female diner's face. Here's the video, bro. What the fuck? Hey, hey. Holy shit, man. Where is this in Mexico? Mexico. I didn't even know they had black bears down there. Oh, did they? Did he really see it? He's like, in a face like that? He's scratch your face or anything or just like, I don't know. Bro, you won't move when the bear's coming over to eat your food. Hey, hey, hey, hey. It looks like you just slapped the shadow. Like you just like an open palm. She's smiling. I'm just like that's blood though. Yeah, she's cool. Bro, must have been spring break. Have those black bears down there in that season. Yeah, probably, man. They're probably senior frogs. Get fucked up. That motherfucker's been a senior frog all night. He had two being them tall drinks. He thought he was going to come in and just do whatever he wants. This shit cold. Listen, I understand. I see what happened when they brought him the bill though. Both fuck ran. Oh, fuck, dude. Adam head out. She, he looked at that lady. He said, you're a kid. Holy shit, dude. That's crazy that they just sat there. They just sitting there chilling, bro. Like, I don't get it, bro. Bro, bears are not friendly, man. What is the shit with people and fucking animals? Like these people that go up to bison at fucking Yellowstone and then get gourd thrown up in the air and then act like, I'm a lot of fucking, I can't believe that. It just happened. And then when they get mad at the animal, yeah, we didn't put it down. Like, Harambe, bro. Like, come on, man. Speaking of putting animals down. Fuck. What? They're going to raid someone's house for a fucking pet squirrel. I did see that. I saw the fuck, dude. You have this dude has a train squirrel for seven years. They fucking raided him for not having the proper paperwork. This is a train squirrel, man. And they euthanized him. No. Dude, and they said for, they killed the squirrel and they killed the raccoon, which I'm not cool raccoons right now because they killed my ducks. So I don't know if I cared too much about that. But the squirrel did. Yeah. Fuck you raccoons. But the squirrel would hurt nobody. And this dude, if you've seen the videos of the squirrel, yeah, it's super train. Like he was super trained and like entertaining all these people. And they raided the house from what I read, 10 agents of the wildlife, wildlife agents or whatever. This is what I heard. Raided the house, took the shit, killed the fucking squirrel. Okay. And then said it was because of illegal paperwork. But then we got fucking millions of people all over the fucking country. We know motherfucking paperwork. You guys gonna fucking go kill them too. You got a lot of squirrels out there. Bro, it's fucked up, dude. Yeah. And if you think those people won't come for you for doing something fucked up, you're wrong, dude. That straight up kill you. It's crazy. Yeah, dude. It's unbelievable, dude. It's unbelievable. That's crazy. Sad, sad. I couldn't imagine that, dude. Imagine like someone coming in your house and saying, you don't have your dog registered, taking your dog and fucking killing it and be like, too bad. Like who makes those decisions? Like who just released the squirrel? Bro, who makes these decisions? This is heartless, wrong, shit. And like this is bureaucracy and government as a whole, right? Someone up at the top says, these are the rules. Go do this. And it's probably someone who doesn't have to do this themselves or never has done this themselves, telling people and then those people instead of saying, this is right or wrong. And then acting appropriately, I'm just following orders. Let me tell you something. We're going to be entering the most turbulent time in America no matter what happens today at the elections. And there's going to be a lot of time right now where people who have the authority, the biggest, most powerful authority, meaning they have the ability to take your freedom away from you or take your life away. Those people, whether they be police, sheriff, national guard, military, you guys are going to have some hard times ahead in terms of what is morally okay. And what you are willing to do under the guise of just following orders. And that goes for if Trump wins and if Kamala wins. Okay. Remember, you took a pledge to the Constitution. You took a pledge what's right for America, not to a person or their authority. You know, I had an interesting conversation with somebody in DMs. And it was somebody who was saying to me, I can't believe how much you fucking love Trump and this and I don't know what they were fucking talking shit. And I'm like, I don't love Trump. I don't love, I don't pledge loyalty to Trump. I don't pledge loyalty to anyone. I pledge loyalty to what's best for our country in the moment. And I can make decisions right now that are best to move us forward. And then maybe if I think it's best to move another direction in a different election or at a different time, I might vote for someone else. This isn't about loyalty to a candidate. This is about loyalty to our country and what's best for it. And when you guys don't make votes because you think, oh, Trump's not going to do everything I want or he's going to be another this or another that or you think Kamala is going to do this or that, you have to think how many steps would it take for us to get ahead to a country of your choosing, of how you want it to look. Trump may not be the guy that gets you all the way there, but he's the guy, in my opinion, that will move our country forward the way I want it to go. And a lot of his things I don't agree with, but I do agree with enough to decide that that's the best decision now. And we as Americans and people globally need to stop being hoodwinked into supporting an individual candidate and start thinking of what's best right now. And then the next time you get a say with a vote or however you take action in real life, you got to think again, what's best now? And that might be not Donald Trump down the road. That might be someone else. That might be this. We have all gotten into this rhythm of being brainwashed into supporting a person as opposed to the cause or the country. And dude, this isn't about a person. This is about our country or livelihood and what's good for us. So, yeah, man, if you haven't voted by now, you need to get the fuck up. You need to go vote, especially men. Okay, because a lot of men have this idea that someone else is going to do it for them. And that's why we are where we are in this country. We have too much passivity. We have too many grown men who think that all the other men are going to take care of it for them. And they're not. You have a civic duty. You need to get the fuck up. You need to go to the fucking polls right now and vote. Got a own bank row. Can't vote. There's a note here. Shot case. Closed.
