What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate goodbye to the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today. We have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking minute. That's what we're going to do. That's what CTI stands for. If you hadn't figured it out it means crews the internet. This is where we put up topics on the screen. We speculate on what the truth is what may not be true and then we talk about how we the people can actually work to solve some of these problems. Other times we have Q and A.F. That's where you submit questions and we answer them for those of you that don't know this is an entrepreneur personal development success based podcast and always has been so we want you guys to ask your questions about how to get better and then we want to help you get better by answering them on the show so. You can submit your questions a couple different ways the first way is you can email those questions in to ask Andy at Andy for sell it I come or you can go on YouTube under the Q and A.F. episodes which typically are on Mondays and you can drop your question in the comments and we'll pick some from there as well. The question is about anything I know this is a business personal development entrepreneurship success based show but we also try to cover some of the things going on in the world and that show sometimes as well so whatever you got send our way real talk real talk is five to 20 minutes of me giving you some real talk full length is what you see on most other podcasts where we just have a guest sitting here we have a conversation and then we have 75 hard verses 75 hard versus where somebody who has completed 75 hard and change their life comes in. And then it talks about how they were before how they are after and how you can take you from where you are now and become what it is you're trying to be by fixing some basic things like developing mental toughness grit confidence fortitude the ability to persevere and you could show and teach yourself how to adhere through the process of discipline to any plan that you lay out and that's what we cover on that show and if you're interested in the 75 hard program or the end of the day. The entire live hard program which I highly recommend it's for free on episode 208 of the audio feed so if you go to episode 208 you can get the program for free there is a book on my website called 75 hard it's not required but it gets you in through the weeds for those of you that like to know the ins and outs and I would like to let you know I do have another book launching at the first of January. So that book is going to be very special I think you guys are going to like it it's a much different book than 75 hard so look for that around the beginning of the year another thing that you will be interested knowing I know that I told you guys we were going to launch the day in the life concept last Sunday it just wasn't where we wanted it to be there was some some things that we wanted to change and figure out and so we're actually going to be premiering that on YouTube next Wednesday night so this coming up. Wednesday what's the date on that. Was it like the 18th okay will be doing that on the 18th in the evening so you can mark your calendars for that and obviously we'll put out some more announcements for that as well. For that you know with all that being said we have this thing that we call the fee the fee is very simple if you like the show if it makes you laugh it makes you think it gives you a new perspective please share the show we call that paying the fee you'll notice I don't want ads on the show. I don't let people pay me and then have them tell me what I can and can't say I don't do those things I just come on here and give my honest opinion and I appreciate you guys that allow me to do that and give me the grace to be myself and say what I think because I think it's important in today's world and we have this thing so like you know we like to say here on the show it's don't be a hoe. Show all right lots of big lots of big announcements for you guys coming up we have lots of big projects that I've been working on and we've been working on as a team for literally the last two and a half years so the new book there's a number of new books there's not just one there's five new books that are going to be launching. Two new YouTube concepts some other things a big project you know you guys like to you guys like to ask me about where to get this hat. What it means and what it stands for that question will be answered for you guys pretty soon so we have a lot of stuff coming out so keep an eye out and we'll let you guys know as it comes yeah you know that's one thing that I think most people. I'm aren't really aware of the amount of attention detail that you put in and anything you do you know but it's about just holding that standard man it's like you know when you deliver something it's going to be fucking perfect yeah you only have you know you got your reputation that's it man and I don't know what you're doing. Like if I have to disappoint people by holding things off or or making them better that's what I do it's you know in the beginning when you're just getting started you kind of got a launch and you got to do shit but with the audience that we have in the amount of time I've been doing this I have enough credibility with everybody that people know that if I hold it back there's a reason why yeah so it is what it is I'm excited man here's a lot of cool projects man yeah a lot of cool projects but I'm at CTI yeah we got a lot of interest and stuff going on. A lot of updates for you guys but I wanted to jump into something first before we get to our main headlines do you remember this guy Senator Minindas oh Bob yeah well he's got charged with acting as a foreign agent it's official now this is the guy with the gold bars go ball has all the cash you stuff in envelopes inside of you know let let them in jacket from that home run the ball still falling yeah yeah this guy yeah so well all of this stuff's going on and out of the way. I'm a world it's important guys you guys just take a second to look at what other things are happening this I thought this was an interesting thing that came up especially with the countries that are you know tied into this right I think there's some interesting connections that have not been made yet time will only tell us about this just a little bit so Senator Bob Minindas was a Democrat out of New Jersey was hit with a new felony charge on Thursday as a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment that included an additional count of allegedly acting as a foreign agent Minindas his wife and one of the businessmen involved in the alleged robbery scheme quote willfully and knowingly combined conspired confederated and agreed together and with each other to have Minindas act as an agent of the Egyptian government the indictment said prosecutors alleged that Minindas quote provided sensitive US government information and took other steps that secretly aided the government of Egypt now the original indictment against Minindas his wife and three businessmen was unsealed last month in a alleged that he and his wife had a corrupt relationship with New Jersey businessmen while Hana Jose Eurebi and Fred Davies who allegedly gave the Senator bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars now according to the DOJ the bribes were intended to protect the businessmen and to benefit Egypt quote those bribes included cash gold payments toward a home mortgage compensation for a low or no show job a luxury vehicle and other things of value the indictment said federal authorities reportedly found gold bars and cash stuff throughout the senator's home that were traced back to the business man Mininda as allegedly work with any update on this to be I know we covered this a couple of weeks ago man but it's not surprising at this point right I mean when are they going to do Joe Biden well I got that look coming up later okay well I mean that's the question I see okay let's go after these low-level guys let's hold them accountable the things that everybody's doing because here's how I read this situation I read this situation as this guy because this is a club and this is a club that they're in that we're not and just like George Carlin likes to say yeah I like to say we live yeah they're in a club and we ain't in it and that's reality and for someone to get expelled from the club they usually have to do something to disrupt something else or some sort of business that's happening for the other members of the club and so we're not doing something yeah he did something to piss everybody off yeah okay because all of these people do this and this is what people have to understand every single person in our government with the exception of very few people very few people are on the take all right that is the system that has been created over the course of time when we first started our country I'm sure there was a genuine care for the country I'm sure there were people who were serving I'm sure there were people who actually went into government with the idea of I want what's best for America but over the course of the last 240 plus years that's eroded and we've gotten corruption and we have this situation now where almost all the members of our government with the exception of very few are on the take in one form or another and the structure of how you must run to even get into office almost creates this system of corruption because they have to go out and they have to raise money to run ads and the money to run ads cost a lot of money and so they can only go out and procure one or two of these big donors to run their ads for them which could sometimes cost tens hundreds of millions of dollars and in the case of like big time presidential right you know it could be billions right so we have a system that doesn't work because it's predicated upon the idea that we have to have a whole ton of money to get our name out to get into office and so if we want corruption to end we have to stop the process of them being able to raise money to run ads what if all the politicians all of them could not actually run political ads they couldn't run ads on TV they couldn't run ads on radio they couldn't run ads in print and they had to actually go out and campaign and figure out how to get their name out there grassroots yes okay so that would change things because we will make it illegal for them to raise money now when they get in there they're not be holding to these people and what a lot of people don't understand how this works you know these big pharma companies have so much money because they it's like this big chicken or the egg puzzle right the pharma companies have become so powerful that they donate to all the political campaigns now they don't make big sums to the political campaigns so when they when these people get into office they understand if I'm going to run again and I'm going to become congressman or a senator again I'm going to continue to need that money because I was only able to get it from these one or two guys right so over the course of their making laws and their their votes they're always that that is always at the forefront of their mind they're like okay I can't vote this way because this will piss off this donor or I can't vote that way because this will piss off this donor and what ends up happening is we have a government that does not operate in the interest of us but operates in the interest of these big giant companies and that's what people are failing to understand these people make so much money because they own the government who does not make any laws to regulate them so they can continue to make more money so that they continue to donate to these political campaigns and so it creates this big cycle of decisions that are not in our interest and I would assume that this guy here did something to piss everybody off yeah okay and when we take that a step further to like what Biden's been accused of doing we're talking about actual countries paying him and his family for policy decisions all right that is treason that is treason dude so we have a corrupt system that has to be cleaned up you know and the reason it doesn't get cleaned up is because the people who are in charge of cleaning it up these decisions are not in their personal financial interest so how can we expect the government to clean itself up when they're all getting rich off the policy decisions that they make it's never going to happen it's never going to happen the only way it's going to happen is if people demand it and I mean everybody and this is what I talk about what I talked about on the last show and I've talked about consistently for years and years and years you know our division is their strength our unity is our strength okay and until we figure out that our unity is the only thing that's going to solve this corruption problem at scale we're going to continue to get fucked over by these people yeah that's why they push these narratives down the pipe which I'm sure we'll talk a lot about on the show but the point is you know this guy violated the unspoken rules of the club and now he's going to prison probably or whatever right that's how they do it is you have to abide by some other rules in there you know these people are shitbags bro the minute the minute you step outside the line they weaponize every resource they have against you no and this is why so many of you guys are afraid to speak up this is why so many people keep quiet you know this is why whenever you guys share some of my stuff you say stuff like this level and hate them bro love them or hate them that's some weak shit like that shows what what does that say to people that says I don't really know if I stand with this level and my hate him he makes some good points no motherfucker they're great points otherwise you wouldn't be wanting to share him but the fact that you're not willing to stand on those things and not willing to say this is what I believe and this is what I stand for is the difference between these people continuing to fucking do what they do to us and us getting our power back like you have every right to have an opinion you have every right to have a stance and not only is it a right to have an opinion or a stance you have an obligation to voice those and they've continued to push down this narrative that you know the silent majority or being quiet or mining your business when it comes to politics is somehow a virtuous thing why do you think they teach you when you're a kid well it's it's rude to talk about politics because they don't want people talking about it right they don't want people having discussions because the more discussions people have the more fuckery becomes obvious to everybody around them what do they and what do they want you talking about you know I'm saying well they want you talking about Kim Kardashian right they want you talking about the flavor of the day whatever the fuck it is whatever they're feeding you on the news that's what they want you to talk about yeah but the point is it's like dude until you guys wake up and start to become like real Americans again and understand your duty that your duty is to stand up and have an opinion to speak up we're going to continue to fail we're going to continue to be ruled over by a bunch of tyrants that that do not have our interests in mind and not only do they not have our interests in mind they have the zero problem fucking us over to get whatever it is they want you know I'm very evident man you know stop apologizing for your viewpoints yeah it's real shit man yeah I thought I was just bringing that up interesting topic there but uh we do got some really really good stuff down the pipelines let's get into it guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you can find them link there if you're watching on YouTube check down in the description below then you can find these articles link there as well so with that being said headline number one let's get into it headline number one rates netanyahu says Hamas is ISIS as israel prepares for ground invasion of Gaza all right so I guess part two of this developing situation we got going on over in the Middle East so fast facts is diving to it so israel has declared war against Hamas after the terrorist group infiltrated the country on Saturday firing thousands of rockets at residential areas and butchering civilians at least 24 hundred people have been killed in the war including more than 1200 people in Israel and at least 25 Americans Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin netanyahu said Monday Israel is in a quote a war to ensure our existence against quote savages who celebrated the murder of women children and elderly the attack was carried out over the weekend on the holiday of simchat Torah according to israeli's reports around 1500 Hamas terrorists were killed in Israel they estimate that hundreds of militants are among dead in Gaza now let's dive into a lot of these things is going on in the in the world right so I'm sure a lot of people have been seeing you know headlines like this report Hamas left knives inside of his daily children murdered in front of parents right or headlines like this this had our reads at least 40 babies some beheaded found by israel soldiers in Hamas attacked village right we even have the president mr shits and pants come out on the interweb right and he made this statement here let's watch this I mean I I've been doing this a long time I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children I never thought I'd ever anyway I uh but there are countries in the region are trying to be have some help including Arab nations trying to be of some help so anyway okay very confident statement super confident all right now here's the thing so you make that statement right and you got influences everybody was like I mean everybody was jumping on this type of you talk about beheading babies man like that's something that's upsetting some real stuff yeah I'm gonna upset anybody it wouldn't it would create some type of emotional response it's kind of upset anybody anybody with a heart that would have heard that yes it's over yes right okay well there's a small problem yeah I know small problem all right this headlong reads IDF says it won't back up its claim the Hamas to capitated babies in Israel because it is disrespectful for the dead right even CNN this headlong reads Israeli officials says government cannot confirm babies were beheaded in Hamas attack right well how about this white house Biden has not seen or independently confirmed Hamas beheading Israeli children uh the White House clarifies the president of Biden and other U.S. officials have not seen or independently confirmed that Hamas terrorists behead it Israeli children it's very contrary to the video we just saw right where he says I've got confirmed photos I've seen confirmed photos of kids with their heads cut off is what he said what our president United States said that's what he said right now they're walking back these claims even Hamas comes out and issues a statement right completely rejecting this claim saying quote we categorically affirm the falsehood of the fabricated allegations promoted by some Western media outlets the latest of which was the claim of killing children beheading them and targeting civilians Hamas spokesperson is that all Rashique said in the statement published on the group's website let's let's be clear they are targeting civilians okay we're gonna be fair both ways yeah for sure when you fucking fly in and you shoot fucking 200 something people at a fucking concert that's civilians asshole okay so I'm not gonna play in either I'm not picking a side here bro yeah I'm gonna call it both ways that's a fucking lie and apparently the baby's being beheaded as a lie now let you continue it leads to something right so I mean there there is a name for this type yeah it's called a tracety propaganda tracety propaganda I don't know that yeah but people don't yeah we gotta dive into it yeah we gotta dive into it so so this the definition of a tracety propaganda if you guys have not heard of it yet just listen to this tracety propaganda is the spreading of information about the crimes committed by an enemy which can be factual but often includes or features deliberate fabrications or exaggerations this can involve photographs videos illustrations interviews and other farms of information presentation or reporting now this is not a new topic or new theme well no do you would you like me to point some of these out yeah for sure okay well how about the footage that came out of China when cover was announced where people were falling over dead in the street bodies just collapsing people just collapsing in the street okay body bags of trailer yeah right and how about the mass graves that they were pretending to dig in in New York in the park how about how about the the ghost of Kiev and all these crazy war stories when Ukraine popped out okay these are these are this is called a tracety propaganda and the point of the propaganda is to be so atrocious that if you are to ask to see proof of it you are considered a disgusting human being right for me to say well look that sounds horrible that they're cutting these babies heads off and by the way that does sound horrible yes and for me to even ask that and for me to say hey I would like to see pictures of that like think of how that makes someone appear to be right it's so horrible that you cannot even see pictures of it right it's no different than when George Floyd happened and the the cop was on the dudes back and you said well actually he's not blocking the guys airway and it shows in the corner report that he actually died of fentanyl and people still fucking freak like bro right these are the things that they are designed to whip people into mob mentality so that whatever they are trying to do is bought into by the public 100% all right and it's fun you say that man because guys let's take a little history tour we go back to April 6th of 1917 the United States you know you guys remember the disinformation committee that we had yeah before you get into this I don't know if you know this and I don't know if you you might have this in your notes like you know that like this is that baby shit yeah is the same shit they did in the beginning of of desert storm in Iraq yeah same thing they did in Germany too okay we'll keep going because you're on the right track what oh I got you it's the same it's the same nerd it's the same thing because they understand that gets people to buy in yeah 100% but yeah so back and everybody's against that they take the most heinous possible things to sway public morale yeah right so they started this so this is a real thing guys you can go archives.gov right the committee on public information this was the first time the United States that we created our own propaganda actually like a actual committee that was designed and formed to literally literally create these types of propaganda right and there are the ones that started putting pictures out like this right claiming these you know German Nazi soldiers were bayonetting children right none of which were happening and by the way the internet didn't exist then right so this is so so there's no way to debunk these things imagine you are a person living with no internet the only farm of news that you had are the are the the newspapers that are coming across that you'll get every week or so updated right or radio broadcast you had no way to verify anything what they told you was the truth it was so much easier to get people to buy along with certain yeah and they're still operating along that line they still think that they can whip people up and lie to them right and they're doing it through the internet but the problem is it only lasts for like two or three days but here's the problem once people start believing the shit they buy into it with their identity we've seen this over and over and over again we saw it with covid we saw it with black lives matter we saw it with the vaccine we saw it with Ukraine and now we're seeing it with the Israel Hamas conflict okay we can go down the list right but here's the thing people read this like they see this this footage of people falling over in the streets with covid right and they automatically make up their mind it's it's real this is real holy shit I'm gonna die okay and we still see the effects of this even today like people who are still afraid to go outside without a mask so this is very psychologically traumatizing to anybody who is not aware enough to understand that what they're looking at is actually manipulation propaganda all right so and if we go down the line we could say this with black lives matter right how many people for a year wouldn't believe that black lives matter was a fucking scam right right until the people started getting busted you know like bro if you talk to a black person who had bought into black lives matter they'd mother fuck you up and down bro you're a fucking racist piece of shit bro I'm pointing out where the money's going it's not going to you it's going to these white dudes over here that are taking advantage of you right but they're mad at you for pointing it out same thing with the vaccine like how many people have fallen over fucking dead from the vaccine and still when you pointed out it's inappropriate to talk about well the reason it's inappropriate to talk about is because these people could create that as part of their identity all right same thing with Ukraine everybody post the Ukrainian flag everybody's talking about snake island and the ghost of Kiev and all this shit and saying that Ukraine's winning the war and all the sudden they're not and nobody can admit they got played and this is no different than what's going on here it's the same thing over and over and over and by the way I would like to point this out as well do you not under do you guys not realize or see or observe but do you not have the perceptive ability to understand that every time there's close to their little narrative falling apart they switched the narrative like when covid was clearly coming out to be fucking bullshit and the vaccines were clearly coming out to be bullshit and there was like all this public pressure and all this boiling up backlash all the sudden Ukraine okay and it started all over again all right and then they got people all hyped about that Ukraine went on for a hundred billion plus dollars and two years all right and people are now getting to the point where they're fucking done with Ukraine okay because our economy is fucked up to you know our our all the problems we have here people are pissed right boom Israel Hamas right and by the way Netanyahu had was about to get fucking tossed out of office by his own people now everybody's behind them like we have to get smarter yeah every time we start to get close to accountability they switched the narrative and pull the switch to run the same play on emotional manipulation and everybody gets fired up and by the way I'm an asshole for pointing out the whole time you know what say it like it doesn't even make sense like dude if we don't get smarter these people will continue to rule over us and not only that they're gonna kill us eventually because they don't want us here yeah these people do not like us they they hate us all right they're willing to kill their own people in order to stay in power like over and over and over again throughout history anyway yeah no it's real shit one other thing too I want to point out real quick when it comes to this atrocity propaganda so Paul line barger um he's a historian uh wrote this piece about atrocity propaganda and I thought one thing that I thought was really really interesting is is uh in one of his publications he says atrocity propaganda leads to real atrocities as it incites the enemy into committing more atrocities and by heating up passions it increases the chances of one's own side committing atrocities and revenge for the ones reported in propaganda like we talk about psychological warfare right this is probably like one of the the wildest things that they could possibly use and the problem is the danger is it works every single time every single time um you know and he also points out atrocity propaganda might also lead to uh lead the public to mistrust reports of actual atrocities it's the boy who cried wolf we talked about that all the time guys um so it's just interesting I thought it was important we bring this up a couple of other things with going on um well he makes a good point there because let's be real you know when they start talking about 40 baby heads being cut off now you have like so much of the internet legitimately calling for for the total destruction of Palestinians not separating the difference between Hamas and the Palestinians right right like this would be no different then then some atrocity propaganda being put out against black lives matter and then the backlash being so strong that everybody's like fucking kill all the black people well you know why they can't separate Palestinians from Hamas it's the same reason they can't separate Jewish people from Zionist well you know have that conversation yeah well look dude I'm just saying let's talk about something that we understand all right here this would be the parallel that you would draw here would be black lives matter fucking does some bad shit right and so in response let's say black lives matter kills uh you know let's just say they kill 40 babies and it's a trashy propaganda and and they make it it's made up okay and what that actually results in is a massacre of all kinds of innocent black people here in America based off of some lies that somebody made because they're trying to produce uh push an agenda and that's the danger of how this happens and that that is actually happening in in in Palestine right now and it is Israel we have Israeli forces and we have tons and tons and tons of influencers on the internet saying wipe them out level them blah blah blah not differentiating the difference between Hamas and regular innocent Palestinian people right okay there's no kids over there yeah bro and they don't care because these people are so riled up over the 40 babies getting killed that didn't actually fucking happen apparently right there's no proof of it all right that they're they're say fuck it we'll kill all their people in our families and shit it's it's it's an it's an actual justification for a true genocide and like there's a lot of people who are not stopping to think like damn man like yeah that's some terrorist shit but this isn't this whole entire population of people right and dude let's be real what's going on between these two cultures this is not going to be solved like this America is not going to solve this the only thing's going to solve it is them fighting to fuck out until one of them's done that hopefully drink up your afterwards well I don't think there's going to be anybody left because they're they're intent on destroying each other completely yeah and if that's the case this will lead into a real world war conflict and you you personally here in the United States will likely be fighting here on this soil in the next 14 months I think there's a real possibility of that if we get involved in this conflict and Hamas already has terror cells and here's another thing let's let's fucking let's work this out this is something I've been thinking about the progressive left is holding pro Palestine pro Hamas rallies all over the country yeah okay who's in the progressive left it's usually far left communist socialists okay which by the way Muslims hate all right and by the way Hamas really hates and you know who else it is it's the LGBTQ community okay who Hamas fucking hates okay so hold on I want to I want to unpack this so people really understand what we're dealing with here yeah all right now I say useful idiots a lot but this will show you what I'm talking about all right so we have Donald Trump in office who love him or hate him like his tweets not like his tweets whatever all of you guys on the progressive left you could say fuck Donald Trump's tweets he's a piece of shit that's fine here's the reality you were safe you were legitimately safe in this country you were not being attacked you were not being terrorized now you say you were because people were calling you names or something I'm talking about actual killing or harming of you all right we're not talking about words we're talking about sticks and stones attacks okay so Donald Trump's in office you guys are safe now you guys fucking call Donald Trump racist you call everybody like me pro two regular type Americans bigots and racist and all this shit for a decade for a decade you've been doing that all right now you voted in this man Joe Biden who is bought and paid for and in my opinion in place to legitimately destroy and demoralize and destabilize our country because every single thing he's done has done that he's being paid by other governments allegedly and what do you think he's being paid to do he's not being paid to make our shit stronger and get paid to you guys cream all right so you guys vote this guy in who is the alternative of this guy that you just don't like his words and then this guy sends money to a run all right who funds Hamas they also leave all our military equipment Afghanistan and that a lot of that military equipment is in the hands of Hamas all right then they leave the border open for the last three years where 10 plus million migrants not not you know I don't know what what what do they call them refuge they're not refugees these are not asylum seekers where do they seeking asylum from right these are people that are illegally here coming here we're in we're being invaded and you guys you know you're bleeding hearts you beat for those people right all the while some 75 to 100,000 of these Hamas people who fucking hate gay people and hate communists and hate progressiveism because of the it's destruction on the culture of the world in their opinion okay and so now you have a scenario where this man you voted for has actually legitimately put you directly in harm's way because when these terror attacks start here in the United States who do you think they're going to target they're going to target the people that they hate the most and they don't hate the regular American the most they say that shit but that's not who they hate they hate the progressive ideology that goes against traditional culture the most they hate this this gender ideology they hate homosexuality they hate communists okay who is going to come to defend you oh that's right it's going to be the same people that you call the bigot and a racist and a piece of shit and a colonizer right yep so so that's the situation we're dealing with and these people are so fucking stupid that they don't understand that when they hold these rallies and support Hamas that Hamas is in their fucking neighborhood right now planning attacks on their shit right now like make it make sense no it doesn't make sense and these people this is what I'm talking about when I say useful idiots when I say like this is how they make the play work like bro there's a big section of people here that are so stupid and are used so hard that they are literally tricked into supporting their own demise potentially and and you guys might want to think about calling all these pro two A people racist and bigots right now because real talk if that shit cracks off here they're the only chance you got because they'll kill you dude and just like they're over there pissing on bodies they'll be pissing on your body that's real man that's real you you can stand there with the fucking Palestine flag all you want bro and say you've support them they don't give a fuck they don't they don't think like you we've lived so long in a soft culture here in America that people can't fathom that people are willing to kill you for different ideology that's that's the that's the that's the like the ultimate like what the fuck right like that's like we live in this country that is so free that you have to pretend to be actually in danger and oppressed to the point where then it becomes a country where you're actually in danger man listen that's rough I'm just saying that's rough man you guys might want to rethink who the fuck your what I've been saying let's talk about America man I've been saying this for fucking years okay we're Americans other countries don't care if you're white or you're black or you're left or you're right or whatever it is that you think you are inside of this country they only care about America and other countries hate Americans and you guys are in here destroying your old country putting your own cells in danger because you're uneducated and too fucking stupid to understand that the only reason you can say and do the things that you do is because our shit is free and because of people that are willing to stand up for you yeah that's real shit man and to your point to vote like I mean I think the the tariff threat is a very legitimate and real thing man you know this headline reads the former a Hamas leader Khalid Masha'al calls for Day of G. Hyde on Friday the 13th that's that's right today while you guys are listening right now this was he made the statement this past Wednesday and tells Muslims to take to the streets and protest against Israel so you got all of this stuff happening like it's a like we it's a very very uneasy time right now bro this is really easy it's not uneasy gather up all the illegals send him back where the fuck they came from first off second off fix all our problems fix our homeless problem fix our drug problem close the fucking border fix our economy okay all these things that need fixing need to be fixed before we ever fuck with anything else if these people want to kill each other over there they're fucking kill each other okay this is not our business and like I said on the last show we're being drug into a forefront war people don't understand that Ukraine Taiwan Israel and here on our soil and if that actually happens that's the end of America you can't we can't fight again we don't have that we are not the America of the 1980s we're not the America of you know 2000 we we we will lose that in this country will be over and your kids will either die or be fucking slaves that's real shit man so so one last thing I want to bring up man but I just thought wow this headline right here says us announces evacuation flights for Americans or you be how they're going to charge yeah is that what you're gonna say holy shit yeah our own government who gives away a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine is now telling the Americans that we have in Israel that they are going to have to pay the government back for their evacuation he's making them sign promissary notes bro but here's the thing MSN won't tell you that they will not tell you the full fucking pictures and this AP news article right and yeah as you don't tell them all the White House announced that the US government will begin operating evacuation flights to help Americans leave Israel as Israel prepares to escalate retaliatory actions against him osm militants in the Gaza Strip the evacuation flights are expected to begin Friday White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the US government is arranging for at least four charter flights a day out of Israel according to people familiar with the planning then they go into it but here's what they don't mention bro they don't mention the fact that the Biden regime is forcing Americans trapped in Israel to sign promissary notes to repay all travel cost if they decide to be rescued by the United States government yeah while they're sending a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine and then giving illegal migrants that come across the border 1500 bucks and a fucking cell phone yeah where's the proof Andy and DJ well how about the email from the actual state.gov right their email it concludes departure assistance is provided via a loan from the US government which requires travelers to sign a promissary note and agreement to repay prior to departure. These people are shipags bro they fucking hate you they hate you they hate me they hate us and they're doing every single thing they can to fuck us up like until people come to that conclusion bro this is not going to change no and I'll be real dude like I'm gonna be this is just real shit like I am I'm to the point now where I'm losing hope that you guys that listen to this show are gonna stand up and speak up I've been doing this for three and a half years now I've asked you over and over and over again I begged you I've implored you I said stand with me stand up speak up stand up speak up get involved get engaged we're at the end of the fucking ability to do that like the next step is going to be us fighting mother fuckers in the streets because you all wouldn't stand the fuck up so you better stand up now because this is the last chance we're gonna fucking half and the correct stand-up is let's fix our own shit and stop fucking around with these things all over the world guys let us know what you guys think down in the comments using hashtag eyes wide open jumping on this conversation let us know before we get to have a lot of two man you want you want a cruise yeah cruise from comments my favorite part so comment first of all guys you guys have been sharing the show out of the last episode gauge was looking great now let me be real about this yeah okay yeah they have and yeah I appreciate it but had you done that for the last three years we wouldn't be in this situation I'd be here we wouldn't be here we have enough people that listen to this show okay every single day across the audio platforms on YouTube everywhere that legitimately had you shared the show for the last three and a half years we would not fucking be here because the grounds will be so fucking massive that they couldn't do this kind of shit yeah okay so keep going this is important and and dude do you think I really want to do this like bro I don't think you guys understand like I don't want to do this yeah it's not what I want to do but I'm willing to do it because it's important if you're not going to share the show stand on your own message speak up stand up like this goes back to what I was saying earlier where you say oh you know love and reheat him he makes some good points bro why can't you just like the whole problem that we have here is indicative in that response like you're not comfortable enough to stand on what you believe to speak up and you're not realizing that the silence that you've perpetuated for so many years is what's allowed this to take place like we have allowed this because we have been tricked into believing this silence is some sort of virtuous thing silent majority political correctness don't offend people right these things cancel culture these things have been in place for you to be quiet now is the last chance you were ever going to have to not be quiet 10 years from now 20 years from now you're going to have to look back on this time and say what did I stand for did I do the right thing did I stand for and bro some of you guys are going to be proud some of you guys aren't that's just real shit there's a lot of you guys been listening to show for the last fucking three years and have a shared at one mother fucking time or you only share it when it's not too offensive there's nothing offensive about being proud to be an American there's nothing offensive about standing for America first there's nothing offensive about standing for the American flag there's nothing offensive about standing for your community and your neighbors and your friends and your family first there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with you having an opinion or having a stance they want you to believe there's something wrong with it because the less opinion and the less stance you take the more freedom they have to operate without any kind of criticism and we've allowed that for over a decade look what it's gotten us so the last chance you have is to speak up and stand up and whether it's sharing this show or other messages or your own message it needs to fucking happen and needs to happen at scale right now and if it doesn't we will lose this fucking country your kids will fucking be slaves or dead real shit yes let's let's cruise this this comment we selected from youtube by at tech knee 87 they say quote that's really bold saying that the Jewish are the globalists proof question mark yeah so I chime back in there actually I said what economic form Hollywood BlackRock Van Garth State Street Viacom the list goes on and on your play on words is both exposing your own lack of intelligence and why the problem will likely never get solved unfortunately I don't have enough time or crayons to help you there well first of all what I said was I didn't say that it was the Jews I said actually what I said was it wasn't the Jews when I said was there's a group of extremely powerful people in which a lot of them happen to be Jewish who then pretend to you know who then when you point at them and criticize the evil things that they do they use anti-semitism as a defense right and so what I'm actually saying is the Jews the regular Jewish people who are good people nice people just like everybody else out here are being used as a shield for potentially a small amount of people doing evil shit that's actually what I said yeah and we've seen this in other places right we've seen this with black lives matter can't question the you know if you question the organization that means your question of the state means your racist and how much money did the black lives matter still from from from communities of black people oh okay we see the same thing with the point here's yeah bro it's everybody it's it's it's the same play they run everywhere and here's the problem this guy here he's probably a really good dude he's probably a normal good-hearted regular person that has no idea that that's even the case of what's happening right you know what I'm saying and so play of words no but so when they hear that because we have to remember anti-semitism is like the last one that you can talk like bro if you're called a racist uh okay you know if you're called a big it but you're calling that I semi oh like you know I'm saying so like bro we have this situation going on where Jewish people are ultra sensitive to any criticism about you any sort of Jewish person because it's been ingrained into their culture yeah all right so when you're a Jewish person and you're just a normal person and you hear someone say well there's Jewish globalists like Klaus Schwab doing very evil shit they take that like you're attacking them yeah we're not attacking them we're attacking those evil people and that's why the language is so important and that's why when people say it's the Jews it's a very negative thing to say because it allows us we're playing into their plan and not able to identify the true criminals there are good people and there are bad people there are good Jewish people there are bad Jewish people there are good black people there are bad black people there are good white people there are bad white people and we go down the list okay like do you really think that Jewish people are only people without any criminals and they're fucking heritage yeah like let's be real yes this is a ridiculous statement and this is a this is what you said is proving the point that is proving the point because this is a result of the operation that's been run on this culture no criticism of any member of this culture can be accepted for any reason whatsoever and what that has allowed people to do very evil people is to operate unimpeded to do whatever the fuck they want and so yeah there's a lot of proof that the people running the globalist playbook are actual Jews just happy okay yes but that doesn't mean that all Jewish people are involved in it or even aware of it so fuck man like how about this how about listen to the show and actually remove your personal bias or your personal feelings from what we're saying I start there that's good start no because actually what we're saying is bro Jewish people are being taken advantage of that's actually what we're saying same way we say the LGBT community is being said and the same way that good black people were being manipulated like it's that's what we're saying like no one's exactly no one's saying oh you know it's like there's people yes like it's such a ridiculous like like and do we have to be able to we have to be able to talk about it because if we don't talk about it the problem can't be solved and because the reason they don't want us talking about it's because they know if we don't talk about it the problem can't be solved so what do they do the minute that you're able to talk about any of this oh racist oh big it oh anti-semit and then they hope to shut you down guess what there's certain people that can't be shut the fuck down and it is what it is man yeah I'm the real shit man if you're a Jewish person and you hear anything I say is as anti-Jewish you're not listening what I'm saying you're missing it now listening what I'm saying I'm actually what I'm actually saying is you're being manipulated and taken advantage of by people who are claiming to be good Jewish people who are not yeah you should be happy you should be like oh fuck broad and see they were I didn't see there were an admit manipulating me like that right but this goes back to people aren't things to admit though no bro it goes back to the psychological manipulation of the atrocity propaganda when people make that shit their identity it becomes really hard for them to separate from yeah it's real shit man guys don't forget to like comment and subscribe we appreciate you guys we see you out there working so keep doing that keep being real ass fans so that being said man let's keep this show moving headline number two I thought I'm a two-reads well before we get to tell I'm a two like I said guys it's easy to get distracted there's a lot of other things going on so we got to address it I had a lot of them to reach Biden I never talked to son Hunter about overseas business dealings all right now this is from 2019 okay where former president or former vice president Joe Biden said Saturday he hasn't spoken to his son Hunter Biden about his overseas business while forcefully calling again for an investigation into president Donald Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president quote I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings Biden said quote here's what I know Trump should be investigating quote you should be looking at Trump Biden told reporters in Des Moines Iowa shortly after arriving at the Polk County State Friday and annual Democratic fundraiser quote he's doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he's using an abuse of power every element of the presidency to try to smear me ask the right questions what is the thing reports just came out Biden allegedly sent 29,000 emails to his son brother about their overseas business dealings but everybody's looking over there yeah everybody there didn't some chargers get dismissed of against Hunter Biden as well yeah absolutely so so let's dive into this so Joe Biden's continued assertions that never once discussed his son Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings have again been called into question following new bombshell allegations a freedom of information or FOIA request obtained through a lawsuit by America first legal found that Joe Biden had emailed his son Hunter his brother James and their firms tens of thousands of times while he served his vice president the federalist reported here's a tweet from America first legal they say breaking our FOIA lawsuit against the national archives has now revealed that then vice president Biden's office had 19,335 emails with Rosemont Seneca 4200 emails with Hunter Biden directly 1700 emails with Jim Biden his brother and 3700 emails with Jim Lines Hall group now this is the actual document again we'll link all this stuff for you it clearly states right in this lawsuit that's an open court here's the proof that you guys need it what evidence here's the evidence right even the oversight committee chimed in on this they tweeted out presidential candidate Joe Biden promised there would be an quote absolute wall between his work as an elected official and his families business that doesn't match his track record new information from the national archives show that Biden's VP office emailed with his son Hunter his brother Jim and both of their businesses over 29,000 times and even while all of that is going on as you alluded to Andy this AP News article headlong reads Hunter Biden judge agrees to drop old guns count after indictment replaces scuttle pleadil but they have an announce what the new indictment will be kept it on the wrap so article reads a gun count that had been part of a collapse pleadil and the Hunter Biden case was dismissed Wednesday as a judge signed off on a prosecution request the order from US district judge Mary Ellen Morekka formally removes a gun possession charge that has now been replaced by a three-count indictment the president's son is charged with violating measures against drug users having guns when he bought and kept a revolver for about 11 days in 2018 a period where he has acknowledged struggling with addiction he pleaded not guilty earlier this month as a case moved toward a potential trial with a 2024 election looming his lawyers have said he did not break the law and they planned to push for dismissal of the indictment Hunter Biden 53 was originally expected to plead guilty to Mr. Minotax counts in the agreement with prosecutors and avoid prosecution on a single gun possession charge related to the 2018 purchase if he stayed clean and out of trouble but that deal collapsed in July after judge Nureka raised questions about it and the current gun indictment was filed weeks later no new tax counts have yet been filed by special counsel David Weiss and what we got on this I mean I think this is definitely part of the some of the distraction hysteria that's happening right like every time one of these big events takes a shift they use it as an opportunity to release some of the facts about some of the things that were happening before but not enough to actually hold him accountable yeah right like a lot of stuff came out about Fauci was coming out about Fauci right as Ukraine was announced right um Ukraine start the narrative starting to fall apart with Ukraine narrative in a very obvious way for most people and then all of a sudden now it's this new thing and you know so it's part for the course you know what I mean uh these people are trying to figure out every way possible to avoid accountability and in my opinion I like I've said many times on the show before I believe that ultimately they will kill everybody on the planet to avoid being held accountable I think these people are that evil yeah I think they do not care about anything right I like when I look at what happened in Israel and we see like I see the videos of the hang gliders coming across the border and I think about like how absurd this is knowing that Israel has f16s f18s and all these aircraft and all these military uh you know equipment at their disposal that we've sold them are given them you know it becomes a pretty absurd observation to think that like some savage people could just like invade the country with fucking paragliders and come in and just start you know doing all this shit and um and so like you have to ask the question you know if and by the way this when I'm talking about things we have to understand there is a difference between the people of Israel and the government of Israel there's a difference between Palestinians and Hamas there is a just like there's a difference here between the American citizens and our government this is like how would you feel if the rest of the world judged us based upon our government and not our people which I actually believe a lot of the enemies of our country right now have great empathy and understanding that the majority of the people here in the United States do not support these people they do not support Joe Biden the majority and I think that's why we haven't been attacked and why we haven't been nuked by a Russia or something like that right I think these people have you know even there's been countless of reasons why they could do it it's usually the opposite of what they tell us and what do they tell us about these people their savage they kill you they throw people off buildings well if they were that savage then why haven't they fucking attacked us yet right it's because they know and can I can I can I realistically separate the difference between a corrupt government and the people that are in in in in the country right the citizens and so when I speak about Israel and and what's going on with between Israel and Palestine understand that I'm speaking with a difference between Israeli government officials and Israelis and Palestinians and Hamas you understand okay so when I look at the situation I observe what I'm looking at and I my conclusion I come to is that it was allowed to happen and by the way there's a whole bunch of IDF agents from Israel that have also come out publicly already and said this was allowed to happen yeah all right so if they allowed these paragliders to come in from Hamas and kill all these people why did they do that why would they do that well it's because they could fucking then push an agenda that they were trying to push which is the extermination of Palestinians all right let's be real here while also protecting the and units mechanism that's correct and unifying all the Palestinian or all the Israelis behind uh uh common enemy no an official that just two weeks ago they fucking a lot of them hate it all right so we have to be honest about like what we're seeing going on here and this is not a criticism of Israelis this is a criticism of their leadership and and and our leadership and the government you know you understand so when we look at what's happening and we look at the response of this attack being allowed like let okay we allowed we allowed these people come in to kill a thousand of our people that's fucking horrible but what did it do that united them and now they're able to go over to uh the rest of Palestine and fucking genocide and tire like dude these people are in a frenzy right because the propagation that they've had has been like baby's heads cut off you know in all this ridiculous horrible shit some of it true some of it exaggerated uh but this is no different than what we had in 9-11 where we we had intelligence we had and some will say that our own three letter agencies were heavily involved in planning this out some say okay right some say it was Israel right so like bro there's there's these and by the way that's not just like conspiracy theory there's plenty of mainstream people that will tell you that 9-11 was an inside job and if we look at 9-11 and then what happened right after 9-11 which was the unequivocal support for the United States of America to do whatever they needed to do we were allowed to go over into Iraq and Afghanistan and do whatever the fuck we wanted for 20 years which made Raytheon and general dynamics and all all these companies billions of dollars and by the way who are those companies donating to oh they're donating their money to the political campaigns of the people making these decisions and they're all getting rich off of the death and slaughter of the citizens of the world this is not the the governments of the world most of them are so corrupt at this point that they are willing to kill all of us to continue to play these games and it's very dangerous dude and so what I observe what's happening in Israel is not like you know what most people are talking about like they're not talking like most people are talking about Hamas's sub-savages and they might be and they came in and they did this and and it looks like they did some bad shit right real bad shit they kill a lot of people but if they were allowed to do it and then that justifies more killing of innocent civilians okay so that's what it appears to look like for me you see what I'm saying so I don't support any of these groups I think they're all fucking shit but at the end of the day bro good people men and women whether they're Jewish or Palestinian or American or fucking whatever are dying at the expense of these world leaders who are guilty of crimes against humanity a bunch of different times and every time we get close to holding them accountable yeah so that's the that's the that's the dangerous thing right so like we've always talked about this there's like this lag right between the narrative coming out and then the push for accountability there's this lag in between those two things right and it's like you know we've noticed it we've said this plenty of times you know every time we get close to accountability bam something else happens so when you when you have this this constant barrage of narratives and propaganda being pushed in these distractions that keep coming up right you take the the physical pains that we're feeling right now as Americans right at grocery bills gas bills right you take all of these things there's only a matter of time from when that lag between those two things gets hours right between oh okay that's definitely bullshit here's accountability right that they have to transition from this being this like mental you know psychological war to an actual physical like real true physical harm and I think we are extremely close to that man because people are getting it too quickly now yeah they're getting caught with an hour too quickly where it took COVID a year for people to catch on really it took black lives yeah took two years took black lives matter a year took Ukraine of fucking six months they just kept doing it now people are calling this shit bullshit days and days and so the next thing is actual destruction and death and guess who they want to go fight for this you and me and our fucking kids and that didn't happen dude now man now yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments using hashtag abracad anyway let us know what you think they're gonna force us into it and like when I say I truly think it's too small this and dude I truly believe that if America gets involved in this war we will have fighting in the streets here in this country in the next fucking 12 shit we've never seen before never had to even think about yeah all because of the useful idiots didn't like someone's tweets couldn't couldn't read the science on a mask or a vaccine or understand what was happening like bro that you guys are way too emotional you're emotionally manipulated way too easy I've seen tons of my friends fall for this again like it's like a real world perception that Q test happening in real time like now I can clearly see okay well this is why this person struggles in life because they do not yet because they do not have the ability to perceive when they are being manipulated at all and it doesn't matter if it happens one time three times five times they they can never catch it and if you don't have that level of intelligence or perception you can't be successful in the world you're gonna struggle at your work you're gonna struggle with your life you're gonna struggle everywhere like to me when I observe these things it's pretty clear quickly what's happening and and then you know and then I go on the podcast like the other day and I say it and you know we got people calling all kinds of names and saying all this kind of shit bro I'm sorry that you don't see it I don't know what to tell you I got enough credit yeah I don't know what to tell you man like I'm sorry you don't see it like but you should start listening to people who were seeing it because it's going to end up costing us everything it's going to cost us this country and probably our lives I mean dude can you imagine like like like like they're could legitimately be like fighting here in the streets fighting soon very soon very soon man it's a real thing very real thing man guys let's give it to our last headline third and final headline of the day headline number three that's number three reads Philadelphia journalist farmer city comms director shot and killed in this home you see this right everybody I mean this has been circulating but it's not that there's been some developments on this I thought we're pretty interesting so let's dive into this so this article from the day the wire this was written on October 3rd 2023 and initially this kind of came out as like oh you know there's far progressive left you know activist writer journalist gets killed by the very people he is an activist for that's initially I came out right so this initial story a Philadelphia journalist who previously worked for the city government was shot and killed in his home early morning Josh Krueger 39 this guy was shot seven times around 1.30 a.m. at his home in the point breeze neighborhood of the city Krueger's neighbor jazz brown heard the gunshots followed by Krueger calling for help CBS News reported quote Josh was calling for help and I called the police to make sure they'd come out for them brown said the journalist was rushed to pin Presbyterian Medical Center where he died less than an hour later according to the Philadelphia inquire a police said they believe someone entered Krueger's home and shot him at the base of his stairs before fleeing thirties have yet to make an arrest or recover a weapon as they review surveillance footage from outside the row house where Krueger was murdered detectives believe the shooting stemmed from either a drug related or domestic dispute law enforcement sources told the inquire the sources also said the investigators found methamphetamine in Krueger's bedroom and recovered troubling text messages between Krueger and a farmer partner now there's been some updates this headline reads also from daily mail I'm sorry daily wire leftist journalist had years long sexual relationship with teen accused of killing him threatened to post explicit photos teens family says so he's a fucking pedophile 100% ding ding ding 10 points for Andy yeah so fill it out why are these people all fucking pedophiles bro like have we not understand that pedophiles have like legitimately infiltrated the far left sect of our political spectrum can we just call it was paid bro it's what it is like and we're over here bending to these people and being afraid they're gonna call us fucking names fuck these people bro like they're out here trying to fuck your children teach your children to cut off their own dicks and shit and you guys are afraid they're gonna call you a cup of fucking names and then we're here the world's falling apart because you're afraid of it bro yeah so so this updated article so a Philadelphia journalist and former democratic communications director who was shot and killed in this home earlier this month was in a years long sexual relationship with the teenager accused of killing him the teen's family said the family of Robert Davis okay this gentleman right here okay Robert Davis he's 19 years old the 19 year old accused of murdering leftist journalist Josh Krueger said that Krueger began the relationship with Davis when Davis was just 15 years old now how old was Krueger Krueger was 39 Davis okay so he's 19 to four years ago so 34 yeah 34 year old man in a sexual relationship with the 15 year old okay and this has all been recorded to the Philadelphia and choir the relationships centered on sex and drugs according to Davis's family and Krueger 39 allegedly threatened to post sexually explicit photos of the teen in the past probably not a very good move Krueger looks like that threat cost you bro yeah Krueger shot as it should seven times man as a shit yeah so Davis's mother and shit a shot him fucking 20 times yeah Davis's mother and brother told the choir that the team was involved in a relationship with Krueger as a minor and he tried to keep the relationship along with his drug addiction secret surveillance footage from the area in their Krueger's home and tips from the journalist's friends and family led police to Davis and they issued a war for his arrest police said Krueger quote was trying to help Davis get through life oh yeah sure you was yeah now here's something that's interesting so you know of course everything's on the internet you can find it let's go to Josh Krueger's Twitter okay let's see some of his old tweets this yeah let's read this one it's a tiresome and incredibly outdated bigoted trope to claim all gay men or pedophiles also if I've seen any seen any consistent thing with the modern American right it's that anything they accuse you of they're actually guilty of themselves as this fucking guy is fucking children calling people like us a fucking pedophile holy shit dude or where are you guys gonna wake up these are fucking shitbag human beings bro you guys defend them like their victim class week like bro when are we going to wake the fuck up people are now using gays as a scapegoat for sexual abuse saying homosexual amorality is responsible nope the lie that gay men are all pedophiles or petter's ass is one of the most vile literally dangerous slurs homophobes use it was a lie a hundred years ago and it's a lie today clearly not yeah not all gays or pedophiles well that's true but this one definitely what okay like this pedophile this is the guy infiltrating the gay community that we talk about all the time that they could protect fuck look at him he looks like a regular dude bro keep going we got another one here this last one I mean this one the centuries old smear that gay men are pedophiles is getting new life thanks to coordination between far right new sites and far right message boards this egregious defamation is part of a strategy to target lgbtq people with violence no we don't care if you're gay we don't care if you're a grown man and you want to have sex with another grown man we do not care what we care about is how you show up at our schools and put books in front of little kids faces talking about sucking dicks okay and being okay to be whatever and cut off their penises and alter their gender ideology and take irreversible hormones you bro can rotten hell I think you will yeah I think you will let me actually this does right so what do you think the kids shouldn't fucking face any punishment whatsoever bro he was sexually abused he was sexually manipulated by an adult he fucking was threatened to expose and ruin his whole life bro you can't hold this person responsible for this fucking level of psychological manipulation no like it's sad this kid exactly this is real you fucking have trauma because someone said something mean to you no that's trauma being manipulated into doing whatever the fuck they were doing and then being threatened to keep doing it yeah or I'm gonna show pictures and ruin your life he's to me this guy's a piece of shit to me this kid's a hero I'm glad you fucking like I mean dude I feel bad for him now he's gonna have to go through his whole life with this shit on his back I'm sick of this shit dude you know I'm sick of this shit the gay community is to stand a fuck up against their own fucking pedophile problem that's a real thing I know there's gays against groomers but there's still a whole bunch that aren't doing it that's real shit those are the people who Moss wants to kill by the way just so we're clear oh hey they will they absolutely will guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments hashtag pito files let us know let us know what you guys think bro and and what not only are those the people who have Moss wants to kill those are also the people parading around celebrating the deaths of innocent Israeli people I think about this like think about this you have people who are legitimately hated by this terrorist group who are parading around celebrating the death of innocent women and children whether it was orchestrated by their own government or not is irrelevant these are innocent fucking human beings and then we have disgustingly like all these people who are like fuck them kill them all let them have it give them hell blah blah blah not discerning that you know like bro how are you gonna run an air strike 500 air strikes against a terror organization and not kill all the civilians too like bro this this is a this is a this is an orchestrated wiping out of an entire culture it's only gonna lead to more death oh yeah it's only gonna lead to more death like dude this is only gonna lead to more like there's how how many million Jewish people are there compared to how many million fucking Muslim people at 1.5 billion okay and how many Jewish people less than I would say I mean can't you google it yeah you got Google right there all right sick in earth 16.1 million people on the earth okay or Jewish now you're these people the have created a scenario now where Israel is gonna roll in and destroy a whole bunch of fucking Muslim people Palestine or not Palestinians or not okay innocent or not they're not just targeting Hamas they're targeting everyone right now how do you think that's going to work out long term when you have 1.5 billion Muslims who are gonna watch this group of people exterminate this other group of people and then the other group of people have you know their cousins and their front people who may not be associated with them watching them do it and there's literally 1.5 billion to 14 million how do you think this is going to work out this is going to cause major problems nobody should be supporting this conflict what so ever right because it's going to get everybody in a fucking world war and get potentially your children killed because of it so like you guys should think before you stand up and say you know this or that or this or this or this and stop being emotionally like stupid like you're putting you're being upon in their game do you think they don't know when they run a fake headline about babies having their fucking heads cut off that they don't know what the reaction is going to be they know they know it's going to whip everybody into a frenzy to say fucking get them bro this happened to me okay I know what this is like when 9-11 happened all right I was like fuck it let's kill them all let's fucking kill them all okay because it was so disturbing to watch that like it was just the way I felt okay but after watching for the last 20 something years right I started to realize that I was wrong in that assessment completely wrong because just because a few evil people of a culture decided to do this evil thing does not justify the killing of millions of fucking innocence like this we're talking about humanity bro we're not talking about now like we're talking like we're talking about human beings we're not talking about a flag we're not talking about a country we're not talking about a religion we're talking about like what's right and what's wrong fundamentally like it's not right none of this shit is right and it's not okay and it's not human nature to do these things to each other like they convince us oh that's just how humans are no it's not there's evil people that manipulate us into these atrocious actions that kill millions of people every single year all over the world for the benefit of a very small group of elite people like bro that's not okay and I don't like it's it's super hard to like witness all of this you know what I mean like for what it is yeah like this is disgusting we have these elite rich powerful people manipulating the peasants to kill each other for shit that isn't even fucking true we're getting us to celebrate it and no getting us to celebrate and then them making trillions of dollars off of it dude we have to get smarter dude like people have to wake up like this is not this is yes I'm for America first but this is a human species problem and the cool thing is the silver lining of all of this is that we living at this time have the opportunity to make a difference like not many people that that have lived on on earth have actually had the real opportunity to make a difference with their time here and we have the opportunity with our words with our thoughts with our action with our compassion with the way we live our lives to legitimately change the history of humanity and if we don't humans are going to lose they're going to replace us with robots and AI and fucking kill the rest of us depopulate the print like when they get on stage and they talk about depopulation do you think they're talking about them right they're talking about us yeah they're not volunteering themselves as tribute correct like and we like stand with some of these people like with Fauci and Bill Gates and these other people what the fuck are you guys doing like you guys you guys say oh hey I was a great thing you not understand that this is all part like bro I feel I don't think we're gonna make it dude you know I don't I don't people are too afraid like to easily manipulate no it's not only that they're too easily manipulated it's that they won't stand and share a message at all like like after coming to terms and being presented with the facts yeah it's still hard for them yeah dude it's fucking it's disturbing bro like legit keeps me up at night you know I don't come in you unlike most of these podcasters and he's talking heads and he's internet personalities this is not how I make my money guys I'm not selling fucking gear and fucking you know shirts that say I stand with this every single time something happens you know I don't even post on the fucking internet outside my show you know like I run real businesses in real life like I don't know man yeah we'll say it's it's it's really it's really frustrating for me to watch this happen and then to see people have no humanity in their hearts about like any of it it's just it honestly it disgusts me like we won't make it if things don't change you know and I'm not talking about we America I mean we human beings like where to the point now where we're being manipulated to the point of literal self-destruction for what and for whom do you think these people and do you think Joe Biden gives a fuck about the American people bro okay do you think any of these people do they don't care yeah and when the world when the world when the world things they say they care I was where's climate change bro when the world starts closing in on them they kill a whole bunch of us to distract the fucking attention off of them yep like like like this like like it's fucking yeah like it ain't nothing bro it's like spraying raid on some cockroaches yep hey we got let's let's kill the crawls too far yeah kill them they'll get upset they'll forget about where even here and also sends a signal everybody else to stay away from that shit yeah we'll see man guys let's finish this out we got a final segment of the show as always thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is what we're bringing headline in we talk about it'll get one of those two options so with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads talk about distractions bigfoot spotted in Colorado and broad daylight and it's all on camera we're convinced well speaking of speaking of bigfoot did you see that did you see what I did it for Dylan no I saved them from that 24th Annaconda did you see that yeah if you didn't see the footage you can go over there right here if you're on YouTube we go to YouTube shorts like this right here yeah go over there check out the YouTube shorts you'll see a video of me saving our videographer and good buddy Dylan from a 24th Annaconda yeah save this fucking life bro can you think you would say would you save us from bigfoot how do you save us from bigfoot I don't know I think right dude they got on video like this is I mean we've all seen those green e-clips from like the 1970s or whatever this is a little different this is a little different so let's dive into this so this is a New York Post article reading oh we know it's bullshit then yeah he was popping a Sasquatch a couple on a romantic break in Colorado claims to have captured the mythical creature bigfoot on camera wondering on the side of a mountain before sitting down to rest all in broad daylight professed eyewitnesses Shannon and Stetson Parker enjoying a trip for their 10th wedding anniversary claims we have observed the legendary Lumix while enjoying a sightseeing tour on the narrow gauge rail line between Durango and Silverton in the Centennial States far south west quote we were looking for elk in the mountains and my husband sees something moving and they can't really explain it so he's like bigfoot Shannon at 44 year old contractor from Shayan Wyoming told the post quote it was at least six seven feet or taller and matched the sage in the mountains so much that it's like he's camouflaged when crouching down if you if you asked before the trip we would have said maybe bigfoot could be real but now we're convinced so Shannon who shared the video of the odd one to two minutes siding in a Facebook post also said that the trains conductor told the couple of a similar previous non-human sightings quote he said that he went out snow-hoeing well snow-shoeing oh it's not snow-hoeing now snow-hoeing now it's not snow-hoeing it's not that was like something like a new term I was like yeah snow-hoeing snow snow snow-hoeing that's they do down there that's for they do down there in the hood when it snows snow-hoeing maybe they still out on the corners hey gotta make those nickels bro so what what is snow-shoeing what is that then you never seen snow shoes snow shoes that's the actual like people to do that shit that's actually snow shoes are like those two brackets yes yeah that's snow shoes so like people with snow-shoeing yeah you go out and walk on the snow like as exercise or hike or whatever why that's what they do man the fucking Colorado bro they're all you know they fucking go on the woods they drink fucking beer it tastes shitty pretend that it's good they lecture you on politics and they go snow-hoeing yeah I got my new oatmeal wheat IPA you want to go snow-shoeing yeah that's right what the fuck is that hey would you like some of my oatmeal stout and they all look exactly the same like bro I love Colorado but let's be real I'll be honest so again native with all it's a cigarette native American cigarettes yeah whatever dude it's all experience yeah it's American spirits bro and then they got a they lecture you on politics man you know I'm saying even though they never had a fucking job ever these snow you know they come from a rich family who fucking funded their new resettlement in Colorado they wear all fucking north face in Patagonia everything's up we all know what the fuck I'm talking about you guys gonna laugh at me all you want I actually love these people because they're fun and they smoke a lot of weed yeah and they go on adventures I don't know shit about what I could do without the lectures on the politics and this bullshit environment shit you guys talk about but you go snow-shoeing I was snow-hoeing it's not so okay like they're upcycled bro yeah right right I'm shredding the knower yeah right okay so we got that clarified all right yeah so they said quote he went he said that he went out snowshoeing in those mountains before and he had seen footprints that were larger and of much bigger stride than snow shoes would have been Parker said quote he has seen unexplainable things as well some took the couples bigfoot claims and stride one common it quote I believe on Shannon's post with another one saying love it though not everyone is convinced that Chabokas doppelganger exists quote and what were y'all thinking another comment oh he says in what were y'all drinking we are in it we'd establish what they're drinking yes they're drinking oatmeal style yeah and it tastes like shit but they're gonna tell you how great it is so good yeah bro like you guys are such wires they are such wires dude it's so good it's upcycled too all right so let me check out the video yeah check out the video this is the video of Sasquatch and Colorado here it is take the shit bro that's a dude in a Chubakas snow shoe snow hoeing snow snow snow home yeah listen man that's a big dude that looks like a dude in a gilly suit you know who that is that's big kev bro it cares out fuck Colorado and he's wearing his gilly suit and he's pulling pranks on these people look at his face he's laughing yeah I don't know man huh yeah yeah I don't know kev why you gotta be fucking with these people bro you got your first week in Colorado you are here fucking with these people I I mean do you believe you believe they should like this exist shit like what snow hose no stas watch I've been skiing I've seen lots of snow hose at ski ski slopes really I don't know man I mean I don't know I think people see what they go Sasquatch hunting huh let's go hunting Sasquatch why just just because I do this shit cuz you know cuz we're gonna be walking around the woods they're gonna be nothing to see how you know I'll do this I won't go like ghost chasing bro last time I went to Colorado might be the last time I went to Colorado okay what happened as I went there and and I stayed at this place and fucking Breckenridge bro and like dude I drink a lot of water like I drink at least a gallon of water every day and shockingly I don't die according to New York Post but like I went I stayed at this restaurant or I mean at this hotel um I forgot what it was called if I could remember I'd say what it was but it fucking sucked and dude they had no bottle water no you they hand you a cup now this place is like a thousand dollars a night minimum to stay there right yeah and they they give you a fucking cup and they say you know drink the water out of these like out of the tap or out of these coolers and it's like dude I just want some fucking bottle water can I get a bottle of water we don't do bottle water here what do you mean you don't do bottle water it's for the environment yeah we upcycle so like bro that was it like you guys aren't gonna have fucking water I'm not coming yeah you know what I'm saying yeah he looked at me like I was insane like I was just wanting to kick I want some waters man I asked him for a straw I can't I can't walk down the street with my cup of water bro yeah like I'm talking about I need some water yeah so they didn't like that 16 for you dude they didn't like I wrote him an email and they got all pissed off and like we went back and forth and I can't remember the name or I will tell you but it was right there on the corner of main street it started with a G I can't remember the name of it right at the base of the mountain they were fucking assholes they're lucky I can't remember the name of their fucking place right now yeah yeah I might be part two now like that we rented the whole hotel we had the whole hotel running they got they got water yeah we had the whole we had our whole we had fucking a hundred people there from the company and they're giving me shit when I'm paying the bill about getting some motherfucking bottle water no they got bottle water I know they had it they were fucking dude it was the same people I described a minute ago you know they're yep anyway yep so what we giving this man thumbs up a dumb fuck I mean it's pretty good I mean I'm kind of convinced are you I'm kind of convinced so you're dumb as fuck well I mean listen I don't know like that wasn't trophy yeah oh that's a trophy my that I don't know that's a fucking truck no this shit looks like a dude hunting gear to me man yeah like this shit done look real like it looks like a dude who's I mean it looks like a guy it looks like the one dude from the Bee Gees I don't know what he looks like Harry and Henderson's yeah you see that nope yeah yeah Harry Harry and Henderson is a good one no when they're a fucking show based on that too I know there was a movie but there was a show too I think I don't know maybe I'm wrong anyway I don't really care but what I do care about is like you know you guys waking up and speaking up and standing up and and not being so quick to make judgments on things and understanding that you're being propagated and played and manipulated to have a certain reaction I wish you all would just stop and pause for a second say what's actually happening here why do I feel emotionally upset and what is the cause of that and why are they doing that we've talked about this for many years on the show right when they propagate us with you know visuals that are very disturbing you know there's a reason they're doing that and it's not because they're doing it for our benefit they're doing it for their benefit so what reaction are they looking for and what reaction are we giving them and right now the reaction that they're looking for is an enraged society that stands with one government that could potentially be very corrupt and slaughtering innocent people off the face of the earth and that's what they're getting you to try and get behind which is going to lead by the way to a massive retaliation by the entire Arab population of the fucking world which by the way they're the biggest okay so like I don't think people understand what's actually happening here you know and it's it still blows my mind to sit here and think about how the progressive lefties and the squad and all these people are like over here saying I stand with Hamas all right when Hamas wants to kill you right like that pleasure in doing no no bro that's what they exist to do okay and I'm not saying I stand with the Israeli government because I don't I stand with the innocent people of Israel I stand with the innocent people of Palestine but most of all I stand with the innocent people of the United States of America and we're being played and used as we as we have been for many many years to be the enforcement uh peace for all of these things going on in the world and that needs to end we're suffering here we have 27,000 murders a year in the inner cities we have a hundred thousand plus drug overdoses we have a hundred thousand plus kids traffic we have kids being manipulated into permanently ruining their lives by having sexual mutilation surgeries and hormone therapy that permanently fucks them up we have an economy that's in the shitter we have a president's improvement to take money from other countries we we have we have we have we have we have we have we have we have we have okay and we are not the America of 20 years ago or 30 years ago where we're this big superpower force we're stretched in and our military is under man and we don't have the equipment and we don't have the oil and we don't have shit and we're being frenzied into a forefront altercation Russia Taiwan Middle East and at home potentially okay well how do you think that's going to end up for you do you do you understand that when you root for this there's nobody else coming to fight this for you it's going to be you and unfortunately the people calling for reasonable thought and common sense like me and you and some other people are being villainized by the right and the left for not wanting to partake in this because we understand what it's going to cause and the the ironic thing is is when these things happen we are the very people that are going to be expected to fight like dude it's just fucked up man man it is man we have to get smarter and you guys have to get bolder you know and don't share my show if you don't want to share it this isn't about me but like I have no problem saying what I believe to be true clearly I say in front of the entire world every day and I have for years very few people do that okay so if you don't want to share my shit take it upon yourself to share your own shit or somebody else's shit who's actually fucking standing up for the truth but figure out that you have to stand up and speak up and be about it and be the change and you cannot apologize for this you cannot continue to apologize and say oh well you make some good points no motherfucker you agree with everything this person says you're just afraid to say it until people recognize that you are no longer afraid that will continue to manipulate you and push you and make you feel a prisoner in your own life this is the time to stand up this is the time to be bold this is the time and by the way we may not get another time and that's not alarmist that's alarmist was you know four years ago when I was telling you this now we're at the breaking point and this is real shit with real consequences and you're gonna have to ask yourself am I standing for the right thing am I being true to myself am I going to be proud of what I did during these times because these times are historic these times are historic to the human race and if we lose in these times the human race is fucking finished forever because we are in this key pivotal position where we can be replaced by working robots and artificial intelligence and the elite people of society can run that without any of us for thousands of years they've needed us because they needed farming and they needed industry and they needed things produced they do not need that anymore which is why they're talking about depopulation and a lot of you guys think they're talking about depopulation because of the environment that's just the catch that's just the the atrocity propaganda so to speak that's getting you to say fuck this really matters they're using your own goodwill and your own good heart against you over and over and over again and until you wake up to that we will continue to go down this path and if we continue to go down this path there isn't much more runway on this side of the path that doesn't include massive death and destruction for everybody that you know including me including you including your fucking kids so think about what you stand for and think about how courageous courageous you actually are because the reality is if we don't find it and we don't find that backbone soon we are fucking finished
