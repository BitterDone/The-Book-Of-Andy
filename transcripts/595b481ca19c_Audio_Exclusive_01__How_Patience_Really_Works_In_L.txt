What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the realist say goodbye to the lion's effectiveness and illusions minus society welcome motherfucking reality guys today we have an audio exclusive this is a brand new thing we're gonna do audio exclusive short quick hit little message DJ's gonna throw me something I'm gonna throw some shit back and it's not gonna take a much of your time but we're gonna make your day better gonna teach you something gonna make you learn maybe kicking the ass a little bit this is our first one really real real AE yeah I don't know about that I don't know about that yeah that sounds that's not good that's all right hey look so we're gonna miss yeah it's really a audio exclusive all right we know we've been putting a lot of effort emphasis on a grown the video platform but our core is here on audio so we want to hit you guys with some special sauce yeah extra sauce yeah hit you with it it's bladder you yeah yeah it's great this all guys is good to 80 I want to ask you this man because you know you've talked about this idea of letting the cake bake right and let's say I got all the perfect ingredients I got the best fucking recipe great oven I set the timer put it on the right fucking temperature what am I doing while that cake is bake it right like I mean what do most people do and then what should you be doing all right so what DJ's talking about is the idea of aggressive patience and I use the analogy of baking the cake because most people lack patience you could give them all the ingredients to how to succeed but then what they'll do is they'll try to work 24 hours a day and think that they can cut the time aspect that is required from the success recipe down which is impossible because it takes actual time for the consumer to become familiar with your product and there's no way to outspend that it's reality so you have to understand that time is an essential ingredient to the success recipe that we cannot work our way around the other thing we can't do is that when you have someone who gives you all the steps you can't think that you know better when reality is you don't know what the fuck you're doing and I use this analogy that we talk about baking the cake all right because I think it's very appropriate easy for people to understand you go to let's say Martha Stewart and Martha Stewart gives you her award winning ultimate world championship universe championship cake recipe and she gives you the exact ingredients and she says mix all of these ingredients in the bowl and then pour it into a cake pan and let it bake at 400 degrees for 45 minutes all right and you think well fuck dude I got all the ingredients okay I mix them up and by the way you know I think it be a little better with this and with that so you throw in a little bit of your own stuff thinking you're gonna make this thing better right it's already one the world's best cake in the universe but you because you made zero cakes you know how to make it better right and then what you're gonna do is you pour it in the pan and you say well fuck I don't want to wait 45 minutes so you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna turn the temperature up 800 degrees and I'm gonna let the thing cook for 20 minutes and and you know I'll be good and it'll work and then what happens you pull the cake out and not only is it burnt to a crisp but it tastes like shit okay because your ego is getting in the way of following actual directions from someone who's already been down the path so you have to remove your ego and stop adjusting the recipe now when you do get to the point where you get the right ingredients and you put them in the bowl and then you pour them in the pan and you do exactly what she said you put the pan in the in the oven for 45 minutes it cooks for a 400 degrees you put it out and it's perfect this is the idea of aggressive patience all right you are following directions and you are understanding there's no way for me to shorten the time here there's no way for me to turn the temperature up and get the cake out faster and I shouldn't adjust it because you know what I don't know what the fuck I'm doing all right so you're in a good spot but here's the problem most people can't do this and the reason they can't follow the directions is because they lack the patience to understand that time is always going to be part of the recipe all right you can't get around it so when we talk about aggressive patience what we're talking about is this idea that we have to be patient and we have to understand that time is always going to be a factor in the outcome of what we're trying to produce and we also have to understand that during that time when we are being patient with the outcome we have to understand that those sick those days along the way we have to be executing at our highest capacity every single day because when people talk about patience they hear people say oh just be patient be patient be patient and they think that if they sit around with their feet on their desk and just chill eventually things materialize you know a lot of people believe that when they hit the age of 30 they're just going to become successful are we hit the age of 35 they'll have millions of dollars just because they're 35 this isn't how it works okay it might take you till 35 to get to that point yes absolutely but the only way that point is actually going to ever become reality in your life is that if you take every day from now until you're 35 and you win every single one of those days along the way with urgency all right so aggressive patience that's the that's the idea we are going to understand that things are going to take time but we're also going to understand that during the time that it takes we are going to aggressively execute every single possible day along the way and this goes into the concept what we talk about win the day right and if you want to know what win the day is you can go listen to episode 16 on the audio feed it will explain the entire concept that I have lined out with the powerless system that allows you to win every single day along the way while you're waiting for the result to materialize all right so this is how it works if you guys think you can hack your way around this process if you think you can you know get there twice as fast as the person before you by doing twice the amount of work and half the time it doesn't work because time is a requirement of product familiarity time is a requirement of consumer adoption they have to see what you're doing they have to learn to trust it they have to be educated around it and this takes time you can't rush that you can't outspend that so understanding you're 20 years old and you want to be a millionaire or a fucking decadent millionaire by 30 all right because if you want to be a millionaire your goal should really be to be a decadent millionaire that's the that's the reality so you're 20 now and you say okay I'm doing this and this is going to take until I'm 30 to do if you just sit around and put your feet on the on the chair on the desk that's never going to happen the only way that's going to happen is you're going to have to execute aggressively along the way so people just have the wrong idea when it comes to patients and they don't understand that when we talk about patients it means you're going to have to be patient while working your fucking ass off every single possible opportunity that you have and that's what we talk about when we talk about aggressive patients I love that but I want to ask you this how many people have you seen just quit because they can't handle the patient time they're waiting why that cake is baking like how many people have you seen quit because I'm not 99% of people quit this is what we can't see the progress this is dude this is how this works on day one you have a thousand people that show up to do whatever it is you're trying to do let's say you're trying to become the best jump roper in the world all right let's just say on day one there's a thousand people that are starting on that same day all over the planet all right and if you stick it out for the first six months half of those people have already quit they've already quit because they're like this is too hard I'm never going to do this they're doing for two or three days and they're out all right so now you're down to 500 people now if you stick it out for another year all right those people who stuck it out for six months they're going to come to a realization of fuck this isn't an overnight thing this is going to take time I don't have time for this this over here a shiny and new and it looks faster and they're going to quit so half of those people quit now you're down to 250 okay now you go for another year and it widows and widows and widows itself down until you find yourself to where you're one of only two or three people doing what it is you set out to do and you're five to ten years ahead of everybody else who's starting today just trying to get out and get going so the game the name of the game is persistence and fortitude and grit and this is why we talk about live hard and 75 hard being such an important tool for entrepreneurs because it gives you the ability to execute day by day by day especially when you don't feel like it because out of all this time that you're going to be on this journey half of the time if not more you're not going to feel like doing it and you're going to have to do it anyway and if you're one of these people who can execute whether they feel like it or whether they don't feel like it you are an unstoppable human being if you can execute when you feel great or you can execute when you feel like shit if you can execute when you're highly motivated or you can execute when you would rather do anything else than do that how can anyone else stop you from progressing they can't so you have to build this quality internally and then understand the game is longevity and persistence and fortitude and grit because everybody else falls off and by the time everybody else falls off you have a ridiculous amount of time experience above everybody else that's just starting and this is how you become great at whatever it is you do so you have to understand it's aggressive patience and the game is sticking it out because the longer you stick it out the less competition you are going to have and the more expertise you have which allows you to defeat the beginner competition this just makes sense absolutely keeps me up bay okay so if you guys want to win start understanding aggressive patience and start understanding the game of numbers that you're playing you are not playing this game of luck you are not playing this game of magic you're not playing this game of I'm gonna hit a hot streak and we're gonna go to the moon that's not the game you're playing you're playing a slow day by day months and singles and stolen bases version of entrepreneurship that eventually you're going to keep playing and playing and playing until there's nobody else playing has been playing as long as you and you're gonna be great and everybody else will just be starting so those are some principles that you guys need to keep in mind if you're gonna be successful over the course of your life
