What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate of item lies and thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome. From other fucking reality guys today we have Q and AF. Questions where you submit the questions and we give you the answers. Questions can be about anything. Usually they're about personal development, business, entrepreneurship, how to kick ass but if you want to throw some in there about other stuff too that's cool. You could submit questions for Q and AF episodes a couple different ways first way is guys you can email those questions into ask Andy at Andy for sell.com or you can go on YouTube on the Q and AF episodes drop your question in the comments and we'll pick some from there as well. Throughout the week we will have different episodes. Tomorrow we will have CTI that stands for cruise the internet that is where we put topics on the screen. We talk about what's going on we speculate on what we think is true we speculate on what we think is not true and then we talk about how we the people need to be the solution of the problems going on in the world. Then we have real talk real talk is five to twenty minutes of me just giving you a little real talk you some of you might call it a rant depending on how you take it but that's what it is. We have 75 hard versus that's where someone who is completely the 75 hard program comes on talks about how their life was before how their life is now and how you could change your life using the 75 hard program if you're unfamiliar with the 75 hard program it is the initial phase of the live hard program which you can find for free at episode 208. That's audio episodes only it's not on YouTube. There is a book called the book on mental toughness available on my website Andy for sell.com which outlines the entire live hard program plus 10 chapters on mental toughness why it's important to cultivate how it can improve your life and how it'll change your life. There's also some case studies some very successful people in there as well that you're going to recognize. You don't have to buy the book to get the program the program is available for free but the book will explain it nuts and bolts top to bottom inside out for those of you that need to know everything about it which I'm one of those people. We have a fee for the show the fee is very simple it's not monetary you'll notice that we don't run ads on the show. I don't like to be told what to do that's kind of my thing and so I'm not going to run any ads on the show because I don't want to listen to the shit and the benefit of that to you is you don't have to hear 30 minutes of ads or me talking about shit that I don't even use so that you know I can get paid I get paid other ways in my life so I ask very simply instead of that that you help us share the show okay we're constantly battling shadow bands and traffic throttling and censorship and if you don't share the show the message doesn't get out so if it's a good show it makes you think it makes you laugh gives you a new perspective gives you some skills or some information that are helpful to you do us a solid and don't be a hoe. Change show. All right. Hey what's up man I've been Monday yeah what's going on with you. Nothing dude just say more stuff you know you know what's up with you. Oh nothing much we had a good good little day Friday. It's past Friday got trying some stuff you guys were seeing that yeah yeah got DJ and I got some new suits yeah fucking Pimp yeah they are they are probably coolest thing I've ever owned in my life. You're saying no for sure yeah for sure and nobody's got that like nobody's that doesn't even exist dude these motherfuckers don't have no swag that's what it is I know yeah people are gonna shit their brains shit their brains right out right out there nostrils I think they already did that. No it's true yeah it's true at least at least 30% of society yeah for no no no no no our listeners might might be a little bit more than that but yeah okay yeah that's what it is. It's going on no man everything good yeah dude everything's great man. Train is going good finally healthy feeling good you know fuck man yeah that's good yeah feeling optimistic about the future no matter what happens because I don't think people are gonna tolerate some of the stuff going on and I feel that's coming to ahead which means that we're closer and closer and closer and moving forward the right way so I'm excited about that yeah it's like the quicker we get to the shit we can get past the shit yeah yeah that's kind of how I feel it's a good place to be yeah it's a good place to be well guys Andy is always I got some good ones for you all right let's do it. Thanks to these guys Andy question number one. Hey Andy I've spent the last two years strategically putting myself into a position to quit my job and start my own business. The time has come where I need to put it all on the line I'm ready but I know from listening to the show that my expectations are not going to be my reality and I should be on alert at all time for mishaps. My family is willing to help me with my business and everything my concern is that because this is literally all of my money and if something goes wrong I will likely lose everything so I feel as if maybe I should just do everything until I reach a point where I can afford for other people's mistakes. What are your thoughts on this? First of all transitioning from a career as an entrepreneur to a career as an entrepreneur is not a it's not usually a situation where you just go from one to the other. Usually you know you continue to work your main income source and you take your spare time your nights and your weekends and the time that you have outside of that and you build your business up to a point where it's making some income that will supplement the income that you're making at your primary job. And then when it gets to a point where you can survive on the new thing then you make the switch to full time. So first of all you should be thinking about that. Most people that go from one to the other and do what you're describing you want to do they end up failing. So it's very very important that you have some supplemental income while you're doing your business. If I hadn't have had that when I was coming up I would have failed. The first six years that I was in business I worked other jobs. I did other things to support. Yeah people don't realize that. Six years. Six years I ran the store from nine to and we were back in those days we were only open until seven o'clock because we weren't busy. But nine to seven and then it got to nine to nine and then I would go to the bar I would work at the bar or do other things like things that I did to make money was I promoted the concerts. I did our jobs construction concrete shit that I could earn some money to be able to keep the business open. So that's very very very common and you should not believe the people on the internet who you know say go in all in on yourself today because you don't know shit bro like you really don't and you need to have some supplemental income coming in while you transition out of that first career to the second career as an entrepreneur. Second point here is you should make really sure that this is what you want to do because this is not easy it's not simple it's not quick. The glory stories of entrepreneurship are the vast vast vast minority. The truth of the matter is most people fail and most people fail because they expect like you said in your question for it to be much easier than it really is the disparity between what reality is an entrepreneurship and how it's presented online. It's a million miles away and that's just reality. So you have to ask yourself are you really willing to give everything to this and that means your early mornings that means your nights that means your weekends that means everything. If you're not willing to give that entrepreneurship is not for you dude you will not win because there will always be people that are willing to do that and you at your skill set cannot compete with those people who are willing to do more and invest more of their time getting better than you will. So a lot of people here this idea of entrepreneurship as freedom it's not fucking freedom dude it's it's the furthest thing away from freedom. You don't get your weekends you don't get your holidays you don't bro I didn't even come home for fucking probably three four years but maybe once a year I was living three and a half hours away for Christmas or you know you miss a lot and this is reality dude and it's not talked about and the reason it's not talked about is because most of the people they're talking to you on the internet don't really have a real business if you dig into it. So how would they know this right there selling you ideas on how to build a real business when in reality they never built one so they don't tell you this shit because if they told you this shit they wouldn't be able to sell their shit alright so it's hardest fuck and you have to be real about what you're willing to give to it so that's the second point and the third point is is that you should in the beginning go as long as possible without bringing in outside help unless it's technical help that is skill set that you don't know and in that case you should not bring them on full time you should pay them to do a specific job until you are pulling in enough revenue to justify a position that would in that situation that would be full time so that's my answer to that question you know it's three parts my main thing here is dude really be honest with yourself about what you're willing to give are you willing to give up your life for the next 10 fucking years to do this and if you're not you shouldn't do it yeah. I want to clarify you're saying that because it sounds like this person is basically like I go two years maybe saved up a nest egg in the last two years and he's just trying to leave this and go straight out and you're saying it's better just make this more of a gradual change. Yeah I understand he has a nest egg bro but like when you start opening a business and there's all these different expenses especially when business owners are inexperienced at marketing and advertising this is where they usually fuck up because they think that they can spend a whole bunch on marketing and that will bring them all kinds of business and they don't really understand that when you start to advertise or run ads or however you're going to do it it takes multiple impressions for people whether that's television whether that's radio whether that's print whether that's digital it takes multiple impressions if you go out and think that you're going to and this is just a fundamental reality of building a company from bootstrap level now it now if you were able to get $200 million and raise cash this is a different fucking story but I'm talking about this situation or specifically the way that that people mess up their businesses in the beginning is they think that they can go out and gather a thousand customers and one ad campaign and that's just not really how it works dude you need to be thinking about building your business literally one customer one relationship at a time because if you build it one customer at one relationship at a time and you do a great job the exponential effect of that of gaining multiple customers is much quicker than you trying to go out and it's much more profitable than you trying to go out and get like a thousand customers with some big ad campaign because dude here's what happened that guy has this big nest egg and he goes out and he runs this ad right and it doesn't work and he's like okay the copy was wrong so he goes out and he runs another big campaign and it doesn't work okay the copy was wrong now they start saying you know he's running out of money right and because the problem really is they're not getting enough familiarity and they're not getting enough impressions to become intrigued enough or interested enough and you don't have the word of mouth out there working for you so it takes even longer all right so what these guys do is they go out they have a fundamental misunderstanding of how the business actually works they think they can blow their business up with ad campaigns and then what ends up happening is they don't work and then the reason they don't work they're completely missing they don't understand it takes all these impressions to get familiar and so they change their copy from here to here to here to here and they change their branding from here to here to here to here to here and what happens is the familiarity can't happen because they're not consistent in their fucking message or their brand so they suicide themselves by going through all their cash and that's that's what I'm trying to help this individual avoid yeah and I would I would also imagine too you know like you know when you guys were sure there's probably there were probably a bunch of like hidden costs that you didn't even know of course you know I'm saying like phone bills or how bro you know I'm saying so it's like you're trying to put this money into a business at the same time wait until you start figuring out how much tax they take from your business wait until you figure that out yeah that'll be a lesson for you yeah people think you know oh you buy this for nothing and sell it for a lot and you just fucking rolling in dough and dude you don't understand how hard they the government makes a business to actually scale if they actually remove the tax restrictions on businesses the economy will go fucking crazy but they don't want to do that because you know they want us to be suppressed because as people get wealthy they get more leverage they get more power and they don't like that yeah so yeah that's real shit man love it let's get to question number two hey Andy Andy I just started a podcast and I've been doing it for almost a year now I post four episodes a month the problem is I'm not seeing any traction how long should I go on this before I call it quits I know the space is super competitive and I see other podcasts popping up and becoming overnight success why isn't this working for me because you probably suck you probably ain't good enough to do it okay like here's let's say answer the answer is the market dictates the result and if you're good the market responds and if you're not good the market does not respond and I would say that most likely if I'm guessing you probably haven't done anything or you don't have a crazy story to tell and you don't have lessons to tell and people are honestly tired of just these regular people having conversations with the microphone and fucking headphones everybody thinks they can podcast and everybody can podcast but having a successful podcast is pretty fucking rare it's the hardest platform to win at and it's not for everybody so you may not have the skill set to do it now could you develop the skill set to do it for sure but what I would recommend is that you go out in your life and you build something to be incredibly interesting around look at the guests that people have on shows they all have an interesting story what's your story what's your position of authority what are you an expert at what it why should people listen to you just because everybody has a microphone and their fucking social media and headphones bro it's become a joke real talk like if I like if I wish they would price microphones and headphones like like $10,000 each just because dude like the shit subsurge everybody thinks that if they do a piece of fucking content with a microphone and a headphones they're going to get millions of views dude it comes down to what you say it comes down to your message it comes down to how you deliver your message and it comes down to the credibility you have and so podcasting is very competitive and to be great at it you either got it you you got to have a great story you got to have done some real shit or you got to be really great at having conversations and you got to have a personality and you know a lot of this stuff that we see online with podcast is you know it's gotten really hot but you know yeah it's it doesn't get traction you know these guys are getting 30 40 listens on their podcast and that's okay if you're gonna commit to it for 10 years I've been doing my shit for nine years dude you know what I'm saying Rogan's been doing it for like 20 years all right you've been doing it for one right you know so you know it took me a hundred episodes to even get like kind of okay so I you know that's another thing if you do have the skills and you do have a story let's say you built a company I don't know if you did or did not I don't know enough about it but if you did or you did something crazy or whatever your podcast is about you know you may not have been doing it long enough you just may not yeah years not a long time no it's not and your skill set may not have developed like this is like anything else reps reps reps reps reps reps reps and you're gonna get better and better and better and better and better and so if you're dedicated to it I would figure out how to become interesting and the easiest way to become interesting is to go out and build something in real life that people want to know how the fuck you did it or at least put you in a position to speak on things like I didn't just come on here and start giving fucking entrepreneur advice I had built shit before my you know my company was a hundred million dollar company before I would have a fucking podcast you see what I'm saying got some stuff to say yeah so like what the fuck are you doing what gives your fucking credibility and that's that's where that's what people miss bro just because you you think you got shit to say doesn't mean anybody's gonna listen to it unless it's really good shit it's like the guys that you see that are out there doing podcasts at a high level that people were listening to and they haven't like really built anything but their podcast they're fucking funny or they they're great at conversation or they're entertaining and they make people fucking laugh and they got personality and what I see is a bunch of you guys getting on there and going like this you got a work hard and be tough and it's like you got to do the thing yeah you got to do the work man and it's like yeah you might be saying similar shit but the way you say it sucks you don't have it right like dude it these are real variable yeah bro there's it's real and like dude you have at the end of the day you have to be good there's you're not entitled to a fucking top podcast bro you're not entitled to a successful business you're not entitled to a great fucking career you have to be good and it doesn't matter how much work you do if you don't develop the skill set so like you could do your podcast for 10,000 episodes the way you're doing it it probably never gonna catch because you're not good okay and that's maybe you are good maybe you're the fucking best ever I'm not trying to scourge you but you haven't been doing it long enough you need fucking story you need some unique competitive advantages that make you different and I would say another thing a lot of you guys are afraid to be authentic like you're really afraid of it like your best you is that that's the product like I don't come on here and pretend to be something else I know some of you guys do because when you meet people that know me that they always tell me what you ask do you really like that yeah motherfucker I'm just like this in my life true or not true is that true yes that this is me yeah you guys get me you don't get some fucking bullshit tone down version of me and I believe that's why a lot of you guys like to show so be authentic be who you are tell tell people what it is like how what what do you really think you know what I'm saying like what do you really really what do you really think man how do you really feel yeah you know and like just let it rip dude yeah let me actually this because there was a part of this question and I'm curious is he you know because obviously you know you talk about like listen there's a journey this is gonna be long you talk about how hard it's gonna be yeah and and even still with that there is a possibility that it still may not work yeah right yeah but there's this concept this idea of this overnight success bro let's let's talk about it yeah this guy like what he said oh I see all these other podcasts like who who wears you know yeah there's exceptions bro there's like it looks like it looks like overnight success success okay but like busing with the boys will Compton will Compton has done a ton of shit and now he fucking finally got to a point where it's great and everybody loves it he'd been doing it for years and years and years you know Bobby all tough super popular okay you know why because it's unique the way she does it is unique okay it's nobody's doing it like that so it catches and she has amazing guess so you know dude what is your fucking unique selling selling proposition what what is that like what what are you who are you what do you think what do you say how are you different how are you different from the fucking millions of people that have bought a fucking microphone and sit on their fucking they make reels what their fucking headset on and it's probably not even plugged in and no shit and they're fucking doing fake it like what makes you different than that and by the way stop doing that shit bro like find a new way to do it like real talk like a lot of you guys like the shit's overplayed man and I I know that sounds weird coming from me because every single fucking clip you see it we don't have dude every clip everybody's ever seen to me is exactly the same I'm bitching about it I know I sound like an asshole but like I'm just being real man like I don't want you to waste all this time and never get anywhere you know what I mean yeah can you take us back to the first MFC episode uh I mean what do you what do you what do you want to know about it like what were like I mean like I mean the first episode is terrible yeah it's fucking terrible it's terrible if I in fact that's why I leave up a lot of the old shows because I'm like you know what people should go back and listen to how bad I was you know what I mean yeah nine years ago yeah it's terrible dude yeah and that's the thing that's why I said it took a hundred episodes it took a hundred episodes for me to get even decent you know what I'm saying I got almost a thousand podcast episodes under my belt a thousand that's a fucking shit time thousand and three thousand and three that's a good guess I knew it was almost a thousand yeah I looked at it yesterday yeah that's fucking crazy yeah a thousand okay like you got fucking seven that's why you suck yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I love it I love it man guys let's get you on third and final question Andy question number three so a little back yeah what do you say what do you say one episode a week uh four episode yeah one oh yeah so that's 52 episodes yeah bro no shit you suck real talk yeah real talk that just based off of string numbers here yeah yeah yeah I would keep I would if I were you I'd do two a week just so you can accelerate the process of improvement and fuck fuck if they don't listen if you're that committed to it fuck them if they don't listen you're gonna improve your skill setting eventually another thing you could do to start you know when you get good enough start having guests on that have other podcasts and and collab with that you know what I'm saying very few people can like just hold a show on their own you know what I mean it's not and they don't have to be famous they don't have to be they got to be interesting right you know what I mean all right I love guys uh Andy question number three or third and final question Andy a little backstory I went to prison when I was 18 years old uh mixed of poor decisions and surrounding myself with the realm crowd anyways fast forward uh I get out at as a 25 year old man by 30 I was a low level manager at a demolition company that's when I found the MFCO podcast and eventually 75 heart I want to thank you personally because 75 heart changed my life dramatically I went from $60,000 a year low level manager position to a project manager position shortly after my 75 heart journey making six figures now I am 33 years old and I've worked my way up to be part of the ownership group at the very same demo company I started that we've been around for 20 plus years and currently an eight figure business my question is how do I approach changing the culture at a business that has been doing things a certain way for so many years recently there's been some employee turnover all stating a quote toxic work environment that doesn't care about their employees personally I don't see this to be true but I want to help turn my company into the go to place of employment for anyone that wants to work in the demo space I'd appreciate any advice yeah for me for sure man first of all that's that's awesome dude like that's what it's about nobody's perfect people make mistakes people fuck up their lives the goal is to not fuck it up again the goal is to be better afterwards and so I just want to say that's awesome I respect the fuck out of that and I actually kind of respect that more than someone who never had to do that because like that's an incredibly difficult thing to go through so congratulations on that that's cool just make sure you don't go back so so yeah dude so like Vince Lombardi has a famous quote and it's very simple leading by example isn't the best way to lead it's the only way to lead and if you as an entrepreneur which is what you are would like to change the culture in your environment you have to start with yourself so you have to start behaving how you would like the culture to be and if you're having an environment where people are saying it's toxic that means you're going to have to correct to where it's positive and it's it's not that so you got to be the opposite of that and you have to assert yourself to build relationships with the people in your company to make them feel because I guarantee if you're having all these people say the same thing you probably got a real problem there even if you don't see it okay because it's a commonality dude so and by the way culture goes up and down culture culture once you set it in place doesn't always stay at a high level it goes up and down in proportion to how much effort you invested it like everything else so if you want the culture to change dude you got to you are going to have to put in the work and you're going to have to put in the work in a way that it's noticeable so what that means is you're going to have to be fucking awesome you're going to have to lead you're going to have to coach these people you're going to have to make them feel you know want it and important and recognized and seen and eventually what will happen is your other partners in your in your group will say you know what's the guy's name to say okay Steve all right they're going to say they're going to say Steve what do you do an awesome man you're kicking ass blah blah blah and then what that what that's going to do is give you an opportunity to sit down with the guys and say all right guys look here's the deal I wanted to do this because we were getting this and this and this and I want to transfer form the company into the best place of employment that we can possibly be and to do that I've had to put in all this work and so what I'd like to do is formalize a positive culture and I like to sit down with you guys and come up with you know a mission statement some core values and then really go through some leadership training together so that we can maintain this culture that I've got going because it will help us grow the business it will help us avoid turnover it will help us have more enjoyment and more fun doing what we do I don't know but blowing shit up sounds pretty awesome and tearing shit down I like that but the point is you're going to have to kind of build it on your own and then bring it to the other people you could always bring it to the other people and then get them all to build it but that's less of a convincing argument because they're not seeing what you've already done so like a lot of times mid-level leadership or you know even just not the main shot collar in the business will bring ideas to the main shot collar in the business and that will get shot down because there's nothing you can really see so the better you know like what's that saying it's better to ask for forgiveness than it is for permission this is one of those situations where you want to go do it and then bring it okay because that way when they notice how great of a job you're doing you've already proven the concept to them and it's going to be easy to get there by and and then you can formalize the culture of the company I love that and let me actually this so as as as a leader in organization as even a shot collar or maybe just a high level executive wherever the case is when it comes to addressing issues or things that are being brought up how how exactly do you know when something needs to be addressed is it one employee saying like hey this might be a problem is it two or three right like you're mentioned like you've got a couple of employees saying that they feel like it's toxic okay well it might be an issue depends on how big your company is too okay like if you have you know 500 plus employees you're gonna have some buzz and that's not good all the time because you're dealing with people and people sometimes you know they become unhappy with their lives in some way and they start to feel like they need to change their lives and they actually end up blaming their career for their unhappiness when their unhappiness comes from other areas and then this is a big this is a lesson in the lesson yeah a lot of people fuck up their lives like this because they leave great careers because they're unhappy in other places and they blame their career and then they get outside that career and they're like fuck I fucked up okay so you need to make sure that you understand that if you have a big number of employees you're always going to have a few people that are upset and it may not even be a real thing it might that's just the numbers game right um but you know when you when you start to have like if you have a smaller company and you have you know three or four people that are saying that it's probably a real thing you know um and by the way when you have big company and you do have only two or three people that doesn't mean ignore them because they might have very valid points uh so it's just important to listen it's important to judge those things I have a little thing that I teach my leaders uh and South teaches his you know our leaders um there's a difference between bullshit and real shit don't ever bring me bullshit if someone's just bitching the bitch don't bring that shit to me real shit bring it to me or handle it right and if you want to be really good handle it on your own uh but if you have to you bring it to us we fix it so those are you know that's a good rule to have what's bullshit and what's real shit and you need to become really good at figuring out which is which yeah I love it man yeah I love it well guys 80 that was three all right guys let's have a great week don't be a hoe shut the shop
