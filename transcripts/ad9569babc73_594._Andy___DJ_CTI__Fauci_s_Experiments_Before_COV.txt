I'm tired of pretending like I got to care about everything mother fucker. I care about us You know what I'm saying? Oh, you don't care about kids and alligators your piece of shit. Maybe sell Maybe maybe you're right. I still care about this more than that. Yeah, that's real. There has to be a hierarchy here You know, yeah, like you got to take care of this fundamental need here first Yeah, that's why they tell you to put on your fucking oxygen mask first before you put it on your kid Mm-hmm. Also, you don't love your kid. Well, no, but if I pass a fuck out, we're both gonna go I Don't love your kid Especially if there's alligators. Yeah, no, yeah, well What's getting to a guy's headline number one headline number one reads Revealed Anthony Fauci run lab in Montana experimented with coronavirus Strain shipped in from Wuhan a year before COVID pandemic began It's not shocking at all, but there's there's some interesting stuff in this But it's all coming out and I think the timing of this is also very interesting I'd love to get your take on that. But let's dive into this so oh, you know you're gonna get my take Everybody knows that So so this is a daily male article by the way guys it reads US taxpayer money was used to experiment with Coronavirus is from the Chinese lab thought to be the source of the COVID pandemic more than a year Before the global outbreak and investigation has found The National Institutes of Health or NIH under Dr. Anthony Fauci's leadership Infected 12 Egyptian fruit bats with a SARS-like virus called WIV1 at a lab in Montana in 2018 The WIV1 coronavirus was shipped from the Wuhan lab The FBI believes caused the COVID pandemic and was tested on bats acquired from a roadside Maryland zoo The research Revealed this week by a campaign group determine the novel virus could not cause a robust infection But the the research is more evidence of ties between the US government and the Wuhan lab as well as the funding of dangerous Virus research across the globe So the paper SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 cove does not replicate in Egyptian fruit bats was published in the journal viruses in 2018 The study was first flagged by drastic a group of internet activists who Investigate the origins of COVID-19 and the lab leak theory The group white coat waste project is now using the Freedom of Information Act to request more details about the experiment The white coat waste project is a watchdog that has been fighting to stop sending American tax dollars overseas to fund dangerous virus research The 2018 experiment was carried out by the NIH's Rocky Mountain the Bore Tories in Montana Now here's the interesting thing So You know all these bats they had there was about they confirmed there was about 523 federally regulated animals as of April 2023 So this stuff is still going on no shock to anybody and about half of those are bats But just last week it also came out this this headline also reported by Daily Mail This how long reads Chinese scientists discover eight never before seen viruses and now they plan to experiment with those as well And this little bit of island that nobody's gonna ever go to or get off of They're finding these new viruses and the strut into experiment with those as well I Read this little final statement for you. So an statement from the president and founder of WCW Anthony Bellatotti Said our investigation has uncovered the real-life horror story of how a shady roadside zoo whose curator was an NIH Animal experimenter shipped off bats to a deadly government virus lab overseeing by Dr. Fauci To be infected with the coronavirus Obtained directly from the Wuhan lab that experts believe caused COVID Anyone have got on this What do you got on this You I just I'm shocked at how like nobody's arrested this guy I'm shocked at how people of the world haven't rallied and then just fucking drug this motherfucker through the streets like he lied to Conhold on repeatedly dude listen. Where's this guy? Where is he? Like where is this dude like do you ever notice you never see him you can't find him You know, you don't see him in public like where is this guy? Is he a real guy is he actually a real human being like does he have an address does he have a life does he have a real family like Where is this dude because the only time you ever see this motherfucker is when they're talking about these people Taking deadly viruses and basically playing with them And you know, let's be real. There's another side of this narrative right the other side of this narrative is what they're they're actually doing versus what they're telling us These experiments are not experiments. These are how to weaponize these viruses against people like you and me And because we didn't wake up and we didn't stand up and we didn't resist and we didn't hold these people accountable Now they're in a position to do what they did again only this time with a much more deadly virus which I have been saying for a number of years I thought the play was either going to be a world war which by the way I was fucking right or Another virus which actually kills people at scale Which appears to be you know this appears to me to be the framework of that narrative coming to life In the not too distant future and because you guys Continue to worry about what's going on with the Kardashians and continue to worry about all this bullshit that you don't fucking doesn't even matter We're gonna end up dealing with something that is probably legitimately going to kill you know Not not millions of people but probably hundreds of millions maybe even billions of people and When all that happens all of you who stood by and didn't share the show and didn't speak up and didn't stand up and just did what you were told You're all complicit in that whatever happens and and I'm not so at the end of the day bro You know, I'm kind of tired of fighting for people. They won't fight for themselves Yeah, you know, I'm kind of tired of like shining lights on things and then having people just kind of go on with their life like I'm like It's my responsibility to continue to do this like That's not my responsibility It's all of our responsibilities You know and people aren't realizing it, you know like I saw but I saw more posts about the motherfucking world series yesterday Then I have seen from fucking anybody's people about this, you know, and it do their pussies and you know what pussies get what they deserve Hard hard dicks. Well, they're gonna get one right up the ass and they're not gonna like it. No No, I do want to ask you this man because I was thinking about this everybody's gonna be like DJ They're gonna be like what happened. I can't believe this is happening. How do we let this happen? You let it happen Mm-hmm you let it happen By because you were a coward and you wouldn't stand up or speak up this entire time There's a number of you listening and by the way, let me say this there's a number of you listening the show every single time I love you guys not hoes, okay? But there's a number of you that is of the greater Listenership that do not and you come and listen to the show and you're afraid to share it You're afraid to speak up you're afraid to stand up because you're afraid you might be wrong Motherfucker, where have I missed? Where have I missed? I'm not leading you wrong I'm exposing you what's actually happening and because you're silent and because you're afraid and because you won't stand up The rest of us are getting our asses beat first of all and second of all This is going to happen and it's gonna be much worse, okay? So you thought what happened with COVID was gonna be bad? You have no idea what they're gonna do bro, and I'm convinced they're gonna do it now I did for a while think it was a war or this but now I'm starting to think it's and it might be both Yeah, yeah, I want to ask you this man. So like think going back to you know COVID 1.0 right? I was trying to like think about this and trying to really like understand it Why didn't they just release the real deal then? You know, I'm saying like well how I how I you know, that's a good question, but how I've reconciled that question for me is I believe they thought that everybody was going to fall in line with COVID I believe they thought they were gonna get much more compliance than they did and you know when you break down the data You know less than 50% of the people actually went and got the vaccine now they'll tell you 70% here But that's not the actual number the actual number is less than 50% that means they got less than 50% buy in to do what they wanted People to do and I don't think they were counting on The resistance being as big as it was Which still wasn't enough because if we're being honest how we all stood up with the mask thing We wouldn't be here right now. We would have said none of this shit would have happened Okay, everything would have fallen apart right there and we would have been back on track the economy would be killing it We wouldn't be dealing with this division. We wouldn't be dealing with this war We wouldn't be dealing with any of the shit had people actually stood up and here's the part that bothers me Is that most of you knew that it was wrong? You know like I've been alive long within a reason a month Yes, and you went along with it anyway Yeah, and so how I see this is They thought that they were going to get total compliance in that situation and they thought that the amount of resistance was going to be much smaller And there what they planned on doing which is in my opinion evidence by like the things that Trudeau said or the things Australia did or the things that New Zealand did I I believed that the small amount of resistance they anticipated which was drastically underestimated on their part they were just going to dispose of right they were going to put in camps They were going to get everybody to agree like like when Trudeau said What are we going to do with these people and you have Biden on TV saying this is a pandemic of the Unvaccinated which clearly wasn't true All of that was narrative to villainize people who were resisting and I believe that had they got their way With the small amount of resistance they would have put those people in camps and definitely removed all their rights Maybe even executed them and saying these people are a dead menist to society that didn't happen And so what I see now is They have moved on to plan B and plan B is okay We're not going to depopulate through a vaccine like Bill Gates says right multiple. He says he says it It's not me making things up Bill Gates talks about this openly and these people talk about these things openly And instead of doing it that way now they've just come to the the conclusion will fuck We're just going to have to kill all these people And I think they're going to accomplish that through this war that they're that they're Intentionally starting in the Middle East That none of you actually know what is actually about you all think it's about you know Palestine and Israel It's not about that at all. It's about a fucking it's about a trade pathway It's about a gas port and it's about depopulation and nobody's talking about those things And if you were to actually go do your research you don't understand that you're a fucking fool For thinking this is about Palestine versus Israel and every argument you make about it You sound dumber and dumber and dumber because you're not understanding These people have a completely different agenda They just know that you're going to get upset and argue about that one And while you're focused on that they're going to keep pulling the fucking Real estate away from us Dude because that's the perfect play man. I'm not to cut you up. That's a perfect play though because you got the war that's going to take out the strongest Bravest most patriotic and then the disease is going to take care of the bottom portion of society The sick is the healthiest and then you're left with this population that is who's scared to fight But healthy enough to work Do you know what the average age that you creating soldier is even after a year or a half? 43 years old. Yeah, that means they've effectively wiped out all the fighting age men from the age of 18 to 43 And fucking a year and a half two years Think about that Okay, that this is why when you go to Europe like people don't realize this Do you know why when you come to America all the men are like big and like You know like I'm not talking about the fat fucks of Walmart. I'm talking about I'm not I'm talking about like Like people like me. Okay, or people like Emily's dad like who six five and you know he's he's a grown man Like we have grown men here in America, right? But you go to Europe. You don't have that And if you've never been to Europe, you don't understand this when you go to Europe everybody's five fucking six and 160 pounds And you wonder why well the reason why is because in World War two all the fucking fighting Stock was removed from society And they continue to remove the fighting stock from society every single generation of men across the globe So that the elite tyrants across the world can maintain control All right, and that this is this is the reality of these life these wars every generation. This is what's happening And so When we look at what they're trying to do, you know, you ask the original question was why didn't they just go all out during 2020 I think because they thought they would be able to ease this in And now they've realized they can't ease it in anymore. So now it's violence and now it's going to be forced And this goes into the line of thinking that I've brought up to you guys many many times over the years Which is if you knew that If you gave up your power your position of power that you're currently in Let's just say it's your job right now. Let's say you at your job Let's say you knew that if you gave up your position at your job That it meant that you were either going to go to jail or you were going to be executed What would you be willing to do to the people behind you in order to maintain your position of power? Not take them all out. Okay, so when you think about this from a very logical standpoint and you put yourself in that position It becomes very obvious that these people are willing to do whatever they need to do to maintain Avoidance of accountability which we all want right so When we look at what's actually happening here Well, you know, and I could be wrong and I hope I am because if I'm right there's really not a whole lot that can be done um But how I see it you know is is they're they're moving into the mask of communism kind of coming off And then this going into force I mean just look at what's going on in the world right now This is no different than what's happened with the black square This is no different than what's happened with Ukraine It's no different than what's happened with COVID You know, we've got a situation now where no reasonable discussion can be had About what's going on in the middle east because whatever side you say you stand for you're the worst possible scenario Of a human being if you stand with them right like if you say I don't think it's right that all these Palestinians are getting wiped to fuck out. Oh, you're you're a fucking terrorist You're a terrorist some you're a terrorist anti-Semite Okay, if you say hey You know, I don't I don't uh agree with Jewish people being taken advantage of by their government and being attacked by terrorists and allowed to be tacked by terrorists You know you're a conspiracy theorist or you're a fucking flake or you're a fraud like there's no position that you can take in society Where other people aren't gonna just attack you and because we can't have an honest conversation Based around reality and reality is very simple United States government does not represent the United States people Israeli government does not represent Jewish people Hamas does not represent all of Palestine, okay And if you can't understand that and have a discussion Like your your IQ is very low and that's the problem that we have in America We have a very low standard IQ where people get highly emotional about things and cannot have a real discussion This is no different than why you can't talk about the black crime rate in this country Can't talk about it. If you talk about it, you're a fucking racist. Well, I'm sorry I'm not a racist. I'm pro-American and I would like to cure this problem that that actually Hurts a lot of our fellow Americans which happen to be black people right? So I would like to address this issue And until we can have open conversations and be people that can actually say things and have a little courage None of these problems can be solved but because they've propagated the courage out of us by using societal weapons like cancel culture And a bunch of other ones to political correctness etc We have a bunch of cowards. We have a bunch of people that can't solve problems and they know that yeah No, of course that's the intent. Yes. Yeah, man. I mean, what do you think? Yeah, no, I mean I mean bro, how do we solve how do we solve you can't okay? How do we solve a problem of black crime if you can't talk about black crime Or who's committing it okay? What's it's called black crime? Well, it's not called fucking maybe crime. All right Fucker like we know who's committing it. Okay. It's a call the statistical reality. You can't talk about it Yeah, but like we also can't talk about you know, and then like if you say that they say well What about the white people commit yes the white people commit crimes as well? They just commit them at a far less rate Like we have to fucking be honest about what the fuck is going on and like by the way That's not a knock on black people that's a knock on the way black people have been treated in this country By the people they've been lied to to vote for over and over and over again for 60 fucking years Okay, which is the Democrat party? Oh, they switched back in the day the fuck they did Okay, that's a lie But how can we solve what's going on when these people are running all these plays if every time they throw Something at us all we do is attack each other right because we want to pick sides and we want to be right And let's be honest a lot of these Consurban to the influencers are part of the problem. They're a big part of the problem I think they're the biggest part of the problem Everybody says it's these people that are shown on lips of tic-tac and all these crazy. No, it's actually not that The people who are causing this to continue are in two categories of people one It's the people who see what's going on that refuse to speak up and still comply That's the number one offender of what's going on with this country And those are the people that are costing us you guys who listen to this show and never speak up never stand up never get engaged and just listen to it and don't do shit You're the number one problem, okay? Number two and by the way for those of you that do Try we see you too. Oh, yeah, I'm not I'm not knocking a group, okay Number two these conservative influencers who before three and a half years ago We're nobody all right who have now built some sort of platform around You know being a part of the quote-unquote the solution have gone from resisting tyranny and standing up for what they think is right into this whole new system of being upon for the media outlets To circulate the information right these media outlets and these people who put these narratives out They understand that that these conservative influencers are going to sensationalize their point of view and basically Rile people up over and over and over in a highly emotional state and when you get these people in a highly emotional state They can't think and if we look at some of these guys and by the way, I'm friends with some of these guys some of these guys I as a person I really like them a lot as a business person their stupidest fuck because they don't understand what they're doing Is actually serving themselves instead of serving the cause and if you actually serve the cause There probably be a place for you to actually make more money But all you want to do is sensationalize all of this crazy shit because you are a relevant before 2020 And you want to sell your gear or whatever the fuck it is you're doing and you're all you're doing Is perpetuating the problem because we can't ever get to an agreement and and it's really weird to me That after all of these things the masks the black square the vaccine you crane fucking Now the Middle East we have these these people continue to fall for the same propaganda play over and over and over again and cannot see their own Roll and and and they're in this chess game that they're a part of their cog in there. Yeah, bro You're a pond like if you can't freely think and Just think basic human thoughts like if you've lost the ability to critically think like Fuck these are innocent people bro. These these people in Palestine. These are innocent people These people in Israel that were attacked these are innocent people And if you can't see that it's the governments and the organizations positioning for power and wealth and control over humanity You've lost you've lost your perspective like you're you're out of touch, bro Like these are people these are normal human beings and like you know When I came out two three weeks ago whatever when the shit started and I said fuck I care to fuck about America That's a fact. I don't care. I don't care what they do They should care what they do and they should care more about what they do and this idea that We are somehow the world police and have to go fix everybody's problem on our tax dollars This is what I was talking about you guys have all seen that clip or heard me say on the show about how America is the biggest slaves It's got like a hundred million views on tic-tac. Okay, it's everywhere You know, I'm talking about that one where I say hey, we're the biggest slaves in the world where where is it? Where are all these other countries paying their tax dollars to help us? It doesn't exist That's a fact and not only are we the biggest slaves in the world not only do we work our entire lives to have our tax dollars Take it from us and sent to these third-party causes halfway around the globe Then when a military conflict comes to us we're rallied up into this quote-unquote patriotic frenzy for freedom and democracy To go over there and kill our generation of men who are our warriors every single generation and like dude when I look at what's happening here I see the big picture. I don't see the little picture and you know that may be for me being in business That might be for me being an entrepreneur my whole life. I don't know But when I look at the entire package here. It's very obvious to me and It apparently isn't everybody else And then on top of that too, it's like you know that war that we send those people to go fight You know the kids of both of those people that are involved in this generation the kids of those people You know, that's the cures the next fight.

We got headline Number two Had a number two reach Big city mayors had to DC with a message for Biden on migrants Yeah, so let's use more taxpayer dollars to go here to compl- I do think you could have sent a fucking tax message But there's some interest to shit with this man. I thought was Some interest of stuff going on Andy you ready for it? Yeah, so uh, so so this is uh, this is AP news New York a coalition of big city mayors is headed to Washington on Thursday to urge the federal government to offer more help with the surge and migrants that are overwhelming their cities budgets and services the democratic Antifers will include the mayors of New York City Uh, in Chicago along with Denver mayor Michael Johnston According to a press release from his office Johnston is apparently leading the group Um ahead of the trip several mayors weighed in on the crisis facing their cities including the mayors from Los Angeles and Houston They wrote a letter to the administration earlier in the day to plead their case asking for a meeting with the president More eight and a quicker path to work authorization for the migrants quote This is not sustainable what you're seeing in Chicago where children are sleeping in police precincts And this is not sustainable what we are attempting to do in Floyd Bennett field New York City mayor Uh, Eric Adams said during a televised television appearance Wednesday night referring to a new tent facility in Brooklyn Quote we need to have the same voice Uh, the group is expected to meet with the Biden administration officials overseeing various parts of the immigration process And members of congress Uh, there was not specified whether the mayors will talk with the president Now here's the thing So that meeting was today right um, so Eric Adams was flying into DC right I don't know if you saw this yet Um, but then this headlighting comes out FBI raids home of top mayor Eric Adams fundraiser Brianna sucks Right um, so The home of a top fundraiser for New York City mayor Eric Adams was rated by the feds Thursday morning just as his owner On a slate of white house immigration meetings to return to the bigger apple almost as soon as he landed in DC the post has confirmed So he's on a flight he lands in DC feds kick in this lady's home. He gets right back on the plane and heads back to New York City Well, it's a little suspect there um says federal agents busted into the Brooklyn home of Brianna sucks a close consultant Whose firm has earned more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars from the mayor's campaign team since to 2021 Sugs herself has also received more than sixteen thousand five hundred dollars in personal payments from Adams accounts According to the campaign finance filings her company sucks solution LLC is registered to a family-owned brownstone at nine to nine Lincoln place and crown heights according to property records Quote I heard screaming maybe two or three hours ago one neighborhood to the post. I heard helicopters also Um, the house is boarded up So city records show suges is also on a monthly retainer for his owners Political work so I just did not pick up the phone with a post call and does not return the call She's probably in jail. Well, I'll tell you this the post lies about them trying to call people and fucking meet people That's a fact. Yeah, so let's be honest. It's a fact every single mother fucking time they've run a story on me Oh, we tried to reach him the fuck you did. I know you didn't yeah, you didn't okay much liars anyway Yeah, I just like keep it fair. Yeah, I just thought that was interesting And so so this guy goes to DC soon as he lands the kick in the door. He's right back home. Uh-huh Like he gets right back off. That sounds like oh shit. That sounds like like that sounds like oh shit. Oh shit Fuck yeah, that's one of that. Yeah With the agent there, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, um, but in other news of this migration issue I don't know if you guys got a chance to see this this headline reads huge 5,000 migrant caravan starts walking to us from Mexico So this is this is coming out the start of Monday apparently so a huge caravan of about 5,000 migrants to start it moving north towards the US on foot From Mexico southern border the enormous group started making its way north on Monday according to organizers and officials Walking in a long line along highway migrants in the caravan hail from Cuba El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras and Venezuela when organizers said Um, anyone we got on this. Oh, and that's also at the same time that you got you know FBI director warning Americans to stay vigilant Um for attacks inspired by Hamas What we got on this It's an invasion It's been an invasion You know, and it's it's interesting to me that all those cities you mentioned Are all those mayors are far left mayors who for fucking the last four years before This administration took office called Trump a racist a big it anybody who said we needed a wall They're they're in yeah, they're they're they're rate yet aOC down there at the border staging photoshoots like These you're getting what the fuck you voted for Okay, I'm sorry to say this, but this is the truth I see all the black inner city people and Chicago throwing a fit Well, you all fucking voted for this, right? Okay, because you believe something is someone on the TV told you about somebody being quote unquote racist What's more racist somebody saying you know some bullshit a tweet or somebody legitimately allowing Millions of people to come to your country that makes your voter relevant and pushes you out of the the community that that is yours. Yeah I mean, that's reality threatens your safety. Yeah, so so like you know honestly I actually think this is a great thing especially for the black communities in inner cities. No, it's a massive way Yeah, because you're realizing that you've been fucking lied to like a lot of us have been trying to tell you massive wake up So it is what it is. I would say out of like you know like I mean because like let's be honest like You know the the political game that you know places like Texas are playing where they're busing these fucking migrants further inside our country Like that's a game. It's fucked up But I would say that that is one massive positive is that you know the awakening that's happening in those communities Sure waking up like oh shit. Okay. Yeah. Well, I wish you guys would have woken up when the rest of us said we're not fucking racist, bro We're trying to address facts. Yeah, you know, and because the victimization around the term racist has been so powerful for so long in this country you know People have realized that like you get your way when you call someone a racist or you call someone a name and Eventually people don't give a shit anymore and so now you're observing real racism now You have the government that you voted for importing all of these people from different countries putting them in your neighborhoods displacing you from your community which by the way I agree has been neglected for 60 years because you continue to vote for these same people and Now you're experiencing what real racism racism looks like it's discriminating against the inner city black people In favor of people who aren't even citizens of this country and so I my hope is is that the black community will finally wake up And start to realize you know holy shit This is this is bullshit and start to see what real racism is because in my opinion real racism doesn't look like somebody making a tweet or saying something It actually not even a word any of the words by the way Real racism is taking actual action to handicap an entire culture of Americans black Americans over the last 60 fucking years By convincing them to vote for people who every single two and four year cycle come to the black communities and say vote for us And we'll fix it. We'll stop these guys over there from taking everything from you when in reality Those guys over there aren't taking shit from you They've been fighting for you the whole time But you continue to believe these people and these people then go to Washington DC and they intentionally pass laws and pass regulations And take positions that make your life hard, okay, and then when they pass money for community Education things and the inner cities of this country they figure out a way to steal it And that's real racism real racism is not some dude from 10 years ago saying the n-word bro It's just not okay. You could say whatever the fuck you want. I don't give a shit Here's the reality the reality is actual racism is taking actions that actually hurt Erase of people and that's been going on very intentionally here for a long 60 years here in the United States against the black communities And I would be I hope That the black communities will start to wake up. I think they are when I go and look at some of the more traditional black pages You know such as like rap or wool star, you know when they talk about this woke shit like nobody's buying it anymore But then again, you still have the quote-unquote black activists that every single time something's posted their crying racism like bro that dog has left the race Okay, that that shit doesn't have no horse to no one fucking cares bro No one's cares about about being called a name anymore. No Like it's over and then remember we talked about this we said Eventually it's going to get overused to a point where it means nothing and the people who are using it aren't gonna We're not going to be able to identify real racism Well, if you want to identify real racism. It's real simple What are the actions that people are taking that intentionally hold a race back or make their lives more difficult? And if we define racism as discrimination in that sense then there is only one class of racism in this country And that is a Democrat party and that's reality Okay, because they're the ones making the rules that are actually holding these people back and so real talk um How do we correct this problem? Well everybody's gonna have to get on board with the fact that we're gonna have to do things That are not very pleasant to look at to go round up every single one of these people and dump them back over the border Mexico and let Mexico deal with them Okay, because in my in my opinion Mexico's complicit by even allowing this all right, and I love my Mexican-American friends who have come here and made a lot of it And contribute to the life But Mexico has fucked us and they are no longer our friend those people are not our friends The separation Mexico Mexican government that those are not our friends. Yeah, they are intentionally aiding the destruction of our country No, not at all. They could say whatever they want they could pretend all they want Mexican people. I love you, bro. You're all good with me. I love Mexico too by the way It's fucking awesome, but your government is aiding in the destruction of this country Which has been a place that a lot of those people have aspired to go to over the course of history Which is half the reason they're probably destroying it Okay, so uh You know, I hope people wake up. I don't know that they will but it is there's a little part of me that thinks it's funny That all of these far left people are now the ones like screaming about how fucking bullshit this is when you guys voted for this shit and championed it for so long My sauce. I don't want to trump wants to build a wall. He's fucking racist. He's need a phone. What do you think now? Yeah, right Now we gotta give the people out of the city. Yeah, right. That sounds kind of listen listen people People are gonna have a hard time With what's going to be required to remove this from our country You also see the other world leaders starting to get on that that same net of two like McCrone and France yeah Like he's on the same thing like mad. He's like we gotta get the people out of here. Yeah, you know, it's correct They're seeing what's happening. Yeah, but I don't know that's why liberty that's where liberalism fails liberalism fails because it's made by a bunch of dumb fucks. Yeah, like it does not work no They're dumb as fuck okay? These people there's only two classes of those kind of people one people that do not know any better All right, who are very poor? They don't know so it sounds good to them these policies all sound good And they sound good-hearted too. What are you not a humanitarian? No motherfucker. I'm not Just so you know none of that shit works on me. No, I don't Like you're big. Yes, whatever the fuck you say I am I'm American first These people need to be rounded up and they need to be shipped back to where the fuck they came from and that's being nice Okay, they don't belong in our country It's gonna cause major problems and you're gonna see this with the terrorist alerts Okay, you don't think that these people Do you not think what do you think these Palestinian slash Arab Muslims Are going to start doing to the Jewish community centers or the or Jews in general here in America What do you think's gonna happen bro? What do you think they're gonna start doing to the LGBTQ population who fights for them who fights for them Like these people are gonna terrorize us here in this country We're gonna see terror attacks that we've never seen here before things that we've never had to worry about here We're gonna have to start worrying about like you're gonna have to look around when you go to the farmers market on fucking Saturdays and Sundays bro because you Intentionally were manipulated into allowing these things to happen and so in my opinion if I represent right now All of these people there will be checkpoints in every city. I'd be I mean, I mean dude Check I'm talking checkpoints to go two blocks Okay, and yes, you would have to show your fucking papers and yes if you didn't fucking have them you're out Okay, that's real shit that has going to have to happen if we want to correct this country and a lot of people are with it They're not able to like stomach that kind of thing even if it means their own personal demise. It's all right. Just two weeks stop the spread. Yeah I'm the listen bro. These people have listen these people have to be rounded up and Send back to where they come from and that's the only way this can be fixed You know, shit man guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments Hashtag open the flood gates let us know So that being said, let's get to our third and final Third and final headline headline Number three. At number three reads Connecticut judge orders new mayoral primary after surveillance videos show possible ballots stuffing This is a pretty big deal. I haven't seen any of this. It's a pretty big deal Yeah, for those of you that don't know I've been sick as fuck for like three days. Yeah, yeah, that's that's why we didn't have CTI that's I was basically shooting my brains out and puking my brains out and so I didn't see much in the news And honestly, it's been great I would rather shit my brains out and puked my brains out than then then consume this shit. Yeah, it's a lot Yeah, going on with this. This is this is a win. This is a big deal Um So this uh, this is a AP still got my rucks down now just for the record. No, that's good. Yeah Um, so but yeah, so this is the AP news article um reading a judge on Wednesday tossed out the results of a democratic mayoral primary in Connecticut's largest city And ordered that a new one be held citing surveillance videos showing people stuffing multiple absentee ballots Into outdoor collection boxes The ruling came just six days before the general election Creating a perplexing scenario in which voters will decide the outcomes of bridge ports mayoral election on November 7th Then be asked to return to the polls at a later undetermined date To choose the rightful democratic nominee in that very same race In his ruling Wednesday superior court judge William Clark addressed the in congruity by saying he lacked the authority To postpone or cancel the general election however he said he had seen enough evidence of malfeasance to order a rerun Of a september 12th primary in which incumbent mayor Joe Gannum defeated challenger got John Gomez Uh, by 251 votes out of 8,173 casts quote the volume of ballots so mishandled It's such that it calls the result of the primary election into serious doubt and leaves the court Unable to determine the legitimate result of the primary Clark wrote in his ruling The judge cited statistics showing that abnormally large numbers of absentee ballots were cast and certain voting districts And video evidence showing multiple people shoving stacks of ballots Uh, into the drop boxes and violation of state law quote the videos are shocking to the court and should be shocking to all parties Clark wrote Here's a couple of videos of this stuff going on. So here's one This was August 27th Okay Really nice be with it be a dubby pulls up. Yeah because because these people to do this come from two classes Which is the part that I was trying to say a minute ago They either come from very poor people that don't know any better or very rich people that get richer by manipulating those poor people Yep, that's the entire Democrat party. So no shit. They got a nice car. Yeah So These people should be hung by the way That's anything anybody who does this should be fucking hung without fucking reservation Right along with the covid people You know I'm saying the covid the covid organizers the election stealers those people should be treated as treasonous people and and dealt with You know a traitor's accountability There's another one. The look of these fucking people they high five each other after doing it This guy's just putting ballot after ballot in the box, huh? Then they high five each other Okay, okay, that's enough. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough You're gonna get his caught right. Yeah, that's what they're saying. I know Look at this and then high five good job We secured out of mind. Yeah, those people should be hung and then that's saying listen I'm talking about any level of election in government Those are traders. Mm-hmm well because they fuck up the city. Don't those people have cost us all Our entire fucking livelihoods and our lives and all this disruption in this country people who think That it's okay for them to fuck with the systems that keep this country secret should should fucking Be dealt with like traders They are traders these are traders. That's saying lady came back at 542 in the morning and kept doing it. Yeah, keep doing it um Now here's the here's an interesting thing so Politico put out this article yesterday. The headline reads but by the way if Republicans did this they should be hung too Anybody yeah anybody This isn't a one-sided. It's anybody um, but I thought this was interesting So political put out this this headline it says Republicans claw back control of elections and key states um You know saying that Republican officials and key battleground states are moving to assert more Control over elections ahead of 2024 efforts that could disrupt preparations already underway for the presidential contest Unlike prior pushes that have focused on pole access and voting requirements the current focus is on offices or agencies That have oversight of actual elections and that tend to operate in obscurity So recently Republican lawmakers have tried to out Swiss consens elections chief after years of empowering baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election Notice how they're talking in this right. It's not a real thing right you can't interfere with elections elections are on stolen There's just a secure right Baseless conspiracy. Yes, right The crazy thing is is just a couple hours, you know before they wrote that article they write this article Federal prosecutor raises along about Chinese election interference wait So can it be done or can it not Well, I can only be done by a convenient enemy. It can't be done by them Is that what it is? Okay, all right We didn't make sense Andy. We didn't our own American people messing with an election to maintain control So that we can avoid accountability for crimes against humanity that we that would never happen now I would never happen that this man right here They're showing on the slide Gavin Newsom or any of these other people who are fine upstanding citizens of the world Such as Hillary Clinton It could never be true that she would legitimately make up an entire document called the steel dossier and then for seven years divide America for her own greed and good You know ill will towards American people and Upside on her, but she would never do that no one would ever do that There would be no way that all these people will go along with it There would be no way that all these people would continue to you know do these things. That's not there's no But China yeah for sure Russia. Yeah, you know These people these people are scum dude There's a what do you see this election? This this next election be a man. I don't I don't know though I don't think they're gonna allow it to happen. Yeah, I don't think they're I think what I've been saying for the last Uh, a few years is they're gonna try to disrupt the world in such a way where the election is an afterthought or even not even like I Going back to what I said bro like when we talk about the accountability that will be had by them giving up power We're talking about life or death accountability And when you think about life or death accountability And you think about what you would do to avoid life or death accountability Very few of you would stand on your principles and morals and take the death You would try to lie cheap and steal your way into like surviving and That's what I that's what I see here and I see I see I I see very bad things for the future. I see I don't think that what happened in 2020 is Even going to be comparable to what they have to do this time I think it's gonna be way worse. I think it's gonna have real damaging effects I think there's a potential that it could destroy our country completely in terms of our entire economy I think it's very very plausible that every single entrepreneur listening to the show right now does not have a business in 12 months Like I think that's how bad it could get I think they could cut off the power I think they could cut off technology And I think they could put it in a stone age and say it was fucking China who did a cyber attack for the neck for seven months And let the world just fucking destroy itself while they get away with what they did I think there's all kinds of options But I don't I think the smallest option is that we actually have a free and fair election and get somebody in who actually got the votes I think that's the smallest option and I think we're in a position now Where it's do or die in terms of are you going to engage in this or are you going to bitch out And I think if you don't engage in this we very well Could be where you know, I just said we would be at that literally nothing zero. You know, and um You know, this all comes from the inability for People to one speak up And to look at people right in the face is saying no It's that simple You know if had you looked at people who who told you to put a mask on and said no, I'm not doing it The the shit would have been flipped right away But you all had to fly and you all had to do this and you all had to do that. So you just did it And here we are and so You know, I I don't have an optimistic outlook. No, like I really know and and I'm not saying that to scare anybody. I'm not saying that to doom and gloom. I'm not saying that to be a dick I just think the wind the window of opportunity is closing at such a fast right now where I don't I don't know Now the only thing that does give me some hope is that you know, we do have people that are starting to stand up We do have people that are starting to wake up We do have people that are willing to use their voice that's starting to happen But dude, you're a year behind the game. Yeah, like you guys need to get real loud real fucking fast and The one thing the one piece of like observation that gives me some hope and like dude There's a lot of people out here my some my friends included who are like and a year over reacting. It's not that bad Bro, you don't understand. Yeah, you don't understand what these people are willing to do Okay, it's it just because you've been over here in your world doing your thing And you are skeptical of things like bro go back and listen to the last three years of my show I'm pretty confident dude. I have the best track record of fucking anybody out there Better than anybody. I don't think there's no If there is someone I don't know who the fuck they are, you know Okay, and I'm not saying that to brag. I'm saying that as a matter of actual fact, but I will say this One thing that gives me some hope Is that they seem to be afraid of the election The the media the far the left. Yeah, the whole democratic establishment They seem to be afraid of the election because if they weren't afraid of the election they wouldn't be Doing this witch hunt, you know, uh, I'm gonna remove it off the ballot Yeah, I'm trying to get them off the ballot like trying it. They wouldn't be doing these things these things wouldn't be happening If there wasn't a little non-factors. Yes, yeah, right and so I think they have the like you know We've talked about plenty of times. I think they have the ability to cheat But I don't think they have the ability to Cheat pack. I think there's a there's an error zone in there like maybe it's 10% right Maybe they can fudge it like 10% and if you get more than that You they can't fudge it anymore and I actually think that's what happened in 2016 I think they've been fixed in elections and fudging elections for You know as long as we've been alive. Yeah, and I think in 2016 what happened was They they were fudging the election with X amount of votes for Hillary Clinton and this dude was so popular The he overcame that and that's why they were so surprised. Yeah, because they were so confident. Yeah, like if you go I can look at the home. Don't you remember the magazine that came out The time magazine or newsweek that said she won. Madam president. Yep. It came out like they were they knew She was when she was with it and they were fucking shocked And then they went into straight up. It was fraud, right? Remember election was stolen. Yes Russia stole it and then what happened then Hillary Clinton made up a document with Christopher steel called the steel dossier Which implicated Trump and collusion went Russia to steal an election which has been since proven to be completely fabricated by Hillary Clinton and this dude and there's been no accountability for it whatsoever None how much of that fudge is the 2020 election? Well, I'm just just that alone not not talking about the Bala heart Oh, you mean like people thinking that was true. That's what I'm saying. Yeah for sure These people are fucked and I think that's also too like why like this case that that just happened and Connecticut Like how did they know that that was a sure way to win? I think if you know if they're still in the fucking local election you don't think that they did that shit in the 2020 election too Did you I think they've been doing it for as long as I've been a lot that's what I'm saying like like this is proof like they're only they did that because they knew the shit worked I don't think we've had a I don't think we've had a fair election since John F Kennedy was assassinated. You think it was that far back Yeah, I do and I think Robert F I think Robert Kennedy like you guys say whatever you want about Robert Kennedy I wouldn't vote for him. He's he's way too fucking liberal for me um And especially I think he's smart. I think he makes some great points But like where he stands on the second amendment is shit. You're fucking insane that that argument is dead Yeah, by the way, you're not getting the guns. It doesn't matter if you do a mass shooting Oh, by the way, did you see the mass shooting that happened that didn't happen In a out in that theme park where the dude fucking killed himself and then wrote on the wall. I'm not a killer Yeah, I did see this yeah And you know what I dug into that you know what the fucking story that they've been telling these people is Is that you have to go kill these people the world's going to end and if you don't kill these people We're gonna deny you access to the fucking underground cities. So they're tell yes They're telling these fucking deranged mental people that's the trigger that yes jeez so they're telling these deranged mental People who are fucked up who are proud you know products of these manipulation techniques like MK ultra and all these things that they do They're promising them admittance Into the underground cities Based upon the idea that the they know the world's going to end and These people they say for you to go in it you have to go kill all these people and I guess that's what they're doing to get people to do this That's what that's what what what I've dug into and seen with that story. That's why yeah There's a whole bunch about that story that That isn't being talked about that you have to like dig deep on that must because I didn't even cross on them So so about that what what about that national manifesto? Where that would not what's that say? Because we all thought that just said some stuff about trans people What if it says something about that similar the same lines? Yeah, what if it says something about Exactly what the fuck's been going on But anyway back to my thing I don't care how many fucking shootings do you guys do We're not giving up our guns because we understand what the purpose of the guns are Yeah, exactly what will happen the moment we hand them over Yeah, like everybody everybody pretty much understands that you know the government the government has overplayed their hand and Gun ownership and gun purchase at all time high by people on the left side of the aisle What's that telling my service even they know Even they know that this so like when Kamala Harris comes on TV and says we're gonna ban weapons everybody's laughing at these people Come fucking get a motherfucker. You ain't getting them It's just reality you can't how are you going to take how are you going to take them? Oh, you're gonna make a law nobody's gonna do it Yeah, I'm a fella Oh, we saw that shit here with the we think that is the play though, huh? I think that oh yeah, they're gonna turn everybody into a fellow and then try to make them not be able to vote Can't vote if you're yeah, that's correct absolutely. I believe that's what they were doing with that brace shit No, that was a big push of it. Yeah, that was a big push Anyway, yeah, I don't know man guys. I mean what you think bro. Yeah, no, no, I agree I think I don't know how long they've been still in the elections But it didn't start in 2020. No, you know, and I think they have you know We from what I've been able to see they have a couple of different ways that can get away with it That but you know, they don't do the same exact way every place. I think you know, there's about five key states in 2020 They had three or four different means of actually taking the election and um I think 2016 that I think 2016 the reason that the world's like falling apart Is because that was the one they didn't they didn't right fix they left that up to change Yes, and the guy out vote the the guy was so popular. He outvoted the cheatability and they were surprised And now Wilson, I think the that little fudge percentage. I think now it's like I would say it's probably maybe two percent We don't know but but the point we don't we don't know but the point of it is bro Is if that's the case and they were surprised it would make sense why they reacted the way that they did in 2020 and why they shut the world down And why they led Biden campaign from his basement and why they you know made it so you know Hunter Biden's laptop disappeared from the news. Why they censored people the entire You know Up to 20 the 2020 election you know They were deplatforming people for speaking things that were clearly true And um and now been proven to be true So if you really think about You know that theory that 2016 was the first election that they They weren't able to fix then it explains why they're reacting the way that they are now Yeah Yeah, that's real shit man guys tell us what you guys think jumping on this conversation Has sac secure the vote let us know what you guys think I'm gonna come to this man. So with that being said man. There was our three headlines. Let's get to our final segment of the show as always Thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is what we're bringing headline up to talk about it get one of those two options But I want to ask you Andy take me back to to 21 year old Andy super swath But I don't know about that. Did you did you so like you go on a date with the girl? Did you pay for the date? Did you guys go Dutch or how no I always paid even when I was broke as fuck all right Well, I want you to remember that answer and I see if that answer stays the same on this I'm just saying that's what I did Usually what I did was that's the way to go what I did was I cooked That's what I did beef jerky no bro. I'm fucking very good cook You know why I'm a very good cook Cuz cooking's really fucking easy if you can follow simple directions. Yeah, okay? So like I'm smarter enough to follow directions So like I was Betty fucking crocker and that motherfucker bro. I know how to make shit Okay, because like it's following directions like anybody can be a great cook if you can follow simple directions It's that simple So like it doesn't take you know how some sort of fucking sandwich artist bro like You've made the recipe 17 times you memorize the fucking I know I know the whole game.

I pay everywhere. I go whenever you ever see me not pay No, you always I pay I don't care if it's 220 or 200 people my fucker. I pay. It's a thing of mine. I can't stick I'm so uncomfortable when people when I when people start arguing over the bill like because I grew up that way. Yeah um The not my family, but just observing you know people do that in general. Yeah, I just it made me so I when I say I grew up that way I grew up where the head of the household paid the bill right So like that's what I was used to and then when I saw like When I would get older and I started going out with people when they started like bickering over the bill bro Like it made me highly uncomfortable and so like I'm still like that's still like a thing for me like Even if it's a party or bro just fucking pay it because I don't want to have any of that weird energy around like it's just fucking awkward It is always awkward. Yeah. Oh, I had I had $2.57 of this and this only had one Shut the fuck up, man. It all even's out in the end.
