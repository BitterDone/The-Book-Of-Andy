It was my initial podcast and it was all personal development how to win how to kick ass in life And we are bringing that back now if you want to know where that can be found and where we are going to be posting that You're going to need to go to my website Andy for sell a calm and subscribe for the Andy Graham emails Which is your daily Andy Graham?

I'm not going to post about it publicly We're just going to do it through that email list So you're not on that email list go get on it that way you'll be notified when MF CEO drops So what's up, man? What's going on man? Oh, no much. Well, let's let's make some people better Because yeah, I got three good ones for you. Cool. Shocking. Yeah Let's knock these out guys. Andy question number one Hi Andy I'm an eight-year veteran police officer for a department in Arizona for context. I am a woman Now I've been following you for years. I feel like I know you I support everything you do and stand for and so without jumping to conclusions and making quick judgments Can you give me a little more feedback on your women and law enforcement statement? I have made plenty of sacrifices. Which statement The women should not be in law enforcement. Oh, okay. Yeah, I'm not doing a couple episodes ago Well, I think I believe I said they didn't they shouldn't be in the field of law enforcement That's what I said. Yeah But she says I have made plenty of sacrifices in the line of duty received a life saver Commodation in 2022 and I have held my own in this career This is how I provide for my family and I love what I do All right, let's talk about it Well, first off, let me start with this okay myself our companies our people There is not a bigger group of people that support law enforcement than we do okay. We do multiple Charitable events and give away hundreds of thousands of dollars and collectively millions of dollars over the course of our business life To the law enforcement locally. It's our biggest Beneficiary of the work that we do so you're not going to find better supporters Than we are with that being said You know, I think my comments were generalized and I think I need to clarify them a little bit I'm fine with that I had a couple women here in St. Louis that were upset with me that I know that are police officers and you know They were like Andy You know, I love you, dude, but what the fuck is this right? So you know we'll address it and what I really should have said and did I did I Did I overgeneralize? Yeah, for sure and I do that sometimes that's the nature of how I speak and you know I'm trying to get better about it But what I really mean is that Certain women shouldn't be police officers and certain men shouldn't be police officers and if we're going to have Women be police officers. They should be capable. They should be emotionally stable They should be able to de-escalate situations and they shouldn't take advantage of opportunities where men are You know, emasculated because they're in a situation with a gun in a badge And that goes for men too, okay? So it's not just a women thing. It's a men thing and so when I said What I said it wasn't you know, it was a generalization man I should have said it differently, but the truth of the matter is you know We have positions in society that are better suited for men. We have positions in society that are better suited for women I'm not saying that there's certain women that can't do these jobs of men because they're definitely are bro There's women who are Nearly or if not more physically superior than most men out there. We see this in the Olympics We see this in MMA. We see this in judo and fucking jujitsu And then we have you know the same situation with men we have men who are physically capable of doing something We have a lot of men than aren't so you know And by the way, I'm speaking of personal interactions that I've had out there In reality and in reality the situations I've had Have been more favorable with men police officers than they have women and I don't know why that is But to me being on the receiving end it always felt like there was an establishment of dominance that needed to happen When in reality, I would have respected her for just asking me politely to do this or that so You know, I can understand why someone would you know Be offended by that a little bit and you know question it But guys I love you guys. I raise money for you guys all the time. There's nobody that's out here Supporting you guys more than I you have all these you know people calling you bootlickers and you know fucking The police are bad and all this shit bro. I've never gone down that road ever one time We continue to support we continue to raise money. We continue to support It's a very difficult job. You've got to put all this shit on and go out in the world and deal with the worst possible Elements of society every fucking day. I have tremendous respect for that And I believe that I'm probably the only person on the fucking internet that has said hey These people need to be paid way more money We need to stop shipping all this money over to Ukraine and the Middle East and all these bullshit cars As we need to put pair police officers the right amount 200 400 fucking grand so that they can do this dangerous job and and be compensated properly for it So like you get me in the office bro you guys will make a lot more money, right? So you know, I can understand why someone would be upset with that That wasn't the intent of my comment and I did over generalizing. I take responsibility for that I'm a big boy. I can handle the criticism But the end of the day. I love you guys. I appreciate you guys and I fucking uh and I have Physically gone to battle for women cops in the city. There was a situation About eight years ago where I had to literally save one of the female cops life because she was in overhead with the fucking Uh a six foot eight massive man and you know what Had I not been there that could have been Potentially bad and that's a lot of where I derive that experience from when I see that situation And I see a five foot four police officer and a six foot eight man And I have to draw my own personal weapon to control the situation That gives me some perspective about the comments that I said I think you know, I don't want anybody getting hurt. I don't want anybody getting killed and I've witnessed those things um, so You know, I love you guys. I appreciate you guys and uh, you know I should have said it differently and been more careful for my words, but it is what it is Well, I think there's also context to like to your point He's like, no, you've had better experiences with male cops and you have a female I think there's something to and this is what we were talking about in that episode though. It's like You know with men there is this like understanding It's not a conversation. I don't know if it's body length but like we know yes like I know that they are going to be consequences There's potential consequences in my action. Yeah, yeah, yeah And like women don't have that same they don't walk through Life with that same because women don't naturally go to physicality when it comes to conflict right men do through nature Okay, and that was the point we were trying to make um But yeah, man, I look you've had a great career. There's lots of women that are fucking tremendous leaders and tremendous Tremendous at doing things that men do. I mean bro oil rigs construction Fuck it farming look I know women that do all of these things and they're and they're amazing at it all I'm saying is is that we have to pick the right people for the right position And not all people qualify for that and I think we've gotten a little bit liberal with who we let to be men cops And who we let to be women cops and I think there needs to be some higher standards for for both sides all across the Yes, so it's not and by the way People need to respect the police officers better too, you know We have this anti-narrative of the police that there's some bad people broke listen Do you know what the fucking world would look like without the police? Do you understand what it would look like without people keeping order? These people have to go out every single fucking day and deal with people that are drunk on drugs Having the worst days of their life and then they're shit on by society And so like dude to hear you know Because I had a couple friends here locally like I said that we're a little upset with what I said in That I hurts me. I don't like that. That's because that's not who I am You know, I'm saying I want people to be safe. I want the world to be good and by the way if you vote for me I'll pay you more money. I love it. Yeah guys any question number two Eddie I own a hospitality business and my career has been in the customer service industry. Yeah, I'm curious When is the customer not always right and how do you train your staff to handle those situations? Hmm Well, look I think it's important to understand That 98% 99% Of the customers you deal with are not malicious. They are not trying to take advantage They just want their problems solved effectively and because most companies do not solve customers problems effectively without resistance customers have this natural mentality when they ask for something now that it has to be abrasive and aggressive and they've got to demand it right away When in reality dude like that comes from all these other companies and all their experiences Sort of like that last question where I'm talking about my perspective of my experiences And we have to be careful just like that last question to not generalize all of these customers has taking advantage Because they're not most people just want their goods that they paid for they want it fairly Fast convenient and they want to be handled and treated with respect And so when you own a business are you going to have customers that are going to try and take advantage? are you going to have customers that are going to try and uh Get more get one over yes absolutely, but dude most of the customers are just people that want their shit solved And if you can take the mentality of okay, I'm gonna solve their problem But I'm also gonna do some extra you'll drive so much good word of mouth because the people who are upset and vocal They will also be your biggest advocate and vocal about that too when you fix the problem. So I say all that to say this are there times when you have to tell a customer no yes Are there times when you have to fire a customer and say hey we've done everything we can I know that you're not happy Maybe there's another company that will be able to service you better Here's some alternative options and you always keep the classy demeanor you always handle it with respect Even if they aren't because they usually aren't at this point um And try to solve a problem the best they can and sometimes dude like these people are having a bad day They lost their dog they lost a loved one. They're going through a hard time They Their paycheck got delayed or they don't have a paycheck. They don't you know who knows who knows it could be the worst day ever So I think it's always good in business to give those people the benefit of the doubt and what I've found is that if you do give them the benefit of the doubt And you do stay true to solving the problem instead of getting an argument with them Eventually they will walk away And I can't tell you how many times this has happened to me eventually they will walk away and they will say Dude, I was an asshole. I shouldn't have done that and I could tell you dude There's been so many people over the course of 25 years who have been very rude to me And I've continued to be nice to them and then they've come back later and owned owned what they did Bro, there's nothing wrong with making mistakes as long as you fucking own them You know what I'm saying and then what happens is is that person when they come back They become an advocate because you always kept your cool and you still try to solve their problem Even though they were belligerent about it. Yeah Now moving that into your team. How do you communicate that to your team? Like how do you hold that as the standard with your team? Well a lot of that is just reps and training and Hypothetical situations role-playing you know making them understand the concept of Loyalty and what it takes to create loyalty not just satisfaction right because you're not trying to get Satisfied customer satisfied customers means that you're one inch away from being unsatisfied Okay, so like when companies say I got a 99% satisfaction rate. That doesn't really mean shit That means you're doing just good enough with 99% of your people to not piss them off That's not what you want what you want is for them to be thrilled to be excited to be ecstatic about being a customer of your brand And that only happens when you stay true to the intent which is to solve their problem Regardless of the day that they're having or regardless of the mood that they're in and a lot of business owners This is where the dangerous part comes in you have one or two or three customers that treat you shitty and one and then you start assuming that everybody Is trying to take advantage and dude that'll ruin your business because your mentality will go from hey I got to fix these problems. I got to serve these problems I got to create advocates out of these people to Fuck those people and then you won't have any customers left. Yeah, it's like that you become so like you start to defend your brand Yes, and you got to realize dude never wrong. Yeah exactly and you got to realize dude Most people have such shitty experiences everywhere else that they're not used to getting taken care of Fast or quick or in a way that they appreciate they're used to having to fight for that fucking thing or that thing right Bro make it easy. Yeah, we're trying to fight for this fuckers. Yeah, be cool. Hey listen I understand you're upset no problem. Let me handle that for you. I'm sorry that happened to you. That shouldn't happen You see what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah, man. That's so fucking true. Yeah, I call it built. I call these people now I'm ready to fight. Yeah, cuz that's just that's what we do with we deal with being on hold for 75 minutes and some fucking lady Who doesn't want to be on the phone with us and doesn't give a shit if we solve our problems and that that is an opportunity for small Business bro, that's an opportunity for you the little guy to do something that people appreciate fuck dude That's the whole reason we exist is because there's a hole in other companies ability to service the customer that our companies Whether I'm selling fucking protein powder or tequila or weed or fucking any of the other shit that we sell We fucking service the customer bro and make them happy you got to remember that person is giving you Their hard-earned money that they work their ass off to get the least you could do is appreciate them for doing so They have plenty of other options and most companies don't so if you can build a company that does actually appreciate people You're that's a huge competitive advantage that you're gonna have as a little guy that is hard to scale as a big company I fucking love it man. I love it guys Andy. Let's get to our third and final question Question number three Andy I've started a life insurance agency and I'm working on hiring people But I don't want to hire just anyone. I want to build a team that is success driven and willing to continue to grow into amazing Bad ass people that want to win at a high level like I do What are some questions? Uh, I can be asking or points. I can be making to make sure people will be a good fit any advice on this would be appreciated What's what's the pre-screening like? Look dude? Let me give you a let me give you the the fucking whole entire key to higher in quality people Higher on character You can teach skill you can't teach character. So whatever questions you're asking make the questions about someone's character. Hey You have to go to your friends wedding and you're 10 minutes late, but you forgot to get a card And as you're walking out of the grocery store with the card you notice a shopping card Out in the middle of the thing do you take the time to put it back or do you jump in the car and go here That'll tell you something about someone you're at a gas station and you're filling up your tank And somebody walks up to you and says Hey, man. Can I get 20 bucks for a tank of gas? I'm I'm far away from home and I ran out of money Do you give them the 20 bucks? Do you put the gas on the credit card? Do you tell them to eat shit? What do you do? Okay, and whatever their answer is which by the way, there's no wrong answer It will just give you insight to their character. So try to think of questions that will qualify Hypothetical situations that we've all faced where people's character will shine through you see when I'm saying And then the skill set you could teach bro skills are easy to teach It's the character that you can't teach So build your questions build your build your your interview process around The the character qualities of the human and then learn to teach the skills and you'll be in a great spot now when you get bigger And you start to scale out you know to to let's say you're at nine figures and bigger You have to start hiring people to have experience and skill But usually those people have good character because they've been through the journey anyway And they understand that if you don't have good character you get kicked off the fucking accessory at some point anyway. So Build your interview process around character build your culture around character teach skill That's what you're gonna want to do love that I don't remember What company was but there was like the parking lot test Like looking in that person's car. Oh, that's me. I tell okay fuck yeah, I'm not even playing like that's really so dude listen when when When we used to interview people it would be me and Jason and we sit in the interview and while we were sitting in the interview with the person one of us would get up and walk outside and look inside the person's car Okay, and the reason we did that was what you want to see is their car fucking full of trash is their car totally clean What kind of car they driving is it fucking beat the shit as I have fucking Dense on the front the back the side You can tell a lot by someone's car Okay Mainly like do they pay attention to details and so that's what we would do and It usually worked out if we haven't made an exception say that guys cars kind of dirty that motherfucker was dirty in office And he didn't pay attention to details. So Yeah, there's all kinds of little things that you can do like that There's all kinds of books and articles and and YouTube videos that you can watch on trying to hire But just remember a lot of those are built built around attracting people with skill and if you're trying to build a culture That you're going to enjoy that everybody's going to enjoy you got to hire a character and then teach skill Yeah, I love that the parking lot assessment. I love that because I also feel too and like everybody knows this You know when you're going to get a job like you're gonna put your best fucking face on correct I'm saying so that's like that's a hard thing I'd imagine to have to fucking like filter in and out like you know because they're gonna give you the best fucking Self up front. Yeah best clothes. Yeah, so you gotta look where they're not looking right you know I'm saying right let them go to the bathroom roach and bathroom after the night Exactly, yeah, exactly Exactly, I love it. Yeah, so dude look Pay attention to the character teach the skills look where they're not looking to see what they really are What's their social like are they on social bitching about their old job? Don't hire them. Yeah, it's not okay Okay, cuz they're gonna bitch about you You know what's funny employees don't fucking get that they don't understand that like when you go on the internet and Cry about your old job anybody who's considering working with you in the future is gonna be like bro Fuck this guy like Yeah, remember that They're gonna feel like they're out there walk on eggs. Yeah, it eliminates your ability to be employed with other companies later And people don't think like that's just messy too, bro. And companies will dig they will go all the way back on your Twitter All the way they will go all the way back on your Instagram and Facebook. They're making an investment in you They're making a fucking the time and the money and the time to teach and bring you up to speed listen man People don't want to waste that time and that energy. So they're gonna look So I have a shit together. Yeah, make sure it's nice when they do. Yeah, I love it, man Well guys, I think that was three. All right guys nice little Saturday. We're gonna go home depot and maybe home goods and I'm not All right guys. I love you guys. See y'all Monday Roke
