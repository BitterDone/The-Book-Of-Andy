going on brother oh not much yeah yeah just doing a thing yeah yeah what's over here thing gets done yeah man chill I mean you know um that new just just grinding yeah just keeping it moving yeah well that's the time of year man you know a lot of people right now are already kind of falling off their program I've been sick as a dog for the last week and a half uh it started off as a flu and it's turned into something else I'm not sure exactly what it is but uh we're working with the doctors to get through it it's been a big pain in my ass but uh yeah that's what's going on with me I'm just trying to keep these shows going for you guys and uh and then after the show I go home and go to bed yeah so that's that sounds terrible yeah works took it's done though but let's get into this though we got so I got three guilt ones for you guys cool uh guys any question number one Andy what's the biggest misunderstanding when it comes to seeking advice uh from other people and giving yourself permission to just go and execute yeah I think that's a good question man a lot of people get really caught up and taking advice and unfortunately they're not very good at understanding who has good advice and who doesn't you know if you scroll through Instagram right now it's it's actually kind of disgusting honestly what it's become it's become one big advertisement it's every single person out here with a fucking cell phone building some sort of personal brand around giving advice when in reality 99 percent of these people are struggling they haven't actually built anything relevant they are just trying to build something for themselves through the you know distribution of content hopefully to gain credibility so I guess what these people think is that if I sound credible I'll get a following and then I'll be able to like I have something going on and that's incredibly dangerous for a lot of people uh especially people who don't really understand what to do because when you're in the beginning of the journey it's impossible to tell who's giving you good advice so right now we're inundated with so many people that just want to talk for the sake of you know like shares and views and comments when in reality do the advice that they give and I can tell you this for fact a lot of it is just dog shit advice um so you have to shit is like shit that everybody else is saying so yeah no and that's what it is yeah it's either it's either just carbon copy of what a few select you know known people are which I'm one of those people um or it's it's just shit people yeah like and you know it sucks dude because in the beginning of my entrepreneurship journey yeah we didn't have social media and yes we couldn't learn from people who had done things outside of like picking up a book and reading it right like I would read a book about Sam Walton or I'd read Tony Robbins stuff right and I'm very grateful for that but it was almost easier having only that because you weren't inundated with so much confusion about what to do you didn't have every Tom Dick and Harry on the internet pretending like there's some sort of uber successful kick ass entrepreneur when in reality bro they're living in a fucking bullshit house with a bullshit business and then sometimes they don't have a business you know um some of these guys are just making shit up so we have to be you know for me when I was young that was actually a blessing because like dude I had no way to be confused that makes sense right um it's almost like too many there's too much now and there's too many fucking knuckleheads who don't know what they're doing who have not done anything giving advice irresponsibly on the internet and there's people by no fault of their own that listen to this advice because they don't know any better like when you're first starting out and you're like fuck dude I think I want to start a business you don't really know that much so you know if people can flash some some cool stuff or you know show a car or a watch you know that's $50,000 or $200,000 on a fucking you know dude that's unobtainable to most people it's it's like well fuck dude if they've got a $250,000 RM one then they got to know what they're doing right and that's just not fucking true so we have to we have to be honest and be skeptical about who's actually done things and you know I talk about this a lot I talked about this on that podcast I did with Ed my let last week which was amazing by the way if you haven't caught that you should go listen to that interview with Ed and I but we talk about this you know it's important to vet who you're going to take advice from you need to ask real questions and you need to ask you need to make sure these people aren't just making this shit up you know ask questions like what businesses do they actually own do those businesses actually sell products how many customers do they serve how long have they been doing it what's it like to order from these companies do they have employees where do they operate out of you know a lot of these people talk about these businesses and and reality you know we can't see them we don't know where they are then we never see them on their social and you know they're calling themselves a CEO but where is it right it's in this shape it's on paper yeah it's this shady dark and don't ask any questions otherwise you're an asshole right you know and the truth of the matter is someone who's credible all those questions are going to be really obvious like you're going to be able to know what these people do and you're going to be able to find answers to that and people who have done real things they don't mind sharing what they've done they don't they don't get defensive about it you know so I think it's just very important to to seek advice from people who have done things people who have been around for a long time they're not just here today all the sudden they're the hottest new guru and be smart about where you get your advice at the very least and then you know on top of that you could get as much advice as you want but if you never cross the chasm from taking the advice in and actually going to execute it's impossible to win and I actually think the execution is far more important than the advice you get anyway because most of the things that you're going to learn you're going to learn from experience right you're going to go out you're going to you're going to do things you're going to do them wrong you're going to learn a lesson you're going to go to the same thing you're going to do it better next time and you're going to do a choir skills through that process of continuing to go and then fall down and then learn what caused you to fall down and then you know approach that same obstacle again with the skill set that you've already learned from falling down so you know the experience of going is highly underrated everybody wants to know everything before they go but the reality is is most of the things that you're really going to know are going to come from what you learn along the way so my advice is you know get get a basic idea of what to do and that information is readily available and guys if you want go back and listen to the first 300 episodes of of my audio feed okay that was called the MSCEO project it's that it was it's 300 episodes of pure 330 episodes of pure entrepreneurial knowledge that you need to develop every fucking skill that you possibly need is free you don't need to pay all these motherfuckers to learn this shit and I can promise you anybody to you're paying out there I've done more shit than them and I'm giving it to you for free so kind of actually this because I like what what do you think it is like what what is the the hang up where people want to be told what the lesson is before they actually go because they're afraid to make them mistakes dude you know what I said I like but that's not realistic to be able to just go through any journey with unblemished and never fuck up right like no most people don't ever win bro or don't ever go because they don't because they are afraid that they're going to fall down and look stupid in front of their friends in front of their family and there's tremendous amount of social pressure now with the internet where nobody wants to make mistakes nobody wants to that's another workplace I had an advantage you know when I fucking fell and I sucked not everybody was watching you know I'm saying so it's different now and but you have to hope nobody saw that but you have to understand that in order to build something real in order to build something that you're going to be proud of that's going to you know provide the the level of lifestyle that you want for yourself looking stupid in front of other people is a requirement of the journey you're going to look stupid a million times along the way there are times I'm 25 years in my official entrepreneurship journey bro I make mistakes all the time and I end up looking stupid all the time that's part of the deal I don't fucking care because I know that if I look stupid I'm looking stupid in front of a bunch of people who are afraid to even try what differences that make okay and so most people give up their dreams and they give up all of the things that they think they want for themselves because they're afraid to step out and do things in front of people who are never going to try that makes no sense so you're telling me you're going to give up your entire life your entire dreams everything you've ever wanted for yourself because the opinions of people who are never going to do a mother fucking thing in their entire life matter to you these people are going to do the same shit they've been doing now next year five years from now 10 years from now and anybody who's been in the game long enough can tell you that so most people just opt out of the game for fear of the opinions of people who end up being irrelevant anyway which makes no sense you know most people also do this thing where they talk about the haters and this and that and then this bro most of you are your own biggest hater most of you sit there and you don't go because you're afraid to go because of what people might say it's not what they actually said it's what you're imagining in your brain what people might say if you do this or if you do that and guess what that makes you your own biggest hater that makes you your own biggest obstacle that you need to overcome to even go so when people sit here and they don't go because they're afraid of the opinions of others they're actually afraid of the made up opinions that they've made up of others that what others might say and that's pretty fucked up if you really break that down you know what I'm saying yeah so bro you know my answer to the question is this be smart about where you get information listen to people who have done real things but most importantly go go do the thing go start the thing go try the project and learn along the way you have to be willing to do that because if you're not willing to do that there's no way for you to ever actually get anywhere you could be the guy who recites all the statistics and knows all the stuff and knows all the lessons and sounds real good saying it with nothing to show for it because you never fucking went so you don't want to be that guy love that man guys Andy question number two Andy how do you retrain yourself to become hyper focused and intentional with wherever you are and whatever tax you have in hand how do you really focus in on the task of hand well I mean look dude we live in a day where we're hyper distracted okay our attention span and this is scientifically proven his lesson has ever been people are making content that's four seconds long and getting 20 million views on YouTube shorts and tick tock and things so we're we're inundated by short form content that is mindless that trains us not to be able to pay attention when was the last time y'all were able to watch a movie from start to finish it's very difficult for people to do now because dude they can't do it without picking up their phone or looking at stuff on the internet like at people are people have become these very highly distracted beings which is a huge disadvantage so you have to put yourself in an environment where you can be intentful that means you got to put your phone away maybe put it in the other room maybe put it in another fucking building whenever the fuck you got to do and you got to sit there and do dedicated work and someone who can sit down and do dedicated work has a massive advantage over everybody else because it's so rare right now it used to be back in the day there weren't these distractions so you're competing against a bunch of people who all were dedicated all had the intent to execute on whatever it is they were working at which produced a ton of great work and right now you don't have that anymore because of the nature of everybody's lives being distracted by these phones so the first thing is get yourself in a position to concentrate without the distractions of technology that's a huge part of it uh secondly you have to realize that work done with the proper intent is a totally different concept then work just done okay and there are two kinds of people in this world and one kind of person gets paid real well and the other kind of person doesn't and they and they appear to be doing the same things they appear to be doing the same shit people who actually work on their work with the outcome and the intent in mind as they work on it produce much higher quality work are much more revered and valuable inside of an organization than the people who just check boxes okay people who check boxes they will get the box they will get the work done but what ends up happening is they can't figure out why their work is always mediocre why the other guy's beating them or why the other guy's getting the promotion or why the other guy's business is is doing better than theirs it's because just doing it isn't enough it's how you do it do you do it with the highest possible standards when you're shooting content or you're making a piece of content is it the coolest fucking thing that you've ever done that you've ever seen or is it just some shit you're doing to throw out there like dude I see all these people now who want to be content creators and there's putting out mediocre shit after mediocre shit after mediocre shit and they can't figure out why it's not taking it's not taking because it sucks bro you fucking suck okay we have to be honest with ourselves about the quality of your fucking work and that comes down to the intent it what am I doing this for am I doing this because I want likes clicks and views and shares for me because I want to be famous and I want to have a following or am I doing this to actually serve people am I trying to teach them something am I trying to help them achieve something am I trying to entertain them in a way that is super entertaining what am I doing you know just doing shit for the sake of doing it is never a winning strategy and that goes for creating content that goes for building a business that goes for being an entrepreneur inside of a business like if you're not getting paid and you're undervalued there's a good chance that you're actually not undervalued you just think you are you're probably doing mediocre work that lacks intent you're not doing it with the outcome in mind you're not remembering that you're not doing this for you you're doing it for them you know when when I was in business my first 10 years in business I fucking sucked okay I made $58,380 my first 10 years in business combined do you know why because my intent and what I did was off my intent and running the business was I want to make money I want to get as much as I can I want to sell these people as much as many products as I can and you know what happened that whole entire time I fucking sucked I didn't make any money I was broke the whole time you know you know what happened to me I got hurt and I threw my back out I was gonna go I was gonna go start cleaning carpets that's what I was gonna do we're gonna close the business that was gonna go start cleaning carpets and on the carpet cleaning training I threw my back out and for 30 days I was in bed I was really really bad and I was having these conversations with Chris about how to unwind the business and how to you know move on from where we were and he was gonna go join officer candidate school and become a pilot and I was gonna start this carpet cleaning business and we were talking and we were kind of like talking about what we did like about the business we got into this conversation about what we liked about what we did and one of the things that happened to us along the way is because we were so slow and because we didn't have much business every once in a while we would talk to someone for two or three hours that came in the store for no other reason than we just didn't have anybody else to talk to and so during that conversation we would go very thoroughly through their their fitness program and what they were doing and this person occasionally a couple times a year these people would leave and they would come back months later and they would be down a hundred pounds or they would be down 75 pounds and they be crying and they'd be giving us a big hug saying you changed my life and Chris and I both agreed that that was like the coolest thing about our business and so we decided you know hey man you know what maybe we won't just go out and do these other things we'll just keep doing what we do but instead of trying to sell as much shit as possible let's focus on getting these people results let's focus on actually helping these people and what happened was our business grew a hundred percent five years in a fucking row you know why because people understood that we were there to help them we weren't there for us and by and because we focused on them and our intent right was on them we made more money so that's a little lesson for you on intent whatever it is that you do in your business in your content creation whatever is your working on realize and keep in mind you're doing it for someone else you're doing it for a reason that is not selfish for you and if you do it with the right intent well enough and long enough you will get what comes with that which is the money money is a byproduct of that process okay money is not you're not entitled to it you don't just get it because you have a business that's not how the fuck it works it is what people trade you for the value that you provide and when you provide value with the right kind of intent the money is all always there and that's a fundamental reality of anybody's business is out there so I know that's taking intent to a different direction than what the question was asked but I think it's relevant to what we're talking about you know well not think it's perfectly real because you're you're explaining why it's so fucking important you can't get nowhere without it yeah well I mean look dude here's the bottom line puts yourself in a place where you're not distracted by technology and get to work with the idea in mind that whatever I'm working on is designed to fucking serve someone else what is that how are you how is your shit serving someone else how is it made now are there exceptions to this are there these girls on the internet that show their ass and their titties and negative fucking gazillion views yes their exceptions that's not really valuable okay but you ain't that and that's gonna wear off so we're talking about a fundamental a fundamental mentality long term right now the internet is very favorable to mindless content if you go on YouTube I could tell you for sure YouTube 100% promotes mindless content if you look at the short the short form content that gets 35 40 million views it's all just mindless shit it's stupid shit it's not even it's not any sort of value whatsoever so you have to understand the internet right now is built for entertainment it's not built for education but business you know a real business is built to serve with impact and education for the most part unless you're in an entertainment business but the point is is that when you're trying to build something whatever it is you're building you have to keep the end customer in mind what is this person going to get out of consuming this what is this person going to get out of reading this or watching this what is this person going to get when they buy this and are they going to is this going to provide enough value where not only are they thrilled but they're thrilled enough to tell their friends and that's gonna come from you focusing on what you can do for them not what you're going to get out of the process love it man love it guys Andy our third and final question question number three hey Andy I've been blessed with the opportunity to establish a construction and development company and be trained by my business partner who has taken me under his wing as a mentor he has 50 plus years experience in this business and every day is a learning experience especially the dick kickings now I know the only way to gain 50 years of experience is to do this shit for 50 years but I find myself struggling to keep up with my mentors pace in accomplishing goals task it done but not as fast as I would like and I find myself reacting to the daily fires more than being able to focus on the growth opportunities when we get presented early mornings and light nights or regular thing we've been a business a little over a year and this is my first real foray into entrepreneurship any advice on this is greatly appreciated yeah welcome welcome bro that's how the fucking game goes the day you enter entrepreneurship the day regular life ceases to exist okay this idea that you're gonna show up at nine and leave it five and you're gonna have all this freedom that's bullshit all right and this pace that you're having to keep up that's the pace of a person who's been doing something for so long that it's become easy for them to do and that's what you have to look forward to now is it gonna be easier for you to get to that point no it's gonna be highly uncomfortable you're gonna be frustrated you're gonna be pissed off you're gonna be angry you're gonna vent you're gonna say fuck all I do is this this is all I do all I do my whole life is this that's right if you want to win an entrepreneurship that's what it takes it takes everything you fucking got because there's other people out there that have skill sets that are stronger than yours that are giving everything that they fucking got and people think they can compete in this world because it's popular on the internet to see oh man it's so easy I started my own business I I became this I did this you know and it was fucking nine hundred dollars in this one program that taught me everything I know fuck you bro you're full of shit okay this is gonna take everything you got and the pace at which you are you are being thrown into the fire right now yeah and you should welcome you should welcome this uncomfortableness because what it's doing is it's conditioning you to become acclimated to the pace that you're gonna have to run out your whole life if you want to be successful this is why I say all the time it's not for everybody is not for everybody bro is a very hard very brutal very time consuming path you have to be all in you have to be fully committed and people who aren't fucking loose and they blame it on everybody else all the market was bad or this was bad or that was bad or this this no you're not doing what's required and what's required is full fucking commitment because you're competing against a bunch of other people who are giving full commitment what makes you think you're so fucking good that you can operate and compete with people who are giving ten times the amount of effort is you and I've been for 50 years that's right it's not gonna happen so my answer to you is you're getting a taste of what it's really like and you should welcome and appreciate the fact that your mentor is showing you this because you're going to be able to acclimate to that much faster than everybody else who's in the same place as you okay because what you're really competing with and when it comes to entrepreneurship is you're not competing with the guys like me who've been doing it for 20 plus years 25 years you're not doing that bro I'm so far ahead of you you're probably not catching me okay but what you are competing with is the guys who've been doing it one year or two years okay and so that's how you have to look at it instead of looking at it like I'm competing with all the big dogs or I'm competing with these guys who've been doing it for 50 25 years start looking at like okay who am I competing with oh I'm competing with the guys who've been doing it the same amount of time as me all right and so because you're with this mentor and he's pulling your pace up to a 50 year pace and probably the next three years bro you're in a tremendous advantage over all the people that you're actually competing with that are in that one to three year bracket so I would embrace this I would I would I would welcome it I would be thankful for it and I would try to acclimate to the pace as much as possible without driving yourself fucking crazy yeah this is I feel like this is interesting talk I'm never really heard you speak on the pace of business right like and it's making me think like I remember when I was in high school playing high school football yeah I got recruited to go to D2 yeah play D2 football I'm like through the speed of the game different completely different yeah and that's just D2 yeah I couldn't imagine D1 or then you look at like the NFL yeah what is that I mean what is that what is that pace of business you're talking about well look man when you start out you know you're not doing a whole bunch of stuff like you feel like you are because before you started you weren't doing much but once you start you start to do all these things that you weren't doing before and it feels overwhelming but what you don't realize is that the further you go and business the more that becomes you know accelerated and compounded you know I can give you an example like one of the comments that I get consistently when people watch the day the first day in the life episode that we did was like god dang dude you're a busy motherfucker and it like I'm just thinking in my head I'm like this is just normal day bro yeah like in fact you're not even show we didn't even show in that fucking video like my meetings and the things I do 20 minutes of that's what I'm saying wow that's what I'm saying dude so like I and you know this because we're we're together all the time but like and I'm not saying this to flex on people but like bro most people couldn't fucking hang with me dude like I wake up I fucking go hard as fuck until I'm fucking exhausted and then go to bed and and most people can't do that because they built in these ideas and their brain about what an acceptable amount of work is or what the acceptable pace is right they've been told seven and a half eight hours a day of work which in reality does anybody actually work eight hours or do they work fucking one or two hours within eight hours let's be fucking real okay and a real competitive entrepreneur has to work and be productive that entire time so you go from you know basically not understanding any of this to you know being overwhelmed in beginning and and and dude it's kind of like getting in a it's like getting in a cold plunge you know the first time you get in the cold plunge you're freaking the fuck out bro like it's super uncomfortable and then after a few days it gets a little easier after a few weeks it gets it's still a little bit uncomfortable but it's pretty easy and after even doing it for a few months you can kind of get right in even though in a normal person that'll fucking it will it will crush him right that's what it's like adapting to the pace of being an entrepreneur you the longer you do it the easier gets but not because it gets easier but just because you acclimate to it and that's how how I describe the process and you know you could only get acclimated to it by exposing yourself to it and not everybody has a mentor that's been doing something for 50 years that understands this so I think whoever wrote this question is a really favorable position over their competition by even having somebody that they can be around to witness that because most people don't get a view of that dude they don't get it let me let me let me final final thousand that's I'm gonna actually this too is there anything that he should be uh I guess not not cautious of right but when you do have a guy that's in the business that I've been doing it 50 years is there anything that he should just like hey just keep this in mind like yeah I would say this um a lot of times a lot of these older guys you know here here's where you take the value from the older guys they understand the fundamentals very well they understand things like building relationship and serving a customer and providing value and bottom of the funnel I would say foundational principles for building a tremendous business they understand fucking way better than any of these young people yeah but some of these young people understand how to get attention or how to build a funnel or how to get leads better than some of the older dogs okay so you know you have to you have to take what they say very serious but you also have to understand that technology kind of changed the game on how entrepreneurship is done sort of uh the exes and those are slightly different it's a different technology not a different concept so you have to be very good at listening to what these guys are saying and then kind of like thinking about it and computing it into your brain as to how to apply into what's going on right now with technology yeah does that make sense absolutely I could do that was the first thing I thought okay he's been in a 50 oh 70 years old at least right right right I'm okay I got no TikTok right exactly exactly so like and he may understand what TikTok it maybe fuck maybe he's got a baby yeah yeah man yeah who knows but my point is is that we have to recognize that the concepts are always the same I think what makes me a formidable entrepreneur is that I operated for a long time without social media in the internet yeah you know and I'm still young I was like right in that sweet spot of age range where I was young enough to still be young when technology came around but I had that good eight 10 years ahead were the internet and social media wasn't like the thing so I was able to learn the real fundamentals and that handicaps a lot of the young bucks now like a lot of the young guys that are coming up right now they they're all about lead generation they don't understand how to fucking actually keep customers and how to get them to stay with your brand over a long term and this is why we see so many people creating basically you know cash flow businesses not actual brands and you know to create a real brand and which is what you should do because that brand is going to have brand equity and a value on the backside of your journey right if you're creating a cash flow business where oh I'm making excellent if you hear if you listen to some of these young guys all they ever talk about is I'm making X amount a month I'm making X amount a month yeah I know but what do you make it on the back end what's that worth you see what I'm saying like I'm making X amount a month but I'm also building a whole bunch of things that are worth a lot of money on the back end I can sell those things right that's why that's the power of building a brand and that's why I tell you young guys you guys should be alert yes utilize your skill set for creating funnels and getting leads absolutely but understand how to put them into a brand so that you're building brand equity over time and then whenever you decide that that journey is over you have something to fall back on you're not just you know a slave to your lifestyle because all you've ever worked for is cash flow which is a problem that a lot of people get into yeah so yeah I love it man that's it that's pretty much it you know you guys who are who are out here right now you got more opportunity than anybody ever considering that the world doesn't burn down and fall apart right which is a very real thing that's why we do CTI that's what we talk about what's going on a lot of people you know a lot of you guys get frustrated because you know I don't do strictly personal development but the reason that I don't do strictly personal development the reason I talk about CTI is because one like I said the Internet is free entertainment and it's an entertaining show but two you have to know what you have to do as your obligation as a citizen in order to protect your ability to grow a business you know a lot of these guys these influencers out here who are just talking about money money money money money money they're not understanding that the environment can change very quick to where they're little schemes and skills don't matter at all and we're not that far away from that in America so whether you listen to our show CTI or whether you stay up with current events with someone else which I could promise you won't be as fun but uh but those those those other sources are listening to CTI that's that's that's a lot there's a lot of truth to that um you have to be aware of what's going on in the world and you have to be socially cognizant and you can't be delusional in buying into you know the left narrative or the right narrative you gotta see things for what they are in reality without bias if you want to be effective in entrepreneurship and and and do your duty as a citizen to make sure that we maintain the fertile soil that we've always had which is quickly dissipating so some all you young guys who are just out here in business man you guys need to get involved in what's going on in the world otherwise you're not going to have the ability to grow these businesses so I'll leave you with that it's real shit man well guys Andy that was three yep thanks guys appreciate you guys love you guys go pay the fee
