What is up guys it's Andy for Sella and this is the show for the real estate about a couple of different ways. First way is you can email those questions into ask Andy at Andy for Sella.com or you can go on YouTube under the Q&A episodes which air on Mondays and drop your question in the comments and we'll pick some from there. Other times we have real talk, real talk is kind of like what you heard yesterday. It's just a five to 20 minute talk that I think needs to be said and heard. Then we have full length, full length is where you know an interesting person comes in and we talked with them and have a conversation like every other podcast in the world. Then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus is where someone comes in, sits down, talks about what they learned during 75 hard, what their life was before, what their life was after and how you can do the same thing. And if you go to episode 208 on the audio feed you can get the 75 hard and the live hard program for free. A whole bunch of people are starting that on January 1st. So I welcome you to join with us. There's a lot of people doing it. I'm doing it. My good buddy Jason McCarthy who is the founder of GoRuck is doing it. His community is doing it. Our community is doing it. There's a shit ton of people doing it. We're going to start the year off right. If you're interested in learning more about that there is a book that I just released on my website called the book on mental toughness and it's available for pre-order. It will ship beginning January 2nd. If you would like to buy that book it's an awesome book. It contains a full live hard program. 10 plus chapters on the elements of mental toughness. Why you need them. How to apply them. Why they're important to your life. Forward by Tim Grover. Many case studies on some of the most successful people in the world. It's an amazing book. It's much much better than 75 hard book. It actually includes the 75 hard book within that book. If you own the 75 hard book we're going to take that out of print and that's probably going to be some sort of collector's item eventually. Now we have the book on mental toughness which is just a completely different book that I think you guys are really going to enjoy and we are selling the fuck out of that book. If you guys are interested in that book you go get it at Andy for sell.com. I think you're going to really like it. It's a tool that you can go back to over and over and over again. Discipline mental toughness these are perishable skills that we have to polish and sharpen many different times over the course of our life. This is a utilitarian tool that you can go back to and help you get a line at any time you need it. Go check out the book. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. What's up man? It's going all man. Not much. Yeah. It's going on with you. Not much. Yeah. Yeah. No it's interesting. So as we got a few days here left of the year there's a lot of reflection going on right now. Right. And apparently somebody has created a list of the top seven most annoying people in the world. Are we on it? We're not on it. We're not on it. I want to go through it but then I felt like I want to list. I want to be at the top. Yeah. I'll be listening. That's like bro we're we're fucking win. You know what I'm saying? I guess I win. Winners win. Number one. That's right. But I want to go that list. I want to go through that list. That'll be fun. You know, make a really F's top five most annoying people in the world. And uh okay. I know who my most I already know like I can let's see who's on the on that list first. Okay. Who's on their list? Yeah. We're going to make our list. We'll make our list. Yeah. Because fuck all these got it. Got it. But uh but yeah. So this is it's from Fox News. That was an op-ed that was written by Dan Gainer. Um oh yeah. Randy Winegarten. She is annoying. Well she's number one. Yeah. So number one. I thought that was shocking. I don't I don't know. She's ruined a lot of kids' education. That fucked up a lot of people. He ruined a whole generation of kids through her own ego. Yeah. Yeah. She she's uh I mean even Mike Pompeo. He called her the most dangerous person in the world. Um you know like she also went for a bash the moms for Liberty Group. I'm saying calling them an extremist front designed to divide parents from educators. Um I mean just just a total piece of garbage. Yeah. I mean I just don't know if that's number one. It should be number one. I don't know if you're fucking face. Yeah. It's pretty fucking bad. This is pretty annoying. Yeah. That's an annoying face. Yeah. Like if I were a woman I'd punch her in a face. She looks like. I would. I would. I'd become a trans woman for a day just a puncher. Yeah. Just identify. Yeah. Because bro if I become a trans woman you all can't say shit. You let you let trans women fight in MMA bro. I'm pretty sure I can punch a hole right through a face. What's going to be your what's going to be your uh your your name? Andrea. Yeah. It's a simple it's it's a simple alternative. Yeah. Andy with an eye. That's right. Yeah. Bro she she looks like Stuart Little Demeel. She looks like a fucking wood check. Yeah. Yeah. That's bad. Just like chipmunk. Yeah. So that's number one. So so so yeah. What's your name? I'm sitting here. She's a piece of shit. Randy Wine Garden. That's number one. Number two on their list. Go at a thumb bird. Reasonably placed. It's hard to argue with that. I mean it's a pretty solid list. It's a pretty solid list. Um for some reason she reminds me that little like you know that Ukrainian orphan kid that was an actually like an adult you know that story that whatever she killed all her family. She reminds me of yeah. That or the movie orphan. Yeah. It's based around her and that's a real thing. So it actually happened. Yeah. It's fucked up. But yeah. I mean that I think that's a good solid place for her. Um third on the list was all of the late night TV show host. Bro. This is a good this is a good list. This is a decent list. Bro Jimmy Fallon all of them. The guys. What was the uh yeah dude. They're all to know I cannot fucking stand that guy. Well they're all listen. They're all paid mouthpieces. These are guys that get paid to talk about stuff and push an narrative. Yeah. None of these guys actually have their own thoughts bro. They're they're surface. Agandists. Yes. They're surface level people. Now I will say though Bill uh Bill Mar. Why is uh it's he's all right. Is Conan still a late night host? I thought he was done. I think he's I thought he was still doing it. I think check that fact. Check that for us. Yeah. Those guys are insane. Stephen Colbert man. That that dude's a fucking faggot. Well I mean hey the words coming back. That's what it is. That's what it is. That's real big guys. Look at the biggest rules though. Well listen. Well is he actually gay? Probably. No I'm just saying. No I think he I think that's not a gay slur. No like you can be you don't have to you can be gay and be a faggot and you also not be gay and be a faggot. Yeah for sure. I think so. I think that yeah yeah yeah you could definitely make somebody what would make somebody a faggot. Well I think South Park already answered this. Okay yeah yeah yeah that's a good uh if you ride your Harley up and down the street and rev it at every stoplight you're a faggot. Yeah and who does that DJ? Who's who's the Harley rider here? I'm a faggot. I'm a faggot sometimes. Look man I you know it is what it is. Yeah but he's one. Oh yeah but yeah so number three is the late all the late night show host. Number four was all context matters. Okay let's be real. The left and politically correct controlling language those days are over. No context matters. Yeah. Like you could use that as a homosexual slur if you wanted to. Yeah but 99.99% of the time it's used. It's used to just describe somebody who's an asshole that we don't like. Has nothing to do with where they like to stick their weiner. No right. Yeah let me know this reasonable. Yeah I mean you could like you could like stick in your weiner in a vagina and still be a faggot. Absolutely be a faggot. Yeah for sure. Yeah. Anyway yeah yeah well I will say this Jimmy Fallon's songs about COVID. Oh yeah like Stephen Colbert did that shit too. Did he? Yeah I might be a guy who's a bunch of turds. Anyway these are America's men huh? Yeah. Some America's men. Yeah. Yeah fuck it. Number four was all the president's women so you are you know the the pins pin university of pin. Look at that. They all look the same. They all look the same. Look how mean they look. Yeah. Yeah they look the same. They are on fire. Yeah RBF's on fire. Yeah they got they got them on that list as number four number five was Megan Markle and Prince Harry. I don't pay enough attention to them to know if they're I think that's why they're on the list though. Yeah because they feel like everybody does. Yeah well I don't. Yeah number six Bill Gates. He's on there. I think he's a little lower. I think he deserves a much higher ranking. For sure. I would agree with that. I would agree with that. And guys we're going to give you the the actual really f most annoying people in the world list are shortly. So don't worry about these rankings here. This is not authenticated just yet. But yeah Bill Gates at number six finally at number seven on their list is all of the NFL referees. Now come on. I don't know how they. So yeah. So I mean you know there's that. Roger Gidell belongs on list before the rest. I would agree with that. Yes. I would agree with that. Yeah. And I don't even think he belongs on list. I mean he's he's slightly annoying but he's not like Megan. I know he's just his face. No it's just the way he cucks for China bro. Yeah. And like bows down to like the narratives and shit and like how they always put this social movement shit and all the games and try to shut like I hate that bro just let them play football. You know what I mean like sports are supposed to be a place where we escape all this shit and could come together and they've really messed up sports because dude this used to be it they used to be one of the main safe havens for unity. Like it didn't matter what you voted for bro we could go to a football game and you know we could fight about that. Yeah. You know back in the good old days. Yeah. Drink Bud Light. Yeah. Yeah. Hey Bud Light's making a comeback. What? No bro you're my boy man. I got nothing. Are you mad because I drank a Bud Light? No. All right. No. No. No. No. Listen I'm for St. Louis dude. We got a cancel cancel culture at some point in time. Now if they do that shit again it's over. Yeah. We want to see a lot of people be giving day to white. A day to white a hard time about signing with Bud Light but I actually think he's doing the right thing dude. Oh yes. Because you got a what point like when does it end? Dude that's what I'm saying and we made a point like I think that as long as they stay away from that which dude they have since then. Yeah. And you know if you look at the commercials they're doing now they got paid manning and they're doing like the the man style commercials again and like David since yeah like do what we do that. Yes. None of that shit. Yeah. Now that might have been a slur. That might have been a slur. That might have been a yeah. Dude that one. Yeah. That feels good. Dude all I'm saying is this like we don't need that we don't need that we got to understand dude like anyway. This is a whole another conversation. I get tired of seeing people dog gain a white over what I think is a responsible patriotic decision because at some point in time we've got to cancel the cancel culture and yes we could punish companies that do stupid shit and stay with that but you know they don't have a history of that they haven't done it since you know what I'm saying. Not only that we're not punishing the company we're putting dude that's what I'm saying is a thousand. Yeah. These are like our neighbors and shit that are getting laid off and that's where I have a problem. That was my biggest thing we'd like to say that we have I know we've covered this but that was my biggest thing it's okay if we're gonna shut that down we have to have an alternative option that's already set up in place for those people to go to. Yeah. You can't just shut the shit down and all these Americans are out of jobs. Look bro I just think I think we got to be intelligent consumers. I think if we don't agree with what a company does we just don't buy from them and we got to we got to give grace based on history based on what a company has done you know over you know for the communities like I don't know I just think there's a lot more to it than just like never again like now if they came out to the same sheet again it would be never again. It would be never again. Yeah and I think they probably know that. Oh yeah. I think they got the message. Well like companies like Target who continually who continuously jam it down your throat. You shouldn't shop there. Yeah you know like we shouldn't have these political social agendas jam down our throat everywhere and and you know I don't know that's just my opinion. Let's give the people our top five. Did you did you take the liberty of making this already? No no no no. Okay. You have like a selection I'm a finalist. I'm gonna go about 2000 people we could choose from. Okay. All right well who do we put number one I think we both know. Let's just say it at the same time. It's it's a tie for me. Okay. I got two ties. Yeah I was saying. Okay. One hold on. Okay wait wait wait wait. It's it's this dude I'll tell you what it is. It's they have the same position. Yes. Okay. All right we'll say it on three. All right. One two three. Hillary Clinton. No. Oh shit. KJP and Gen Socki. Oh man that's a good one. Yeah and then Hillary Clinton is good that's a good one too. Yeah I was gonna say Hillary and Obama. It's like yeah the most annoying. I mean we're like annoying. Okay KJB got it though. I think I think I can tolerate Gen Socki a little bit more than I can KGB. I can't they're both terrible. Yeah. They're both blatant liars. Yeah. With no shame. No. Yeah the list is long dude. Hillary Clinton is definitely at the top. Yeah obviously she's number two. I mean can we say number two? I don't know man because I don't know she could be I think she actually is like in a whole different category. Yeah. Like I think there's people that should be eliminated from the planet. And then there's annoying people. That list comes out next week. Yes. Yeah. Like like when we talk about Klaus Schwab like Klaus Schwab's down annoying he should just be dealt with. Yeah it's different. Yeah. Like these are there's a different list for these people. Okay so annoying people. All right so KGB and Gen Socki is number one. Yeah. Number two who we got that man. I don't know who you think. I would say the people who don't put their shopping carts back. Yeah but see that doesn't annoy me because I don't go to the store. I pisses me off. Yeah. Yeah I pisses me off. Yeah we'll get you to grinds my gears. To me it's wine moms. Look everybody. And so that you're a fucking shopping carts back. Click here buddy. Hey that's cultural appropriation. You're stealing our lingo. You can't be doing that bro. Hey look I think I think for me it's it's the whole culture of wine moms. Oh brunchers. Yeah brunchers. That's number three. It's wine moms who who try to outliberal each other every chance they get they have contributed nothing to society. They don't really have a job. And yet they got the most opinions on everything in the world. They scream and yell when they're in public together. They all dress nice but they're not really dress nice and they think they're hot and they're not hot and they drink their drinks with their fucking pinkies up. Like everything about them annoys me. Like when I see them coming dude I start getting like agitated. Bro what I think I was talking about. You know what I'm saying dude it's white suburban women who think they're upper class but aren't really upper class. No. And then you know it's like sex in the city chicks. Like it's like that whole that whole thing. Yeah that whole thing. I think I was with you brother. We were at twisted tree one night and it was like this fucking group but it was like they just kept coming. Like they could just kept adding another one to their little group and like bro they get they're so loud. Yeah they're laughing at fucking nothing. Yeah dude and then yeah but they all got trans kids. You know what I'm saying? They all they are. They're adopted a black guy. Yeah they all got an adopted black kid. Like they're all trying to show how fucking socially conscious they are. You know they all got one. Yeah. These are the these are the propagators. These are the nobody will think I'm racist if I have a black kid. Like a name to my OJ. They gave him much additional black man. Dude listen. Listen these women are the problem with the world. Yeah okay because the men they're married to don't stand up or believe in anything. They marry all these little sump pussy bitches. That'd be number three on the list. Yeah right. Yeah that's right. No shit dude. And dude they they they they have the most opinions on they're the most opinionated people with nothing to contribute. Like real talk like I don't know. They they're up there. Yeah. And the list is long. Yeah. We just yeah okay we got not got two more though. Number four and five. Yeah I mean like I said like Klaus Schwab and Obama are on a different list. Yeah it's different. Um hmm. Zalinsky. No Zalinsky's on a different list too. Yeah it's a different list. Um hmm. I mean Dylan Mulvaney is definitely an annoying he that's annoying. Like super annoying. Yeah. You know the way the way he tries to like like emulate what he thinks a woman is like did you see that video where he was like look kid I always feel like crying I don't know why I feel well because you're injecting yourself with fucking massive amounts of estrogen bro. Yeah. Like that's what happens when your body is overloaded with fucking synthetic estrogen. Yeah it'll do you feel like shit. Yeah it'll do that. Yeah yeah well okay so Dylan's number four guys what about you guys tell us who number five is how about that you guys put it down in the comments. Yeah I want to see everybody else is top five. Yeah. You know and you know we when I are clearly on the top five of awesome. Yeah one of them. One number one and two. There's no fucking down. Yeah. Come on. But that's up there too. He's up there with us. Top two. The whole crew here is. Yeah. Top five. All right. Yeah. Well guys let's give it to our show. It is cruise the internet. Remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to AndyFacella.com we linked all the videos there for you guys for these episodes. That's important because you guys can go back and check these things out yourself. So with that being said. That's my number one. That's my number one reads. Nearly 8,000 strong migrant caravan heads towards the US. Blinken urges Mexico help and irregular migration. Andy they did it again. They did it again. It's the name game. Irregular migration. That's what they're calling it now. It's no longer. It's a fucking invasion. No. No. It's a regular. Hey let me ask you this. How many how many Chinese special forces soldiers have crossed the border under the guise of migration? I don't know. Nobody knows. I mean it's more than one I can. Okay well hold on. How hard would it be for China to send their most elite warriors across the border as migrants with all these other Chinese refugees? What about what about what about terrorist organizations like Hamas? What about the enemies of America that legitimately hate this country? Like pretty much every country in Middle East. Which by the way that's a large percentage of the amount of people coming across the border. How hard would it be when you think about the geographical location of the United States of America to like do a land invasion or parachute people. We couldn't do that right? Can't do it. But what you could do is you could sneak people in and get them in the country because our people are so fucking stupid that they allow this shit. Yeah you pay the administrations to set certain policies that incentivize and allow people to come through the border. I think that's happening. That's 100% listening. I think and then you activate them whenever the time is right. Whenever the time is right whenever you need them. Sleeper sales may have been to real shit. Yeah so I mean this was this tweet so you just went down to Mexico. This was this tweet you put out. This is from the official account of Secretary Anthony. First of all, hold on. Why the fuck didn't he have an H in there? Don't you got a spell Anthony with H or is that just black people? It's two. There's there's there's it's two different. Some people do it one way some the other way. Yeah I don't know what determines that. I think black or you do. On the Anthony's I know we'll get an H. I think it dude it's Anthony. He's on the list. He's on the fucking list man. That's annoying. He's on the other list. Oh okay. Well yeah he tweeted this out. He says the US Mexico partnership is crucial to prosperity and security in our countries and throughout the Americas. Good to discuss these issues and our shared efforts to reduce irregular migration with at Lopez Obrado. Yeah. Why are they not putting our military on the border? Why are why are Republicans not demanding this? Yeah. Why are why are Republican governors and Republican senators and congressmen? Why are they not doing something to stop this? This is incredibly dangerous to everybody here and it's been that way for two three years now. Yeah it's bad. It's bad and it's weird too because now like it's definitely something now that you know from the White House are saying that it's an unprecedented irregular migration but then you had KGB saying that it's just ebbs and flows. And you know Fox News is saying 8,000 there's other sources out there that are saying anywhere up to 15,000 just keep it in mind just in the month of October alone. We saw three quarters of a million people come through our southern borders illegally in one month. November saw a quarter of a million. I mean it's becoming quite a bit man and you know they had this meeting down in Mexico and they didn't cover anything that actually affects us as Americans like the fit in all issue that's coming across our border rampant league. I'm letting it address that in their meetings at all year. And good news. New York Shion make a move. New York City Mayor restricts bus arrival system migrant search. New York City Mayor Eric Adams issued an emergency executive order that restricts bus arrivals in the city to curb the migrant surge as more asylum seekers are sent via bus from Texas. Adams is requiring bus operators who know they are transporting migrants to the city with fares paid by or four by a third party to provide notice at at least 32 hours ahead of their anticipated arrival. Operators must provide the number of passengers on their bus and the number of passengers who will require emergency shelter and other immediate services upon their arrival. Not really sure what much that's going to do. Um, be there anyway we got on this. Do you look at all those fucking people man? I mean look dude it's the replacement of the American culture intentional. There has to be something deeper. How do you organize 8,000 fucking people? It's it's 8 million people total. This is nothing. This is nothing. This is like this is just a sensational headline temporarily to get people riled up about it again. This is nothing compared to what they've actually been allowing in for the last three years. Like who are these guys in this green vests? Yeah, but look dude they voted for this. These people voted for this. You voted for this. If you voted for Biden, you voted for this. If you had sympathy for AOC and her lies, you voted for this. And now you have the inner cities in New York, Chicago declaring emergency situations because where did you think they were going to put these people? Did you think they were going to put them in the fucking suburbs? Did you think they were going to put them out in the country? No, they're going to put them in your neighborhoods. And now you're pissed off about it because you voted that way. Okay, you voted for this shit. This is what the fuck you voted for. All right. And they're registering these people to vote. This is a this is this is this is about trying to widen the gap. Close the gap. In terms of the election, the people who have woken up and are going to vote the other way. It's about that, right? They want these people to vote for them. They also want this is just reality. The global conspiracy on on migration is real. Like it's not about, you know, taking care of poor people or whatever dude. Like there's a reason they're moving all of these people from Africa and from the Middle East into these countries in Europe like Ireland and Belgium and Holland and Germany and all these places in France because they're trying to remove the nationalities from these countries to create one race of people, which is a hybrid race that is a mixed race, which sounds okay. Everybody's like, well, that's not a big deal. But the reality is is they're why aren't the why isn't Israel allowing these people to come to their country? And who's orchestrating all of this? You see what I'm saying? It's highly orchestrated. No, bro. Like dude, it's, it's, you know, you have Netanyahu on TV right now talking about how they want to ship these people from Palestine to United States, America and through Europe, but they don't want to take them into Israel. How come Israel doesn't allow these people in there? How come Israel only like lets the same people, the people of their culture and their race in their country? But everywhere else in the world, those same people root for these people to be inside these other cultures and you could say that's anti-Semitic. I don't give a fuck. That's actually what's happening. Okay. And so we're protecting one culture and one race of people, but we're going to dilute that we're going to dilute everybody else's culture across the world. Why is that? That's a fair question to ask. Very fair question to ask. Why is that? So in, and the answer is in the conspiracy of a one-world government, which is governed by two classes of people, one ruling class and one subservient class, a slave class, and that's what the fuck they're doing. So that's what this is about. This is about a bunch of different things. It's about making a vote. It's about creating a situation where the culture of the United States, America and these other countries is diluted at such a rate that where there can be no national pride, no national identity, no nationalism at all, all right, so that they can group all of these countries into one big conglomerate, global government that is run by another class of people who protect their own race. Like, how is that so hard to understand? And people just don't want to talk about it because they're afraid of being labeled this or that or this, but the reality is that's what's happening. Okay, so it's fucked up, dude. And I don't have anything against these people individually, but the reality is, is like, dude, we're going to have, if we're going to maintain the culture of the United States, America, if we're going to continue to be what we have been and improve upon that, these people all have to be deported. They all have to be sent back. And honestly, in my opinion, they should be sent back to Mexico, drop them right over the border, close the fucking walls, and let them deal with it because they're letting them come all the way through their country, all the way up to our country. Like, in this, in this situation, I love Mexico, and I love Mexican people. Okay, but the reality is, is their government is a bunch of fucks. Okay, and they're ruining our country by allowing these people to come through and do that. Like, how many of these people are settling in Mexico? Right. You see what I'm saying? Like, dude, it's just a, it's, it's a total fuck job and people are so afraid of being called racist or anti-Semitic to even point it out that you, it's not even talked about. So, all these people coming to, yeah, this, this is about destroying culture. This is about destroying national identity. Ireland is supposed to be filled with Irish people. Do you agree or disagree? Agreed. Germany is supposed to be filled with what? Germans. Okay, France is supposed to be filled with what? Okay, and we're supposed to be here in America, filled with American. Okay, now that all makes sense until you, until you break it down to what actually is, you know, like being played here. Yeah, right. Israel is supposed to be Jewish. That's okay. You see what I'm saying? But when you start actively trying to dilute everybody else's shit intentionally, call them races, if they're not with it. Yeah, call them racist bigots, anti-Semites, if they pointed out, now we're in a situation of, well, why are you afraid of being called these things? These people are coming to your neighborhoods. They're sucking up your tax-paid dollars. There's only a matter of time before people just say, fuck it. I'm not going to pay my tax or I'm not going to work because these people are getting your half of your money that's being pulled out of your income is going to these people. That's not okay. Like, dude, this is, this is, this is, bro, I fucking can't stand it. Yeah. Guys, tell us what you guys think. Jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know hashtag, plan them and by the way, who voted for this? Who voted for this? Who said, oh, this is a great idea. Did the people of Ireland say this was okay? Did the people of Germany say this is okay? Did the people of France say this is okay? Did the people of Italy say this is okay? None of them said it was okay. It was just put on them by a global movement and that basically like they're doing everything else. These are elite deal with it. Yes, and they don't, they do not give a shit what you think of the moves that they're making. And until people rise up and stand up and say, no fucking more, they're going to continue to operate this way. In real talk, these people should all be eliminated from the fucking earth. That's the, that's the truth. People perpetuate. I'm talking about, I'm talking about the world economic forum. I'm talking about the people organizing this. I'm not talking about some sort of genocide, right? Because that's what someone will twist it into. I'm talking about the evil people who are making these decisions on and protecting themselves with certain political identities or racial identities and not an entire race. Okay? That's low level thinking. Let's just eliminate an entire race. Like you have all these young people now saying that, you know, some really fucking fucked up shit like Hitler shit. You know what I'm saying? And that's not right either. Most Jewish people have no idea that that all of these people above them, well, they're waking up to it now. Yeah. But they have no idea that all these people above them have done so much to try and fuck everybody else in the world. Just like most Americans don't know all the shit that's going on. Yeah. Waking up though. Yeah. They're coming. I don't know, bro. I'm just saying these, the one to two, three thousand criminals that were running this whole entire operation across the globe, they need to be dealt with. I'm surprised they haven't been, bro. Yeah. I mean, that's the thing, man. Like, there's this appearance that's like they're untouchable. I mean, dude, this is a, this is a critical time for humans. Yeah. A critical time for human beings. Let me ask you this, dude. What's the pluses of diversity of when they say, oh, this is for diversity. What are the benefits of that? The only benefit of diversity that I see is diversity of thought. That's about it. Diversity of thought experiences was known. It's America not the most diverse country that we've already. We've called hasn't always been that melting pot for a hundred years. Yeah. But Americans are racist that they, if they don't want to completely destroy that culture by flooding it, where people from other cultures who are bringing their culture here as opposed to adapting to the American way of life. No, there's a balance. We got to have just enough. It's like making a good soup. You know what I'm saying? Like, not too much, not too many black people. That's not even what it's about. No, it's the fact. No, it's the fact that nobody's been given a choice. Yeah. Nobody is about this. Where is the democracy in that? This was such a good idea. Why, when you criticize it, are you called all these names? You know what I'm saying? Why wouldn't it be such? If this was such a good idea, why, when you ask questions about it, are you called all these names? Why, when you pointed out, are you called all these names? I feel it was such a good idea. Why does it feel so fucking wrong? Listen, because it ain't a good idea. And if it was a good idea, it'd be easy to present and say, this is why we should do this. This is why this matters. And what they tell people is, you know, oh, well, because people aren't reproducing, reproducing, we got to have society will collapse. That's not fucking true. That's not fucking true here. We have literally millions of fucking migrants on the fucking streets of these cities that don't belong here. They don't speak English. They don't have, they don't contribute. They haven't paid any tax. Why they rob the people who have paid tax their entire lives of their income and their livelihood to pay for this shit. Like, bro, this is not what the fuck we asked for or signed up for or anything. It has nothing to do with race. It has to do with this is our fucking country. And it should stay our fucking country, meaning Americans country, not white people country. Like that's what people will say, you know, when they hear me say that. It's our country, bro. It's an American country. Yeah. These people are not Americans. And they haven't gone through the proper process that we've had in place for fucking hundreds of years. Like every other family that's here, that's diverse. That's the complaint. They're just being dumped in neighborhoods and they're taking up resources. They're committing crimes. They're disrupting social, you know, to the point where the inner city black people are like, dude, what the fuck is going on? Oh, that fucked up. Yeah. And a year two years ago, if you said, if I said, like, bro, when we had hawk on and I said, great replacement. I said, hey, the great replacement. That's racist. That's not true. Do you think it's racist now? Yeah. Because it's racist against you. It's racist against. That's what to do with me. Yes, it's racist against our own black American population. Yeah. Oh, they, you know what? They, they, they woke up. They're not going to vote for us anymore. Well, we might as well bring some new people in. It's just fucked up. Guys, jump it on this conversation. Let us talk down in the comments. What you guys think? Hashtag playing the name game? Let us know. With that being said, man, it's time to cruise the comments. Got a problem, though. Okay. So I'm going to show you this comments. Somebody in this room wrote this fucking comment. Well, that's not a surprise. And I want, but, but you have to guess who wrote it. Okay. All right. Comment reads, good God. He is the sexiest man alive. No disrespect. It's just true. Well, who's she talking about? No, who in this room? She's talking about, they're talking about you. Who wrote that comment? And they're sitting in this room. I've already checked the IP address. Well, what me? I think it was Sayed. I think it was Z-Shine. So you write this comment, bro? No. Who are all of the favorite things that you just wrote it? Say, I mean, look, she ain't wrong. She ain't wrong. It is what it is. SCB5847, please prove yourself. Prove me innocent, please. I'm not a black guy blaming and a very responsible immigrant naturalized citizen. That's racist. How do you choose the profile picture? Because she looks that way. He fucking wrote this comment, bro. I don't think so. I mean, this is more creative than this. Yeah, I think so. I'll do it so you will never listen. Let's be real. This is this is a normal type comment. It's a good compliment. Yeah. He will never know because you get this all the time. He will never know. All I'm saying is, yes. Guys, we appreciate you, man. Thank you guys for coming. Make sure you guys are liking and sharing not being hose out there. Let's get back into it, man. We got some more stuff to cover. Headline number two. Headline number two reads, Americans back Biden impeachment probe by 12 point margin and six and 10 believe he was involved in hunters, shady deals. Devastating daily mail poll reveals voters think president's son is corrupt, a crook, and guilty. I like the daily mail. I think out of anybody that does the polls, like they're generally pretty pretty on point, pretty good. They get a very, very good temperature check. So let's dive into this. Oh, the problem is you just say that because you're saying that because the polls always come out in the way that you think. No, no, like I feel like I mean, I think they're getting a pretty accurate representative. But that's just you think it's accurate because that's what you think and see these people on the left. That's what they think, too. This is the entire problem. Is that nobody's actually telling the fucking truth? Confirmation by, yeah, it is. Confirmation by, like this though. Right? So like daily mail, this is a UK based thing. They haven't, it is. Yeah, they don't have any elite. Maybe, maybe you're more accurate than what I think. You know what I'm saying? All I'm saying is bro, like, look, like we got to be real. Like America has to get back to common sense and unity. If we do not get back to a unified America, we were going to lose America. Yeah. Okay. And we have to quit buying into these polls that we know are lies. You know, like dude, when they, when they say, you know, Biden's even with with Trump, like right on CNN, oh, you know, like there's a reason for all these reports, right? Like when they say Biden and Trump are dead even, they're trying to make it seem like Biden has more support than he has, right? When they say Trump is ahead by 10 points, they're trying to get people who are, you know, scared of Trump to get engaged, right? And also those who like them to relax. That's right. And get people who who, who, you know, well, we got this in the bag, right? Wave. And then you got people who were saying, don't vote. It doesn't matter. It's, dude, you don't understand. If you don't vote, then if it's, there's cheating or corruption, you can't ever catch it. So it's important that everybody just show up and vote for who you think the best candidate is, like legitimately, like your vote showing up and actually voting in force, no matter what the polls say is the most important thing that anybody could do. And, you know, I don't know. I don't trust any of these polls. I think they're all bullshit. But here's what I will say, dude, like I will say, okay, most of my friends will say, dude, of course, I'm voting for Trump. Like this is fucking insane shit. But those are my friends, right? Those are people that, that typically resonate with my shit. But here's what I will say. I have a lot of friends because believe it or not, I'm not actually a domestic terrorist. I'm actually a pretty nice guy. You know, I have a lot of friends who have different political opinions than me. And when I talk to those people, a lot of those people who, who legitimately hated Trump are now backing Trump. They're like, dude, this is insane. This is, this is communism. We're in deep shit. We got fooled. And we need, we really need somebody who's going to clean this up. And so we see a lot of awakening happening with people who are left of center or even in some cases, progressives are ex-progressives. A lot of my friends who bought into the progressive ideology over the past few years, you know, the politically correct movements, the me too, the pro, the hash tags. Yeah, like all the shit. Okay, those people, like I have, I know a lot of those people believe it or not. And a lot of those people have woken up and they're saying like, dude, this is fucked up. And I'm a little scared of Trump too, but I do think that they're lying. Mostly shit's a lie. So like, you know, the biggest problem that we have in that I think that's preventing unity right now isn't the left or the Democrats because I think a lot of those people are waking up. I actually think it's within the traditional Republican side where people are trying to argue that, you know, like, you know, people like the people who like the Santas are like kind of the worst with this, right? They will just attack Trump nonstop, you know, and so like we have to, we have to come to a unifying understanding that if we don't pick the right person here, we're all fucked. Okay. And, and dude, we have a chance by voting for Trump legitimately to fix the entire system for for the next hundred years. And that's why they're saying things like, you know, Trump's gonna go in. He says he's gonna be it. Like I saw CT the God say this on his show. He, you know, Charlotte, main to God. So I listened to their show when I listened to the radio, just because like I like hip-hop music. And I also like to hear their perspective because it's traditionally opposite of my perspective. So I want to hear what the fuck he's saying. I think he's an interesting dude. Um, well, no, you don't. Yeah. Yeah, too early. Really? That dude's a piece of shit. Is he? I don't think so. I think he's just got a different perspective. Yeah, it's wrong. Well, this is what I'm talking about though. Like I would love for him to come on the show. And that's actually talk. Come on, Charlotte, main. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like dude, the thing is is he made a post the other day saying Trump says that he's gonna be a dictator on day one. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And everybody in the comments was like, bro, you're crazy. You're fucking crazy. Yeah. The tradition. The online, I can say this, the online Instagram black community has switched all over with it. Yeah. I was there. You see it on world star. You see it in and and shade room. Shade room. You see it on, you know what I'm saying? Like all the all the black culture pages. It's it's actually really cool. And what I really think is cool is that they're also pointing out the fucking anti white racism, which I think is awesome. And that's a good step towards unity, which is why they're allowing back to topic one, all these people coming in like what do you think is going to happen when they've imported millions upon millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of people who culturally do not like America. And not only are they bringing them in, they're giving them free shit. And then they're telling them that white people are the fucking cause of all their pro. How do you think that's going to end up like 10 years down the road? How is that going to end up for white people? You see what I'm saying? And black people are starting to recognize that this is happening in their standing up for it, which I think is a beautiful thing. 100% man. To your point too, I actually got a little supporting article here. You know, you talk about those progressives and ex progressives and stuff, you know, uh, yeah, well look at this headline. Joe Biden is a dictator and worse than Trump progressive activists. I mean, this this this lady, uh, Breen Newsom. I don't know if she's related or not, um, to Hawk, but, um, she tweeted this out. She said, I want liberals to stop trying to convince us that a second Biden term makes any sense. Maybe they're simply trying to convince themselves or maybe they're okay with Biden being the dictator we fear Trump would be. Whatever the motivation, quote, vote Biden to save democracy sounds nuts. Again, vote Biden to save democracy is not vote Biden to save what you think democracy is. Exactly. Vote Biden to save democracy actually means vote Biden to save the corrupt oppressive political structure that has become the United States America over the last several generations. That's what they're afraid of losing. Vote Biden to keep us out of the house. When Nikki Haley legitimately says Trump will destroy democracy. What she's saying is Trump will come in and make it impossible for me to oppress you and make a whole bunch of money doing so at your expense. It will it will. That's what they're talking about. The destruction of remember what we said on the show for many years when they say democracy, what do they actually mean? They mean communism. That's what they're saying. That's the main game. So if you if you substitute democracy in with communism, that's what like then read it then read the statements like that. The our country is a republic. It's not a democracy. Democracy is mob rule. That means the most people that vote a certain way get their way. And that's not what the fuck this is supposed to be. What it's supposed to be is a representative government that the people who contribute get to make the decisions. Okay. And this idea that every and look, this is a controversial statement, but it's the truth. This idea that everybody should get the vote is insane. Okay. Because eventually you pump in enough people who don't contribute anything and then you allow them to vote. This is why like allowing illegal immigrants to vote is pushed. This is why allowing, you know, no voter ID is shamed and called racist because it allows them to get all of these people in poverty and then promise them free shit and then get them to vote for their policies, which enrich them and make more people impoverished for their benefit. They'll keep voting and the worker class. They'll work have to work even harder until that worker class. They just give up. There's a book about this call atlistened. Okay. Eventually the producers stop producing and society collapses. And I'm pretty sure I think we cover the last time we checked it. It was like 40 60, I believe like 40% of Americans who are able to work or not. Yeah. I don't look man. There's very simple solutions. There's very simple solutions to this. Okay. You round up all the people that shouldn't be here and send them somewhere else back to where they came from. You change the voting laws. So like there is no it's not based on gender or age. It's based on your tax return. Are you do you have a job and are you paying taxes? If you have a job and are paying taxes, you should be a lot of vote. If you're 15 years old and you have a job at fucking Walgreens and a part-time job and you're paying your tax, then you get to vote. That's okay. Okay. We have to eliminate people from voting that do not contribute. Like if you're a white suburban housewife that doesn't have her own tax return, guess what? No fucking vote. And these things should this should be real. This is them. We're going to see the true yes beliefs. Yes. Actual competing Americans. Yes. Yes. The laws that we pass in Congress have to apply to the people who pass them. Okay. The tax codes, the tax exemptions, everything that applies to us has to apply to them. If that were the case, they'd make some different fucking laws. Okay. If we made it like Warren Buffett says where politicians were ineligible for reelection. If the deficit, if we had a deficit, the meaning all politicians, that would be a real thing. If we eliminated lobbies. Okay. If there's a lot of things that we could do that would be done instantly that could correct this entire problem and people get snowballed by the language that people use in these ideologies. You know, everybody gets everybody shouldn't get a say. Why? Because everybody gets say, because it's fair. It's not fair that I work my fucking. That's right. It's not fair. You get to decide how much I can. I have to fucking contribute. That's not exactly. Those people are going to vote you out of your money and your income all costs every single time. Bro, the welfare system, the welfare systems should exist and it should exist. Okay. There's plenty of good people who have to go on welfare and need some help totally. Sure. But it should have a time limit. Like you should only be able to be on it for so long over the course of your life. Okay. Okay. Fucking crutch for the rest of your money. And while you're on it, you don't get a vote. And on top of that, while you're on it, you have to pass a drug test. You cannot be doing drugs. Like these are things that have to happen for us to have a civilized true representation of what America is supposed to be. There has to be some type of system to show that you're making progress. Yeah. Getting back to that. Look, man, there's a whole bunch of other things that need to happen. But those basic things I just mentioned with fixed most of the problem. 100% bro. Because at the end of the day, bro, like the majority of Americans, like if we're being real with ourselves, we have just been taking from this country. Term limits. It's an obligation. We got to fucking do some shit to keep taking. You know what I'm saying? I'm going to take everything from you guys and from us and for me and from all of us. Like it's it's a real thing. Biden's going back on vacation. Yeah. Well, he's a permanent vacation bro. Come on, little girl. Yeah. Look, man, that's such a man. Dude, grown men shouldn't wear their hats backwards either. What's he doing? I'm just saying. They just shouldn't like if you if you're a grown man, you wonder why you're not getting any pussy. It's because you wear your hat backwards, bro. Real talk. Stop doing it. Don't do it. Yeah. No. It's just not a look, bro. I felt it too. I felt it. Yeah. See? See? Now imagine how they feel. Oh, we're back in action. That's right. Yeah. Like bro, I caught myself. I caught myself trying to put my hat on backwards the other day, man. And just fell all wrong. I'm not doing it. I refuse. Guys, jump in on the conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. Hashtag. It's closing time. Just thought that went well with that. Yeah. Head on number three. Head on number three reads Chicago mayor on increase in most violent crime. Reparations money will help. So give him more money to steal. How? This guy's all over the place. So he's wild. Yeah. This guy's all over the place. Wild, man. Wild. So on Wednesday's broadcast of CNN this morning, Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson responded to a question on an uptick in most violent crime categories in the city in 2023 by stating that homicides and shootings have fallen and money for restoration. The reparations will help address the quote unquote cycle of violence in the city. Co-host Poppy Harlow asked quote, I do want to ask you about the crime in Chicago. Just pouring through the latest data from the Chicago police department. The murder rate is down from 2022. But all other forms of violent crime, Mr. Mayor, are up from a year ago, up 17% overall. Our Chicago is going to be safer in 2024. Here is his response. I know you're about seven months in as mayor of Chicago. I do want to ask you about crime in Chicago. Just pouring through the latest data from the Chicago police department. The murder rate is down from 2022. You see a face when she said that. He said, oh, shit. What would she say? She's asking about the crime. I do. I do want to touch on the crime. Shit. The case. Crime in Chicago. Just pouring through the latest data from the Chicago police department. The murder rate is down from 2022. But all other forms of violent crime, Mr. Mayor, are up from a year ago, up 17% overall. Our Chicago is going to be safer in 2024. What I've built within these last seven months in order for us to have a better stronger and safer Chicago, it really requires the full force of government. And as you've indicated, homicides are down, shootings are down. But yes, what we've experienced in the city of Chicago, cities all over the country are experiencing. And I've just released my full out community safety plan that not only gets at the root causes of violence in the city of Chicago, but we're making critical investments. Those investments look like what I've presented in my last budget. A quarter of a billion dollars to address homelessness, 100 million dollars for Vadas prevention. We added 80 million more dollars to our youth employment program of which we hire 25,000 young people just this summer. That's a 20% increase from the previous year. I'm going to hire 4,000 additional young people this summer. We have stood up and an entire office dedicated to reentry. So individuals who are returning to our communities who have been incarcerated because of failed policies. We'll have a welcoming space for them. I've added a half a million dollars for restoration and reparations to address again the cycle of violence, which looks like school closings, closing of mental health facilities, of which I've invested in now. We're going to open up two mental health clinics that were closed from two previous administrations ago. And so in order for us to build a better stronger safe for Chicago, it requires investments. And that's what this budget has done. A $16.77 billion budget without raising property taxes. And we're just getting started in the city of Chicago. Look, the last thing that I'll say on this, look, my wife and I were raising our three children on the west side of Chicago. It's a beautiful part of the city. We love it, but it also has been the side of the city of Chicago that has experienced gross disinvestment from school closings, from lack of transportation, from lack of investments. And so I wake up every single day in one of the most toughest parts of the city. And so there is no one in this city who thinks about public safety more than someone like me who was raising a family on the west side of Chicago. And so I'm very much committed to investments so that the better, stronger safe for Chicago that we're all hoping for, we can actually see the full fruit of our labor. Yeah, look, that all sounds good. It's what you should say. The things you should say, right? But the problem is is when you spout off, you know, half a billion dollars, a hundred million dollars, this and that. And you don't tell us where it goes or how it's spent, you know, like put it in this book at this time. Yeah, right. It's like, it's like a connect the dot puzzle where you just don't connect the last few dots. Like it's not a complete story, right? And these politicians love to get on TV and talk about how much money they they allocated for this or that. But they don't tell you how what they're doing with the money. They don't, you know, and then two years ago, three years ago, you know, these people hate the police and fire the police, defund the police, police or shit. And now murder rates are at a fucking all time high. And people are like, well, we don't know why. No, no, no, you know, like they know, listen, bro, this is just an excuse for them. Pause this problem. Yes. And they caused the problem intentionally for the reason of being able to milk taxpayer dollars to solve a problem that didn't exist before the way that it exists now and line their own pockets. Come on. Yeah. And that's what we're talking about here. And we see this over and over and over again. This has happened in St. Louis with a number of our politicians and public officials where they've been shown to advocate for the defunding of police or these soft on crime stances. And then later on, it was shown that they were stealing the money. And, you know, they've convinced through media and propaganda that black communities. And I don't think they believe this right now. But for the last few years and for decades before this, they believe that Republicans and white people are the fucking problem. That's not the problem. It's the people that you keep voting for. They come in every two, three years, every two, four years and they say, hey guys, those guys over there screwing you over, vote for us and we'll fix it. And you continue to vote for them. And they continue to, you know, go out and get these big numbers of dollar bills. But how come we never see it actually doing anything on the streets? And then on top of it, he's like, oh, we've seen a large divestment of business dollars in the infrastructure of West Side Chicago. Yeah, because it's a fucking war zone. And you made it that way. Yeah, you made it worse. Bro, I'm a business guy. If there was opportunity there, if there was bit, this is a thing. Business people don't rate their opportunity based on racial, they're based on fucking money. Okay. Like I'm not going to invest a few million dollars in rehabbing a cool building in the downtown St. Louis. When I know that the police won't arrest the criminals who've analyzed it and fuck it up. We have this shit happening in our own city here in St. Louis. There's all kinds of great people trying to build businesses and revitalize the city and do all this shit. And people that care about this city and love this city. I love the city. Okay. But we can't like do that. I would love to take millions and millions of dollars and go invested in downtown St. Louis and build some cool shit. But I can't do it because there's too much crime and they won't stop it. So like dude, to say this is like a white problem or a Republican problem in these inner city black neighborhoods is fucking bullshit. And for it to stop the black people that live in these communities have to recognize that it's a lie. We have to stop saying, oh, it's white people. Oh, it's Republicans. No, dude. It's the people that you believe and vote for. Like they're voting for those people because they look like them, not understanding that those people are doing the same thing that white culture does. They're saying, they're saying, we're gonna do everything for you. We're gonna blah, blah, blah. And then they get in the car. And they're like, we ain't doing shit for those motherfuckers. That's what the fuck they're doing. And it's hard for black people to understand that because these people look like them. They sound like that. Yes. And dude, we got this. This is why we got to stop identifying people's quality of character based upon their racial pigments. Like bro, just because someone's has lighter pigment than you are darker pigment that you doesn't mean they're with you. It doesn't mean they're real. It doesn't mean they actually care. This fucking, this loyalty because someone that happens to be the same race as you. That's, that's what we see black people do that in a different way too, though, right? Like I mean, we protect our own in certain situations as fucked up. But do they do do some fucked up shit? But do they do that? Because they're protecting their own or do they do that the same way the Italians do that where they they have traditionally protected the criminals because they're afraid if they tell on them that you fucking dealt with. Yeah, but the difference is the Italians will still handle those fucking people. You know what I'm saying? Listen, the world was in much better shape. You know what I'm saying? The Italian organized crime. They'll take care of it. Italian organized crime and Irish organized crime kept order. Yeah. Real talk. Like if you fucked up, yeah, we ain't gonna branch up. We go handle you. Yeah, that does not happen in the black community. Yeah. You know, I mean, I think we need that shit back. Bro. And there's no laws right now. So it's not like you're gonna get in trouble. Well, they're black. They'll be out in 24 hours. No, I'm just saying like I'm talking about, you know, like there needs to be some vigilante organization to fucking stop this crazy shit going on in the world. And that's what's happening. We're seeing it happen. Yeah. It's just like being reported. Yeah. I mean, bro, I think that's a fair assessment. I think, yeah, you know, I mean, dude, I think it's stereotypes exist for a reason. They're not just made up. No, no, they're typically gonna mind off of two things. It's like it's actual historical evidence and then fear is typically what stereotypes. It's the same reason humor's funny, bro. Like there's a little bit of truth. Yes, because it's fucking true and everybody knows it. And that's why it's funny when you say it out loud. It's comedy is just another way of speaking the truth. And in fact, it's the best way of speaking the truth because people get way less pissed off when they hear it in a comedic sense. Right? Typically. But the truth is the truth. And, you know, Kanye said a clip recently. I thought it was amazing. He's like, he said, uh, every every time I speak radical truth on the internet, the internet goes crazy. And they censor it and they they they they they they de platform me and they call me all these names and they attack me. So what does that mean that we're getting the rest of the time? That's some fucking real shit, dude. You see what I'm saying? Like we have to be able to speak the truth and have real discussions about, you know, even sensitive topics in order for us to actually have any unity. And that's why they prevent these discussions for happening. That's why when we talk to these things, you know, that we're talking about right now, they they clip them out and they say, look at this guy. He's a fucking racist or look at these guys. They're bigots or look at this. This is this because bro, they want to shut that line of communication down. The truth of the matter is, bro, black people and white people get a long fucking great when nobody's stirring a fucking pot. Intentionally. I wish we could get some I wish we could do it if we could figure out how to get black America and white America to truly unite. These people would be totally fucked. Bro, they would they would be ruined totally fucked. I think we're getting there. We're making some strats. We need to get a lot closer to that. I think we're we're getting there. Yeah. I think we will get there. Yeah. Well, the internet, if you look at the internet, it appears that that's getting closer and closer. Almost there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we'll know by that. But that means that means we're in a very dangerous position because if we know that they know that and also if they know that they're going to do whatever they can to stop that. Like I truly believe in 2024, they're going to pull some ridiculous insane shit. Like if you think back to like the beginning of COVID, right? Like I remember when COVID started, the last thing I did before COVID was we went on a ski trip. We went to Colorado and it was like COVID had just started being it was it was like March 5th, right? And like a March 13th, the world shut down or whatever. And like I remember like sitting out on the patio, totally oblivious. Like I knew they were going to do some shit, but I had no idea they would do that drastic of a thing where they literally shut the world down, shut everybody's business down, force all these people out of business. You know, try to force these people to take an untested vaccination, which now is legitimately killing people. Okay. Uh, you know, force people to watch their loved loved ones die on the news or on on a Zoom call. You know, all of this crazy shit. We can I mean we can list as long as they do. Yeah. Dude, you would have never imagined that. Like if someone would have told me and I was skeptical that that's what they were going to do, I would have been like, bro, there's no way. There's no there's no fucking way. They're not going to do that. And the truth is is every single fucking human involved with that whole operation should be hung. All of them, every single one of them worldwide, every single one of them, because that's the extent to which they'll go to push the agenda, which they think is the right agenda for us. We can no say in it. Okay. We're going to get another taste of that in 2024 because we didn't hang them because there was no repercussions and there was no accountability. We're going to get another taste of that. And this time you better believe that it's going to be fucking permanent. So like I'm pretty nervous about what's going to happen now. Am I going to continue to operate in an optimistic fashion? Am I going to continue to try to get better every single day and run my life and run my companies and be the best I can? Yeah. And I'm going to do that even when they do whatever they're going to do. But the reality of it is, dude, is we're we're staring straight down the barrel of a cannon that we could have prevented had we held these people accountable when they did what they did and everybody knows what they've done. And so like, do we have two choices as human beings? We can either allow them to do this again or we can not comply. We could stand up and we could take our ship back. And that's how whatever that means is what the fucking means. And it really should be led by the people who have taken an oath to defend our country and protect us that our tax dollars pay. We have a military and a police force generally over the course of the last four years that my opinion completely fucking failed their oath. You know what I'm saying? And I love the police, bro. It's one of the biggest charities that I donate to. But the reality is is like when you're arresting people on the beach, when you're not standing up for truth, when we have people who have been shown to have taken money from China and making decisions like what's been made, they're like, look, dude, it's a failure because I always believed that if anything like this were to happen, like our military would step in and handle it. But dude, that's that's not happened. And these people deserve to be arrested. Yeah. Globally, not just not just yeah. And the fact that like none of these Republican senators or congressmen or like they're just continuing to allow it play out, like they're just as complicit. They're just as guilty. You know, you could say whatever you want about Matt Gaetz or, you know, any of these guys are like, oh, he's doing a good job. No, he's not. They're not doing a good job because this is continuing. And where to the point now where if it continues any worse, we could be in a situation where it's like a permanent destruction of this country. We're not far off from that. You know, so you know, they shut the power off for a week, bro, total chaos and soos. Most people can't survive for more than three days without without power. They have no idea. It would be total disorder and total chaos. And I'm not I don't think that they're above doing that. You know, the Obama's just produced a movie about just that. Yeah. You got these people building bunkers all over the world, dude. And like, you know, like, what are they building all these $200 million bunkers? Like apparently Zuckerberg's doing in Hawaii. What is that for? Why is Biden doing a bunker in Delaware? Why are they doing these things? It's because, dude, they are preparing to destroy everything if they lose power because if they lose power, they're going to be held accountable. And these people are so incredibly fucking dangerous that I, you know, the police and the military and the senators and the congressmen, you guys are continuing to play this out along the quote unquote rules when in reality, they're not playing by any rules. And they're going to get their way, dude. And it's going to fuck your entire life up and your family's life and everybody's life just like it is everybody else. You know, these people are going to do anything. That's the thing that those people think they're safe. I think they'll be safe for these people will do anything to avoid accountability. Anything, anything. And people need to be understanding and prepared for that. And it's disheartening that the people who we've trusted and pay through our tax dollars haven't stood up for what they know. You know how many of these people reach? I mean, bro, you know, like you guys don't understand like our DMs and like our emails and all that. They're flooded with these people. Bro, keep up the good fight. Keep doing what you're doing. Keep standing for the truth. We're with you. And they're all members of these things that I'm talking about. Three letter agencies, the military police, etc, etc, etc. Okay, if you're with it, then why the fuck are you allowing it? You see what I'm saying? Yeah, because I know what it's dangerous. Your loyalty should be to the fucking citizens of this country. It should be not a corrupt fucking government that's willing to propagate an entire orchestrated black swan event that transfers all this wealth, kills all these people, changes society forever, all for their own benefit. And you stand by an act like this is for for your defending, you're supposed to be defending us. These people should already have been arrested and dealt with real talk. And people, you know, I don't know, I don't know what's going to happen, dude. The way this country's supposed to be built, these people would already have been held accountable. They wouldn't be in a position to do what I think they're what they're going to do, which is something fucking horrible. Guys, let's get to our last segment of the show. Thumbs up, dumb as fuck. Let's go bring a headline in. We talk about it to get one of those two options. So with that being said, our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads, Mexico's weed nuns, sister of the Valley aimed to take marijuana back from Narcos and emulate their success in the US where they have raked in $500,000 in the last year from CBD, Tinctures and Solves. So this is not in this man. A group of Mexican women who call themselves the Sisters of the Valley dresses Catholic nuns while trying to take marijuana back from the Narcos, but their financial success has come from expanding to the US. The Sisters of the Valley were founded in 2014 in central Mexico with the aim being to spread the gospel of the healing powers of cannabis. In the United States, where around two dozen states have legalized recreational marijuana, the group has also launched a successful small business selling CBD, Tinctures, oils and salves online and raking in over $500,000 last year. But in Mexico, where a drug war has ravaged the country and Christianity is embedded in society, the image of a marijuana smoking nun is more an act of rebellion to women's say. The Sisters frequently post on social media, primarily Instagram where they can be seen carrying for cannabis crops, giving workshops and attending cannabis related events. Sister's getting high on more than just God. You know what I'm saying? I mean, how long did you think of that joke before you said it? Me and Joe worked on it. I was going to say that sounds like one you thought about like all night. Yeah. Hi, oh, God. They're all wearing sunglasses and OG haze. Bro, they all got sunglasses on. They're all like, oh, my God. Look at that. Man. Praise Jesus. This is man. It goes from the earth. It's supposed to be here. God came from there. I just better for you than alcohol. That's that's a fact. Yeah. It's a fact. What are we giving this? I say thumbs up. I think they're in deep shit, though. They keep fucking with the cartel bro. The cartel fucking kill everybody. That's the only part that gets spicy, man. It's like that. Listen, they're savage, bro. That that that that dress like I'll save you. That gets you. Dude, I'm just saying people have to come to the understanding that criminals and evil people do not play by the same set of rules. Yeah. They do not play by the same set of rules. And if you continue to play by the rules while they're not playing by the rules, you will lose. Everybody. This is the problem that's happening with the American people. And aside from this story, I give this thumbs up. But this is the problem that's happening with the American people. The citizens that serve in the military are elected senators and congressmen. Is that they're continuing to try to play by the quote unquote rules and avoid having to do some uncomfortable things and make some uncomfortable situations. And these other people, they don't give a fuck about the rules. They're going to get what they can get and take what they can take. And it doesn't matter what they do. And that attitude is going to get us killed. It really is. It's going to get us killed. It's going to cause us the loss of our of our country. And it's going to probably be a huge loss for humankind in general. You know what I mean? Regarding freedom and and becoming enslaved to technology and life. Yeah. It's another way of installing like a surf system. You know what I'm saying? And we happen to be on the wrong side of that. You know, we're the fucking source. And it's it's fucked up, dude, because if we continue to and what's really funny is like if you read the fucking constitution and declaration independence, the citizens of this country have a duty to stand up to people just like this. This was the reason that this shit was written. So I'm wondering what's found. You know, our are two second amendment rights are not for hunting. Like it's for this. And in my opinion, you know, the fact that the military is just standing by and allowing it to happen. And the police officers are standing by and allowing it to happen and forcing these ridiculous rules and shit like, dude, that's a big fucking problem. Yeah. And those people, those individuals, those of you that listen to this show, you should be examining what why you joined and what you think this is about. You know, like the I don't know, maybe maybe maybe I'm delusional about the patriotic nature of the people in this country. Maybe I'm delusional. Maybe people are just fucking worthless consumers. And they've been or completely demoralized. Yeah. I know this. I went to fucking gearbox for the first time in like, I don't know. 10 years. I was that. I mean, bro, I didn't see one able body man in the whole store the whole time I was there. Not one. Not a single fucking one. Not a single one. I was there for a while, too, because I couldn't find what I was looking for. So like, I was, and then I and then I saw one of our end caps for swarms and caps. So I spent like 30 minutes getting that right. And dude, I saw, I mean, I was in there for probably an hour and a half. And I did not see one other able body male in the whole store. Not the security, not anybody. Not a single customer. Like it was, it was eye opening. Yeah. So, you know, I don't know, man. Yeah. Guys, baby. It's all I got. Yep. Don't be a hoe. Show the show.
