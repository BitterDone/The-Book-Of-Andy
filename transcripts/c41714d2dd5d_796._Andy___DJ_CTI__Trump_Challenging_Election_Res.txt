What's going on? Nothing dude. What's up with you? I'll just sift into the the the world of the internet. Yeah, yeah, there's Going on out there today though, huh some cool stuff out there to be there I have a breakthrough I haven't been on the internet today because I've been doing my job. Yeah, there's there's some breakthroughs and Cool stuff happening. Yeah Some racist stuff out there always is like to we like to clear out the racism Sometimes you mean you like to contribute to it. I well, you know, somebody's got to do it. Yeah, so So what we got we got some crazy shit man. Yeah, I saw this thought this was pretty cool SpaceX they're making history Thought it was pretty interesting Why yesterday space X launch was such a huge deal for space travel So apparently was I mean this is apparently a pretty big deal and I remember when Elon first like Made this announcement that like he was going to have a rocket like land how it launched everybody called him a fucking idiot and he did it Vogue and did it So SpaceX achieved an incredible engineering feed on Sunday the company launched the fifth test flight of its starship rocket After liftoff the super heavy boost a return to the launch pad and a world first maneuver So yeah, they they achieved a world first on Sunday during its fifth test flight Showing for the first time that the launch system may really have what it takes to change space flight Now apparently this fucking rocket dude is massive. It's 233 feet tall. It's the same length of the statue of Liberty That's a big fucking rocket. Yeah, this was the takeoff clip check this out I There's nothing to you know crazy, I mean, it's a rocket that's going into space right Now that's not like the crazy part about it. It's how it landed which is like making a lot of noise So the super heavy booster release starship on its path towards space then began to fall back towards earth for the first time ever as the booster Descended towards the company's Texas launch pad a pair of giant mechanical chopsticks or arms Snatched it check this clip out of his landing It's slowing down That's pretty fucking crazy That's pretty crazy. That's pretty fucking cool. Yeah, that's pretty fucking cool Quote a day for the history books engineers at SpaceX set the set as the booster landed this engineering feed is unlike anything Ever seen an orbital rocket technology, but it's something the SpaceX's founder and CEO Elon Musk has been touting for years Now I think it's pretty cool, you know technology these days. They got so much, but I also sell this other article which I thought was interesting about technology Because you know, it could be dangerous sometimes Did you see this robot Vacuum they got hacked and started yelling racial slur It's what's a racial slur these days. Well, it was pretty bad. Was it because like everything's hate speech Everything's a racial slur. Yeah, you call it like if I said Sia's Indian that's a racial slur You know like I'm fucking over it. Everything's racist So what did it say it was pretty bad job some hard art did it? All right, well that might be right But yeah, and the article this was on gizmodo is said it's a tell as old as well the internet of things era robot vacuums made by eco-vax Have been reported roving around people's homes Yelling profanities at them through the onboard speakers after the company software was found to be vulnerable to Intrusion, ABC News and Australia reports that there were recently multiple instances across the US When owners of eco-vax vacuums notice their devices acting unusually Quote it sounded like a broken up radio signal or something Daniel Swinson an owner of an eco-vax Debot x2 told the outlet Quote you could hear snippets of maybe a voice he opened up the vacuums app to find a stranger was Accessing its live camera feed and remote control feature, but assumed it might be an error after resetting the password and rebooting the x2 The vacuum quickly started moving again Quote this time there was no ambiguity about what was coming out of the speaker a voice was yelling races obscenities loud and clear right in front of mr. Swinson son Quote No way No way This is real man. You guys see here. I mean it's on the screen. It says fuck hard ours. Yes Yeah, and it screamed the voice over again But so wait so somebody a person hacked into the camera the fucking vacuum man and starts yelling at the fucking people Okay, this sounds like the this sounds like the the chat in like call a duty bro. Yeah, it's true You know I'm saying it's pretty much all right. It's funny how everybody makes all these big deals about everybody saying all this racist shit You open up call a duty bro. You want to know where the most racist shit exists It's in the chat forms of games and they're still they're still fighting to you know You know push ahead and battle for comic costs and and to win and beat the Even despite all of the you know, but it's crazy. There was some weird comments like this one from Where could I get one That's big Reggie man, that's you hey, you know, I need I didn't need a vacuum But it's just you know, I thought a little bro. I think it's crazy that people have any of this shit in their house Yeah, like any of this remote shit Alexa any of it I'm not a big fan of it now like a batter's bro. They're recording everything from your cell phone anyway Yeah, but it's just like the like it's the scary thing is like what Like the capabilities of it. You know, I'm saying what happens five years down the road if communism takes over and like You say some dumb shit on the internet now you have no AC Because they shut your fucking difference to make for us. Yeah, I'm saying But don't make no difference for us. Yeah, it's true. We're going to the do lag See you guys there permanent. They see yeah, we'll see you on there too But it is scary man, but like that's why we didn't do any of those like like those That shit for like the baby cribs and shit like the video my oh, no, we're not doing under that shit because that shit Like there's like that shit's been hacked before man like you just I'm not a big fan of it But the space space ship. Yeah, that's cool. That's some cool technology I wonder if that was yelling out anything Maybe there's too far away to hear it. Yeah, maybe but uh, yeah, man, so let's get it to the screws guys remember if you want to see India there's no video this thing like screaming this shit. I wish there was oh, man. It could be a lie then Could be bullshit trying to say the the vacuum is racist. Yeah, it is it is they offered in a few different color modes You can order there's what I mean was this the white one white vacuum that was saying it Um, you know, I don't know or if it was a black one is probably accepted If it's a black one, I mean, I think you know, it could say it right be all right. Yeah, I mean, but I'll say this if you don't want the white vacuum to say it I don't think anybody any vacuum should be saying I agree You know what I'm saying. Yeah, I that sounds reasonable Why do we let the black vacuum say it and not the white that one because the nothing all vacuum should be able to say it You know, I'm saying you had a black one right then we had kids that disappeared We could never keep the room clean. It just never went in there It was like, you know, there was like a border wall there. Just never wanted to enter the kid room. I don't know. Oh, man Oh, man, that's some funny shit though. Oh Guys, uh, remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to Andy for seller dot com. The guys can find all of that good stuff link there with that being said let's get to our first headlines Uh, head on number one. Uh, this was an interesting headline that came out There's some foreshadowing that's happening um from the left And it's very interesting. Let's dive into a little bit of this this nonsense. Uh, this first headline reads How Trump may try to challenge the election results if he loses again Out of the press for a Monday morning Are there article reads if vice president Kamala Harris wins in November Election officials and experts worry that former president Donald Trump and his supporters will not accept that outcome and could again Try to overturn his loss In 2020 Trump refused to acknowledge his loss spread false claims about widespread fraudulent voting sought to reverse the results And swing states and tried to press your vice president Mike Pence to help him stand power as rioters rated the U. S Capital many of those strategies can't be used again because Trump no longer acupies the White House And state and federal officials have since tightened election laws and policies to make it harder to undermine the will of voters But vulnerabilities persist the risk this year will depend on the particulars of the election and the closeness of the results Many election officials and experts are worried false narratives could again take off eroding public trust and leading to chaos confusion and in the worst case scenario violence David Becker the executive director of the center for election and innovation and research Uh, I said that those who oversee elections and key states are once again bracing to be harassed And threatened for doing their jobs. No, they're not they're they're bracing to be harassed and threatened for cheating Okay, and I agree with them. I think these people are in danger this time. Mm-hmm I think the general public has figured out what happened even the Democrat Have figured out what happened and uh, yeah, I think you're right that you should be concerned if you're someone who is out there cheating And you think that you have the right to undermine the will of every other single citizen that you see first of all you have a god complex And you're insane if you think the people aren't going to get pissed off and probably do shit this time Because most of the people recognize the dire situation that we are in and These people who are cheating which we've seen videos of them already trying to do it who are bringing These fake votes and counting these fake votes and acting like it's no big deal like it's just like do you understand What that means when you do this you are basically saying that you think your will is more important than the will of everybody else in this country And yeah people are gonna get pissed about that and they're not gonna tolerate another four years of this bullshit All right, I don't think it's gonna happen And I think they should be concerned and I think the result of their concern should be not to fuck around and then they don't have to find out I mean, that's as simple as way you could say you just says quote this is not a hypothetical This is not fear mongering. This is what happened in 2020 and since on a widespread scale The rest of the rest of the world Communicates about America calling America occupied America. Okay, so it's not just these far right You know citizens. Let's be real Okay, everybody who's not along with the narrative is considered far right There is no actual center or right anymore everybody's far right According to the media and according to the progressive left whack jobs, all right, so If everybody's far right that means everybody else is pissed off about this in the small minority of people The tail is wagging the dog right now and that's gonna stop It's gonna stop everybody else across the globe Understands that we are fucking occupied by communist. That is what's happening. That's how they talk about us in other countries All right, that Trump just said it actually and Washington Post that's who this article was written for they had this other article that they just released as well With the headlines saying Trump urges using military to handle radical left lunatics on election day Yeah, I think most of the people want that no Where he he went further to say that you know, he labeled them as enemy from within And saying that they're more dangerous than threats from rivals nations such as Russian China. It's finally telling the truth You know, but they're trying to spin this as if like it's a bad thing But everybody's on the same page. It is a bad thing to them. It's a terrible thing for them. They eat quit fucking around Stop doing it. You know, it's a very simple thing But but but it's even crazier You know, it's like as this shit goes on these people on the left mainstream media and included They keep trying to just blatantly lie and try to make things not as bad as they actually are And the beautiful thing is that now we have people in place JD Vance being one of them Who I think does a great job handling the media and calling it out for when they you know do some bullshit This just happened trick this out JD Vance rips ABC's Martha Raditz as she tries to downplay Venezuelan gang take over in Colorado. Do you hear yourself? Let's check this clip up The incidents were limited to a handful of apartment conflicts on apartment complexes in the mayor said our dedicated police officers have acted on those concern a handful of problems Only Martha do you hear yourself only a handful of apartment complexes in America? We're taken over by Venezuelan gangs and Donald Trump is the problem and not Kamala Harris's open border Americans are so fed up with what's going on and they have every right to be and I really find this exchange Martha sort of interesting because you seem to be more focused with nitpicking everything that Donald Trump has said Rather than acknowledging that apartment complexes in the United States of America are being taken over by violent gangs I worry so much more about that problem than anything else here We've got to get American communities in a safe space again and unfortunately when you let people in by the millions Most of whom are unvetted most of whom you don't know who they really are You're going to have problems like this Kamala Harris 94 executive order is that undid Donald Trump successful border policies We knew this stuff would happen that's that's ragged about opening the border And now we have the consequences and we're living with it We can do so much better But frankly, we're not going to do better Martha and let's Donald Trump calls this stuff out. I'm glad that he did I love how she tries to interrupt him and tell him that's not actually true That's bullshit man, and it's just a handful of apartment complexes You know, it's just listen. It's just a couple neighborhoods across the country. They're occupied by Venice, Wailing gangs Just no, it's just a handful like One is too many Even the real threat of one is too many The possibility of it being one is unreal These people say this stuff because they don't have to touch it. It's not at their front door If it was at their front door, they would say other shit All right, these people are parrots their puppets They don't have a brain cell in their entire being They are repeating what they were told to say because It's their job I'm just doing my job No, your job is to be a journalist Your job is to have some integrity The reason that the American citizen has lost trust in the processes of America And the media is because those two things don't have any integrity It's not our fault. It's not the citizens fault. It's not far right people. It's you Okay, and people see it So like dude the more these people put this information out and say this nonsense The more people are like look how foolish shit these people are Did you see the clip of Kamala saying they were trying to hide trump that I posted in my story last night Kamala went out in front of people yesterday and made a statement at her rally saying Don't you think it's kind of weird that they're not releasing Trump's medical records Don't you think it's kind of weird that they're trying to hide him? Don't you think it's kind of weird that he seems to be afraid? What the fuck are you talking about this dude is 78 years old He's doing more work than any man in the history of politics He's doing more events He did 30 events of 50 to 100,000 people the last 30 days in 2020 and nobody said shit while Biden was doing little speeches from his basement And people in six foot circles at a gym with 12 people in it You know why because he couldn't get the fucking crowds Donald Trump goes out there to prove that the crowds are there so that when they try to cheat It doesn't make any sense Kamala can't do shit Okay, these people are total criminals their total liars and anybody who believes these polls are even close is a fucking moron Okay, she had a 27% approval rating the day Joe Biden Quote unquote dropped out You really think she's at 50% now, right bro You there's groups out there black men for Trump Democrats for Trump black people for Trump fucking Everybody Democrats for Trump dude Everybody sees it okay, and they're gonna continue to push this fake narrative of her popularity And the harder they push the less popular she's gonna be because people are being realizing that they're being manipulated Of course, and the next thing you all are gonna see is you're likely gonna see another big attack or another big disruption Or a black swan event if you don't know the black swan event go fucking Google it That happens between now and election and if there isn't that that happens They're gonna definitely claim that they won the election and they're gonna expect you to believe it Just like Kamala has no problem saying in front of people that they're hiding Donald Trump When we know damn well that that's what they've done with her and Joe Biden the last four years All right, she spent two months not doing one fucking anything correct And we all know that and everybody knows that and the more they lie the more they push people to Trump I just saw a report yesterday on the advertising campaign That said that the more that they show Trump and then try to attack him for lying The more of those people that they run ads to go to Trump like they're running ads They're pushing people to Trump. Yeah Well, that's not the only thing that's helping them Andy because it's who they keep using That's fucking them up too. All right. I got two examples. Well, when they got Barack Obama coming in and saying oh You basically what he said was you ain't black if you don't vote for Kamala And black men are like what the fuck? Yeah Like and they got Bill Clinton too. Let's check out this bill Clinton first Because Bill Clinton just gave a campaign speech for Trump Oh, we're in a that's all you saw this yeah, right? And I got some what he said was incredible. It's amazing Yeah, let's check this clip out You got a case in Georgia not very long ago didn't you they made an ad about about a Young woman who'd been killed by an immigrant Yeah, well, it's late all been properly vetted that probably wouldn't happen But if they all properly vetted and that doesn't happen and America Is not having enough babies to keep our populations up So we need immigrants that have been vetted to do work There wouldn't be a problem and he couldn't keep people all torn up and upset Well, we need we America is having a problem of not having enough babies Coming from the side that keep pushing fucking abortion How does that? Doesn't they don't care they don't care if it makes sense They don't care for make sense This makes sense Um, and then you got you got good old berry um scolding black men Um, I got a dead. I know who he is and he ain't you so he's getting fuck controlled Oh, he's a black man. He's a turd. No dude. He's always done this like look One of the gifted most gifted orators of all time period. Oh the duke and you can go a long way being a great speaker period Ask me how the fuck I know okay But he does this arrogant shit where he thinks he talks to people like he's their dad When this motherfucker is out doing all kinds of corrupt shit and he walk do when he walked into that room Clearly, I'm not a black man, okay, but when he walked into that room and he talked to those men like that It was so rude to mean and so arrogant and so elitist to sit there and like identify An entire demographic based on the color of their skin like they don't have their own thoughts Or their own opinions or they don't know by now that 12 years of you running the country because let's be real That's what's been happening Doesn't benefit them. They fucking know bro 12 years you've been saying the same shit and nothing happens it gets worse and worse and worse Yep, now for those of you guys who didn't see it is the clip Get old berry such an arrogant fucking Um We have not yet seen The same kinds of energy and turnout in all courts Our neighborhoods of communities as we saw when I was running Now I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothers Brothers you don't mind just for a second. I'm gonna speak to y'all and And say that when you have a choice that is this clean When on one hand you have somebody who Ru up like you know those you Went to college with you You know Understands the struggles and Pain and joy that comes from those experiences Said to work hard and do more And overcome And it seems the second highest officer She grew up just like you guys He grew up just like you guys.

Yeah, we appreciate you guys be funnier be funnier Let's keep this careers moving, man. We gotta head line up a two Uh, this was an interesting one now, you know, obviously we guys we've been tracking the efforts going on down In North Carolina down in Florida. There's an interesting narrative that is coming out now Oh that I thought would be a good time to expose Um, I want you guys to read this uh this headline listen to this headline North Carolina hurricane recovery team relocated amid threat of armed militia Okay, that's the headlines coming out. All right hurricane Helene federal emergency workers told to evacuate Rutherford County Washington Post reports Uh, so government emergency workers in the United States responding to the devastation caused by hurricane Helene in North Carolina Relocated over the weekend amid concerns that armed militia could pose a threat to their safety According to an email obtained by the Washington Post the US Forest Service official sent out a message Warning that the federal emergency management agency or FEMA has advised all federal responders Rutherford County North Carolina to stand down and evacuate the county immediately Okay, the message said that soldiers with the National Guard had come across X2 trucks of armed militia saying they were hunting FEMA Okay, the Appalachian County of Rutherford incorporates the mountain towns of Rutherford 10 Forrest City and Chimney Rock which were badly hit by Helene floodwaters That's where we homes washed out roads and killed dozens um The politicization of the response to Helene and later Milton has provided a recruitment opportunity for white supremacist groups We have assembled and devastated regions that government emergency services have struggled to reach as part of a recruitment drive and PR effort FEMA has also Long been a target of unfounded unfounded anti-government conspiracy theorists Especially on the US as far right going back more than a decade Okay, now That's what they're telling us is happening Okay, let's dive into this a little bit. I thought this was pretty interesting Sounds like a good party to me Um, if it were actually true because they arrested somebody they have arrested they arrested somebody This is a CNN article so suspect arrested after reports of threats toward FEMA operations in North Carolina North Carolina man was arrested over the weekend for allegedly threatening harm against FEMA employees Responding to Hurricane Helene according to the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office William Jacob Parsons 44 years old this guy right here Okay, was arrested and charged with going armed to the terror of the public a misdemeanor Captain Jamie Keyvers said in the news released issued Monday Quote Parsons was armed with a handgun and a rifle okay the Sheriff's Office Begin investigating Saturday after receiving a call that a man quote made the comment about possibly harming FEMA employees working after the disaster of Hurricane Helene and the Lake Lure and chimney rock area Parsons was found after investigators received information about the color and license plate of his vehicle According to the Sheriff's Office Parsons was arrested in his car outside a grocery store that is functioning as a storm relief site Keyvers said Parsons is now free on a ten thousand dollars cured bond the Sheriff's Office said Okay, now It's interesting right it's interesting because Every progressive liberal in the world would look at this man and I don't know if he did or didn't But they would be scared of him just because of how he looks yeah, I mean, they would say he's he's he they think That that's what everybody the votes or Trump looks like looks like yeah, yeah, yeah um, but The interesting thing is like they closed All of the offices and all of the response shelter locations They closed all of them And the only evidence the only actual fact the only proof Was one person this guy Who allegedly made some comments which have not even been proven to have been said they closed all of them So who who's the person that made the comments not only that and he they They stopped giving aid to victims over this guy well. I mean it took It took people calling Senators And congresspeople for a week to give them to do anything And now it's all done because of one threat that was made Okay, one threat from one person put a stop to all of this Now we've been talking about this story, right? And I think it's obvious to say that the response From local state federal governments have not been adequate They've it's been delayed. It's been You know, not to the well if you ask them it hasn't been but if you ask the people who are actually there right I've talked to a number. I've been helping a number three different groups specifically um I know you've talked to a lot and they all say the same thing And so it's interesting to me That you know on top of this delayed response now you get one person And Everything is stopped and they get to blame it on the far right for why they're not able to continue The work that they were not even wanting to do in the first. Yeah, I don't think they wanted to be there either I think it's interesting man. I mean, it's a definitely an interesting situation Um, so who say any made of threats? I would like to see a picture of that person. I will yeah no shit No shit Um, and these like truckloads of militia men where the where they at? Where's the pictures? Where's the evidence? Where's the like where are they at? I mean, they don't have to be evidence anymore. You could just say whatever they want You know, I'm like they they've reached out to the US army who's coordinating the national bar response They they haven't said anything they haven't been seen anything These are just people driving around trying to help fucking people because the response is not there. It's a shit show, dude and honestly I think that so many people Have been watching this from the left and the right and and you know their delayed response whatever it is They're trying to accomplish with that I I think that was kind of the final nail on the coffin for a lot of people in terms of what they were gonna vote for I've seen a lot of people sort of waking Uh, uh, wake up over this situation Um, that's going on and I think it was a $750 comment from Kamala I really sealed the deal. Yeah, I I think there's yeah, I think so too I think there's a bunch of other things too. Let me for sure, but yeah, I think that was the main thing Dude, that was that was when everybody's been watching for the last, you know, number of years literal hundreds of billions of dollars go overseas um, and you know the intentional quote-unquote unintentional Destruction of America happening, you know over the last four years with You know the depletion of our oil reserves the stopped stopping of domestic energy production The inflation of the dollar the military equipment left over in Afghanistan uh, the aid going to Ukraine that the aid that was stolen from black lives matter movement for act blue I mean people have seen all this and when she gets up there and she says $750 I mean, I don't care who you like you're you're gonna get pissed off about that because at the end of the day We're neighbors we're American people and I think most people are coming back to that realization And I think a lot of what's happening now Is actually going to be really good for culture because People are realizing whoa we are on the same team We have been the whole time and these people have been trying to divide us and make us hate each other and make us pissed off at each other And uh, we've been wrong and getting mad at each other and I think there's a unifying that's happening right now Uh, that is very important for culture. Yeah Yeah, it's sad man It's sad and I'm also torn to because it's like you know, wow I think the efforts of the American citizens coming together uniting helping out. It's fucking awesome to see It's just you know, and like It shouldn't have to be that way. It shouldn't have to be that way right with the amount I'm fucking money that they still from us the amount of you know, I'm saying resources. We so quickly give to fucking other country Yeah, it shouldn't be the case. No, you know, but then I'm conflicted because it's like man We've like that to me proves internally. It's like we've put way too much trust in our government at all Of course, you know, that's why every single person that's there should be voted out uh, and replaced with American citizens who are of service to the American people You know, the country was founded upon the idea of For the people of the people for the people by the people and that's not what we have we have we have a country full of elitist politicians Who are operating for their own gain at the expense of all of us and uh, it doesn't matter how much they try to convince us that You know, we're the problem people are realizing that we are not the problem especially when they get their paychecks Their paychecks have half the money taken out and then they see that all the sudden All this money going overseas and they see all these politicians coming into the office worth nothing leaving worth hundreds of millions of dollars They're starting to put them You know the dots together and they're understanding that dude and and this is a big this is part of a bigger discussion that has to be understood It doesn't matter if Trump wins Okay, if we don't fix the culture on our own, you know American people have to fix themselves. They don't understand that you are the culture you are the example How you live is the perception of America that people will have your friends your neighbors your kids These people will look at you and they will say this is what being an American is about Whether you understand that that's happening or not and if we don't take Responsibility for ourselves and we don't start to live at a higher standard America cannot return to a higher standard if we are not fit if we are not healthy if we are not financially successful if we are not Organized and united America will not be any of those things and so we have to do that ourselves as individuals and I see far too many people That are crying about the state of America while being a shitty example of what it means to be an American And if that's going to be the way it is nothing is going to fix the problem Okay, so we have a culture problem that all of us have a hand in fixing That all of us have an obligation to fix that we are in control of every single day They want us to be fat. So we have to be fit. They want us to be sick So we have to be healthy They want us to consume all this data and live in a virtual world and we have to live in the real world They want us to be mega consumers of everything that they do information medication food everything and If we don't take control of the things that we control nothing is going to fix itself regardless of who's voted into office You can't just go through life being a substandard individual citizen of America and expect America to be great like that doesn't make sense like that's like saying Oh, I'm going to play for the University of Alabama. We're going to be great But we're not going to work out. We're not going to practice. We're not going to train We're just a part of the team and we're going to kick everybody's ass. Got the best coach. Yeah, that doesn't Fucking matter and until Americans all Americans black wide straight gay left right everybody gets on the same page It starts living at a higher standard themselves as individuals This isn't going to fix itself. It's just not okay. So everybody has a lot of Reflecting to do on what type of life you're actually living that represents who we are as citizens and what we represent as a culture and you know the Average male that they portray and commercials and on TV which is this fat middle-aged hot dog eating You know supplicating pussy male That's not going to get it done boys Like we got to get back to being fucking men being fit being strong making money Protecting our families standing up for what's right having courage using our voices You guys all these men out here have been Beat and conditioned into thinking they're irrelevant through through cultural phenomenons and weapons like feminism political correctness cancel culture The removal of competition from society by rewarding participation over merit all of these things have Newterd men so to speak culturally and we have to take that back and if we don't take it back Nothing's going to change in this country. We don't get permission to do the things that I'm saying we just do them We don't have to get approval from the media or from You know the liberals or the progressives or the communist or whatever to fuck you want to call them First of all, they're never going to give you a permission to do it Second of all you don't need their permission to do it and I hear all these guys saying shit like this Oh, Andy. I love what you do, but fuck up. They won't let me say this or they won't who won't let you Who won't let you oh you won't let you because you're a fucking pussy and that's the biggest problem we have in this country right now We have a lot of people who are doing um Nothing and we have a small amount of people who are doing a lot and until everybody does a lot nothing's going to change bro You guys better reach down in your pocket find your little balls and figure out what it means to stand to fuck up and be an American man Yeah, man guys jumping on this conversation Let's know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our third and final headline Um got a little new breaking uh Breaking news and good news Um, I thought this was interesting Check this out New cancer treatment protocol featuring horse dewormer I ever mech this Dog dewormer thin bin dola's all and men bin dola's all passes peer review marking potential breakthrough in therapy This is interesting sure is I think there was this dude There was this dude who has a podcast pretty big one too.

But yeah, anyways, Dr. William Mack is a nuclear medicine physician and researcher specializing in multiple medical fields, including cancer and one of the first doctors to warn about the danger of the COVID shot. Share this news and a post on Twitter. I'm you said breaking news. First in the world, I've ever met in Mimindolazol and Femindolazol protocol and cancer has been peer reviewed and published on September 19th, 2024. The future of cancer treatment starts now. My thanks to lead authors, Lyle's Bagley and Peric Martinez for their incredible inspired work. FLCCC's Dr. Paul Merrick for his extensive work on repurposed drugs and every co-author who worked hard to bring this paper to life. Here's the study. Look at all those guys. It's, well, you know what's interesting. It's a bunch of the same doctors that were, you know, fired or forced to resign for coming out. It's because I've remected and so cheap, dude, they made too good of a drug. It kills all this shit. Yeah. And it's widely available. And they try to hide it from you so they can continue to make trillions of dollars. Penies on the dollar, bro. And by the way, you know, update tomorrow. All these people were magically killed in car crashes. No shit, you know, no shit. But I mean, it's incredible. And they list out, you know, all of the prescriptions and dosages and everything. Now the FDA's response was interesting, okay? Because if you go to FDA, you know, you put anything about Ivermectic. Ah, look at that. Intravenous vitamin C, bro. Yeah. That's been, dude, do you know that that's been illegal in this country for like ever? They're not allowed to really prescribe that. And I think you can do, I think recently they've been able to do it. But for the treatment of cancer, it is shown to actually allegedly cure cancer and they won't allow you fucking do it. And I know a whole bunch of people, I know like five different people over the last 20 years who have gotten cancer went down and other countries got intravenous vitamin C. It cured their fucking cancer. Jeez. Yeah. It's vitamin C, dude. Yeah. Vitamin C and vitamin D, bro. And I'm like, but what do they do during COVID? They wanted everybody to stay home. You know what I'm saying? Just getting natural fucking vitamin D from the sun. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? But no, they wanted everybody to stay fucking home and say, dude, if you have a working brain, you should be able to see how COVID was designed to cause mass casualties intentionally. You know, when you look at the ticker that they put on the screen for two years straight, they wanted people to be sick. They wanted people to die. And by the way, they got richest fuck doing it. Yeah, man, it's crazy. It's crazy. Yeah, man. Now, according to the FDA, they're still saying that, you know, the FDA has not authorized or approved Ivermectin for use in preventing or treated COVID-19 and humans and animals. They still have this and it's interesting because I remember four years ago when they decided to put a tweet out, that tweet was taken down. You mean the tweet that has the horse on it that says, you're not a horse, you're not a cow. Seriously, y'all stop it. Yeah, that's we. Yeah. Yeah, you know why they had to take it down because they got into a lawsuit with those same doctors and they settled it and they had that was part of the settlement. And the fifth circuit court, their opinion read that quote, FDA is not a physician. It has authority to inform, announce and appraise, but not to endorse, denounce or advise. The doctors have plausibly alleged that FDA's posts fell on the wrong side of the line between telling about and telling to you. And, you know, but they still want to try to rule out Ivermectin, bro. Yeah, it doesn't work. But the same thing, it costs pennies on the first dollar horses. It's for horses. Yeah. It's for horses. Bro, like the shit, even the shit they did with Joe Rogan, man, like they fucking come in like when they took Rogan's picture, he's listening. You got Joe Rogan on TV, okay? Or on his fucking social, which is bigger than TV. And he says, hey guys, I'm doing pretty good. I took Ivermectin, I'm feeling good after a couple days, just trying to help people, bro. Right. Because he's a good dude. And these motherfuckers took his fucking face and made it yellow and said that he was a quatt podcaster, bro. Yeah. Tell people to fucking take horse to do armors. Get the fuck out of here. And the dude's trying to listen. There's a very clear delineation between the people who were trying to save lives and actually and people who were trying to cost more lives. And dude, it was crimes against humanity, dude. And there's no accountability for it. People aren't even calling for accountability anymore. It's like they forgot. Like they forgot what the fuck happened. I'll never forget that, dude. No. No, man. I'll never forget that. I'll never, ever, ever forget it. Dude, you had Justin Trudeau saying on TV, what are we going to do with these people who are danger to us while he's building camps? We got to decide if these people are going to be included in society. You have a show when the CDC, yeah, on fucking TV. Now she, the director, she was just a part of it on TV saying these people are a problem. We're going to have to take drastic, we're going to have to isolate them from society. They shouldn't be allowed to shop their groceries and this and that. And then she comes out a year afterwards and says, oh, I was wrong because she knows what she was a part of. And a lot of these rats are going to start jumping shit and blow in the whistle when Trump gets back in power if he does because I think Trump is going to fucking get involved in this. And it's going to be a sticky situation because he went along with the fucking vaccine shit. Yeah. Bro. That's still to me one of the most interesting people. I don't like it, dude. I fucking hate it. But it's like the thing is though, like just being a fair devil's advocate, man. Like we don't know the pressure that he had on him. You know what I'm saying? Well, he had all the pressure on him, bro. But also being a leader means that you fucking stand up when all the pressure is on you. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I would like to me. That's a lot of it. It was a loose, loose situation because had he not done that, they would have blamed him for all the shit that they were manufacturing or release something real. And remember, remember when they were counting these deaths, these are not deaths from COVID. These are deaths with COVID, all right? They turned up the cycle rate on the PCR test. They tested people post mortem, okay? The cycle rate, we had a Serrasky and Tapper on the show who talked about the cycle rate of the PCR test. The guy who invented the PCR test was magically unalived right before the pandemic happened. Why is that? They ran an exercise event 201 right before the pandemic happened. Why is that? They just, that's smart. They guess, do you not remember all the people who were saying Trump will not be the president? So confidently up until 2020 because they knew what they were going to do and they ran the play. And in that play, they had every single organization, the WHO, the CDC, the CDC, the NIH, the World Economic Forum, local doctors, regional doctors, all the pharma companies were all involved in this. Locked up. Yeah. And they said everything the same. And we're supposed to be trusting these people. Bro, they were counting people who were dead from suicides, who were dead from car accidents. They test these people post mortem with the cycle rate turned up on a PCR test. And when you turn the cycle rate up on a PCR test, it will get a false positive intentionally and they knew this. Okay. So they counted all those people as COVID deaths. All right. And then they pressured this dude into saying we got to do something. If he had said no, what would they have done? Right. And now he said yes. So he was a participant in their exercise. And so like dude, it was a loose, loose situation for him. But what I would like to see is him to fucking actually say, hey, this is what actually happened. But I don't think that's going to happen until he gets elected again because the topic is too sensitive. And I don't agree with that. I think he, I think two years ago, he should have came out and said they fucking did this and this and this and this. And the problem would be over by now. But it's still something, it bothers me, dude. I don't like it. Yeah. It definitely is a. It's unsettling, man. Yeah. It's unsettling. I was like, what's the point of what I'm saying here, dude, is that people don't remember like all the shit they did. And they still don't even understand what they did. Like they don't understand. I think that's intentional though, bro. Like, dude, when you're putting cases, quote, unquote, cases on the screen and you're using a turned up PCR test, every single person you test is going to be positive. They were sending tests out through the mail for free. They wanted to get as much testing as they could because it drove the number up, which created the sense of urgency and hysteria, which allowed them to manipulate society the way that they wanted to. And then they then came the vaccine. That's a whole other piece of the fucking pie. Yeah. Yeah, it's perfectly safe, dude. Everybody that took it is per there's there. Listen, I haven't talked to anybody who's taking it that isn't scared shitless personally. Yeah. Yeah, man, guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. It comes up at dumb as fuckers. We're bringing hell on there. We talk about it and get one of those two options. I'm a little rescue effort here. This headline reads 220 pound catfish rescued after getting stuck inside flooded train station. Damn. Okay. All right. The cat's cradle was a tight rail hub. Oh, it's a huge. It sounds like our our commenters. Rescueers. Those are the kind of catfish that my grandpa used to catch on the high river. There's a fucking huge bro. Like when I was like five years old, they were like bigger than me. Fuck. They were huge. Yeah. The ultimate catch and release experience after saving a monster mcconn river catfish that became trapped inside a flooded train station in Thailand. Quote. It was one of the biggest I have seen. Boonsong, Tangred told viral press of the dramatic rescue which occurred in Shanghai on October 6th. The northern Thai city had been pummeled by floods caused when the ping river overflowed its banks due to heavy seasonal rainfall, killing three and forcing dozens of citizens to move to shelters. Volunteers from the Uratak Song Dock Foundation. Oh, yeah. You've been putting in time on this book, bro. We're in route to evacuating stranded residents from submerged homes when they spotted the massive catfish stuck outside a ticket booth at the Serapi railway station, per Tangred. They said the water was up to their hips and they could not swim through obstructions. Here is a picture of the rescue efforts. And here's the picture of the rescue. Yeah. Now, now the catfish that he caught weren't that big, but they're big. That's a big catfish. I just have one question. What? You're telling me that these motherfuckers released that catfish? No, they fucking ate it. They ate it, dude. Come on, man. They eat it or they let it go. What do you think? I have no further thinking about dinner, bro. He's like fried catfish nuggets tonight instead of fried cat. You know what's one of the most popular Thai dishes, Andy? Spicy crispy catfish. Yeah. Well, dude, that's because it's great. Catfish is good. Yeah. Catfish is fucking good. I like the fillets better than that. Guys are like, man, we're having a party, bro. We're going to feast. Oh, yeah, we rescue you, catfish. Yeah. We rescue you. Let's take a picture before we grill them. Before you've never seen again. Yeah. He knows what's about to happen. He knows what's going on. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's fucking hungry, dude. Look at that smile. They ate the catfish. Oh, yeah. 100%. There's no doubt. There's no way that catfish made it out alive. Nope. There's no fucking chance, man. I think it's fucking catfish nuggets. It is spicy catfish. Yeah. Yeah, man. What we got on this, Andy? You know what? I mean, I don't know. They're probably. It's probably good. Probably was pretty good. I like catfish, man. Catfish is good. Bro, that one place, the one two for Emily's birthday. That one's good. Yeah. Juniper. Juniper. Yeah. That catfish dish. That was next level good. Some good food. Yeah, that's a great place. Yeah, I eat the catfish, too. Yeah, so I know they ate it. Look where we rescued. Yeah. Unless it's like some poisonous one or something. I mean, I think it looks good. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And I think their faces give it away. Bro, they told them so. I mean, that guy, the guy, the third from the left, that guy just smoked a big fatty. And he's like, fucking catfish nuggets, baby. Look at him, bro. He's not even hiding it. He's like, yeah, you got to stick with rescue in this. That's a big ass fish, though. Yeah. That's a big ass fucking fish. All right, so what were you giving this? I'll give it a thumbs up. Yeah, everybody's happy. Yeah. Same to fish. Yeah. And hats doing the Lord's work. Catfish nuggets. Guys, Andy, that's all I got, man. All right, guys. We'll see you later on in the week. Don't be a hoe. See you later. See you later.
