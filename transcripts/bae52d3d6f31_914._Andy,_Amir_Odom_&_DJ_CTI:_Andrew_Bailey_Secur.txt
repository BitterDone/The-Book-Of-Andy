Welcome to another fucking reality guys today We have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking internet and we got a mirror. Oh, hey, I'm here. What's up, dude? Are y'all good? How long's it been since you've been on the show two years really been two years been two years Been two years and you want to know something crazy a crazy story about two years ago? What you never really know what like someone's going through because two years ago Less than a week before I did this show was like the darkest moment of my life pretty much Because a few weeks like listen a week Essentially Essentially I had just left my corporate job of eight years Jolai friend at a start of company worked there for about a month and then I'm driving up from 38 back to Nashville And he calls me and I'm like what's up bro? How you doing? He's a hey only let you know shut down the company We don't have any money and your last check was two weeks ago Oh, man, and I was like what and went from making like eight to 10 to zero just like that overnight Then like two days later. I'm in here and then I leave here and I go start door-dashing But it was really Notivating being in here in that time because in that time of when shit hits the fan You can easily go into fight or flight mode. Yeah, you can either flight and like just do nothing with your life You can retreat you can be sad or you can fight against whatever's happening to you and go after it and being in space like this I mean shit that that other building was just dirt was it was yeah, yeah, it was just dirt and now there's people in it Yeah, and the last time I was sitting here Unemployed like in my brain is figuring out what the fuck am I about to do and then now I have employees Yeah, and I have over 650 thousand subs on YouTube bro, and it's just crazy how much life can change in two years at that at the age of 29 Just now living my dream life and is this great bro a lot has changed since last month here.

Here's the truth and jokes aside all right Most people fold then yeah, most people fold and people who win they let that pressure push them into immediate action dude and You know in those in those times man. That's when we find out what we're really about. Yeah, you know So you have to have no choice and I've been through a lot we talked about previously before I've been I've seen the car get you know repot Yeah, homeless been sent to conversion therapy the whole all the night Yeah, and in that time is like They say you to conversion therapy to make you straight. Yeah, are you fucking serious? What was that like? It was annoying so basically fucking weird basically you like you like vagina It's like show porn like man. I was what is that so essentially this is like a little weird kind of conversion therapy I don't know how all over you I was 14. It's a freshman year of high school Jesus and so my best friend at the time She's like it was a like my status for to be honest and I liked her status and she went my Facebook wall And it was like a mirror my gay best friend and I love you so much. Oh fuck pull it out of me to the whole family I'm sitting at the lunch table. I get three text messages from my mom like oh, you're not gay like Yada Yada's going off right and my dad's not in the picture. I'm obviously I'm black and gay so he was never Never is the truth never was around to begin with And so for like three days my mom would just cook dinner and then go to her room and I'll get my plate And then after that for two weeks. I was meeting with the pastor three days a week And then every sermon was directed at me Like I'll be sitting in the pew he's like staring down in me like reading scriptures about being gay and stuff And then two weeks after that was with the youth leader who I switches his day was gay I swear he was gonna make the same mistake I made That's essentially what you know, it's a youth leader That's what it felt like and then I did two weeks. I'm actually going to see him tomorrow I did two weeks in my pop-as-farm out in the middle of Missouri To do straight things that had no male figure in my life bail some hay and quite I brought the day I received broke back mountain Thank you Thanks Still gay Yeah, but it was crazy my mom taught me growing up straight things Yeah, my mom taught me growing up that being gay was like so bad And she told me that every man the planet has a bubble of AIDS and they booed you whole And that when you have sex it pops and then they both get AIDS and die That's what she taught me wait what very traumatized that you have a bubble in your booty hole that has the AIDS in it So we all have a so don't pop the AIDS exactly So basically it went from you're not gay To do some straight shit to if you stay gay you're gonna die. Yeah, pretty much. Well, that's nice. Okay, I'll be well You're still here. Yeah, I made it out the trenches Out the fucking trenches. Are we still here and still queer?

We're a Missouri We've been the Missouri. I've been like I don't know what it is. I feel been like really proud to be in a Missouri and lately Um, yeah, I have yeah Missouri's great What Nothing Newer, Missouri and I mean, I know you don't live here, but like I did grow up here a lot I came down here every summer growing up. All right, but still coming here. It's very interesting Yeah, no, we got good people here, dude. We're good people are very good. Do listen are people having PTSD from your conversion therapy. Yeah I that's what it's it's hard to conversion therapy and Jennings That's what I'm tied to a Missouri That's understandable Well, we got to talk about Our amazing attorney general real quick land down some fucking law. We got the Missouri a g-Ajr Bailey secures felony indictment Again, St. Louis County executive sand page for stealing by deceit and election fraud. Uh-oh He's in trouble. Yeah, he's in fucking trouble To be sand page. Yeah does well. I mean it would suck to be him regardless because he's just sucks He sucks. He loves me. Yeah, he does I'm sure oh yeah, but uh, Missouri attorney general Andrew Bailey announced that a grand jury has issued a felony indictment against democratic county executive sand page Which is basically like our mayor if you will for the county Um, Missouri a g Now it's on Wednesday that a grand jury returned a true bill against page accusing him of abusing taxpayer dollars and deceiving his own county Quote I conducted this investigation into sand pages the legit misuse of public funds because the people of st. Louis county Deserve accountability not corruption said attorney general Bailey he continued Public officials must follow the law and my office will in will work to ensure that they always do so According to the indictment he faces two class for election offenses Um, uh for unlawfully using public funds to oppose a ballot measure during the 2025 election cycle Um, the indictment states that page authorized a flyer and a postcard campaign with county money between February and March or 2025 In an effort to influence public opinion and defeat a ballot initiative Um, he also has one count of felony theft and $25,000 and more Um, prosecutors alleged page misappropriated over $25,000 and postage under false pretenses by misleading county officials Into thinking the expenditure was lawful I mean, he also has another uh, count of felony theft for 750 or more Um, where he allegedly stole at least $750 in county funds through deceitful meanings. So through all of this If he's convicted he's he's facing about 13 years Um, in prison um and finds reaching $24,000 now I think he should do be doing a lot more um, are we gonna talk about what else he did. Yeah, I mean He uh during the covid dude. That's probably the worst I mean, yeah, he was the he was one of the worst if he works executives slash leaders mayors in the entire country When it came to covid. Yeah, he literally defied a quarter order multiple times multiple times when it came down to like the mass mandate. Oh bro. He it was it was straight up Power hungry bullet. It was the like California It was exactly the same he he did Almost exactly what uh Uh, what was it? Garcetti or whatever yeah, GarÃ§on. Yeah, I think fucking guys naming L.A. The old guy's gone. I think it was something like that No, that's fucking so anyway. He would just do what L.A. did every single time. Yeah, and It was extremely extremely harsh and oppressive and threatening and this dude was basically threatening everybody in the city with going out of business and shutting their businesses down and all this shit and uh And then he gets reelected which We all thought was really weird. Yeah, so because nobody like everybody fucking hates him Yeah, and then he didn't even any piled on you know and some other things about me too personally So but yeah, he's a fucking shit bag. Fuck this guy now again, you know and rebellion is a is a By the book real deal patriot american and um I haven't even spoke to him about this, but uh, I hope that the Fucking destroys this guy. I hope so that guy that guy is responsible for a lot of local businesses here does gone gone Yeah, families ruined Because he wanted to play the you know the big dog during covid, you know i'm saying That's disgusting man. Um now speaking On politicians needing accountability. Uh, there is a bombshell. That's just got dropped today You guys see this Hillary Clinton approved play and hatched by campaign aid to smear Trump with Russia collusion declassified docs We knew that to happen. Yeah, but wasn't this already put out in the news years ago I think the problem is is that we don't we have clips of us covering this yeah Well, we all we all we alluded to it like we all felt that this was what was going on But like you know that was that that's the thing it's like we did There was no like they call it smoking gun like there were we didn't we didn't have the documents that fucking laid it all out We didn't have the money trails We just knew that hey that looks fucked up and most likely she's fucked up so you know we alluded to it for sure Um, but now we got the hard evidence, bro. It's all coming out and I think the craziest piece On this a new person again We alluded to this, but it's also confirmed now that George Soros was tied into all of this Oh, I wonder how like It makes him wonder if the left is even reporting on this at all. Yeah, because they talk all these claims about Oh Republicans and the right all they do is lie all they do is steal all they do is cheat nonstop they shove it in our faces, but then It only comes out that they've been doing this the whole time locally and federally and Are they gonna be talking about this a lot? Are they gonna be well? I think I think it comes down to the to everybody else forcing accountability You know what I mean like I mean bro how many videos and commentaries have you done on things like this valid me too, you know And eventually we we always our tone always is is well who's gonna do something are they gonna do anything? We are they like yes, we need to do some shit and um I mean it's gonna be interesting, but I think it's important for all of us, you know you me all of us listening To not let off the gas For accountability fails. Yeah, that's that's the biggest piece and like I think that is the important thing because now more and more people are talking about it Like I mean and I got some of her her her comments, but like right now even on Twitter Um, a rest Hilary that's trending that's a good and it's been floating between the top spot and number two right now um, you know, but but how sorrows is tied into this is that apparently when The there was a hack back in 2016 that released all the emails right and those emails got like leaked on wiki leaks Right in the from wiki leaks it kind of went went out everywhere and then they trapped this whole campaign and it just all disappeared somehow Right banished there's over 30,000 emails right and so like in specifically we're gonna focus in on on literally one of two of them Because quote two of the apparently hacked emails appear to have originated from the open society foundations the appendix stakes noting that the purported author of these emails was Leonard Bernardo who was the regional director for eurasia at the open society foundations All right And so there's two emails here Um, and then these are being sent uh, these are communications between open societies foundation the George sorrows people Or uh going to Hilary Clinton's campaign staff okay. Yeah, how stupid are you to email something like this? Yeah, but they thought the emails were gone. They you know, I'm saying like they didn't think they had to worry about it bro So let's read this first email. We'll read the important pieces here, but this is email again from Leonard Bernardo Okay, going to the Hilary Clinton campaign HRC approved Julia's idea about Trump and Russian hackers hampering us elections that should distract people from her own missing email especially if the affair goes to the Olympic level The point is making the Russia Russian play a US domestic issue say something like a critical infrastructure threat for the election to fill Minnescence both POTUS and VPOTUS have acknowledged the fact the Intel committee Community with speed up searching for evidence that is regrettably still unavailable However, insinuating um, insinuating that they would find the evidence after they made the accusation after they already said like they know it doesn't exist Right they invented the accusation and then they would find the evidence. Yeah And so then by the way, that's what they do to everybody else In the in listen to this piece in the absence of direct evidence crowd strike and threat connect will supply the media and GRU will hopefully carry on to give more facts Okay, then in the follow-up email, okay I'm sorry in the previous email The media analysis on the Democrat National Committee hacking appears solid This is an important story because it would be the first time that we know of that a state deliberately uses the infiltration and publication of data To interfere in the US election Julie says it will be a long-term affair to demonize Putin and Trump Now it is good for a post convention bounce Later the FBI will put more oil into the fire That is fucking trees and dude This is treason and the drive me up a fucking wall because yeah Often did we hear about Jan 6th how often do we hear about all the covid stuff all the fake news? Is it buying a laptop? We're all that to be true And all of that to just be what is what it is, but then we see stuff like this And black right from them bro. Bro think about this if they're willing to manufacture This to deep and their own work. Julie says it will be a long-term affair to demonize Putin and Trump Later the FBI will put more oil onto the fire. Well you you met you January 6th what happened during January 6? Oh 12,000 hours of footage don't exist anymore What happened what happened during that time? Oh allegedly All kinds of bad actors who were part of three letter agencies Actually instigated and open the doors for people to walk through into the capital Okay, we could go on and on and on about all of this, but dude This is disrupted the country for nearly 10 years And if they're willing to manufacture a narrative out of the blue What are they not willing to do what else are they currently doing? Yes, they're willing to do anything anything To take power and keep power and dude. This is this is I mean, I love that this is actually coming out I mean, how do you combat that you can't that's treason dude What's your justification here? Listen dude an example has to be made and it ain't prison They didn't prison. Yeah, now in the time since he lose the Julie So Julie was on the campaign for Hillary Clinton? Can that be her daughter or no, no, I wouldn't have thought it was Chelsea. Yeah, Chelsea. Yeah, Julia Julie was like Campaign manager, but okay like she was fucking high up on the strategy play of it and then apparently allegedly it was her entire plan To do all of this well, she belongs in the woodchipper right there with her show Hillary dude, you know, I mean you got had to get approved You know, I'm not about just run a play. I got to run about you. Yeah, I think we can do this. Yeah, all right Fucking do it. Yeah, you know, I'm saying but if we get caught we're both going in. Yeah, right. Yeah, right Everyone to that fact, you know, and then that's what you know this bigger picture of why even Obama keeps getting brought up into this Because Hillary was not in any position to you know, make orders to the FBI or anything like that Officially that had to come from somebody You know, I'm saying somebody had to give the FBI. FBI will pour oil on to it Who's giving them that direction? And that's how you bring Obama into this because Operation crossfire hurricane that was the whole fucking thing behind all of it Yeah, you know, I'm saying so like it's it's it's this confirmation of Complete business undermining all of the entire country by a very small group of corrupt people who have decided that The country no longer belongs to you. Yeah, or I the people who actually Have jobs and create jobs and pay taxes It belongs to them and they rule over us and this is what I always say like you if you pay attention to Hillary Clinton And people laugh when I say this, but it's true. Look how she dresses, bro She dresses like she's a fucking emperor. Yeah, you know what I'm saying like these people do not Represet us in any way shape or form and There has to be accountability and it has to be harsh. Mm-hmm Traditionally over the course of humanity treason is met with very public very painful executions For the reason of discouraging treason in the future and this has to be the way It has to be the way. No, it cannot be she goes to prison. It cannot be You know anything other than a statement made and how this is handled And I really really really hope that I think the people understand that yeah I think comes of this because it's not right especially that they have this big As we see control on public relations and how they appear to the public Hillary Obama all these people George Shorty look like the most peaceful people They get it all the money and they do all these great things But they are some of the most corrupt not some of the already most corrupt people on this planet. Yeah Well, it's also already been you know kind of exposed to but like Soros. He's not using his money That just came out. I mean that's all money. Yeah, that came out with the doge shit like none of the the money that was you that that was you know funnel By the Soros foundation open society that wasn't his personal money. He's not this philanthropist That was that was taxpayer dollars like that's what was uncovered with doge He was using our money to fund the Soros fund to prosecute to fund the the BLM riots the fund so literally all of the divisiveness all of the destruction They used our money to do it Our money nothing raging. Yeah, you know, and what does Hillary Clinton because there hasn't been a public statement by her by the way at the time of the recording But she did turn off her comments on Twitter So now only accounts that uh That she follows Can reply to post because I mean obviously she would be getting destroyed or up right now destroyed But yeah, so she hasn't released anything. We made it any official story. I bet they're freaking the fuck out Oh, yeah, well, and that's the whole thing because also you're gonna start see it dude. Here's what you're gonna see Canaries, huh canaries fucking singing You're gonna see that and I bet you're gonna see some suicides. I bet you're gonna see a couple of these people kill themselves And a lot of people missing yeah And that I mean I mean the people who were being accused. Okay, kill themselves. I think people don't deal with it Yeah, that's right. They're already set up a lot of them to be in those positions too, but I mean that's the other interesting thing It's like All right, this is cool. What else is happening though? You know, I'm saying because like Epstein stuff So nobody's still talking about that like I saw a video come out like now they have new release video that showed Um some figure going up to Epstein sale. You see that Epstein sell. Yeah. Oh, that the one minute wasn't missing I didn't see no this was an additional clip and I guess it like it was I don't know if you know I didn't see it Yeah, it came out like and like they have to zoom in on it, but you see like a little figure where orange No presumably it jumps you to something like that going up to the only stairs that go up to his sale. Yeah, I mean There's still a lot of stuff happening here man. I don't I don't know what the play is It's very interesting I just really hope something comes of it. I don't want this to go. We got a demanded slipping by the buy side I yeah, we can talk about this we're making videos on this, but I want actual like responsibility for yeah Oh dude, get away with this and mirror if they don't have it There will be no trust in the system ever for anyone people already barely trusted as it is. Yeah, I think it's gone. I think to establish some sort of I would say even a bridge not to a reestablished trust, but even an opportunity For the government to be trusted again in good faith There has to be real accountability and it has to be real it has to be real and like dude this woman has marched around with her smug arrogant Fucking bullshit for the last decade like she's untouchable and Yeah, I mean we listen I just don't understand I guess like I have a hard time relating to You can look out on this country and all the people and the people that are You know of all different You know backgrounds and they come from different places and they're working and they're paying taxes and To just think that like your Shit is more important than the job that you were elected to do ultimately right like We need selfless leadership in that in a position like that, you know and Clearly the government has become a self-serving entity, you know people don't go To serve in our government anymore To make People's lives better they go there so that they can get in on the gravy train and milk the system and make their lives Yeah, and be immune from any accountability for anything get money and just power trip Yeah, that's right the older I get 29 right now the older I get them are realized that just because someone's older than you doesn't mean they're smarter or they're more Edge could they're more qualified for a role yeah, it's like after it seems like after 25 is it the equal playing field of people We're actively changing their lives for the better people who are stagnant and then people who are just very selfish and self-serving And there's a lot of people in office right now. They're just self-serving Don't give no crap at all about anyone else in this country, but themselves in their family Would do anything to cash or check or you have some type of power to mandate this role or do this or that and it blows my mind how They can like look out at everybody in this country And say oh, I love you guys like yay dude. That's what you guys and it's so It's like a movie. It's like a scary movie how someone can be that Miss guiding and deceitful do you just in front of our faces? Do you think that people are buying it anymore? No, I don't either People are rising up and I think I mean we're testaments of that with what we do online, but People are waking especially have to cover because COVID was so personal I think it has to get personal for someone to care. Oh, yeah, I mean that's a criminal the doorstep Yeah, it's it reminds me of a little bit like a school shootings, you know There's kids getting shot every day in Chicago But the second the school gets shot at it's like oh my gosh like what's going on? And I think it COVID was so personal that it woke a lot of people up to the BS in the lies and I'm just hoping this trend stays up where more people are saying enough is enough. Yeah, but with The amount of votes Kamala got last time. I was still but did she I mean hell that what stuff like this right exactly makes you question everything I want some nick alive to chess q action. I do too. That's what I want. I want some fucking blood and guts, bro That's what I want that is what I want And I'm not scared to say it and you know what? It's not it's not illegal To say that a revolution Is required to restore power in this country that is protected speech and these people hopefully it's not required Because our elected officials right now will do what they're supposed to do right But if they don't that is going to be what you want to say is like you know Andrew Bailey again like bro Phenomenal patriot great dude. We don't have enough of it. Yeah, we need fucking we need about 20 more Andrew Bailey strategically across this country All in the world. I believe he wasn't picked as the AG because he's non-corruptible. I think he was gonna make too much fucker Yeah, I think he would have I think he would have done all the things That were promised and when he was told not to do them he would have done them anyway And that's why he wasn't picked as AG. Yeah, because it's exactly who we need as AG uncontrollable in this. Yes The people we really need the most barely good the power that we need them to have that's right And that's why it's a responsibility for good people to seek power Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's real man Yeah, we we all look as good people you know look. I'm not saying I'm the best fucking dude. I'm saying I'm not a fucking crazy tyrant yet Yeah, but what I'm saying is is good people look at good people have been trained to see the seeking of power as a negative thing And if you train good people to believe that being poor is a positive quality of a of a of a great life, you know, stay humble stay meek, okay, they're easy to control If you convince people that seeking power is a negative thing Then what do you end up with you end up with all the good people saying I don't want power because it's bad and who gets it All the bad people that's right And so we the good people have to realize that a lot of what we've been taught Is to our own demise and to their benefit. There's nothing wrong with making a lot of money There's nothing wrong with Being successful these are things that provide for other people and You can really only stay understand that if you are a successful person, but they tell everybody If you seek those things, you're a bad person And the same thing goes with power If you're power hungry, it's your ego no actually Good people should seek power. We have an obligation to seek power so that bad people don't have it So that's how it used to be bro. That's how it used to be bro Like our country was found on the idea that like If you see a problem You go fix it and then once the problems fixed you can go back to doing your shit You know, I'm saying like our senators and our congressman, bro. They used to be farmers, bro They had farms and shit to run and they see a problem that was coming down the stream that was gonna affect them or their neighbors Hey, I'm gonna go do this. I'm gonna serve my two year for your term. I'm coming back to my farm. Yeah, once I fix it Very caring. Yeah, it makes me wonder how many nonprofits actually like Complete their mission statement and then fall away. Oh, bro. I mean how many nonprofits out there like all right We're here for this goal go complete it now. Oh, it's all most of them relies most of them have less than five percent of their actual money To the cause that they advertise and that's a way for these rich people so dude when people get really rich They start a foundation right the forcella foundation Donate to the forcella foundation. We're gonna do all these crazy things that are good And then people start giving me money and then I put my dad and my mom and my brothers and my sister and everybody on the Fucking payroll They don't make a bunch of money and then we go out and do one little thing of that Google we did and that's the game and it's all tax-free And this is a this is why you should always like really dig into Where you Donate your money if you want to do good things or Even better do it yourself. I'm not saying because the truth of it is whether you donate to them or not your tax That was definitely going to those. Yeah, well, and that's the other thing these tech these companies get into this game I want to say companies, but charities nonprofits get into this game of acquiring Like the Hillary Clinton foundation or the Clinton foundation where they get all kinds of money from our government Which is our tax dollars? So our tax dollars go to their foundation and then their foundation doesn't pay tax which means they can write off Jets they can write off lifestyle they can choose. Yeah, so nothing that they do all that's just justifiable Like I want to fucking a g650. I fucking start a foundation. I say we're gonna This is what they did we're gonna build houses in Haiti and Give me a bunch of money the government gives them money they buy the jet Oh the foundation only has x amount of dollars left we could build a hut over there for those guys And then they live it's it's all theft it's organized tax-free legal theft and most nonprofits Run by people like this are that way and this game is you can see it everywhere in our government It's just corrupted a giant circle of just kick back after kick back corrupt person after corrupt person But it's because of what you're saying how there there isn't enough of good people Actually going in and making change, you know, because they're just so discouraged from doing so well And they discourage you on purpose. Yeah, that's the other thing too like I've also learned over the last couple of years Bro like it doesn't take much to buy somebody. No, you know what I'm saying like it like it's different for every level Right, but it doesn't take much bro like I mean you look at people like Cory Bush who I'm gonna be the person to go In a fix all of this and then they give her 60 grand and a fucking, you know book deal Where she now you know, she gets her boyfriend that's why they get these people, bro because they pull these people out of the street If you give someone out of the street 60 grand it's more fucking money than ever had their life, bro so like when you someone gives you regardless of where level you're at more money than you've ever had that's that's And by the way, these people are dumb Okay, like aOC's a dumb mother fucker. Yeah, all right, but they came to her and they said hey, we'll make you somebody and we'll do this and we'll do that Yeah, and now she's somebody. Yeah, okay, like that's that she's gonna do whatever they say Yeah, well conversely like okay, like let's say you are a good person, right? And you do want to make some change Well, you gotta get on one of these special committees, right? Like you got it You know, you want to be on the ways and means committee or the judiciary committee so you can really like affect some change with those seats costs Hundreds of thousands of yeah, you're your donors pay for them, right? Okay, cool. So like I'm a big old guy Okay, well, I'm gonna pay for your seat, but when it comes down that you got to make these decisions on here I need loads of my mind that they don't even the thing that happened. Oh, no bro if people knew how it actually works Like sick people would fucking if people knew if they if people truly understand How the money is stolen from us and how the laws are Created and how votes Are decided there'd be a revel there would have been a revolution 30 fucking years ago. Yeah, like it's this the elute We live in an illusion. It is not We it is not what they tell us when we're going through grade school about you know This is the land of opportunity and everybody has a chance in this mess in this Yes, there is some truth to that and there would be a lot more truth to that if our government action was set up the way that it's supposed to be set up, but it's not no It's now it's just a money fucking theft Scheme That is for them and it's at our expense. Yeah And until it's cleaned up new we won't see the country Rise to the level that it should be right the funds don't make it where it's supposed to go Yeah, you know every four years the democrats every two years the democrats go into the inner city and they say Look what the white dudes did to your city the white dudes didn't do shit to your city Actually, though the white dudes don't go down there because they're afraid. Okay, uh Here's the problem the people that you vote for who say We're gonna get all this progress Steal the money they steal the money and you don't get shit and until we clean that up and people understand That Truly like dude, this is why the division is such a fucking obvious play If if black people and white people and Mexican people and everybody hates each other there's no conversation Right, it's like covid remember like when covid it was like We're closing down all the restaurants. We're closing down all the bars Why are the bars and restaurants closed? Oh because the seeds of revolution are sewn in taverns all right no If they create blocks for communities to not be able to communicate effectively Then nobody can ever have the conversation of hey man I think they're fucking us. I think you know saying us too. Yeah exactly Take it as effort don't even invite your family over to things given. Yeah, that's right. Let's go to Walmart Yeah, don't worry about the mom and pop shop. Yeah, stay six feet away from everybody. That's right. You're a little circle dude It's insane. That's right. I mean that was all for communication That was all for communication to To create so much angst and frustration and anger amongst even the family that we could not communicate because remember how high the the The anger was like you were either mask or you were no mask grandma killer either Yeah, and by the way They don't want people having conversations about the truth. Right. They don't want you to that's what I've never been That shadow band and that censored in 2020 in my entire life. Yeah, we have let that money locked away in meta because I was racist and homophobic I mean There's some here sometimes but The still is just insane is that even happened and We're seeing all this now.

How you just go on there and talk sometimes I'm being honest You just talk like you're talking to a friend you just beek. Yeah Bro the whole thing here the whole thing is is that they had a power control structure That was so easy for them for the last Hundred years and then all of a sudden this new technology came out which ironically they invented they gave it to us They gave it to us which is the best part of it And now we have social media and instant connectivity that they developed the fucking three letter agencies And they thought they were going to use it to control everybody They thought they were going to be able to control and then you know like we're going to have Millions of fake accounts and we're gonna you know thumbs up the shit that we like and we're gonna censor the shit that is crazy And they thought that they were going to use all of these tools to curtail and curve the narrative And it's blown up and they're fucking faces and I love it.

That's that's uh Talk about this. This is making some rounds In virility right now Sydney, sweetie. Oh dear. Oh, yeah American Eagle Slammed as Nazi propaganda. Oh, man by crazed woke mob of jeans jeans pun Uh, so leftist tic-toc is in full pitch fork and torch mode after a new ad for man All seven of them. Yeah featuring actress Sydney, sweetie Used to play on words with some claiming it's full on Nazi propaganda So the ad features we need who's 27 cloud in the pair of the brands jeans and a denim jacket talking about her jeans jeans um, I got the clips check them out jeans are passed down from parents to offspring often determining traits like her color personality And even I color My jeans are blue Sydney, sweetie has great jeans Nazi Nazi 99 99 99 That's the only German word you know Yeah, yeah, the other one you could say don't get saying nine Yeah, and there's more I mean there was a couple of ads. I mean it's a whole campaign. This is another one check this out With a German shepherd It really does have a German shop. All right, I'm already a little too much there That might be too much I don't even think about the German shopper, but whatever dude That's pretty good. It's fucking hilarious, but the people of piss yeah Well, they're ugly this is They're mad she's hot and it's those stupid bro. What is being hot? Yeah, you have you look good You have a great jeans listen these people are mad their day and the sun is over their mad they can't fit in those jeans Hello, I know how that feels bro. I get it. I'd be pissed too. I think they're mad that no one gives a fuck about their stupid shit anymore Yeah, no, it's great. I said it a year. I said you're gonna wine and wine and wine and eventually people are gonna be like fuck you And here we are. Well, here's the look at her. Yeah, her jeans are blue too. I think her jeans are big blue They might be a little bigger jeans But they're blue why she upset. Yeah, why you upset like a blonde hair blue-eyed white woman is talking about her good jeans Yes, cuz they are good What the fuck is wrong with saying that and what have we endured the last 10 years a black boy magic black girl magic Support black on businesses. This is all like cater to black jeans Glitter like the genetics. It's all you've been doing this whole entire time bro And you're mad that someone white that looks good is getting some attention and your automatically saying oh This is crazy though. It's not to propaganda. What the hell have we been seeing these past few years We make up 13% of the population and we're making up over 50% of all the advertisement. It's making me racist now. I'm looking Why there's so many blacks fuck these niggas? I Know when I'm driving out of my grocery store. Thank you when I'm driving down to interstate I see a black person on a billboard I'm like why you Did you even earn that because we're constantly giving a hand down to everybody? That's a valid point right there. Okay. All you said was valid because the truth of the matter is this Why people have never been able to say I'm proud to be white never by the way I don't even give a fuck about being proud to be white because I've never had the ability to say it So my identity has never been in I'm white like it's just like I'm a I'm a fucking Andy, you know what I'm saying like and ironically I don't even want that. I don't think that's healthy. I think that In America at least, you know, yes, you could be proud of who you are But it shouldn't be your number one thing that you identify yourself with no, you know, so weird because my answers out there Slave in a way getting whipped nonstop getting bushels a cotton for mass and making pants a hair here to go running All for us in 2025 now to filter businesses by the color To just be promoting black people nonstop for literally nothing Well, notice that most of the people mad aren't even black. No They're racist. Yeah, they're white people who are racist and feel guilty about it. Yes. Yeah, it's literally racism Yeah, well, I haven't seen hardly any black I see the couple but like they were like the pink hair black people They were like them. They're are they them, you know, I'm saying but like I've not seen any real like People black or white be like yeah, this fucked up. I see a lot of them make a fun of these people. Yeah for sure I mean, here's the other thing. Look bro, listen You're fucking ugly you're fucking jealous. You don't know if you're a boy or a girl you got a fucking trans flag in the back you got a coffin like you're weird Okay, and you take pride in being weird So why the fuck do you even care that she looks hot that you you you're the one that says I love who I am I know who I am. I'm a day them. I'm a this. I'm a that here's the truth You're starved for fucking acceptance and attention and now your ridiculous way of getting the acceptance acceptance and attention has Run its course with society because we're all tired of pretending that you guys are beautiful And that you're fucking smart and that you're successful and that you're dude listen You're a bunch of weird motherfuckers. That's the fucking bottom line and society is done celebrating weirdness for the sake of weirdness I don't care how you live. I don't care what you want to do I don't care if you want to cut off your own dick if you're old enough to do it. Fuck him do it I don't care. I don't care, but you were not going to convince me that because Somebody who is white and looks sexy and by the way, I think many years ago I said that the advertisements were gonna get back to this. Okay, I think we could probably find that clip. Yep I said it many of times Been telling you know if you're not pro-America bro, you're gonna get your ass fucking cancel Yeah, and you're seeing it right now, but get won't go broke shit. It's real. It's real shit It's ten times more powerful than the cancel culture of two years ago that they had So you business owners better think a really long and hard about your stances because what we have here is a bunch of companies making policy around allowed my Minority And then the majority saying oh, what fuck you and we still have these people who run these companies who are Terrified to fucking like to speak up and be a part of a fucking pro-freedom movement It's like they're being held hostage like bro Not listening you're at a point now where you're missing a huge opportunity Yeah, because the pendulum swung and like the companies that have done it because now dude people are bitter towards the companies that have rode the fence Yeah, I don't tell you this the amount of messages I get in a day They're like brawl never fucking shop anywhere else or innumerable. It's the most popular message I fucking get And it's because of the shit that we stand for you know why you nobody will care about your company because you rode the fence You rode the fence before you rode the fence now you rode the fence during the biggest opportunity of our lifetime to stand for something to Fucking matters because all you care about is money and it's become very clear to people consumers are very smart And they're gonna spend their money with pro-freedom pro-America companies It's already happened now that we're getting back to common sense where you know, you could say oh well there are Beauty standards and they aren't 400 fucking pounds And you know what 400 pounds on the on the cover of a magazine it says healthy We know better. Yeah, right. We know better bro. Right. So like Fuck off. Yeah, here's a good thing though Because it didn't just stop with I'm sure these people are getting destroyed. Oh yeah, they are. Yeah, they absolutely are But it didn't just stop with American Eagle. There's a lot of companies jumping in on this train right now Let's get our next one in here. We got Duncan Duncan is in the in the conversation Left is melting down over Duncan's latest genetics ads And now this game just days after the American Eagle The donut company is the latest to find itself in the liberal firing line Of trash can lids and pool noodles after dropping its new commercial featuring the summer I turned pretty star Gavin Kasselingo Kass. Yep Let's check this out. Yep. Yeah, look. I didn't have to be the king of summer. It just kind of happened This tan genetics Just got my color analysis back.

That's what that fucking ad looks like. How are they mad that they put a gay guy in an ad? Is he gay? I know. I don't know Well fucker looks you got gay. Are is he gay? He's gay that mere thought he was gay the ad was gay. Yeah, that's super gay The ad I didn't want to say it. Oh, yeah, my golden I didn't want to say straight up.

Here's the thing Okay, I'll be honest. I miss it. I missed that Huh, I missed that I want I want I want certainly isn't Nazi. Yeah, it's not Nazi. No, how is putting a guy? How is putting a gay kid? Nazi Fucking Nazi. I'm just saying if I was doing that I wouldn't be my move I mean I was sharing my shepherds and Fuck it's was to get shit, you know, Kanye You know thought about this early we've been a great Because the liberals are some mad at this ad, but what if American Eagles campaign was really to focus on how anybody can look good in their jeans and their jeans What if it didn't stop it sitting what if it was maybe how do we know that that's not the next commercial? Yeah, right What if it was a zendaya next or a Lizzo next or just a whole campaign? I hope it's not Lizzo Anybody can look good in their jeans and their skin in their jeans Dude yes, you don't even know if that's that might be the campaign. Yeah Here's the thing Who knows and who gives a fuck right like I don't care. Yeah, I think it's brilliant because we're all talking about it Where's the other well we got one more company and by the way Lizzo is full of shit Okay, because Lizzo lost all that way that's right. Right. She went out talking about all that, you know I'm happy with and by the way remember I said bro. I used to be 350 fucking pounds. I know they're lying Okay, and you could say how I feel so good in my skin and all this you're lying It's not comfortable to be that fact society's not built for that when they start asking you for seatbelt extenders And you can't find clothes that fit and you're the size of a fucking house and you're sweating while you're you know Standing rushing your yes, like it's not healthy. It's not fun And Lizzo went around for years saying body positivity look And now she lost all the weight which by the way, I'm glad she did Good for her, but you're full of shit and you were full of shit then and your price still for sale now Well, here's the thing so it didn't stop it Duncan.

This is how marketing's done now. Mm-hmm like No, I want to I want to bring this up because I think we need to show what what marketing looks like from the left And how fucked up they actually are. Yeah, I have this clip that that's been going around It's a it's a WMBA is nice to see some white people and some advertisements. Thank you. Yeah I'm tired of the black. I mean look man. I you know, it's excessive. I'm not saying I'm listen Here's the thing for the last six year five year six years You have legitimately not seen a complete white family in an ad. Mm-hmm. Okay. You haven't you know Generally speaking What do you see it's mixed or always is it always is and it's like bro Not that there's anything wrong with the mixed family. I don't give a fuck but like most families aren't know You know, I'm saying so like when we you know, it's nice to see Society kind of going back to the shit that always was like good to look at people in ads like I Girls fucking selling shit sex sells that's real shit. That's real shit. Okay, so I don't know. I'm kind of happy about it Yeah, well, let's see the left's attempt at marketing and how that works for them. So this was a gay to rad ad Okay, have you guys seen this yet? No So it's a billboard With all the WMBA players is a letter cook Well, so listen to this Yeah, she could whatever she wants to meet love for pork steak ribatitis at cornbread be good Really anything Bro, they didn't think that would through dude Oh Land her cook man, bro, you know what happened there and what happened there was it was so fucking obviously offensive that nobody in the office wanted to point it out They couldn't even point it out because they would have went to fucking HR bro like dude if you're sick That's how politically correct the office has got for a while and the big corporate offices or like that That was so bro nobody missed that. No, just nobody wanted to say anything Yeah, oh you put that out. They're gonna say getting the kitchen What do you think about women? I'm reporting to HR right like that's the whole thing That's actually that's really believable. Oh no, it is I've listened. I've been in a gazillion meetings. I promise you That's what happened because we have a very loose culture and sometimes people don't want to point out obvious shit like that So like in a think of like in a stiff culture like you're scared to say anything. Oh, yeah I'm the big Kitchen. Yeah, but could be viewed. Bro, remember that one time dude remember Yeah, I fucking had to catch some shit one time I didn't want to say what it was But it was very similar to that It was like very it was it was innocent very innocent. It was it was in our I'll just tell the fucking story. I tell the story like five years ago Okay, we had some new flavors of a product come out and To the flavors were watermelon and grape all right, and but there was like five flavors, right?

This was like during George Floyd the hide-up Yeah, so like we had to be paying attention to that Like dude nobody wanted to say anything because Nobody wanted to be the guy that says black people like watermelon and grape. Yeah, I like watermelon grape too I like pig feet No, chitlin, but dude it was like Yeah, you know now everything's everything's a lot. We'll get him back to the swing Yeah, but like dude people get afraid because they don't want to fucking be the the one that points it out Yeah, let her cook Fucking let her cook The next one let her make sandwiches Gatorade goes go with a fucking turkey sandwich.

We got one more headline. Let's get to our third and final one. We got headline number three um This is an interesting play Elon Musk. Let's talk about him um Hella reads Elon Musk makes bold play for an unlikely marriage with three trillion dollar icon What does this mean? Yeah, well, so Elon Musk Has been openly hinting at a historic merger in the business world suggesting that his company xai should partner with tech giant apple uh musk muskus musk I hate his last name man Musk company is the corporate face of his popular a i chatbot grok Which functions similarly to competitors like chat gbt claw jiminine copilot Meanwhile apple has struggled to bring its own a i programs to consumers notably delaying improvements to the series voice assistant Until 2026 so venture capitalists started openly speculating this month that musk and apple make the perfect power couple In the a i world with xai bringing grok to even more people using iPhones through this proposed partnership um and apparently Musk he actually just just bought a former apple designer joni eaves hardware startup for a reported six and a half billion dollars Um, so the story here is you got tech giants Coming together. Hey, I'm just gonna say this tech giant. I'm just gonna say this right now Elon, mm-hmm. We put the show on twitter now. Mm-hmm. Okay, Elon I have the greatest tech hardware software company that's going to ever exist Right now, which is hasn't launched yet and nobody's done it and nobody's ever thought of it And it will change the fucking world Call me Continue yeah, I'm being dead serious. No for sure But my thing on this because I mean I saw this is interesting uh, you know interesting topic sure right But I think I have a pro I have a problem with this right. I don't I'm not big on monopolies And I feel like that's all this is yeah monopolizing power Well, you know, there used to be a time when the government would derail these right big these big But they don't do that anymore because these they pay so much money the politicians No back in the 80s the phone companies were like that. They derailed many broken up Yeah, I mean they did it to a bunch of industries. Yeah, and and yeah, this is the tech the tech world should not be controlled by For guys right like when does a partnership Get translate into like a monopoly like it's one thing to partner with another company, but it's another when Everything is it's becoming into one. Yeah a big incestuous And I need everything to be related like I drive a Tesla and there was an update There's came through that put to grok in the car. I don't want grok in the car. Mm-hmm. Just give me the damn car Not only that broke did you see the fucking did you we covered this we well we were gonna cover it Did you see they open a restaurant? Yeah, yeah The diner. Yeah, the diner in LA. Yeah, yeah, terrible. You gonna go If I was out there probably would yeah, but see I say the same thing. Let's see like they did it wrong They didn't totally wrong nobody wants to go in and get chicken and waffles at a place it smells like fucking Windex Right like they're trying to get people to adopt the technology and become because they got this robot that does the popcorn Yeah, I don't like I don't like all that yeah, but a bit like dude what he's trying to do is to get people more comfortable with the technology And that's not a way to do it like how it should be done is like dude What kind of restaurant do you want to fucking get chicken waffles that for real? I get an actual chicken shock Okay, but what what is the atmosphere like? Oh, it's very just like grungy like just real. I don't know. It's like very So you want you want your mom's in the kitchen. There you go You want you want a red and white checker table cloth you want to go in an actual diner You want to you want a woman to come in? Yeah, who's you know a big jolly woman who calls you Honey and butter cook dude for real and you want to have that experience and and instead of making it smell and taste like this futuristic thing Why don't you make it smell and taste and feel like the old thing and then work the technology into it? You know like that's where because what you're trying what he's look this is a we could do a whole podcast on why This is not the best idea for what he's trying to do but If you're trying to get people to adopt something different you want to tie it to something familiar yeah, and That's now what's happening with the technology and that's why people are resisting it so much because See the deeper intent that you're looking at behind the some of them now When I'm drawing going on long road trips in my Tesla most of the chargers are at a gas station Yeah, just at a gas station that going side real quick But it would be like and then from charging for a long time I'll walk to a restaurant with what he's doing is incorporating all this tech and AI and the robots when in reality If he would just open up an old school diner with the driving movie theater, but actual people and I know they have roller blades and stuff but Not so much tech heavy Yes, it'd be fine. Yeah, bro people would adopt it much more easily like he shoving the robot piece make it Americana bro Do like a fucking a drive a drive a what do they call that a movie theaters? No, the fucking out driving but like Sonic. Oh, yeah, come on on fucking roller skates Now that's right there. It's interesting. They do come out on roller skates there And they have they have the movie but at the Tesla thing. Yeah, yeah, they have a lot of the robots there too Doing all the optimists. I don't know they have a lot of the robot doing a lot of stuff I want to walk in and get good food like the food he's trying to serve is the fucking thick bacon and the The comfort wholesome Americana food. I want to have an Americana experience. Oh, and by the way You could still do that and tie in your rope like the the the robot Would stand out even more in a place like that. Yeah, you know, so Come by my tech You can control the fucking world And I'll help you with your restaurants. Yeah, and I want to boat I want to boat How deep does it like this partnership that he wants with apple is gonna get or how what he's envisioning my brain I see X and apple and Knowing Elon not personally, but how he is I'm immediately jumping to neural link an iPhone And I'm like is he have plans for that in the future where he's integrating for sure all these chips for people's phones And then I get you thinking to super far Let's let's be real. Let's be real dude apple lacks an innovative leader right now. Yep. Yeah, like they don't have apple hasn't changed or Innovated since jobs passed away. It's been the same thing They they use the strategy of planned obsolescence Which is an expiration date on technology intentionally to drive their revenue. So we're seeing this right every time that we get a New iPhone now there's new chargers and new plugs and new and that's what they have to do to maintain revenue To cover for their lack of innovation So if I'm apple Regardless of the monopoly that it would create like just strategically talking business A partnership we must might not be a bad idea because he is a visionary creative thinker in terms of how to use the hardware Apple's become a fucking hardware company. You know, they make a phone they make you know A new a new release You know every year with new shit and that it's not real innovation. It's fake innovation And they they they planted it's called plan obsolescence. Why's me at told me all about it. You know, so um They need some help with that, but I don't know that it would be good for the world. Yeah, I don't trust you on musk in terms of like And this is not personal against musk. I don't trust anybody to have that much power and control Over society and then they do it under the guise of capitalism right? I'm a capitalist But there's ethical capitalism And then there's unethical capitalism and once a company gets too much power Just like when a government gets too much power it becomes very easy to see yourself as The creator of culture as opposed to serving people And solving their problems. You know, it becomes about control instead of help. Well, here's the other issue to the more way I too And that's one of the things AI is about AI is about dependency. It's not about they they sell it to you And say it's great, but really it's about dependency because once you start in and there's already studies that are showing this your intelligent level They dropped your IQ drops you're not creating new neural pathways You're probably depending on the tech and same mom will just talk about the sonoree some podcasts. He was saying That guy's a funny. He is yeah, the millennials use chat gpt more is like a Oh, I'll go to this for this quick question or advice with this Whereas Gen Z and Gen offer they're using it as a good operating system for literally everything And I feel like it's only gonna make people dumber. Oh, yeah, we're gonna see younger people have all timers because yeah These older people are getting all timers because you're not using their brain a lot and we tell them You do puzzles. Yeah, they active. What's this is that creating a long term Dependency dependency right now and we have all these young people depending on chat gpt and they're not thinking because you can be in school And again, I'm only using chat gpt for the class. I don't care about But it's the act of learning that helps you learn not necessarily what you're learning Here's the act of creating these new neural pathways and becoming a better stronger person That prepares you later on in life to tackle challenges and know how to operate through it Absolutely. You're not gonna have that because you're depending on chat gpt. Where do we end up? Well, dude, let's think about it like this bro Let's just say That the three of us are the evil overlords that we think These people are not Elon but like soros and Clashob and all these people at the top Netanyahu, okay? All these people at the top that push this globalism bullshit from Either publicly or privately Let's just say that's us, okay, and we're like fuck we want to control the world and We want to maintain control and maintain power The easiest way to do it is the way that they're doing it They're creating tech that creates dependency based upon convenience and then They are leveraging people's financial greed to put more dependency into the system All right a lot of people right now. How many people have their life savings in Bitcoin Okay, let and by the way, I'm not here to argue can you make money in Bitcoin or not what I'm saying is this If I were the headhunt show of the bad guys What I would do is I would unleash the tech which AI tech has existed far Many years ago, okay, it's not new. It's new to us I would release the tech Lower the IQ create as much dependency on convenience Every every which way, okay, I would make it so that entire generation of people is unable To repair a small gasoline engine or change a tire or grow food or take care of themselves or hunt or defend themselves And I would do that Slowly through the implementation of technology which by the way we are many years already into Okay, the thing and I will just say this the things that I know how to do Are probably 60% less than what my dad who is 80 years old still knows how to do Okay, and I'm a capable man by my generation standards now Once I get everybody once I get this long enough going long enough You know what I do turn the fucking power off Turn this it off. I turn the power off. There's no money Nobody knows how to survive and within weeks I depopulate the planet Because there will be chaos and war and no ability to know how to survive all at the switch of a button Yes, which this sounds To some people can say conspiratorial, but it's literally if you just keep life going as it is right now That's all it's it's already happening. It's a likely contender if everybody's at home Using chatty beauty for everything Amazoning everything door dashing everything And not leaving the house there's at home You're just getting more dumb and more dependent. Would you be able to survive without power today if they turn it off right fucking now Would you I'm talking about right now like right now we walk out of the podcast. What the fuck would you do? There's no power your card Doesn't run. I went for a little bit. Yeah, but where you going a generator So everybody else last law it wouldn't laugh that one. That's what I'm saying, dude And we're creating a society and by the way, I don't have a better answer than you I'm not saying like hey, I'm That we're creating is a very dependent one is not really it's not promoting Independence and free will and teaching people how to you know in fact The demon brothers that's intentional. Yeah, I'm gonna say they demonize that yeah, you know, I'm saying those prepers They're right wing extremists, right. Yeah, well, that's what I'm gonna say to the other Let's put my glove around the terror list because he's teaching people how to survive the bill campfires Yeah, that's the other danger part of this man. It's like we got reminded so we our government This current administration, which is one of my issues with it Just set up for the next five to ten years to have zero regulation on any of it You know, I'm saying with his AI shit. You know, I'm saying to it's like We know we see how fast AI is moving right now They just gave him five to ten year fucking unlimited fucking Unlimited scope do whatever happens Dude even bigger than that like that allows people Really unless they're like very technical Uh technology versed What that dude what that allows is for every fucking person's information every person's creative copyrighted information every fucking thing that everyone is ever done in the history of mankind To be scraped into someone's large-large language model of AI which protects nobody's work that's ever been done Like there's so many problems with this dude. It's Look there's so many obvious problems with this it cannot be a reasonable thought That they just unleashed it not knowing like an ignorance. I mean in each example is Elon I mean if you look at what he's doing with uh, I forgot the name of it the cybercats versus You know about the oh yeah, the little cybercats versus Waymo to self the really self-driving like yeah ubers or whatever You look at Waymo Studying the roads and creating their tech and you know trying herself to be a business Elon he just looked to switch. He's been getting all this data. All his AI from everybody driving a Tesla since 2012 All those Google map cards see route driving around the street. They needed to do that to then have the street view in Google maps Elon he just He was like oh, I'm already have all these Tesla on the street. They're already getting all this data I'm just gonna record all that data and they're literally every single Tesla on the road now is my own basically a Google Maps car And then I have all that data and now at the flip of a switch. Oh, I can turn my car into a cyber cab because you already has a date He's already full like Is that a new I didn't know so so you can make your car a cab In the future. Yes, they're already making cybercats So basically you can make your car an unmanned uber And pay for about two years. Yeah, they already have some in Austin But I can personally buy a Tesla for like 30,000 and then send it out to the road while I'm not using my car for it to work And that's what Elon's pitching is saying your car should never be parked Like if you're at home let your car go uber and then come back home because he wants a little capital aside Make the money well greed is the avenue to adoption. Yeah, and it is interesting. I you talked about how you know What's the long-term game That was Elon's long-term give me talk to talk about this for years and I mean I think you all into we do you think given the data Do you think he's doing it from malicious reasons or do you think he's just that fucking smart? He's a great idea and not thinking about it. I think He's a genius, but also think he's I think he's very smart and very innovative But I Almost want to go down the route that he's just I don't know real list, but he's a seeing okay AI is already unleashed So he's already looking 10,000 steps ahead. Well while I'm here What can I do to make the most of money? Yeah, he's already knows already here. So Already know self-driving cars are gonna be things. Yeah, but dude after after a certain amount of money, bro Like it doesn't matter. You know, and he's not a money guy, bro He doesn't own a lot of things with Twitter. He just oh, let me just sign off Well, I mean bro, I mean he Outside of an airplane which is a booger compared to what he can buy he could buy the fucking airplane companies He the guy lives reasonable, you know, so like I don't know if it's about money dude. I think the guy I look I'm not I don't know him so it's all talking out of my ass and you know and What I can deduce from watching him. I mean, I think the guy's so just so fucking smart that he takes this shit up And acts like a lot of times in business dude The fastest executor is not always the best businessman. Yeah, because they They execute on ideas quickly without thinking of the long-term repercussions and so like good CEOs great CEOs Have the vision to weigh all the options before they fucking pull the trigger good Good CEOs will execute so Fat which which they come across is very good in a lot of situations like people say oh he's great. He executes sometimes And by the way for those of you that listen for business content. This is not you you need to execute more Sometimes people are so fast at executing they failed to recognize The detriment of what the plan could provide later and sometimes I look at Elon and I think He's a fucking brilliant dude. Yes, who is not a great CEO because he does not think before he goes and Maybe that's me giving him the benefit of the doubt Maybe he sits in his fucking plane with a fucking evil mask on and You know like I don't know But I know enough people that know him and they're friendly with him They like him. Yeah, you know, so I don't know that's extremely valid Yeah, when you say that the meet example that comes to my mind is Samsung and Apple Samsung sells a lot of parts to Apple it's a use of especially their screens, but Samsung's very quick to Put out a feature. Yeah, for example, you think of like Apple pay Everybody knows what Apple pay is everybody uses Apple pay that tech Samsung's had in their phones since 2010 And it acted so fast on it but then Apple's like we could do this How do we scale it out? What's longevity? What's the marketing? What's the play here and now every it's everywhere That's right and that's a good example of that. Yeah, bro. It's it there's many There's multiple personalities that fit into it Most people don't understand that CEO is a hired position It's not always the founder like you could go on LinkedIn or put your feelers out and find very effective CEOs the best CEO is the guy who can Develop the best plan and execute the plan at the perfect time and Just because someone's worth $200 billion does it necessarily mean that they're the best CEO I don't know people will get upset when I say this because I'll say the game is the look and make money Yes, but if someone's exceptionally brilliant they can make the money You know what I'm saying? So he really in my opinion I think he needs some people in between him and the fucking outcome. Yeah, let's say hey Here's what could happen if we do this and this and this which I'm sure he do this guy This guy's not a fucking his own team. He's good at hiring and creating teams Yeah, innovation of Tesla and Neuralink and SpaceX. He's good at putting those teams together But he needs like a Elon team like he needs his own damn team to figure out his ideas and how they're getting pushed out and That'd be very effective for him. What it means for the fucking world Well, that's what I'm saying like he there needs to be some consideration to the amount of power that has For writer wrong been collectively bestowed on him To use it responsibly. Yeah 100% man guys jumping on this conversation I just know down to the comments what you guys think with that being said We have a final segment Thumbs up at dumbest fuck always we're bringing this up bring your headline in it talk about it and we vote on it We give it one of those two options Um, I'm here. Let me ask you some of you like amusement parks Yes, okay, like I get kind of unhealthy how much I like it okay I like the atmosphere, but I I there's things about I don't like okay like I don't like when I go to six flags and There's 400 pound ladies weren't fucking see through fish net outfits As the cover up in the chairs and then bikinis and then they have a two-foot-long turkey leg You know and a wooden mug like we're in the fucking it's like it's a weird dynamic that makes me uncomfortable Like we're at a what do they call those festivals the Renaissance fairs? Oh, yeah, we're kind of in the Renaissance fairs We're kind of at like We're kind of in the 80s. Yeah, it's like kind of at old country buffet Dollywood and a Tennessee they have up a you walk in and you cut it right and it's like a parking lot for the the scooters And you go in everybody has a scooter and they're just scooting around No shit. Yeah, for the big people. Yeah, everybody. I'm the big people. I can't stand that It's too big to fucking walk on it and amusement park you should probably just just don't go well You should probably try to lose some weight You know what's funny about the theme parks is that now they have so much shaperoning Policies and not allowing teenagers in because I wonder what Like what color person what group of people Changed the rules for a theme park. Yep. Oh, I mean a obviously white supremacy, bro. Oh, it's holy white kids A bunch of Dunkin-Donut cows. It's a bunch of fucking nerdy white dudes Running through with their pocket protectors Everything fun is getting run and that's what I don't like. Yeah, but I love them. Well, okay. All right. Well, specifically the rides All right Because this just happened Amusement park rides snaps at Saudi Arabia Park with 23 reported injured An amusement park ride malfunction and Saudi Arabia has reportedly left 23 people injured with three critically hurt No one dead at this time I'm a video of the incident shows the ride with 360 degrees written atop It's swinging back and forth before the arm with the spinning wheel carrying passengers snapped off The frame of the ride. Let's check this clip out I'm not getting on that motherfucker anyway. No zero chance Oh So the sound comes back in there's no there's no chance. I'm getting on that. I want to know who made this Oh Hell no, that's why I don't get on the ride See I'll get on a ride at a theme park that is nationally known and recognized and you follow the rules I don't know what Saudi Arabia got. I don't know what they're like. You don't get on no carnivore Yeah, no Like this this shit. I don't do this. No, no, no carny rides, bro. You go to a carny ride and there will be shit jacked up with wooden blocks and like Yeah, no for real They'll be moving like this You look at the guy and there's a guy standing next to it looks like fucking Joe dirt smoking a cigarette. He said That's all good. Yeah, it's fucking good. Don't worry about it. Fuck your rubber bands. Holy safe No Don't take I've been doing this whole life. Yeah smell the motor oil Look at like if you look at the boat ride that's a semi truck you literally just fold it up and then it's literally on wheels He just drive it away. Bro that ride you should terrify the fuck out of me But right, oh you didn't like the boat ride either. Yeah, well, yeah for different reasons. Yeah, triggering. Yep memory You try to get on there and look for the basement Where's my chain dude? The I don't know what the bro. I was never in the rides bro like because of that shit Now I'll tell you what I do like there Funnel cakes now we know that okay. Yeah, that's right. That's it. I mean here Amir is right mirrors getting a permanent seat, bro Honorary fact with that anytime you come through you better stop by and do a show dude the the Yeah, no, I'm not doing it bro. I do like carnivals and and fairs Like I like that. Oh Holy fuck dude. No way. Is that real? That's real. That's real that guy died huh? Oh for sure holy shit man. Yeah Yeah, and this was the god the yeah, that was the amine. That's where I went and but that was a different one right that you just Yeah, yeah, bro. I mean look man. There's some serious Dude, did you do you guys remember that story from the guy in Kansas? There's a congressman in Kansas City from Kansas City who's son Leirbond whose son went down a fucking water slide got his head cut off. Yeah, it's called for root I'm very plugged in the theme park. You know this one. Yeah, so what happened the veroo basically was a the world's largest like water slide It was a kind of the ones that you sit in a little boat like a water coaster Then it would go down and then it went up and then back down and there were trying he wasn't heavy enough for something He wasn't heavy enough. They're trying to do the math on that going back up and they had a netting over it But the kid just wasn't heavy enough. So he went down then went up and yeah, it cut his head out bro snapped his chin and decapitated him and then his body went back down the water slide. Yeah, and everybody was as greeted with blood and a body. Yeah Yeah, I remember their tower power his dad's a congressman. Yeah, yeah The the fucking tower power at six flags here. It's remember a snap that dudes leg off Dude when I was a kid there was a there was one a stand-up roller coaster out there at six flags and some lady fell out of it and died Someone got it's a lot of just Yes, remember that I'm cool. Yeah, I'm cool. I'm all right And then they they took it down and they put where the n that's where the ninja is now I still I do like like I do like those rides at the theme parks, but I do not do carnival rides Yeah, I won't do the carnival rides and I won't do a theme park that's not a big Like known if I will I Unless there has been up for a long time. I you won't find like a family park. I want to support it And you know that atmosphere, but no I'm gonna put my life on that. I did like how like all the the people on this they still had their garbs on what Like the bro bro that so that is safe check this out that 360 part. Mm-hmm That's the counterbalance of the weight. Yeah, right then look when it breaks if fucking hammer somebody dude Like somebody gets hammered by that whole counterweight, which has to be thousands and thousands of pounds and then go back and slam right into it. Yeah Oh How did that not kill anybody? How did that not kill anybody bro? That's like hitting somebody with 10,000 50,000 pound hammer bro had to Fuck yeah, yeah, well, nope that stumps down thumbs that will nobody dies yet So I'm yourself for that. Yeah, that's good thumbs up for life, but I thumbs down for Carney rides. Yes. Yeah. Is that a carnival ride or is that a park? You know, I think no, it's it's an actual like a amusement park That they have Kadehya. That's what it is. Yeah, no you guys sound racist though bad I really they're opening up a new theme park is partnered under six flags and have some really reputable companies back in these rides But I can't go They don't do gays no Where is that when was it ticket? It's deep up in Saudi Arabia. It's oh, well, yeah, wait a sec guitar I think so Dude, remember that guy wore that gay shirt it's soccer game and the next day he was dead.
