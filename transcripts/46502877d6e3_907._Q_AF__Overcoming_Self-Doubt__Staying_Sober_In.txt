know sick man uh well it is Monday so you guys know what that means Q&A makes some people better that's right that's what we're gonna do that's right and um let's get it started okay we had a call in oh we do start with the call in start with the call in all right let's uh let's give our boy Dylan a ring well Dylan what's up my man what up DJ what's going on bro oh I did fucking great now yeah oh that's nice that's nice what you up to uh just uh I'm gonna wait back from a friend's wedding oh sick sick awesome I got I got the big one here what's up Dylan how are you bro I'm doing outstanding Andy oh dude this is so fucking cool this is this is so how's the wedding it was awesome did he run off recently uh I'll say again that's it did he run off uh they're waiting for mayors though kind of a little bit sick man so what can we help you with bro yeah so just in background so uh I played a division three football for a school in the Midwest called a Scott Through Riffles see if they're all four years and then I luckily had the uh an opportunity to play um I got invited to the Coles mini camp in May so uh went there you know uh did was a little nervous at first you know just like how how new everything was uh unfortunately that didn't make seem uh left got caught like that weekend but I you know I've been training my outs off and ready because you know got that foot in the door and that just drove me back to you know try to get to that point so and I really just been lifting working my ass off since since since he's not in in November and my question is really uh so like I'm a really self like motivated and really like determined athlete to get to the you know my dream and my destiny that I think I was you know like designed for me but I still struggle with you know self-doubt and consistently thinking that like what I'm doing isn't enough and I guess my question for you is like when you first started your business what helped you get through those times where like man I don't know if I'm going to make it I don't know like if we're undoing the knot like is it all going to be worth it uh yeah okay well um I got some bad news for you bro and that is this uh that feeling really never goes away if you're an ambitious person uh if you want to continue to grow continue to get better continue to evolve which is required in entrepreneurship if if you want to continue to innovate which is required and adapt which is required you almost have to have a paranoid feeling about not being good enough because what that does is that causes you to pay attention to every single detail and to make sure that all of your eyes are dotted in your teeth across and a lot of people look at this attitude because it's uncomfortable and it creates anxiety and it's not this peaceful calm feeling that you know you get to have when you're not working on important projects they think that it's a bad thing but the reality is bro is that having the feeling that you have is actually a very strong sign that you're going to be successful in business because the key to business long term is the ability to do the monotonous things at a high level and then continue to evolve and create and adapt to the ever changing and fast changing way that business is done so a lot of people feel like you know man what's wrong with me because I'm always thinking about this or I'm always thinking about that or I'm always high strong or I'm always on edge but dude that edge is exactly what allows you to continuously get better which is the requirement of being in the the area of life entrepreneurship that you have chosen you have chosen to be an entrepreneur and to be a successful entrepreneur you by default have to be a high level entrepreneur and to be a high level entrepreneur you have to be detail oriented and to be detail oriented you have to feel a little bit insecure so that you notice the details that other people won't and so I would I think you should think about reframing this as a good thing as opposed to something that is hard to deal with I had this happen to me when I was about 12 years in the business I was having a lunch meeting with a guy who was much further along in business than I was and I asked him when we sat down I said dude when does it when does it stop like when does it when does that feeling stop when does it when does everything feel okay and his answer was right before you're about to lose and I'm like fuck yeah I'm like damn dude like that's that's some real shit and and I think the awareness that you have brother is an asset that most people don't have and as a instead of you seeing it as something that you need to get past or work through or deal with I think you should look at it as man it's really good that I have this awareness because it allows me to see things that other people won't it allows me to operate at a higher detail it allows me to do the things that other people refuse to do or don't want to do because I want to win and I think it's a great quality to have every single successful entrepreneur that I know personally that succeeds at a high level has this same doubt insecurity feeling of not being good enough even when they're you know even when they're being a position that most people would say you haven't made they still carry that with them and and what people fail to identify is that the reason they are in that position to you know be looked at and said man that person's got it made is because they carry this feeling of doubt paranoia I'm not good enough and then they take action against that does that make sense yeah 100% yeah yeah I understand everything actually you kind of said something similar and one of your recent podcasts with a guy with that had a construction company I think so this is definitely just to hear this firsthand is yeah is broke this is just the way it is I mean look I would love to be able to tell you yeah man you know eventually you're gonna get this much money in the bank and you won't feel that way or eventually you're gonna get to hear and you won't feel that way that's not been my experience in fact I actually think it gets a little worse because as you grow it's not just about you anymore it's about your team it's about the company it's about people's families it's about their kids and when that responsibility really starts to weigh on you and it's not just about yourself I think that feeling actually gets a lot worse like you're always thinking fuck could I be doing better or am I letting these people down or should I be doing this or you know and and by that time I think you're a little more like I am definitely in a place where I accept that as part of my reality but I do remember for a long time wishing that I didn't feel that way because it was so uncomfortable so you know I think you'll acclimate more to it but I think you could acclimate faster by understanding how valuable it is to your path. I go by something that Nick Sabin always says that to get where you want to be it takes you don't got a lot of choices and that's it and I mean that's it yeah obviously yeah well yeah man and it's and sometimes it takes more for other people you know sometimes it takes less some people start off further along some people start off further back some people have a natural set of skills that allows them to move faster some people have to develop those skills so the answer to everything is exactly what Sabin says it's whatever the fuck it takes man and uh I'm fed yeah I and that's different for everyone and we can't make that quote unquote fair it's just what it is so yeah brother I mean I I would say that you are very blessed for whatever reason to have that awareness in the beginning um because I think eventually you're going to look back and you're saying the reason that I was successful is because I was paying attention to everything because I cared the way that I cared and uh it will be it will become something a quality that you very much so value and appreciate about yourself from son I appreciate it yeah brother all right do the man go kick ass yeah yeah sir yeah I'm sorry I was I'll just say one thing I just want to say that God bless you guys man like I listen to your show every day I work I wake up at 5.15 and I listen to your podcast every day every morning cutting grass at a golf course and to say that you guys inspired me to think the way I think like Andy like I I just I listen to you every day like DJ thank you to like like your whole team like you guys are like you guys are are doing and saying the saying the work that not a lot of people want to say anymore because they're biking soft and shit that's what you all say so like I just want to say I appreciate you guys and taking time out of your day to come talk to me and yeah just keep doing what you're doing well bro we do it so that guys like you will go out and fucking build what this country is supposed to be so that that appreciation is neutral thank you bro good there all right brother we'll have the good rest of your day we'll catch up with you soon y'all see that all right see Dylan it's an interesting thing because I've noticed this I've noticed this and I want to get your take on it because I don't know if it's a science to it but why does it seem that like a lot of people who are successful in business have a sports background or something what like what is that like is that a real thing I I feel like yeah I think it's saying like yeah but I mean dude I think it's a I think it's a very real thing um I don't know the numbers on it but well because all of the skills that you learn in sports translate to business in a different way you know you've got to do a million reps to get competent is something you know what I mean like if you start off with soccer you don't know how to dribble you don't know how to you know take shots you don't you don't know how to pass the ball same thing in basketball same thing in baseball I mean dude to to learn how to hit a baseball is a multi-year process like you don't just stand up there at five years old and hit a baseball like you start by hitting the ball off the tee and when you swing you don't even hit the ball you hit the tee four hundred times in a row then eventually you hit the ball right then eventually you get to like where they toss it to you then they you know what I'm saying and it's a multi-year commitment to even be able to hit a baseball somehow people forget that when it comes to their lives or their business or whatever but the reality of sports and business being parallel is about as close as you can get both on an individual level and a team level to have a successful team you have to do your job and you have to trust that the people on the field are going to do their jobs and if everybody does their jobs you're going to win a lot more than you lose it's the same thing in business yes you could have a small business and it could be one or two people and one person you could carry the whole team but that does not work when there's 50 people all right or a hundred or five hundred or even fifteen you have to do your job and then you have to teach everybody else how to do their job and then everybody else has to do the job together to win and so the the lessons on a macro scale are the same and the lessons on a micro scale are the same you've got a guy on the baseball team who's staying out till four in the morning and not fucking practicing and not hitting oh you know at first he's still hitting 300 but then after two months of that shit he's hitting fucking 180 and you got to go to him and be like hey you motherfucker you're fucking it up for all of us right and those are the same things that have to happen in business or on any team so yeah dude I think it's very parallel from both a micro and macro level and it's confusing to me how more athletes don't understand that yeah I was gonna but my question is gonna be so like I wonder why then so many athletes even at the professional level or whatever get out and then don't like why are they fucking kill as you you would think that they would just kill and remember dude like it's not always as it seems in sports you know sometimes guys that are considered to be great are really only great because the team around them is great and then they believe that it's them that's great and then when they don't have the team they don't do is good so you know not there you know what I'm saying so like there's guys who get paid a lot of money in sports because their team is fucking awesome and they're pretty good okay and they just happen to be in a position where they get the credit but you remove the teamwork and they think oh I'm the superstar and then it happens to be that they aren't so there's all kinds of things that happen but you know that it's very parallel this is why I think it's important for parents to really get their kids into sports um you know like fuck dude even the physical pain that you have to go through to be good at sports the conditioning you know the training yeah that shit all you know it all translates to real things in life putting yourself in intentionally uncomfortable positions you know I really think sometimes bro would be easier to teach like six graders how to be successful in business than it is adults because the adults have told themselves stories about why they can't do things where these kids are just like okay I'll do it yeah you know what I mean yeah I feel like if you had like a fucking like a little little little little T baseball team brother fucking crutch yeah but but like it's you know adults tell themselves stories like this like you could take someone who understands the principles of teamwork the principles of individual work culture leadership mindset and all these things and you could take someone like that and you know pull them out of that environment and they will say well yeah I was really good at at baseball I was really good at football but business is just not something I'm good at and so they tell themselves these other stories even though the principles are parallel you know like there's no I think the biggest thing about business and entrepreneurship is that people think there's some sort of like third party approval that you have to be or club that you got to be invited into you know what I mean like yeah yeah you don't there's nobody's gonna come along and say hey by the way I see a whole bunch of good shit in you you could be fucking the next best entrepreneur that never happens and I remember thinking like when I started in business that that would eventually happen like the people who were further along to me would come to me and they would see something in me and they would say I recognize that and you and you got it and that doesn't happen bro you've got to like tell yourself that you've got to be able to look at other people and be like I could beat that fucking guy or I'm as good as that guy or what's you know I could be as good as that guy if I did what he did you know what I mean so I'm gonna do what he does and I'll get better like kids will do that you know what I'm saying but adults will have a story as to why they can you know adults are amazing justifiers bro they can justify anything that's why you know live hard as such a valuable program is 75 hardest such a valuable program because one of the biggest things that it does is it brings awareness to the bullshit that you tell yourself it brings awareness to the internal dialogue that keeps you from doing the things you actually want to do you can see it and identify it very clearly and then you know how to overcome it you know there's a reason we say win the war with yourself because that's really the only war that matters that's real man that's real guys and let's get a question number two this is a right in right in question here question number two guys hello a and D a and D yep yep I'm Anthony 22 from Chicago and I've been a stoner for five years just graduated college and I want to take my career in real estate and finance seriously how is he 22 in chief in four minutes but as a self-proclaimed stoner how do you maintain the discipline to stay sober in business I I wouldn't say that I'm a stoner I would say yeah I mean I like to smoke marijuana occasionally I did go through a period of my life where I was smoking daily but that's not something that I you know I don't brand myself a stoner I don't think that's cool you know yeah I just honest with you guys like I I don't drink because I think drinking is very hard for me mentally and physically so instead I like to smoke weed it helps with my anxiety it actually helps me think a little bit more clearly because what it does is it declutter is my mind and to be honest for me I have some of the best organization sessions regarding the ideas that I have because I'm not thinking about anything else so you know I don't have fucking Bob Marley pictures hanging on my fucking wall on shit you know and like and some fucking you know uh in some while you fucking yeah I'm not growing dreads bro like I don't think that I don't think there's anything cool about that whole uh yeah lifestyle like you know when you're making drugs or alcohol lifestyle it's usually a problem um so I'll start there uh the other thing is is like bro you know I didn't really start smoking um I quit smoking from the time that I was probably like 20 until I was probably 38 or 9 wow yeah because I was so focused on what I was doing now that at that time I was drinking which was probably worse um but I think had I not been drinking that entire time I probably I for sure would have progressed more quickly now I will say that with I saying this uh most of the time that I was drinking I was drinking with people from our company and I have a lot of fun memories of that and we had a lot of fun and a lot of good times together and so I don't regret it because those stories that we have are irreplaceable like some of the guys that you guys follow you know up here at HQ I got some funny fucking stories about those motherfuckers and they got some funny ones about me and uh those are my homies and and I enjoy that part of my life so I don't like regret it it's just not good for me anymore um so I just say that uh and I think it's important for you young people to understand that like dude marijuana is very dangerous for your mental development until you're over 25 the studies show that uh doctor Aiman who is like the world's foremost expert on brain development um he he will he talks about this yeah and after the age of 25 marijuana is much less harmful for an adult so like dude what do you say what's 20 22 bro you need to quit that shit yeah like you need to fucking get the fuck off of it you need to stop smoking weed you need to focus on your shit you need to let your brain develop and hopefully you didn't completely ruin it for the last five years of fucking weed smoking so my advice to you was be to fucking stop smoking weed because your brain will physically not develop the way that it's supposed to develop at that age um now what was the main question you had just maintain and discipline to stay sober in business well do you want to be fucking retarded I'm being dead serious do you want your brain not to work do you want your brain to be fucking less development than your that less less developed than your competitors are you good enough to be able to smoke weed every day and beat everybody else or what they do be honest no because the fucking truth is you're not so it comes down to do you actually want to win or do you not want to win do you actually want the things you say you want or do you not want the things you say you want um if I'm somebody who's you know not even in a fucking close to the stratosphere of where I want to be in my life I probably would stay away from drugs and alcohol completely uh that's that's my opinion I've seen way way too many people weren't ruined their lives with substance abuse to think that like it's acceptable if you're trying to be a high achiever and in fact most very high achievers that I know don't fucking smoke or drink yeah all right pretty straight edge yeah yeah so uh in you know why because they understand they are humble enough to understand that they are in a competition with other very smart people and all these people in real life in society on the internet they try to convince people that you know this isn't a competition and you're not in a competition listen dude you are in a competition when you're in business you are in the biggest competition that there is when you're creating content and you're trying to be the best content creator you're in a competition all right the the nature of human existence is competition whether it be you know your personal life there's probably other people that were competing for your spouse um whether it be your business life there's certainly other people that are creating competing for your job uh whether it be really anything okay uh what what's the nature of the Bible and church to be a better person that's a competition with yourself with God okay so this idea that there's no competition and then nothing is a competition is a is a faulty bullshit idea that's put out by people who want to opt out of competing they want to say hey man I can just float through life and everything will be cool and I'll be peaceful and that what they don't understand is that yeah that might work today you can tell yourself that today you tell yourself that tomorrow but eventually you find yourself in the same position that you're in and everybody else has progressed because everybody else understands that it is so you have to be real about your ability to compete are you the best if you say you're the best then where are the results if the results don't show you the best then guess what you make the fucking best which means you need to focus all of your attention all of your effort all of your mental capacity on becoming the best which you can't do when you're hung over or fucking stoned so and people could say well then why do you smoke if you're still trying to get but I don't know bro like I real talk I probably shouldn't but at the same time I do whatever the fuck I want I go wherever I want I fucking buy whatever I want I live how I how I everything passed where I'm at for me is fucking gravy because I'm so far past where I ever thought I would be in the first place it is what the fuck it is so if you can go you know and say that about your life then if you want to smoke a joint once in a while I'm fucking think it's a problem but when you're sitting in a little shitty apartment and your life hasn't materialized yet and you don't know if it's gonna it's probably a good idea not to yeah I think that's a thing too man like especially with the younger generation is it's a perspective issue right because they're in it they don't see where this is gonna lead them in 10 years or 15 years you know I'm saying like there's a reason why I don't smoke weed on video you know you got all these fucking these other little mentor dudes they're rolling up cones on a fucking video trying to be cool it's not that cool man it's not that cool I like it but it's not cool like it's not cool to fucking make it cool to like kids and shit and you know maybe maybe I should lie about it and say I don't do it but dude I I try to keep it real with you guys you know so I don't think it's a good thing for fucking younger people to do and to be honest if I had kids I probably wouldn't I probably would never they probably never see me fucking smoke you know what I'm saying um but you know it is what it is yeah I love it man I mean I don't know like I don't want to sound like a fucking I don't want to sound like an asshole but like I've given everything I've given my whole life to what to what I have if I want to smoke some fucking weed once a while guess what fuck smokes weed if I was in an apartment and I was paying 500 bucks a month with roommates and trying to build a business I would have no problem not smoking weed because I would look around my life and say fuck this sucks I need to fuck a fix this and this and this and I would fucking do that and you know if you want to develop discipline around being able to control yourself that's the whole point of the lib hard program in the 75 hard program if you want to control your discipline and you want to take control of the outside circumstances of your life with which actually give you control of most of your life uh do the program because it will teach you how to adhere you know most of the problem that people have in life isn't that they don't know what to do it's that they can't follow the plan to do it and that's what 75 hard and live hard fixes it fixes your ability to adhere and have discipline over the decisions that we are in control of day by day by day and when we take control of the things that we can control we find out that we were 95% 98% in control of all the important things that dictate our results so if I were you I would live the live hard program uh I would live the live hard program every fucking year but especially if I was fucking 22 years old because it's going to teach you a skill set that none of your peers are going to have and if I was 22 and I would have had the ability to control my external environment the way that I do now I would have been where I'm at now by the time I was fucking 30 that's the truth I didn't learn what I'm telling you until I was like 36 37 38 years old so yeah man yeah that's my answer there you go Anthony you're not as good as you think you are bro you need to calm the fuck down and you need to uh realize that and and take control real talk yeah quick yeah quick I love it I love it we got one more uh we got another question got a call in calling another call in let's hit Travis up Mr. Travis there we go hello this Travis Travis what's up dude this is DJ DJ what is going on brother what's up Travis is Andy Andy how are you doing man so good to hear from Berkard yeah it's good to hear from you too where you uh call it in from bro I'm calling in from Virginia Beach Virginia oh man I've been there before yeah that's where the seal the seals bases right yeah yeah yeah we got a bunch of bases right here but seal bases is here Norfolk's here a whole bunch of a whole bunch of bases that's cool so what's going on today bro how are you school I'm good I'm good I'm busy in the workshop I've got a I've got a couple builds I'm just trying to wrap up and get delivered by Tuesday so I'm not here to get my sweat on it feels good today it's a it's a brisk 84 with the stiff breeze it's pretty nice to be outside and working that does sound nice that's it does sound so what's what business are you in so I'm a custom woodworker I've been doing it on paper since 2018 but I've been building really anything and everything since 2010 uh so custom furniture a little bit everything um so that's what that's what I do that's uh that's my business well what can we help you with bro man I've got a a question I've just been distressing with for the past couple of years so a little bit of backstory for context for the question um so my wife is in the navy she signed up COVID-19 times um so she went to officer training school did that whole thing and we moved up here shortly after um so we move pretty often being in the militarities officer so my question is we didn't so I don't misquote myself so moving we're moving to a new area what's the best way to connect um quickly and find your ideal customer or customer base and then my second question is how can I keep my previous customers engaged and turn them into long-term repeat clients even if I'm no longer local to their area oh man well it's I can relate to this um when I moved to Springfield Missouri from St. Louis to open our business supplement super stores I didn't know anybody I knew I knew I knew my business partner a couple people from St. Louis but I knew nobody for Springfield and so I was in the same predicament and this was in 1999-2000 okay so there was no internet um so I had to do the the press and you know the the press and the flesh so to speak you know what I'm saying the tummy sticks you know uh create we had to we had to go around you know Springfield Missouri shaking hands meeting people making friends introducing myself hey I'm Andy we just opened this vitamin store right down the street this is what I do if you ever need something like that you know we're here and then you know usually you get shoot off and and you know it doesn't come of anything but we did enough of that where we had you know a few people willing to come in and give us a shot and off of those few people we did a good enough job to where those people would then bring other people and that is legitimately how we built our first company supplement super stores and to be honest it's still the way we try to operate today you know we try to make sure that we service the customer the best that we can and hopes that you know they will recommend other people to come to us and that's the foundation of business the foundation of good business is solve the problem doing in a way that is remarkable in terms of them wanting to legitimately say something or recommend you to someone else and then you do you repeat that cycle over and over again and your business grows now I had a second experience with that when I move back to St. Louis okay so I lived in Springfield for eight years I moved back to St. Louis to expand our business our first form still did not exist so when we got back to St. Louis I had to sort of do the same thing again where I had to go around even though I was from here I'd been gone for so long that people kind of forgot so I had to start over you know and that was lots of meetings and lots of you know lunches and lots of shaking hands and and all that stuff all over again and it comes down to this man yeah make a friend make a sale all right if you're friendly with people people buy from their friends dude they buy from their friends more than they will buy from someone who isn't and a lot of people on the internet and entrepreneur world will complain say nobody supports me and this and that well nobody's going to support you if your product's not as good as what it should be and you can't expect people to buy and support you just because you exist if you're not as good so you have to fundamentally be as good or better than other people but then when you are your friends and family are proud to support you you know and if we're realist about why they don't it's because most people just aren't that good so I've done this a few different times bro and you know it really comes down to the simplest of simple which is doing a great job taking pride in your work making sure that people are blown away with what you do and then leveraging the word of mouth story that they tell their friends in the new business for yourself and then repeating that over and over and over again and whether you're starting out from you know a new area or you're in an area that you grew up in your whole life the principles of growing a business are the same and if you think about it like this dude this is where a lot of people really mess this up is that they think there is unlimited amounts of customers and if you imagine your business like just imagine you have a bucket okay and in the bucket you have at the bottom you have a bunch of holes all right and you go out and you spend marketing money on acquired new customers and people go in the bucket and then you know they come in and then they just go right out the bottom because your product's not good enough your experience isn't good enough however you're doing things isn't capturing their loyalty could be a bunch of different things the customer experiences off and people what people think is because they don't have the complete formula set meaning they have holes in the bottom of their bucket people start to believe that whatever they're doing isn't working or it's this or you know people don't want my product or they won't become a return customer well if you just plug the holes in the bottom of the bucket meaning make sure your product's great make sure the the customer experiences great make sure that you do things that make them feel valued along the way give them a story to tell meaning like however you deliver the product should be there should be a you should be crafting your delivery your experience with a outcome of the story that you would like to be told about you when you're thinking about your business right how am I going to make this product deliver it make them say holy shit this is the best piece of furniture I ever seen with the intent of them telling other people like hey man you know this is where I got this you guys need to check him out if you think like that it doesn't matter where you're from you're going to be able to accumulate customers because the holes in the bottom that bucket get plugged and then the customers accumulate and then you create this giant momentum of word of mouth based off having multiple customers now as far as people being remote or further away from you I'm sure there's logistical challenge this there with with being a physical company a custom company custom word work but the idea is still the same if you can abridge those those physical modes meaning your ability to deliver the product in a fast efficient quality way that it's going to work the same for you there too so I mean dude it's I know that's probably a more simple answer than what you want me to tell you but dude it's really it's really that's it it's all it is so if there's something more specific I could maybe help you with here I mean you're definitely free to follow up with a question but um yeah yeah I mean mainly dude this is this is how it works what what I'm working on is just an amazing product an amazing process and I know with those two if I can just really hone in on that that works because what what we do at my company we use trees to spice from natural disasters to build heirloom quality furniture which is really really cool we have an awesome way to build that but building that story where it's just it easily digestible for a customer that's been kind of a challenge and then the other thing that I've this is probably dumb but I've been going to a lot of like pop up places farmers markets and I've been told this a long time you know you know don't don't sell Gucci at Goodwill kind of thing so it's I don't know if that's the the right avenue to just old school methods work for new school tactics so like I know getting in front of people is the best way for people to know that I exist and that's that's the number one challenge is in Virginia Beach just trying to just let people know hey I'm here I'd love to help you if this is something that you need so is that kind of is going to farmers markets like dumb or is it the right way to just find physically your customer base I don't think anything is dumb if it's going to get you in front of people okay are there better ways maybe and I'll give a few in just a second but keep in mind when when we do events you know we do lots of events at first form and as to and and our goal is not to go do an event that just has the right kind of people in it our goal right is to go to an event and make one relationship one customer out of that event and when you do that okay we know that like let's just say for you you get one customer out of these farmer markets if you can get one customer and you can deliver a great job and you can document the job and the satisfaction and the experience and then leverage that through social media that's going to bring you more customers so a lot of it is how you value each customer and I have not found a way in business to grow a business even at the size of the companies that we operate now where it isn't one customer at a time if you came to our all company meeting that happens every single fucking Monday morning we would talk up you would hear me say and you would hear sales say one customer at a time one person at a time you would hear that a thousand times because that's how we've built everything and I think a lot of people get hung up on the idea of grabbing a whole bunch of customers at once not really understanding that a lot of that shit that you hear on the internet is geared towards like selling a two dollar widget or a you know a temporary or e-commerce product it's going to change next week right when we're talking about building a real custom company brand like you're trying to build you know that's a different thing and so you have to recognize the value of one job what it was worth you know hey I spent three hours at the farmers market I met one guy I did a cabinet for him I documented the cabinet I got him to do a little testimonial and I put that on my on my social and now that brought me two more customers well that brings a complete different value then saying you know is this the right thing or not and so when we look at when you look at that that's how I would think about that if I were you okay now where could you go to get in front of the right customers that you would like to be in front of what is your ideal customer in your mind my ideal customer I mean I think I think that changes from season to season because in South Carolina it was one person but here it's another person I think it's a person who has just like a love and understanding for not even necessarily wood but it could be land conservation it could be just the natural beauty of wood but what I'm really gearing towards is the person who wants to have like a dining room table or a conference table and just have family gatherings over there just have tons of memories around that and then be able at one day to pass that on to someone so then the memories kind of go with the family that's that is my ideal customer it's not you know they make X amount or whatever like okay my tables do start a certain price so let me ask you this are you telling that story through your social media meaning when you show your woodwork or when you market yourself are you that's a first of all that's a great story okay and me not giving two fucks about furniture if you told me that story I would be like yeah man that's how it should be and I would lean into that story appreciate that yeah no it's a that's a real thing and I could tell it was real coming from you so you know you need to you need to lean into that story like hey man you know in a throw away world where everything's instant everything's cheap everything's replaceable we're right we're making real American handmade goods that that your family's gonna sit around and have holidays around and some of your best memories are gonna be around and this is gonna get passed down to your kids and they're gonna have their memory like bro that's a real great story about what you do and especially now in this time of course yes right exactly because everything's going so far the other way people are craving that stuff yeah so first off yeah you should be telling that dude you know go back to the example we were talking about a minute ago where you document the entire thing that that story should be woven into to how you show the projects that you built because just hearing you say that never meeting you never fucking seeing you I felt something when you said that so yeah bro you should be telling that with your voice by the way you have a really good voice yeah oh yeah for real dude you have a voice for radio huh absolutely me you must be ugly dude I'm my best day I'm a four I'm married up joy the club brother hey we can't get it all right so uh that's it dude yeah so so hey man you're on the team with us bro it's hey if we got it all we'd be on TV right uh that's it but that's it every camera front of me that's right that's why I'm not documenting a thing on social media because all the cameras break when I start well we'll get you one of the ugly cameras like we got jokes just like me so uh so yeah dude I'd start telling those stories man and then you know get get one job you know bro all you got to have is one or two jobs do you have one or two jobs you just said you did the next the next job I'm working on it's it's very complicated because being in a military town so I'm delivering a completely custom Adirondack for a marine officer that's gonna go on his ship so I can't really I can't get pictures of it there but I'm working on trying to get a video with him outside maybe in front or beside the ship because there's a lot of a lot of red tape no I get that but but you can still tell the story like hey I made this for the admiral of this you know this is what he this is what he asked this is what we did and you know this is gonna be something that after his service is done he's gonna pass down to his kids like there's a real story there and uh yeah and once you get one or two of these stories going bro the thing they will people will start to see you as like oh that's the guy that could create these amazing heirloom pieces that are high quality and you know instead of you having to go to the farmers market to get started you're gonna start start start having people come to you and that's that's where we got to get you to we got to get you from the going out and getting leads to where the leads come to you and because the nature of what you're doing requires a lot of time energy and expense and you only have so much of that right now to do so what the ideal thing would be for you to get some jobs tell a story about the jobs replicate the customers that you've art that you're already getting all right creates such a demand for you for your product that you can charge whatever you want because it's limited time and now you're in a place of options now you could say all right I would like to bring on an apprentice I would like to start a little bit bigger of an operation where everything's still custom but yeah so so do we got to get you from that place where you're out acquiring leads to where the leads are coming to you and that's only going to be done through you doing a really good job making an amazing product and then also telling the story which you happen to have an amazing story that goes along with the product um and then and then doing that bro like you're it's yeah it sounds like you've got it all figured out man like to be honest it's just time no really I know you probably don't I know it doesn't feel like it because like I don't I don't mind chasing leads because I love talking to people I love just seeing if I can meet someone's neat because there's been so much where like I they're like I really love what you do it's not going to work out for us but I know a ton of people I can recommend you to which has kind of been great because it's like it's worth a mouth without earning the business which is really rare for me I think it's kind of rare for a lot of people but it hasn't like it's it's good some months and then it's like Christmas time is much of money is I want to make Andy I can make but it's that January because it's because I'm so close to retail but I'm not quite so it's just January February March or just like you know a ghost town in the bank account which is fine because you know November December or August sorry October November December is like you know harvest for me yeah well here's what I would try to do this year is I would try to let these people know I would just straight up tell them I would say hey look I got a lot of extra businesses this year I'm going to have to start booking for next year let's get you lined up in these slots if you're going to want something next year I'm going to need you to tell me this year because like dude your best customer is going to be the guy who fucking bought something this year right so so like my like the guy I get my cigars from right like scars are a massive gift around commit Christmas and oh yeah you know sometimes I can't get what I want and he's like you got to let me know way ahead of time and it's so dude you got to use that time frame to your advantage with the customers you already have and so I would also you know in addition to everything that that we just said I would start to when when you go through Christmas this year I would let them know I say hey man I really love doing this for you if you want to do something again next year for Christmas we're going to have to put it on the books now and that way you can start to pop your books ahead of time and then what happens is the story becomes not hey this dude built me you know one off piece it's hey this is my custom word worker bro he does the fucking most amazing shit and now you're starting to build a little bit of a legend around what you do just by pre-booking the people who are already buying from you does that make sense yeah that totally makes sense yeah and I think it creates a little bit of urgency for sure I didn't get the stuff in creating that totally makes sense creating urgency and FOMO's a big deal bro even if you have to manufacture it in the beginning meaning you've just got to say hey yeah you know I only have and dude it's not it's not even bullshit it's true with you you only have so much time yeah so that's true so yeah dude I would I think bro honestly I think you're set to do do really well I don't think you need to go do anything else right now except take the customers that you have make them extremely happy and start documenting the stories and then when you know you start filling up for Christmas which is gonna be soon yeah you know start letting them know hey man just letting you know this is my busiest time of year I've got you in this year no problem but if you're gonna want to do something again next year a lot of my customers do let's go ahead and get you on the books now and that way we can meet we can talk then you know we'll talk in March or right exactly and and and that way it helps line up your business for the next year and so that creates the scarcity right like here's the story now the story is man where'd you get that that humidor oh man my buddy made it for me you know custom it was amazing actually you know like I get in with him every year he's really hard to get into but maybe maybe I could get you in with him you know and now the customers are starting to like create the scarcity yeah bro and this is what I've seen work and other work very well in other areas where people are trading their time and skill for money like such as tattooing my tattoo artist you know he he's got a four year book you know what I mean like he if you want to get in with him new it's four fucking years away so wow but but then guess what he does if he's if you got the money he'll say I get you in next month and then you know what you know what the story is about him hey man my guy is the fucking best and you know what I might be able to get you ahead he's got a four year book which makes me feel cool now you're the guy and him feel cool right so it's it's a lot of you know it's a lot it's putting all this shit together so that people value what you do and then they'll talk about it and then bring you their their people and you know I think you're in a good spot dude you love people you love the work yeah yeah and you you understand the value of the work and I think really do with just a few adjustments you'll be as busy as you want to be and then you're gonna have the options of how you want to scale it yeah that's that's the goal like really the next two to three years I want to bring on a apprentice because you teach what you know what your reproduce who you are and you know skills you can go learn skills anywhere but to be a good human to just love love the the process you don't always get to learn that anywhere so if I can just find someone who's just I mean it's interested in what I'm doing I think I could go make robots of myself and that's yeah that's kind of the goal yeah bro for sure 100 percent I think you're on it dude I think you're good I would like for you to check that I don't feel it most days well dude nobody does that's why you fucking get good at what you do you don't feel get nobody gets great at something they think they're already great at no nobody nobody nobody gets better at something they think they're already the best at like it to be good you have to think you're shit like that's that's that's that's part of that's part of the recipe you know I'm saying like you have to understand that you're not doing a really great job to even be great you know when when fucking Michael Jordan was kicking everybody's ass you know he didn't go to practice thinking I'm the greatest he went to practice thinking man I get better and the reason he thought I get better is because he thought man I don't know if I know what the fuck I'm doing so all winners think like that bro it's not just you I feel like that everybody I know everybody I know that's successful feels that way right right we're gonna check in I'm pretty that's
