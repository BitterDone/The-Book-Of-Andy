it was great dude like I it's so interested man because I've been to Mexico a few times but like there's just a different work ethic down there mm-hmm right and like it is so interesting to see like you go to a fast replaces up here or restaurants up here and it's like you get like services drop and you go down there and people that like you know they're not making nearly like they're not making them in a mowage here but like the work ethic is ridiculous it's ridiculous and it's it's it's a cultural standard bro it is yeah I mean look dude uh people here spoiled people here have had a good for you know their whole lives those people that you see in the restaurants that don't give a fuck they usually come from places where they haven't had to give a fuck okay people in Mexico understand hard times they understand how valuable it is to uh have an income and to have a job and they appreciate that and honestly you know I think there's some of the greatest people in the world awesome and it bothers me sometimes when when I talk about deporting people that people think I'm talking about next Kings no like no yeah I'm talking about all the other people from the fucking third world shitholes that come here out of people's prisons I'm not talking about our friends in Mexico I mean they're pretty much as American as everybody else at this point in time no they're fucking awesome

schedule here yeah I don't I don't like I mean just for you guys know like when we move and like we don't really post that stuff it's it's not like you know that there's some security reasons behind like you won't know if yeah if you know you just won't know yeah but uh yeah we're like back in action and uh I thought it'd be cool you know we've been on this little string of conspiracy theories yeah for about four years still have missed well no I mean the ones that like I mean these are like like like real conspiracy theories all right and like how we didn't go to the moon yeah stuff like that you know I'm saying this the seven love and really get up there you know stuff like that of course it is um but you know I saw this one late last night actually and I'm like damn like this is pretty convincing shit and so I would love to get your takes on this um Michael Jackson you a fan I mean dude I thought Michael Jackson was the shit see dude when you guys don't understand it's like in the 80s if you were a little kid you you all the little kids ran around one glove line yeah yeah I mean I was like to have yours no I dropped it in a urinal and who urinal oh shit yeah and then I put it back on I got trouble yeah and put it down yeah yeah yeah all right well so there is a conspiracy theory that he's still alive and there's been some like I guess new evidence and shit coming out and I just let's wash the clip and you tell me what you think because I it's pretty it's pretty convincing all right all right so here's the clip let's check this out have you ever seen this video of the corner's van that supposedly had Michael Jackson's body and it didn't know it was being filmed this guy thought he was going to capture them wheeling him out and instead you captured this okay now I was very skeptical when I first saw this so I had to do what I do and I did my investigative work 1 2 7 602 remember that number so what I did is I went and I scoured the internet and I found actual news footage of a helicopter filming the body of Michael Jackson going into a corner's van and you'll never guess what I found let's take a look at that number do we remember 1 2 7 602 then just in case your memory is not good helicopter garage 1 2 7 602 now for me this isn't enough to just automatically assume he's still alive but when you keep digging you'll see this guy's name is Dave Dave and he is supposedly even a friend of Michael Jackson's and then you ever heard him speak and there were all these palm cardney records all of this the girl's mind and you know this and that 13 so well so appearance and on TV shows and there were all these palm cardney records all that it yeah Dave Dave Dave yeah I mean if you're going to pick a name after you go for Michael Jackson Dave Dave that does seem like a Michael Jackson move that does seem like a move bro he's an eccentric dude look I look go back to the Dave Dave fuck I don't know the van thing is weird I mean dude you know look bro I mean look at all the AI that's being used right now you know what I'm saying like dude it's so hard to know that's the problem dude we're never going to know what's true what's not true ever again I mean he gets better and better every day yeah the AI shit yeah it's insane yeah so I don't know man I mean the guy definitely looks kind of like he could be like a older Michael Jackson I'm sure that was what 20 years ago when did Michael Jackson die right like 2003 I think it was like 2009 or 2009 no it was like 2013 somewhat yeah I don't know something no two that yes when was it I'm just yelling numbers now 2009 shit a long time ago I don't miss bitch don't you got a picture like that too somewhere I do yeah just like me I knew you had my diet was like I think my diet was just covering for you because I know for a fact I've seen yes I pose just like that just like this if you don't have it I know I tried to ask my diet he covered for you hold on I guess I said it to you I'm gonna throw it in right now yeah that shit's awesome oh no you gonna throw that in there yeah I did a better than fucking Michael a little Andy Richie in there you know I'm saying man who did this hello who did that damn everybody was posing like that back then the fuck yeah bro that's how we did that's my real hair just let's just so close I like it I like it too bro I like it yeah I'm about to grow that shit back out I can't I can't I wouldn't yeah I mean that look at that guy look at that I mean that's that's pretty swaggy that looks like AI to me yeah I look like he's trying to steal my sauce is what it was yeah yeah yeah yeah him and Dave Dave Dave Dave fucking Dave Dave guys tell us what you guys think I mean listen the Vansheds weird but let us know down in the comments what you guys think is MJ still MJ and guess that's a yeah all right um well in this cti of course and of course we got some some some great great things to connect and talk about if you guys are interested in seeing any of these articles pictures links videos go to Andy for cellar.com we link all of that stuff there for you um and what that being said headline number one let's talk about it um trumpet musk little tag team duo there uh trump musk interview five biggest takeaways from the 2024 presidential election to the us border crisis um so this was a big deal and there there was some interesting things that happened with this uh Fox News article they covered some of the big takeaways from it um it was a two hour uh talk on one of the Twitter spaces x spaces was about two hours and they covered a multitude of different topics one of the things that uh that was confirmed during that interview is that trump said he's gonna go back to pencil uh to to Butler Pennsylvania where the assassination attempt happened um which I thought was you know it's interesting I don't know if that's like uh I don't know what the what the point of that would be but you know that's apparently one of the biggest takeaways that Fox News took um one of the other things that I love to to hear and he's doubled down on this many of times um is his talks on the deportation of illegals in this country he doubled down on this as we're gonna have the largest deportation in the history of this country um trump told musk at one point during the interview that quote we are going to have the largest deportation in the history of this country and quote we have no choice in quote now the remark came as the conversation was focusing on the challenges posed by a legal immigration at the us mexico border uh quote we're already overwhelmed Elon we are overwhelmed trump said um and another key thing uh policy wise that he brought up was uh he wants to get rid of the the department of education and the federal level put it back to the states and states kind of oversee that process yeah i see the left freaking out about that today freaking the fuck out yeah but the funny thing is is that you know since 1980 when it was uh put in there's not a single statistical category that is measurable that shows that we went up since 1980 every single category are kids us we Americans have done worse and worse and worse since that time and every area that's right there's not a single category now one there's not a single statistical argument that you can make that the department of education has been a success well i mean here here's a broader question for you name me one thing that our federal government does well like we like it's complete take our money that's about it yeah you know i'm saying like that is literally about it they lot of us they still are money they use it on bullshit there's nothing that is efficient that our federal that's by design bro they're not listening they they don't these people do not talk privately about doing things that benefit us at all and private they're always talking about okay we did this we get this we can get this much more money like it's all scheming dude none of these people care about us at all no now one of the interesting things that i saw pulled out of this connect on some dots here is it hours before this interview okay hours before this interview there was a press briefing at the White House where a Washington Post reporter suggests the White House censor misinformation from Trump Musk interview at the press briefing so a reporter from the Washington Post openly suggested that the Biden White House censor so-called misinformation from the interview between Elon Musk and former president Donald Trump during Monday's press briefing the Washington Post cleave witson witson witson witson witson witson witson witson junior here's a junior but he evoked musk musk is highly anticipated viral conversation with Trump that night insisting misinformation is not a campaign issue but an American issue as well let's check this clip out Elon Musk is slated to interview Donald Trump tonight on oh wait that's definitely a wooot yeah yeah woody woody damn man that's it that's his noisy makes train coming choo choo i'm gonna stop the train tonight with my booty let's see if you could bust through this barrier hope you don't miss this information watch out for the black hole this dude yeah yeah okay sorry Elon Musk has slated to drink the tap water tonight on on x i don't know if the president is going to tune in go for this say if he is or not but i i think that misinformation on twitter is not just a campaign issue it's a you know it's an American issue what role does the white house or the president have and sort of stopping that or stopping the spread of that or sort of intervening in that some of that was about campaign misinformation but you know it's a wider thing right yeah no i mean if you've heard us talk about this many times from here about the responsibilities that social media platforms have when it comes to misinformation disinformation don't have anything to read out from here about specific ways that we're working on it but we believe that that they have the responsibility these are private companies so we're also mindful of that too but look it is i think it it is incredibly important to to call that out as you are you're doing i just don't have any specifics on on what we've been doing internally as we as it relates to the interviews and that's something that i'm tracking and i'm sure the president is not tracking it either yes we should not allow people to talk about anything that doesn't go along with what we say and what we believe and anybody who has a dissenting point of view or a question or a statement is clearly propagating misinformation and we must stop it right what's that sound like to you that's i was like communism yeah these people are already showing their fucking cards bro and and and i got the NPCs who are behind them who can't fucking tie their own shoes being like yeah sensorum okay well then what are you gonna do when they start coming after you because that's what they come after next they come after the useful idiots you're the useful idiot because you can't think critically and you because you don't like trump and because you don't like elan you believe that they should be censored and that makes you part of their little army that's what they're counting on but what these people failed to understand is is that the minute that they get in power complete control which dude if Kamala gets in with this fucking walls guy that they're listen these people are fucking openly communist all right they're trying to redefine her policies now to look moderate because they understand that that far left shit doesn't work right now but promise you once they get in it's right back to that and uh what what these people failed to understand because they're so low IQ they just are you know people like just say all these people on the right or low IQ or these people if they're not with all this stuff like to look dude you're the dumb motherfucker look at your life okay well we'll talk about how low IQ you are you're fucking broke you depend on the government for everything you don't contribute to anything you want my shit and everybody else is shit that it all worked real hard for and you think you're the fucking high IQ person no you're the problem here okay and these people failed to realize history because they are so fucking stupid and so lazy then not only can they not provide for themselves or even go out and attempt to provide for themselves and they want to vote your shit into their pockets these people can't understand history okay and in history they take people like you right after they get in power and they fucking kill them because you are useless you don't contribute to anything you don't produce anything and in communism that's the whole idea everybody's supposed to produce but it doesn't work that way and these people are putting themselves in danger by rooting for this yeah like that guy mr. Rudy woot he has no fucking idea what he's fucking talking about no he like he he has no idea he just hates Trump it hates the right and he doesn't understand like bro these people that you're rooting for getting power they're going to look at you and say hey mr. wooty what can you do besides getting drilled in the fucking ass and he's going to say well I can report the real information and they're going to say not good enough boom face the wall that's what the fuck they do bro and here's the interesting thing about this because you know they have spoken on this misinformation this information they they they spoke like this has been a highlight for them right they always talk about this I thought that her answer was a little bit weird though right because like it was almost like she was trying to avoid that conversation now imagine this was like Monday afternoon yeah of course they are and and it was it was interesting because right at the start of that interview between Trump and Eli what oh they had a DDL DDOS attack I thought that was that's weird that's not weird that's it's not weird they fucking tried to prevent this from actually happening dude and so yeah so like imagine how fragile and let me point this out too if they were ahead like they say they are and Kamala was as popular as they say she is this fucking lady went from 27% approval to $300 million raised in a fucking week and now they're spending all the money on ads on paid actors hold on pay their they're running ads in the cities for paid actors they're having these artists play at her fucking venues those are million dollars performance artists okay they're paying them they're paying people to show up at shit they're spending all this money on social media influencers millions of millions of millions of millions of dollars to create this perception that she's so popular when everybody fucking three weeks ago was like this lady is borderline fucking like who is she yeah like you know like what even fucking newer huh brother no they hated her dude she's she's a hateable character no different than Hillary Clinton yeah and and dude if they were ahead the way they pretend to be then why did they be worried about this right why are they worried about what Trump says if you're whooping his ass and and there's no chance for Trump to win and everything is going great why are you worried about this why are you worried about that no if they're crazy in misinformation and everybody knows it why are you worried about that no right because it's not misinformation you're the these people are the misinformation and dude everybody seen it for the last three years the problem is is that we have a group of people who fucking hate Trump and Elon so much they're willing to do anything they're willing to tell any lie they're willing to break any law they're willing to compromise any semblance of our constitution thinking that they are the patriots they think that anything they do is justified because we got a save our democracy and when they say save our democracy they're not talking about what you think democracy is they're talking about their corrupt system that they are a part of that robs and pillages and impoverishes the American citizen they are not talking about what you think a republic is a democracy is they're thinking you're gonna fuck up our game and they just call it a democracy okay it has nothing to do with you how's the democracy treating you how's the democracy treating your family how's the democracy treating your wallet how was it better than it was four years ago right dude damn it's here here's a quote mark pink it says it's dems fighting to save democracy from two massive disruptors and Elon's like yeah no I mean they were able to get it under under hand and I think even despite this is to listen to it so I'm I'm just going off what you say yeah I mean it was awesome and you know and despite even despite the disruptions despite you know this DDoS attack that that happened they still were able to generate almost a billion views yeah yeah and there was one dude one of these leftists I forgot what his name was he posted he's like Trump such a liar they this is what they always say Trump such a liar lies about everything he says there's 60 million people listening right now and there's only one million and that comes out like literally fucking five minutes later that there was a billion people listening to the fucking thing and billion yeah a billion uh that's what I actually posted it out they said uh between 747 PM and 1047 PM Eastern time president Donald Trump's space post received 73 million views during the same period there were four million posts about Elon Musk and president Trump's conversational next generating a total of 998 million views that is ridiculous yeah I mean that's some horsepower well and that's and dude it's it's important to note this right okay now let's put Kamala on oh let's do it let's put Kamala on with um you know whoever Mark Cuban let's put let's put them on okay because Cuban size with them yeah let's put them on and uh we'll see how many views they get yeah how about that let's just do it right and because this is important data to consider because what they're doing with this propaganda campaign is falsely promoting her to seem like she's within striking distance of Trump so that when the election gets stolen it's somewhat believable and there's not a revolt so 100% yeah that's what that's about 100% and I think people know better already they already know they know what their play is that was the whole I think that was a whole purpose of this interview was to actually like show what real horse power dude a thousand percent it's like what Trump did going into 2020 election nobody talks about this where every day yeah for 30 days in a row bro he did he this is you know Biden's in his basement or he's in a gymnasium with 12 fucking people in six foot circles right which we now know was just made up shit Trump did outdoor and indoor rallies for the 30 days leading up to the election anywhere from 50 to 100,000 people a night yeah he did that for this reason to show the optics right yeah and I mean like you bro a billion fucking views you can't fake that man this was Trump's reaction posted a view with Elon Musk yes it could just record that conversation and first it would have been excellent I hope we can have something like that today well I think we will I'm pretty sure we will and congratulations because I see you broke every record in the book with so many millions of people and it's an honor we view that as an honor yeah so I mean he was happy with it and what does the Harris campaign respond with oh of course they tried to rip it I'm in a statement by a Harris campaign spokesperson Joseph Castello he said quote Trump's entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself self obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a live stream in the year 2024 now obviously again I'm sure that was before it came out that it was a billion people that tuned into to watch this but other things that they touched on during this conversation was the economy global warming the fell assassination attempt Trump's belief in God the Harris is coup against president Joe Biden that's a bigger deal than being made right now that's gonna become a much bigger deal yeah well I mean bro I mean like I said thing the whole respect you know we have to save democracy no no I'm saying that's going to be a key issue moving forward in the next hundred days that the coup that they pulled it the yeah yeah well I mean because like that's that's what I'm saying like that's the thing like you know they say save democracy yet nobody had a piece or part of that democratic process even vote for this woman in you know and that absolutely was a strong armed move yeah um they talked about AI talked about the Ukraine more they talked about coronavirus but to your point man let's get common on there let's see what happens Elon invited there well they'll get a lot of views of Elon does it yeah for sure but it won't be that it still won't be it well I don't think I don't think I'll be in a fraction of that I don't think it comes close yeah um yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think I would that being said let's go cruise some of these comments check some of these out I love our people yeah I do too I love all you know what I love the best about our people bro number one they all have an achievers mindset they could be just starting out they could be digging themselves out of a hole they could be facing adversity but they're trying to be better and they're trying to set an example and that's admirable bro the reason our country is a fucking shit hole right now is because people stop trying and I've seen over the last four years are people specifically whether it be 75 hard or the podcast people or you know live hard or first form people they've taken a direct they they've taken in a direct attack on improving their own lives and understanding that this is what changes the world and dude it's incredible it's it's just super inspiring to me and then the other thing about these people is that when when people talk shit on us they fucking hammer him yeah and I love it I see it all over the internet it's awesome yeah by the way I'm actually met two of our listeners uh down and down when I was out of Mexico oh yeah uh Nathan was one and Courtney was the other uh that I both met rock in there rocking the hats man yeah yeah it was awesome bro I think it's cool to see the hats everywhere bro that's cool I see everywhere I see him everywhere and you know dude it's it's like it's like first form right like when you see someone wearing that logo or wearing the the bison logo you already know like what kind of person that is we're both on the list that's right yeah for sure yeah for sure yeah man but uh but our people are fucking we're gonna change the fucking world bro we it's just gonna take a little bit of time yeah I promise you um my people are awesome so let let's check into some of these comments as first comment comes from uh could can canisola Schneider uh she says blocking you blocking who you me yep what I do I don't know but you did something oh she's blocking you okay to which uh remira's 361 says nobody cares nobody does care and then uh warrior pig said truth hurts yeah I mean they're taking them they're going live yeah that's being nice yeah that's being nice I mean our people are pretty savage yeah I mean they can get hot and that should be in so sensitive bro that you hear someone's opinion that doesn't align with yours and you're like block yeah like imagine how stupid you have to be and not even listen like how fucking intelligent can you be if you're not willing to at least listen to what the other people are saying or you can reasonably even articulate why you believe in something without well that's somebody you know I've been saying that for fucking years and you know people steal it but you know I've been saying this for years and years you know if you can't explain in detail why you believe what you believe you don't have beliefs you've been programmed that's the reality so you know these people can't argue their beliefs at all so their their responses to throw a tantrum or block like look at how they respond in public whenever these people ask them questions you know usually they start screaming or literally acting like an infant child like you know they put their fingers in their ears and start making it's like dude you're fucking 35 years old you know I'm saying like get off the ground yeah it's weird dude are you doing yeah well no so I cool I hope people I hope people like you do wait so you mean you you didn't see like you didn't get no notification when she blocked you didn't try to like actually dude I did and it ruined my whole day got it I went through massive depression I I made like a bunch of posts about it and you know it's just I felt bullied you know what I'm saying like I felt excluded I felt bullied I felt attacked and you know it's just I can't believe that we live in this country and it's just I see you yeah I feel she that's verbal abuse I'm offended for you yes that is verbal abuse that's abuse she's abusing me hmm blocking you all right next comment comes from Matt soul Matt Soul God Matt Soul God he said I've been watching and listening since 2020 the favorite part about Andy is that he is richest fuck he doesn't need to be doing this he could be on a yacht somewhere enjoying life but no he genuinely cares about America and wants it to prosper props to Andy and DJ for doing this amazing show and props to the real ones who aren't hose and show the show yeah and that is exactly that is fucking 100% accurate fact checked yeah um I am rich as fuck okay and I don't need to be doing this and I'm not saying that to be an asshole yeah I'm saying it because it's a matter of fact I work my ass off for 25 fucking years to be here okay and I earned everything I have and nothing came easy for me all right for what it came easy I had had in five years or fucking two weeks like these internet dumb fucks tell everybody okay I've worked my fucking ass off but I've also understood that the reason I was able to work my ass off and get where I'm at is because of the country that we live in and the fertile soil that I my generation had available to them and now because I can see that being destroyed I feel an obligation to speak up about these things to stand for these things because there's 20 year old or 18 year old Andy's out there that are going to go create shit and changes the fucking world and if we are generation doesn't stand up and say hey fuck this and fuck these people and we're going to make this country what it should be those people will never have a chance and do that matters to me because what if I was born 20 years later right like it be a different game and I'm not saying you can't still win because you can but what I'm saying is is if we go too much further you won't be able to and that's what I'm fighting for I'm fighting for the people that I feel obligated to fight for who are 19 20 21 22 and also you know they could be older in life people who have decided that they want to become the best version of themselves and contribute and build and create you know the American dream and that matters to me a lot and I'm not ignorant enough to think that um to think that you know I could have done that in a whole bunch of other countries because I don't think I could have and so yes that I love this comment I appreciate it because sometimes I think that people don't realize why I do this if I was doing this for money I'd make ten million dollars a year on advertising and I'd be out speaking getting paid 300 grand of fucking appearance to do speeches and shit this ain't about money to me this is about fucking fixing this country so that the people who have ambition who have drive who have the aspirations to be great are able to do so and I feel like everybody has an obligation to stand up for that whether you choose to go down the path I've gone down or a similar path or any path like we have a duty as American citizens to stand up for what this country is supposed to be and contribute in a way that builds it into the best possible country you know it's one of the problems I have with Trump's slogan make America great again I believe that the slogan should be make America greater than it's ever been all right um but I also think it's ridiculous that half the population thinks make America great again means go back to fucking 1820 you know no one's saying that you dumb mother fuckers we're saying make America dominant again we're saying make America a force to be reckoned with we're saying make America dominant in all categories and that includes the quality of life and the opportunity for the citizens no matter if they're white black Asian Latino it doesn't fucking matter if you're an American you're a fucking American and when he says make America great again which I think he could have picked a better slogan but when he says that that's what the fuck he means he doesn't mean take us back to 1820 and gather up all the black people and make them fucking like shut the fuck up you guys are full of shit yeah I complain about this shit anyway huh all they were doing is complaining about this shit anyway bro these people don't want fucking freedom they don't because dude if they're free then it exposes their lack of ambition and work ethic and drive right they want to be dependent on the government because then they don't have an excuse for not achieving things you understand these people don't want to have control over their own lives because they're not willing to do the things to control their own lives so because they're weak and because they're sloppy and have no ambition no drive no want no will to do anything they think that nobody should be able to do that and everybody that does do that owes them some sort of fucking you know keep porous yeah get the fuck out of here bro where were you the last 25 years when I was working my fucking ass off seven days a week which I still do okay I still do it where were you and all these times when I was fucking close to going out of business sitting at home thinking about blowing my brains out because I fucking didn't know if we're gonna make it right where were you during all those stressful times oh you weren't anywhere you were fucking off dying your hair pink and purple and fucking protesting some bullshit fuck you you don't deserve any of what I've done ever if I choose to help you that's a different thing and Americans are very generous and that's a great thing but the reality is the government isn't and you root for the government to take my shit and they don't intend to give you any of it because you're a fucking idiot and you're useless it's real shit man guys we appreciate you for being real ass fans make sure you guys continue to like continue to comment continue to share and make sure you guys hit that bell notification on the tube to stay up to date with the latest episodes for real as fuck you know get a fucking degree of gender studies and queer theory and I can't figure out why I can only be a barista here's your chai te latte bam yeah that's that that's the job you get with that degree motherfucker what comes with it yeah maybe you should thought this through a little bit I require critical thinking guys Andy headline number two uh let's dive in on this switching that's happening right now with Camamola headline number two reads exclusive trump crushes Kamala Harris with list of flip flops from fracking border defunding police and more uh so former president Donald Trump the Republican nominee for president 2024 said presumptive democratic uh presidential nominee vice president Kamala shit man that's a that's a that's like a common the Kamala Harris like that sentence well I mean shit she doesn't enjoy mouthful hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm you said it I did I meant to do it's true uh but long story short she's been getting caught out and I think it's actually something I'm very happy to see um because I don't feel like it has been exposed enough this like flip flop of like uh oh I said this and then oh I never said that uh like oh band fracking on day one oh no we're gonna frack I love fracking that's you know like that's essentially what she said um but uh and and Trump basically ended it with saying you know I don't I don't think that's gonna fly um and that she can't even do a press conference no you know why she's not doing press conference bro 22 days it's it's not just that she can't like people are saying oh she can't uh read off and tell it that's not that's not it that's that's true that's not it though yeah here's what it is we started press conference what's the first question I'm gonna ask Kamala you're making all these promises about what you're gonna do when you get into office you're already in office so why the fuck aren't you doing them and she has no defense for that question so she's afraid to be out in public because that one question she can't answer it'll end it it'll end it right yeah fuck yes she can and it's interesting uh the New York Post did you see so time magazine do you see that cover they did oh yeah hurt her moment mm-hmm it's her moment you mean that was like the Hillary cover Madam President right yeah madam sit yo ass down yeah that's what happened but uh I do like this little little clap back the New York Post put out uh Kamma Camillean Kamma Kamma Kamma Kamma Kamma Camille you know the you know the one no yeah it's a song from when from back in the day when we had good music not to shit you fuckers listen did in there I Joe Joe you were jamming and that shit weren't you yeah okay you never heard that I feel like I've heard on like a TikTok thing or something all right just keep going all right um but uh but the truth is finally coming out and I think people are starting to realize like yeah like no she's still in office like she still has some some power why isn't she doing any of this um but this flip flopping on you know the policies and things that she said she would do and now she's not gonna do them or things that she said she wasn't gonna do now she's saying she is um one of the weird things that did come out here recently is that uh even mainstream media is starting to pick that up and uh starting to admit that uh this headline reads politico admits borders are Harris resisted taking ownership of the migration well some vice president Kamma Harris refused to help fix president Joe Biden's Bortacle Apps in 2021 said the head of news at politico a pro-establishment media site in Washington D.C. The useful admission was presented on August 10th by Alexander Burns underneath a headline saying smash the gangs what Harris can learn from left wing UK Prime Minister Kiar Starma yeah she can learn how to arrest your citizens for the same shit you motherfuckers in England are dumb as fuck I was a real bro like I my my friends my friends that I know I like them all right but the rest of you are dumb and how many comments have I gotten over the last fucking 15 years on the internet you Americans in your guns do you get it yet you stupid motherfuckers there's not fun I'm not laughing it's not funny you Americans are obsessed with guns yes yeah that's a reason yeah you're learning it first hand and it's a tough one tough lesson to learn that's what you get for thinking you're morally superior yeah which are fucking beans and toast and yeah and you're fucking terrible teeth what I look I like England bro I love London I've been through I've been all over England I fucking think it's a beautiful place but the people there they don't they don't get it like they think that they thought they were untouchable because they have a thousand fucking or how I don't know 2000 year empire right like or whatever we our country is young we're only a couple hundred years old we have a very good understanding of what firearms are useful for you guys don't remember like beating their asses in 1776 yeah you think they would have learned that time America USA USA no uh but it is interesting but now the truth is starting to really be exposed and picked up by all different sides and I think that's very very important there's some weird stuff that's gonna be happening I think in the next next few weeks man with this you know but the the borders are they're finally admitting that this clip has been circulating of when Joe Biden actually don't hurt the borders are let's check this clip out I've asked her the VP today because she's the most qualified person to do it to lead our efforts with Mexico in the northern triangle and the countries that help we're gonna need help in stemming the movement of so many folks stemming the migration to our southern border yeah and actually did you know that it's officially it was called the the Biden Harris administration immigrant this is not even arguing about that listen these motherfuckers open the border intentionally and then worked with the NGOs and using our tax dollars to dude if you go down the path to central America there's all kinds of organizations that are helping these people migrate up here okay and they come they come from this country all right those people are getting donated to buy who do you think okay all the main fucking left wing donors the sorrows people the fucking all of them okay then they get here and what do they do they villainize the border patrol they they tell the border patrol all they're whipping migrants you know like they don't allow the border patrol do their job and now they're trying to act like they aren't completely responsible for this because they fucking went they made a bill for border control three and a half years into their foot after 20 million mother fuckers came across the border that had like a hundred billion extra dollars for Ukraine that all the Republicans voted down and now they're saying Trump caused this right Trump wanted to build a border while when he was in office for five billion dollars and it got denied because they said they couldn't afford it we could have built these are fucking listen these are fucking facts but um the kids in cages guess who did that that was fucking Obama Obama and by the way I don't even think it was a bad policy because what they were doing was trying to separate kids from people to verify that the people belong to those kids and vice versa so like even though I'm not with Obama's shit it still wasn't a bad policy yeah you know but not cages you know maybe like dog crates I've probably I mean it yeah I'm just saying like these people are fucking full of shit the stupid yeah these are the same people that see an info-murshaw a fucking nighttime for fucking like you know okay I got this cream it'll help your fucking vagina not smell so bad and they order fucking 4,000 cases of it you know I'm saying like by the way are those not the worst commercials out there the vagina cream will have it seen that one person oh dude it's just an information like yeah do you have a sticky snatch rub this cream on it you won't have one anymore you call now it's for it's for pits and feet and prilates and then they show like the feet and like it's just fucking I'm sure these people are making billions of dollars yeah it's gross they're winning and they are winning but that's because most of us got sticky basses let's make our own information I think we should make one every month let's do it yeah well what we got we got to get some products I mean look from a business standpoint they're geniuses I'm just gonna say but it grosses me the first off it from low credit score it's supposed to be gross that's the thing it's supposed to be gross because you're supposed to be like yeah I bet that like you're supposed to look and be like man she looks like she smells bad yeah like bro I mean from I don't know I mean whatever dude anyway avoid the stinky pee I'm being so racist in my head right now why because I got them perfect and from what is it let it rip let's hear I'll help you you suffer from low credit scores I can't do it I can't do it I can't I won't do it do you suffer from low credit scores well how about this how about pay your shit off what a black off what's daily top cookers what you sound like biting over there what do you say the ones daily what black off the ones daily topical solution that's that shit so see you speak into Michael Jackson he used that shit to you that's why you had to quit bro he couldn't dance anymore well we're now you get two free tubes oh man um all right back through it yeah get serious here off my uh that would be fucking funny this is rubbing mayonnaise on you show a dude like fucking dancing this shit all good and he puts some mayonnaise on him he starts like uh the hit you know that hip-hop video you're talking about oh with that white lady oh yeah yeah I got like this oh you do oh I got some for you all right yeah all right let's work on our infomercials well we'll run him dude dude I think no we'll run him on Fox News I want to do like a little afro week without here's a deal whatever infomercial we make we have to actually run it hmm I like it yeah let's do it I'll pay for it oh yeah yeah yeah spot me yeah all right um what if we made one of those a rant during the Super Bowl and then made it an ad for real af we beat no more podcasts in the world for five minutes bro great yeah but uh but here's one other thing too that she's been flipped I mean she's flipped up on a lot of stuff now she hasn't been doing any type of pressers any type of interviews nothing there's been zero policies that she's listed on the website um and remember zero primary votes right go on back to that coo thing um but here's a very weird thing that I saw happen so a couple of weeks ago you know when Trump this was back in June by the way when Trump announced that you know one of the policies he would try to implement would be this uh uh you would vow to stop taxing tips right like no no tax on tips for service like you know for waste wait staff and stuff like that right um and CBS news ran this article with the headline ready former president trumps vowed to stop taxing tips but cost the federal government up to $250 billion over 10 years according to a non-partisan watchdog group okay and then and then kind of a Harris comes out like two days ago saying that she would implement the the exact same plan okay and this is what CBS news has to say about Harris vice president Kamala Harris is rolling out a new policy position saying she'll fight to in taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers yeah yeah bro listen they don't show any of the shit to these people like they don't these people don't see Trump saying any of the shit they keep them off the media they keep them you know any put like do look what they just did with you learn we're trying to get it removed they they do not want their listeners to hear or anything Donald Trump says so they they think they're counting on oh well they didn't hear it from Trump and then when Trump says I said that first I'm gonna say oh fuck look at Trump trying to take my shit take the black one machine fucking white supremacy you know I'm saying and by the way how's it gonna cost see this is why you dumb motherfuckers like you CBS stupid media fucks how's it gonna cost the government $250 billion dollars to how how how yeah that means there's $250 billion less that they would get it doesn't actually cost them that because you would actually fire $250 billion worth of fucking processing labor to balance that out and we would shrink the government you dumb motherfuckers it's a great thing yeah oh we're not getting revenue over here well then we fucking fire those people make sense to me well you could tell these people have a run a company dude and here's the other thing how the fuck do we vote for anybody ever that has not run a fucking company in their life to run the country the country is one big giant company it's the most complicated company on the planet the people that running it are should not be lawyers and social activists they should be business people who understand fucking business oh it's gonna cost the federal government to yeah if you keep fucking employing these people don't do shit right right right and uh but but here's even the the the the the the the the dumb remember thing on this is that you know this whole tax on tips thing for for every fucking $250 billion they cut off the government that's $250 billion dollars back in your fucking pockets you dumb motherfuckers like what the fuck you shrink the government down to as small as possible that it can even just operate its regular business and the rest of the money stays with you but you're gonna vote for a bigger government got it yeah but here's the interesting thing I mean we talk about these flip flops right so it's now she saying as she wants you know no tax on tips it's definitely coming from Trump she's throwing it from them um shocking um but if you go I would fucking destroy these people on the fucking microphone I would fucking destroy them I can't wait till 2028 when I'm on the fucking debate stage because I will fucking destroy these people bro but but here's the thing I don't know I mean it's it can't be dementia or short term memory loss but fuck man like not too long ago Kamala Harris was actually the person who casted the deciding vote to let the IRS tax workers like that didn't happen that long ago but but that was her she's the one that did the like here's the clip of her banging the fucking gavel the age of 50 the nasa 50 the senate being equally divided the vice president votes from the affirmative and the bill as amended is passed since we're on the headline here for people listening on audio says Kamala Harris cast the tie breaking vote for the inflation reduction act which hired 87,000 IRS agents and then launched a tip reporting site they also started taxing people on their fucking pay pals over $600 so those 87 thousand IRS agents how much that cost for the next fucking 20 years right okay you see what I'm saying like bro people don't understand how to balance they don't understand a financial statement they don't understand a balance sheet they don't understand how to run a company they have no fucking clue but because this person is a certain skin tone or because she's a certain gender they fucking vote for him like bro all you baby boomer fucking old people like you don't vote for what's going to benefit your kids or they're fucking grandchildren you know I'm saying like dude it's it's disgusting it's stupid and bro by the way I'm not saying I'm not some fucking Donald Trump I'm I'm an intelligent person that understands we have two options right now we have option a which is fucking uh go to communism eventually or real option B have Trump run the shit like he knows how to run it which we've already seen he knows how to run it and deal with some fucking stupid fucking bedside manner that he has in an ego that he has I the guy has earned his ego okay nobody in the media gives him credit nobody says anything nice about him so when he goes up on the microphone he has to brag and it comes across as bragging that's what happens when everybody's against you and they won't let you fucking even have their reporting right right prime example you know yes is it a yes is it be here you guys could say whatever you want about Trump but dude if he doesn't tell you nobody tells you no but so you're pointing about slipping down and then later another four years from now guess what we're gonna have the country's gonna go a certain direction and it's gonna produce two more candidates and then we're gonna have a decision there we get to go left or we get to go right and we get to say okay how we do it now what's working for us should we go this way or should we go that way and then we make another decision we don't just decide based upon what they've tricked us into identifying with on a Democrat I'm a Republican I'm black so I vote Democrat I'm white so I vote Republican like this is the dumbest shit and we're all being played to think that we have to identify with one or the other we don't what we have to do is educated voters is make the best choice that we have right now and just because someone says they want to vote for Donald Trump doesn't mean that there's some sort of Trump cultist like there's a lot of people out here that understand like fuck dude you know I'm going on the highway I could choose to pass this car and get go a little faster or I could choose to ride behind them for 300 miles though I have two choices like this is all this is and they got a lot of bumper stickers on the back of their car too yeah oh bro I forgot to tell you fucking store it I tell you later it's about one of those people though and it was while you were out of town oh fuck yeah everything good yeah yeah so well here's I'll tell you the story yeah so I was driving the the she-ron home and you know it has my my I drive a Bugatti all right and fucking has a life place as MFCEO on it okay that pisses people to fuck off which I don't give a shit because I've been working 25 years to fucking have what the fuck I have and I like it are you RSEO yeah well I'm not anymore I'm chairman now oh we got change of place yeah but anyway MFCE is part of the deal so anyway this lady I passed this lady who's got 50,000 fucking you know Obama Kamala and all this bullshit coexist shit yeah y'all motherfuckers want to coexist but then she pulls up next to me and starts fucking screaming out her window taking video of my car so you know what I did I videoed her back yeah I videoed her back bro and she fucking hated it oh she got so pissed off I just rolled the window down and pointed my phone at her and she's like you're the problem oh I'm the problem I'm the one creating jobs in your community you dumb bitch like fuck I'm sponsoring all the fucking sports teams all these people that around dude we provide fucking thousands of jobs nationwide I'm the fucking problem what do you do right by bumper sticker fuck you yeah right oh that was great it was dude I was you know me I was laughing I asked something yeah that's fucking awesome the best thing you do is laugh at those people oh yeah they get she gonna pop a testicle oh yeah she did have some of that on there too yeah but to your point man about this you know I choosing these two paths I'm glad you brought it up because it is a very very important important decision to make and I think it's important that people are informed and well educated behind it and don't forget what happened yeah so if we go back a little bit you know everybody knows Tim Walsh is his name he's been you know no balls walls no balls walls he's been chosen as the VP for the Democrats allegedly he's been selected but you know and he's from the great state of Minnesota right how was Minnesota how do they do with the covid stuff well I believe that they you know were tyrannical fucking crazy people well it's I think that's exactly how they were I also believe that during the George Floyd riots that he let them do it he actually gave a command that said I believe the quote was give it up yeah to his own fucking police force right meaning give it give up the city to the writers like yeah don't try yeah don't even don't even attend which is interesting because you know then when when the covid shit you know was with full effect he gave a different set of orders to those police officers let's go back and and check out what was happening in 2020 when he put all of his major cities on curfews check this video out and if you pay attention you'll hear the police say get in the house there's several commands and then you'll hear light them up and then that's when you get the the fire we'll play it again you know this is I've never seen this before you ever seen this get in get in get in get in get in get in these fucking fucks went around city shooting people with paintballs to get in their house yes and you want to fucking elect this motherfucker vice president United States very well listen to those fucking cops yell at people bro bro who the fuck do you fucking think you are bro I pay your fucking salary dude but then the protesters that are burning down they don't do shit nothing happened it's interesting last little thing bro you these cops you guys who were cops because I know a lot of you listen to show you better start standing up to this shit oh that's gonna come a time with them they're gonna have yes they're gonna have to this fucking unbelievable I never saw this ever bro it's wild it's wild and that was directly from the governor's office that was a direct order right he enforced that fucking curfew that was put in place I mean that's unbelievable wild it's wild last little thing I want to show you here man because again we're talking about the election election is coming up it's so interesting because this this article just came out yesterday um check this headline Pennsylvania announces election results may not be available on election night okay three three 90 days ahead of time interesting the Pennsylvania Department of State has announced that the results of the states upcoming election will not be known on election night and they put out this little interesting tweet with a nice little that has to be some sort of illegal dude there's something wrong with that no because they're trying to know how much votes they need to win and then any manufacturing votes here's a tweet that they put out this is from the official account for the PA Department of State says uh Pennsylvania's won't always know the final results of all races on election night any changes uh in results that occur as counties continue to count ballots are not evidence that an election is rigged see the foolex explanation here man you're fuck dude it's unbelievable they're gonna cheat no shit they're gonna cheat no shit they're gonna cheat they're gonna cheat it's gonna listen dude a lot of people that want Trump to win they think they got it in the bag you don't have it in the bag because they're gonna cheat in a massive scale and the only way that Trump can win an election is by every single fucking person every single person going out voting every single one and if you're listening to this show and you know you're planning on voting you have a American duty to figure out who your friends are that may not vote or may not be inclined to vote and get them to fucking vote with you the problem here is that everybody thinks because it's so crazy that it's just common sense that Trump's gonna win that's not true that is not true you guys do not understand they are going to cheat way worse than they cheated in fucking uh 2020 and if you don't have these your friends the family everybody out in force to vote they will fucking win all these rural areas all you gun owners and hunters and shit that don't vote and you think oh I'm out here in the country they're not gonna come for me I don't care about communism because I'm just out here doing my thing you are dumb dude they will come for you they will come for you you fucking farmers out there who are farming and you can't afford to farm anymore they're already coming for you all your little farm buddies and everybody up and down the road no Joe who's 70 years old up the road you guys have to fucking vote dude it's frustrating it's fucked it months out months out don't say we didn't tell you that's all I got to say man there's an organization out here doing it vote for america.org vote for america.org go check those guys out they're they're mobilizing people on the ground to make sure everybody votes okay I can't fucking tell you this enough if you do not vote and you do not get your friends to vote and you do not get your family to vote there's a very real chance that we will become a true communist country like Venezuela okay like El Salvador was like fucking you know what's going on in all of these countries in europe and england right like dude we're in a very dangerous situation here and this is not you know I mean look man I've been urging about this for four and a half years and you guys are fucking continued you know at first you a lot of people were like dude you're fucking lost your mind blah blah blah blah blah and now all of you have seen that I'm right about almost everything I'm telling you if you do not fucking vote there's not going to be anything that anybody could do after that I can tell you this if if fucking he doesn't win I don't even know the point doing this show anymore I just go do something else because people don't care enough to fucking stand up for their own shit and I'll be real dude I'm tired of fucking getting in here at my dime at my expense and saying this shit and then people not doing anything about it you know for example like when I say share the fucking show I'm asking you to share the show because I'm doing this as a service I don't sell you anything I'm not on here selling you shit everything I do is for fucking free 75 hearts for free I don't come on here and tell you to buy my shit every day I appreciate the fuck out of it you know but I'm not on here marketing I don't run ads half the show I'm doing this because I fucking care bro and unless the people start showing that they care too bro there's not going to be people like me out there doing this people are going to say fuck it there's a whole book about this it's called Atlas Shrug okay when the producers when it gets too hard for the producers which is me to fucking produce and all these other entrepreneurs all you guys listening you're the producers when it gets too those people enough saying fuck it and they stop producing and everybody stars the economy crumbles everybody becomes dependent on the government communism usher's in and people die in mass scale and that we're close to that way closer than people think you know everybody it's the bystander effect bro everybody else thinks that everybody else is going to handle it you have to take personal responsibility you have to say my vote matters my action matters my life matters and I care about this country enough to fucking do the right thing stand for the right thing become the right thing build the right thing so that people understand what an untrue American looks like sounds like and creates over the course of their life that is an American duty as a citizen you do not just get to be whatever you want to be off the backs of dead people for the last 250 years because we're quote unquote free no that freedom comes with an obligation that obligation is is that you use the freedom that we have to become the best example that you can that is the point they pay the price and your prices to fucking honor that sacrifice and I don't understand where we got away from that or how this got off track but like dude voting is one of those things it's a fucking civic duty guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three I got to bring it back home for a second this is one that that touches pretty close so let's let's check in on it headlon reads Ferguson policeman suffers severe brain injury during protest on anniversary of Michael Brown's death all right and it's so crazy because I actually got this call while I was out in Mexico and but let's dive into because there there is some very beautiful things that are happening here that I think are important or to kind of show where the temperature of the people are at but just a little backstory so a police policeman of Ferguson Missouri was severely hurt Friday during a protest held on the 10 year anniversary of the night of Michael Brown was fatally shot by police officers several protesters were arrested near the local police station and chief Troy Doyle explained during a press conference on Saturday the demonstrators shook offense at the station KSDK reported now he gave this press conference and I actually know Doyle as well and I think it's amazing I don't know if you got a chance to see this tonight just showing you the the different place that we are in right now let's check this clip out my team got out there and was assaulted by a number of the protesters they were out there on the scene as a result one of my police officers suffered a severe brain injury he is at an area hospital right now fighting for his life and I'm gonna break away a little bit from what I was planning to talk about this police department this Ferguson police department since 2014 has been a punching bag for this community the police department back in 20 foot we don't even have them officers here anymore so what are you protesting these officers not even here no more everything that the activist community has advocated for as far as body warm cameras implicit bias training crisis intervention training all this stuff we have done all of this what are we protesting what is it we even changed the uniforms at this police department because people said that the old uniforms trigger people what are we doing 10 years late I got an officer fighting for his life it's enough and I'm done with it we're not doing it here in Ferguson our community is united behind us our community is fed up we want to heal our community want to heal we want people to peacefully protest but we damn she ain't gonna allow you to destroy this city and we ain't gonna allow you to hurt none of these police officers yeah well you know what that's you know that's a great message but that should have been message on day one since Mike Brown is a fucking criminal okay he robbed a fucking store five minutes before he was shot then he fucking reached inside of a car and tried to pull an officer's gun what do you think is going to happen to a person who does that regardless of the color of their fucking skin I know even as a dude with white skin that if I go for a cops gun I am at severe risk of being killed okay so let's fucking talk call it what it is it's total bullshit these people want to protest because they want a fucking complain about something that they have no understanding of actually I believe they do understand what I just said they don't care they don't care they just want to get out and yell and scream about fucking something and now we have a fucking police officer who's a father who's a good dude who's graded the community who's worked our events here at first form for years fighting for his fucking life in the hospital it's fucking bullshit dude it's stupid it's it's stupid and then and and it wasn't like there was a lot of protesters either bro there was like fucking 15 of them bro there's nobody yeah you know what you fucking racist fucks who fucking will go to bat for a fucking black criminal pretend like he's some sort of fucking hero when in reality those are the same motherfuckers that destroy your mother fucking neighborhood and make your neighborhood a shit hole and make it dangerous for your fucking kids but you'll march up me down the street screaming about bullshit because you fucking want to seem like you're fighting for civil rights you ain't you're full of shit no that's a thing man like I mean then they call it fucking white supremacy right really white supremacy is all the black on black shit happening these fucking neighborhoods that's white supremac get the fuck out of here it's I'm fucking done here and it dude it's stupid man it's stupid it's stupid and uh you know but I will say this because I've been checking the comments looking at the posts that's in place to post them and and it's been overwhelming support for good it's been over and like and you know people are saying like yeah I mean it's 10 years like what the fuck are we even like what the fuck are we protesting for why are you protesting at all fucking thug criminal right 10 years like I was saying that 2014 bro it's false outrage fake victimhood no that's it that's all it is man that's all it is now here is now what about the cop what was his name hearty the guy who shot Mike Brown down Wilson Wilson fucking Wilson has his life ruined he got doxed by a fucking a local a local it was I think I don't know what channel it was one of the local news stations put his fucking home address in a picture of his house on fucking television this guy's had his life ruined let me ask you something if you're a police officer and some six foot four three hundred twenty pound fucking dude done matter of these black done matter of these white reaches into your police car and starts fighting with you you gonna shoot him or not yeah I'm shooting him in a fucking face a hundred times out of a hundred and I'm not feeling fucking bad about it and neither would you no let's fucking stop the bullshit call what it is man but but here here I would say this here is the silver lining of what we're starting to see change throughout the country and I don't know if it's you know like there's here's the thing the the end goal is being accomplished it's it's who's doing it I think I might have an issue with it I'd love to get your take on it but this headline comes out progressives face an existential threat from APEC and there's nothing to stop it and I thought this was a very interesting article because the very people that supported these things like BLM and Mike Antifa you know back from 2014 2020 the George Floyd rise those very people that pushed these that allowed our cities to get burned they're now all losing how much money did APEC contribute to their campaigns oh when they got elected when they were getting them in office yeah that's why I'm saying like there there's a okay it's who and why let's talk about it do you have more on this well yeah I mean so people in specific Jamal Bowman they APEC spent $25 million just in advertising to defeat him and also Cory Bush who you know Cory Bush is from here she was right along with those riots both she was the leader of those riots and now they're losing their seats and so big mouth dumbass where she is and now they've lost her seats to which this guy right here who's in the background that's Wesley Bell single County prosecutor he just beat Cory Bush he just beat it right and and he did receive some money from APEC APEC funded his his election as well but it's it's who's funding this who is APEC and why do they want these people out because it's not because they damaged the city let me tell you got you know why here's it is they wanted to put these people in to progress the the progressive agenda which destroys American culture and when they've started realizing that these people would destroy their culture as well with the Israel Palestine shit and they all wrote it for Palestine all the sudden you know it was all we can't have these people in can have these people in they you know now they're against Israel country on the other side of the world can't have them in but they can come here and destroy this country right that's what the fuck it's about it's a problem I have an issue with this I do too I mean to me like I said I'm glad Cory Bush is out yeah I know Wesley Bell he's cool he's still he's Democrat but he's definitely not as progressive or liberal as she was you know but I still have a problem with the fact that you have this organization APEC whose main concerns and main main focus has nothing to do with this country that they are you know they're they're one of the biggest fucking funders in the world in the world but they have nothing like there's no focus on America and no shit American great but they're funding and trying to fund these campaigns and you know spend millions of dollars on ads to get these people out of seats from places that they care less no that's very simple it's it's not confusing at all the moralized America mix all the culture of America remove the Western culture from America so that we can build a new culture of globalism communist shit because that's what these people are about the minute these people started attacking them they all I can't have that fuck these people because they're going to create a movement they they understand that these people are are able to create a movement and for the last year they since October 7th last year they've been creating a movement that is anti Israel all right that's what this is about so it's okay to demoralize and destabilize and ruin American culture and American nationalism and you know American pride American cities and we could fucking ruin Western culture all across the world but the minute that we start fucking with Israel fuck you and here's the problem with that how come all these country where how many migrants did Israel take in what's how do you say none in Israel I'm just saying none but these people are all for that all over the other all over the other place in the world help fund it why is that maybe that's a question everybody should ponder you know so I guess I'm happy with the end go I'm glad Cory bushes out but like I don't like who still I don't like who's pulling the strings they shouldn't I be able to pull the fucking strings man and that's something I would like Trump to get in and talk about bro this lobbyist shit well listen he won't talk about that specific pack but the point of the matter is is that you're right it's got to be all lobbies I don't care who they should be illegal I don't want to fucking I don't want a lobby for fucking dog leashes no promoting fucking or poop bad that's the bottom line we shouldn't have any of this shit we shouldn't have any people in our country they're dual citizens with any other country period okay not Omar who's from Somalia not a whole bunch of these people who have dual citizenship with Israel none of these people should be allowed to serve in this country it should be American citizen American citizens exclusively not dual citizens if you have dual citizenship then you're not eligible yes this qualified that was fixed the entire problem and see I think they won't do that because all of these fuckers get all of their money from this pack you guys tell us what those dots connect everybody knows my nose man people are done with the fucking shit dude everybody sees it you know the internet was designed to the social media specifically was designed as a cultural weapon to to monitor citizens and demoralize people show the worst of society make people hate each other cause division all this shit and they they knew this when they started it they ran a fucking Facebook before Facebook was ever invented called a life log and on the day life log ended Facebook started the very next day you're gonna tell me that's coincidence okay one fucking day out of all the days in the history of time the CIA ends life log and Facebook starts the next day really oh I guess that's just a coincidence you know like bro this is a weapon this is a weapon to fucking do all of these things that are negative to our culture if you go read the chaos machine it looks playing it all um and yeah that's that's what we're dealing with here and it's blowing up in their face because the one good thing about social media and the internet is that it allows information to spread unabated instantly and that's why they're worried about the Trump uh must thing last night yeah now they can't stop a billion bro can't fucking stop it guys jump in on this conversation uh down in the comments let us know what you guys bro why are all these protesters fucking white people you know it's crazy fucking middle it's like these crazy white people it's always you know they're all racist too we're on here hold on you know they're all racist because they feel guilty about fucking themselves that's why they're out there Corey Bush a piece of shit I can't stand her yeah she wouldn't take my calls I called her a few times all she does is yell and scream dude you can't have a debate with her because she yells and screams like these people like I was just talking about puts her fingers in your ears and yells the scream have we ever heard her have a a
