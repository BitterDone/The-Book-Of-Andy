for seller.com you guys can find them all links there for you with that being said that number one and line the more got more pics coming out i'm actually just as a show was starting rfk got announced as a department of health and human services uh he's gonna be leading that but we got uh mat gates as a g now we have a mutual friend that we know um who was actually gonna be slated to get that position but he has stepped down but yeah mat mat gates is in now uh mat gates for attorney general top law enforcement officer in the land trump wrote a very lengthy um truth that he pushed out um and mat gates very subtle he just said it would be an honor to serve as president trump's attorney general um he's been getting some heat honestly it's kind of weird um that all of these people getting picked have been getting heat um like liberals and democrats are losing their fucking minds over these choices um which i think most people looking at him like i'm sure audience along agrees like okay i don't really have a problem with that person like that pic like yeah i mean it's like now he's making some decisions and i'm like uh yeah i mean some make sense some don't make sense some don't make sense i'm fine with mat gates yeah i think he's fine i'm also fine with to see gathered i am too uh democrats trash to see gathered after trump taps her for d and i post um and she's starting to get heat you know i'm saying it's just like of course i mean any of these people are gonna well she i think most of her heat is coming from the fact that she left that little aisle you know i'm saying that side of the aisle and like she now she's conservative yeah but i mean who better to have in a national intelligence role than someone who is going to stay true to what they think is right and wrong regardless of the label that's put onto them you know what i'm saying you know like i think the fact that Tulsi has enough backbone to stand up and say no i'm not with this anymore this is where i belong is the exact kind of person we need serving because they're not lending their loyalty to a title or a group or you know uh anything other than what is right and wrong so i actually think i think she's gonna do great i always more people would look at Tulsi and like more people that are you know we talk about these people all the time they're democrats so not super far left crazy you know i'm saying and they need some room over here i hope that they would like look at her as like a beacon of like okay it's safe like maybe we can just roll over there now you know i'm saying maybe you know i mean it is you know what's what i think is cool about this Tulsi Gabbard thing is you know she was on the fucking terror watch list you're right she's on domestic terror list and now she's coming a bunch of go man yeah and now she's a charge of all the people to put her on it that's pretty funny but i feel like there's a lot of that shit happening too just kind of just effused to the swamp we got a little bit more of that coming up in the later a little bit later but one thing i wanted to bring up that i thought was interesting um as all of this stuff is going on obviously is getting a lot of traction a lot of people watching and paying attention to it um there's always something happening in the background okay um and uh i believe that that background noise is this this headline reads uh Lauren Bobert probes UFO experts on existence of underwater alien bases on earth the american people are being kept in the dark so this was like a two and a half hour uh congressional hearing uh with experts like people that are actually in these fucking programs talking about this stuff and like nobody's talking about it now i know we we've talked about it i mean you got you know the project blue beam and stuff going on man but some of the stuff that they're saying is pretty pretty wild all right pretty wild let's dive into this a little bit um so Colorado representative Lauren Bobert has probed top UFO experts on whether aliens had quote-unquote bases in the depths of earth's oceans now during a hearing held by a subcommittee on the house oversight committee in washington dc Wednesday Bobert extra group of experts if they had any knowledge that the department of defense was involved with any secretive projects involving the manipulation of human genetics with non-human genetic material so the panel was a team of four experts okay consisting of retired navy rear admiral dr. Tim Galaday farmer d.o.d. official Luis um Elizondo farmer NASA associate administrator of space policy Michael gold and journalist Michael shellingberger um they four all testify that the government lacks transparency uh with the public regarding u.a. peas and alien life let's check this first clip out can you speak on that at all man i'm not qualified i'm certainly as a scientist or otherwise to speculate points of origin um i looked at everything from a scientific perspective so if you look for example instantaneous acceleration which was one of the observables of the program that i belonged to a tip um the human body can withstand about nine g forces for a short period of time before you suffer negative biological consequences blackouts and ultimately redouts and even death comparison our best technology the f-16 which is one of his older platform but one of our most highly maneuverable aircraft manned aircraft uh made by general dynamics can perform about 17 or 18 g forces before you start having structural failure meaning that the airframe begins to disintegrate where you're flying the vehicles we're we're talking about are performing in excess of 1,000 2,000 3,000 g's dude 3,000 g's dude not nine not nine not fucking 15 yeah three you would liquefy as a human 3,000 so like the shit that they're they're saying that they've seen that they even have 3,000 fucking g's bro instantaneous fucking travel omnidirectional 3,000 g's in the instant that's ridiculous take this other clip out well that that's like teleporting almost yeah um in in the discussions it's it's simply about material or is there a discussion about biological it was previously testified there's biologics that were collected are you aware of any of that i am sure aware of the reporting that biologics have been recovered again my focus was more nuts and bolts um looking at the the physical aspects of these phenomenon how they interacted around uh military equities and nuclear equities so i'm certainly not a medical expert um i would not be able to probably provide you a whole lot of value in that simply because i don't have the expertise but was anything described as that we have possession of bodies yes yes we have is it multiple types of creatures or sorry i couldn't answer that um i can tell you anecdotally that it was it was um discussed quite a bit when i was at the Pentagon the problem is the collect suppose a collection of these biological samples occurred before my time in fact before i was even born and was this part of the lucky martin discussion or was this complete the biologist is a completely separate um separate yet related okay um has has anyone made contact so i'm sorry could you specify has there been any to your knowledge any communication with a non human life form so the the term communication is a bit of a trick word because um there's verbal communication like we're having now at the problem is you also have nonverbal communication and so i would say definitively yes but from a nonverbal meaning when a Russian reconnaissance aircraft comes into us airspace we subscribe to f-22s and we are certainly communicating intent and capability um i think the same goes with this we have these things that are being observed over controlled us airspace um and they're not really doing a good job hiding themselves they're making it pretty obvious they have the ability to even interfere with our our nuclear equities and our nuclear readiness well there is a story from i believe the time around the bay of pigs when there was belief when kennedy was there that there was some sort of nuclear event the the cold war you know there was all shut down yeah magically that one you know um and repressed the button yeah and the fucking aliens apparently shut it down yeah that's that's one of the you know conspiracies it's documented out there yeah it is documented it is uh i mean what do you think dude pro listen a lot of this stuff here's a listen i think there's zero evidence that says they're not real right right like like it's just ignorance it wouldn't even make logical sense if we're being told the truth about the earth and the universe and the way it's set up it would make sense that there were other living beings in inhabited planets and people with better technology than us that just would make sense based on the infinite space of the universe yeah i mean dude like a lot of this stuff happened back in the 50s right like a lot of it like all the CIA classification um all most of those documents originated started back in the 50s and 60s right and then from you know from then to now it's like nobody talks about the shit you know i'm saying like even with area 51 and all the weird shit that allegedly happens out there what would be the like my only question is what would be the reason to keep Americans keep civilians keeping vanity from knowing that information probably mass panic you know um people committing mass suicide you know civil disorder civil unrest uh it would be perspective shattering for a lot of people to confront that reality i think that yeah for sure yeah i mean think about like the religious zealots like people who are completely bound by the the word of their religion whatever that religion might be right um those people would have a hard time accepting that whether they be hardcore Islam or Christian or anything else um you know we talked a little i don't know who was on the show recently we talked oh when uh Dan Holloway was on the show and we talked about the ice shelf theory um i think that was Dan Holloway at the show you know there's that movie m night shalam and did with called the village right where these people basically move to the middle of the woods in this nature preserve and taught their kids that if they go outside the nature preserve there these quote unquote monsters will kill them and when people try to escape the adults of the of the community the village dressed up as these monsters and actually killed the people that tried to escape so that it would instill fear into the village from trying to escape and so if we're being told the truth about the universe and the earth and everything it would make sense right but if we aren't being told the truth it would it could be very easily a made up story to keep us in line as well i mean we don't know because they don't disclose this information to us and uh you know we deserve to know what's going on man and and it's become it's come to a point now where they've lied about so many things and they've kept so many things in the dark and they've lied about so much history that's happened that for everything to be disclosed it would i mean look at people that are freaking out about Trump they're freaking the fuck out shave in their head now imagine that times like a hundred when they find out all this crazy shit about history not being accurate uh the origin of humanity aliens the reality of you know earth and what it is and who lives here and how we got all the technologies that we have right like it would flip people into a frenzy and so it sucks because we do deserve to know and have full disclosure but there's going to be collateral damage to people because their perspective is so ingrained in what they believe reality is right we have these people that watch msm and they believe that everything that comes across on mainstream media is true and then they look at everybody else who doesn't believe it and they think they're crazy right and so if you think you're the one that is you know grounded in reality and everybody else is crazy and then it comes out that actually everybody else sees it and you don't think what that would do to your worldview it would be tough dude see i feel like we would be at a point man like honestly if they came what i think there's we we are at a point yeah but i feel like there's a couple of things man it's like even if they came out and said okay yeah all right aliens are real we've had them here like here they are this is what they fucking look like i feel like there would be a lot of people that like okay all right yeah of course we knew it we would be like that yeah you know let me see you Joe Rogan would be like that yeah what's a dickland like yeah like that'd be your first question with it yeah so so you know yeah we would be like that but also we're open to the idea that we're being lied to about everything i mean which brings the second point though like okay like how would we even know that their truth is now the truth well hold on what if they just said oh aliens exist and here's a video of them and it's AI that's what i'm saying like how you know like so what we what do you think that process would even look like man like as far as like true declassification like what does the truth how do you get the truth to be out there like what does that look like because well they're the same mother fuckers who two weeks ago told me that vaccines were safe and effective yeah i mean our current people would just say hey we put it out and then you'd read it and it would everything would be redacted and then they would say oh we put it out hey did it right right yeah that's what they would do but it's you know i don't i don't know dude i don't know what that would look like i know this though i know a lot of people lose their fucking minds yeah because you know they probably started with a little bit of a lie a little bit more of a lie a little bit more of a lie and i think they're lying about so much now that it doesn't even really represent our current reality i especially think they lie about the capabilities of the human individual i think the humans are much more capable of manifesting and controlling their outcomes then then we're ever been told i think we've intentionally been told we are powerless weak individuals so that we are easy to control yeah i mean bro that would make sense man because even if you go back to all 12 thousand years the you know beginning of human existence what we call humans now it's like i mean you look at like simple shit look at the pyramids how they like they there's higher glyphs the fucking UFOs and spacecrafts and fucking pyramids and shit right and it's like how two things can't be true at the same time like it can't be true that we went 12 thousand years no significant advancements and all of a sudden we have a computer that fits into our fucking pocket yet all all the sudden all this technology started happening in the 50s right right we went right around the time right around the time that apparently razzwell had UFOs that crashed error dude come on man you know what i'm saying like dude i get it it just does it make sense and then like when you look at like all the way back like when you look all the way back into anthropology you know 12 thousand years ago you know there's this anthropologist named Robert Sefer who is on s e p h e r on youtube and he's got some interesting videos about the anthropologist perspective of history which is the accurate interpretation of history because we have the facts in the archaeology to back it up right so um he did this one on how basically all across the earth there are ancient symbols that are consistent on continents that are separated by massive oceans right and they're the same exact drawings the same that cannot be accessible back to this yes and then when you talk to people they're like well you know that was back when there was panjia and it was one big thing no it wasn't that wasn't it was that's not accurate right so how the fuck did all these civilizations all across the world come up with the same ideas the same drawings the same figures the same similar language similar technology and why are they all telling the same story why do they tell a story of a half fish half human that that came on a boat to their land and talk them all these things they all tell the same story it was a half fish half human person that was a superior being that came in talk them the technology and left and like if you look in I know people that have never looked into it they think that's crazy but if you look into it that's the story and there's drawings of it so we don't know like somebody knows this shit you know what I mean and there's like in the Vatican bro there's there's tens of thousands of books that aren't even allowed to be viewed or read why is that same thing over in Tibet there's tens of thousands of ancient books that aren't even allowed to be accessed or read why is that so you know there's a lot here man it's not just like oh you know aliens do they exist or not like we don't even know the origin of humanity for real and everybody you know says well I know it's God and I agree there's a God but you still don't know you weren't there you don't know the science there's science that says that fucking the Anunnaki came out of fucking nowhere when I'm before that right well God just formed this dude and said through him in a hole and they fucking showed up in Iraq you know saying like you know like it just doesn't it just doesn't uh it just there's just a lot more to it bro yeah really high one night this is a while ago last night no no not last time this is a while ago I got really high and like I watched that movie in a steller that's probably one of my favorite movies ever yeah and it hit me about aliens are just us from the future like just a more advanced form of human who knows that's what my belief is really yeah like there are humans that are just way more advanced like I'm talking about thousands of years ahead of us that was some good weed yeah I don't know man we'll see I mean like I don't listen to they look dude here's here's what I think I don't like when people talk about this shit in like this is the way it is yeah you know like like we'll talk about this and then you know people will say no this is what happened you know fucking know that you know fucking know that right we nobody knows because we're being lied to there's people that know but we're not being told the truth yeah I'm not the person that knows you ain't the person yeah and dude we should be we should be allowed to know the truth man we should be allowed to know what the deal is yeah yeah I got so the only way that the fucking they wouldn't allow us to know what why wouldn't what is their main mission their main mission is control yeah okay so the only reason that they wouldn't allow us to know in my opinion is because they use religion to control the populace okay and if something like this came out it would shatter a lot of people's belief in that sort of code of ethics control man structure right exactly so there and maybe that's not exactly what they think but the point is we're not being told the truth because whatever the truth is it's going to make it harder for them to control and rule over us yeah I think a little bit of a two man like what it could also just be something that's so simple as okay like maybe there's infinite power maybe you know I'm saying maybe you have it maybe we have it as I'm saying so like so there's no need for a fucking utility bills no more now that you know I'm saying like inside the effect or Tesla fucking already made that bro you know I'm saying so it's like I think there's something you can Tesla came up with wireless electricity that can be transmitted through fucking radio towers and then all the sudden to do just dies yeah right and where does technology go oh it just stopped no these motherfuckers have an archive they don't want to use it because bro listen they got the cure to cancer they got the cure to free energy they have the cure to all this the reason they don't fucking put it in is because it takes away the economic value that these other people who donate to these people's political campaigns and make them rich it takes away their power to make money so there's interest financial interest to keeping the shit secret that's my take on it man that's how I see it guys jump down in the comments and let us know what you guys think about this topic with that being said let's go cruise some of these comments man we missed them yesterday with Mighty Mouse yeah we got we had this full show the full that was the full boat very girthy bro very girthy along yeah yeah yeah long for a white guy hey above average we hey that was a fun show bro that was great he's one of my

thing and do another it's it's called human nature but these people here they don't have any fucking wreck they don't have any recognizing uh any any ability to recognize their own hypocrisy it's a square circle bro yeah it's weird it's weird shit man guys Bailey Alex Shriwillie we have Bailey enjoy your new neighbors both of them guys appreciate you for being real ass fans man keep liking keep commenting make sure you guys are subscribed hit that bell notification to stay up to date with the latest drops from really up with that being said let's get to headline number two uh this one is great um because you know we mentioned it a little bit yesterday I think um the new doji the doji the doji the doji I don't know how you pronounce it I think it's doji is it doji I wish it should be doji department of government efficiency department of government efficiency right and so you got trump uh who uh is bringing in this new department you got Elon Musk and the vape running it okay now leave it to mess them they're gonna do some fear monitoring they can't talk about either one of them otherwise it's racism it is we established very racist to talk about an African-American in an Indian-Americans it's fucked up yeah it's fucked up are they not qualified yeah well you know I mean clearly Elon knows how to use computer oh shit uh but uh you know leave it to MSM they're gonna try to do some fear monitoring yeah right so I thought this was interesting this is coming from CNN of course trump wants Elon Musk to overhaul the government here's what could be on the chopping block all right and they go into this like stupid fucking article and I'm not even gonna read all of it um you know but they talk about you know Elon Musk and you know he's a billionaire one of the richest men uh on earth who runs several companies and he does them so good and why can he why should he be you know in charge of government efficiency I mean I think it's pretty fucking good that's exactly why it's it's exactly why dude what is it with these fucking idiots that can't understand that to be in uh charge of a government is no different than being in charge of a company it's being in charge of the most powerful company in the world and do you want to elect someone based upon their gender or their skin tone or their being the first this to run the most powerful country in the world if you do it's because you're a fucking idiot yeah I mean listen and if they are gonna do that then again he qualifies for that too he's the first African American to lead the the Department of government efficiencies he runs and the guys a creative thinker plus a competent operator which is a huge huge huge deal because very few people have both those skill sets all right he runs Tesla Tesla is completely innovative company how can we do cars well we could do him like this and he starts making it up right like he's not like hey we're gonna do like GM and own a little bit better all right there's levels to this fucking game I want to go to Mars so I'm gonna build my own fucking NASA okay so he my point here PayPal he thinks completely outside the realm of the structure that most people think which is a requirement to innovate and push forward and I actually think because of those skill sets there is nobody more qualified to do what he's been tasked with doing because what we need to do is we need to take the entire government like imagine if to renew your license plates you just went on the internet and fucking typed in a few words instead of going to the license office waste in half a day dealing with a bunch of bullshit you know blah blah blah like all of this stuff should be on blockchain all of this shit should be immediate like instantaneous it should be very low cost if not free and he's gonna do all those things like in every way possible yeah that's what I think well they're trying to scare people into thinking that you know they're talking about cutting Medicare Medicaid and the children's health insurance program the affordable I bet I bet he will cut and I'm sure there's gonna be some true I bet he will cut the bullshit out of it I'm think there's some there's some definitely some fat that could be trimmed off from there you know for sure but I want to to direct our time and energy to what really is the shit that needs to be getting cut right let's check this out this is where Elon Musk can start cutting federal spending from transgender monkeys to DI and checks to dead people it's a great fucking article by New York Post let's dive into this so first thing they could check waste of day feds paid 1.3 billion dollars to dead people last year last year we're not talking about fucking Medicaid 1.3 what we what could we do with 1.3 billion dollars do a lot going back just to the people do a lot you know yeah the federal government mistakenly paid 1.3 billion dollars to dead people in the fiscal year 2023 according to US office of management and budgets reporting on improper payments other things they've put out behind bars benefits prisoners thought to still be free and out of work received 171 million dollars in unemployment payments or social security in 2023 Medicaid Medicare also sent out a hundred and one billion dollars in improper payments largely due to fraud and tax cheats took the IRS for at least five hundred and forty six million dollars I don't like that one I would say everything the IRS is it's not a tax sheet it's a fucking individual cheat yeah yeah that's true other things that no pointless government money goes to talk about cutting the fat Russian cat research in 2021 yeah fucking kill crumbs bro bro I think crumbs was a kill crumbs he knew too much oh that was a massage hit bro he knew too much bro yeah they killed him in 2021 who killed him too who doctor death how about you fucking Fauci Fauci killed crumbs with RFK getting in the cat was probably fucking around with too much as per tank yeah well they ain't bringing crumbs back man you been seeing those reels of R.K. stuff of our of junior bro RFK what do you do well they they're making reels of him now like fucking shred it he is shredded he is shred it no but like like 30-year-old shred it like ridiculously shredded all right and they have his voice over this clip and it's like this dude going to open up his fridge and pull out a diet coat and then it's like saying fat fuck no it's RFK is like stay away from the aspirin team I'm here to work for you even if you don't like it because we're today we're hidden bars and drives this fucking great um but yeah cat research in 2021 the National Institute of Health awarded half a million dollars to a Russian lab performing experiments on cats including removing part of their brains and seeing if they could still walk on dread mills that is so fucked up why are we doing that I don't think we're actually like I don't think they're actually doing that yeah they're just saying they're doing it taking the money exactly like this for example other wasteful government I don't know bro you saw that experiment foul she was doing with the fucking puppies with the beagles yeah yeah maybe they are dude foul she's going to hell bro oh there's no doubt yeah like he's caused so much pain so much suffering he's a sick fuck yes but uh other wasteful government spending byrish bydons Irish boondoggle American taxpayers showed out four million dollars last year for joe and hunter bydon to go on a trip to Ireland as the post reported that included one point two million dollars on an elaborate sound system and light show for a Biden speech and seven hundred and sixty thousand dollars to rent out an entire hotel in Dublin just wasteful spending um fifty million dollars um to uh to a firm that runs monkey island it's a colony around three thousand primates that are sent to research labs and they also sent three point seven million dollars that was used to fund a study on monkeys and gambling um part of a nut yeah bro like how about the insurance companies that give you an aspirin and charge you seven hundred dollars yeah no shit yeah how about we start there it's fucked a monkey shit because that's where most of the shit comes from yeah well that's funny you say that I mean even on the health care that's we're still paying for the pandemic of course we are still millions of dollars billions of dollars um FEMA is expected to spend another seventy billion dollars on the pandemic in twenty twenty six six years after it fucking started um doctor Fauci he's been receiving fifteen million dollars worth of security this year bro how much security is that like well that's a shit no I know think about what what we spend that's a shit ton right and think I mean what the fuck do they have all of it like fucking is that like a army of robots the fuck they got bro it's a lot it's a lot of that's a lot of shit right there that's a lot of that's a lot of power um yeah and uh you know oh this is crazy drag shows and Ecuador taxpayer money is going to that the state department awarded a twenty thousand dollar grant to a center in Ecuador um that was used for twelve drag theater performances in a two minute documentary well look there's a there's a billion things like this yeah yeah China I mean it's all over there but you know one of the things other things that are interesting obviously there's a lot of government waste that goes on and that's the department of health and human services higher two hundred ninety four employees at a cost of thirty eight point seven million overseas d i as reported by open the books forty million dollars to say that people who aren't qualified should get jobs over people who are doesn't come down to you in salary thirty point seven divided by two ninety four hundred and thirty one thousand dollars a year yeah that's crazy yeah to say okay well uh you have this color skin or you have this genitalia and this guy's more qualified than you so you get the job makes sense yeah makes perfect sense um but Eli he's he's been doing some other things too he's also changing some stuff up at twitter um which is what I want to move this next combo to um have you been seeing the mass Exodus of twitter twitter writes and my mass Exodus I mean like five people oh you got joy read she's leaving uh she's leaving twitter as liberal tantrums over Elon Musk and Trump spy to read didn't easily the US I think so too yeah she's a fucking racist straight up racist like imagine if a white person went on TV and talked about black people the way she talks about what said half the shit she says the other way um yeah joy reads out that's what I'm glad I'm happy about do racism is gonna is gonna get to the point where racism is racism it's not just one way right if you judge someone based off the color of their skin for any reason whatsoever your world class piece of shit yeah that's that's the bottom line and racism is racism whether it's towards black people or white people or Asians or Jews or fucking whatever right it it's just bad people and good people do is this person bad person is this person a good person if we would just get to that we could actually find out who is at the bottom of all of these fucking radholes that cause all this shit right I don't know yeah let's let's check her video out hey guys so today I finally did something I've been meaning to do for a while and the reason for doing it um and kissing goodbye my 1.9 million followers too many white people is because I hadn't been posting for a long time I just didn't want to contribute content um once it was purchased by its present owner but just having it there I was only holding on to it um because I you know really didn't want someone trying to take over that name and using it for nefarious purposes I was a little bit worried about that um and also every so often I would use it to just like sort of look at news that was trending and when what's happening and I was just sort of use it as like an aggregator but I just realized that's not really worth it because in order to like do the news aggregation and just look at all you have to wait through a lot of Drek and a lot of just abuse and a lot of just negativity and yeah and you know yeah you do yeah the abuse that was as the response in the backlash of the shit you've been doing for 15 years lady yeah you know by the way nice hair yeah she's not the only one she's put her fucking wig back on she does fuck bro when you get a headline like that you don't let it quit on you you got to fire it bro listen it's only fight I've ever lost yeah but you know what you didn't lose it because you fired it you know what I'm saying no you didn't you only lose if you try to like hang on to it like she's doing okay you know so I didn't lose my fight no you you you won because you said fuck you fucking quit on me fuck you you fired yeah you can't fire me I fire you yeah that's right right right got breaking up with me I'm breaking up with you fuck you that's what she failed to do yeah and she's not I mean by the way what's up with the cultural appropriation of her blonde hair so what that oh all right now joy yeah yeah you got some explaining yeah you do yeah you do she's not the only fag of the left don't let me down live and left too he's all done well he didn't leave yet he's leaving tomorrow did you try to like extort you want for some sort of fucking contract or something I think so yeah and he last said they had a they had a disagreement right like didn't you want to listen man uh yeah you guys are irrelevant man like joy re quit because no one cares what she says no but she was getting hammered every day every day well that's because she's she's legit divisive and racist man bro these uh these people who are all did you do you have anything in here about the mainstream media in the next topic did you see all these people getting fired from MSM all these people that are getting released and like going shit that's how about it oh yeah dude all the all the like main hosts are on the chopping block at CNN and MSNBC allegedly well nobody's watching that shit I know but see this is their move my point here is that that's their move to regain credibility they've realized that these people have exhausted their credibility they so they need new faces and apparently they're trying to get some pro Trump voices on their networks uh I have heard that yeah so trying to go buy us so ABC just gonna throw this out there I will be a host on one of your shows mean DJ we come as a package and we will be the counter to the rest of the and we can handle them all all you need is us yeah okay and we'll just go on every show and be the voice you guys pay me money my reparations amount is gonna be pretty highly that's right pay me a lot of money pay DJ a lot of money we'll come on your TV and we'll get the ratings up there promise you if you don't hire us we're suing yes right fucking racism yep I'm an African American with the African American credit score I demand to be heard and I am a I am a persecuted white man who was forced to pick Jake Paul I want my I was bullied by two black men on my own show this is one of the pictures from that study with the monkey's doing a casino shit really yeah monkeys learn how to gamble 3.7 million dollars right there that monkey smarter than me dude I don't know how to play poker or anything I don't I never wanted to learn bro really yeah it's like cocaine I don't want to touch it yeah it's smart I know bro if things are gonna be bad for me like that I don't even fucking go near them that's smart man I'll end up being that weirdo fucking high on cocaine at the car table when I'm clear visors on five in the morning yeah yeah man guys jumping on this combo man let us know what you guys think down in the comments I I I will say this I love the vague and I love Elon Musk and I believe if they do what they say they're going to do they could be the two most historically relevant individuals in our government in modern history for the next century bro for in modern history yeah bigger than a president bigger than anybody because what actually needs to happen here is what they are claiming they are going to do which is removing the bureaucracy and reducing the bureaucracy from what is currently the biggest government in the history of human history down to a functional cash flow positive non-wasteful business that serves the people and if they do that bro not only will we be our country be out of debt we won't pay the taxes we're paying not even close no and that can be done quickly yeah so I'm very excited I'm very confident in both of their abilities there's been a lot of picks and a lot of them I am excited about some of them I don't get like at all like this marker rubio pick yeah like the secretary of state not only that dude I don't like I don't like these pro-Israel people do like I don't like it it doesn't have a place in our government yeah okay and I don't mind I don't mind if you're a regular person and you love Israel and it's a big deal but this is fucking America dude and the Israeli influence in our government is unacceptable just as it would be unacceptable for any country to have that level of influence in our government it's not an anti-Semitic thing it's not anything against Jews it's the principle of a government having that much control over our government and when Pete Hegseth who I gave amazing words to yesterday stands up today and says you know free freedom or what do you say cap or something patriotism and Zionism are the forefront no patriotism Zionism is for there it's all the way across the world is for them okay Zionism does not belong in our government and we can be allies and we can help each other without that much influence happening in our government it's it has to end at some point we need to be American first and I'm I'm I'm really tired of the people who claim to be America first going up there and talking about this and like if there's someone who can explain to me the relationship and why it's that important I would love to hear it but I have not heard a valid argument from anybody as to why we should have dual citizens of another country in our government making policy decisions that serve them and then us it should be American first dude and so like when Pete says because I have all the respect in the world for Hegseth and Pete I do what the fuck man this is America let's be American first don't go up there now all the sudden fucking starts spewing up all these talking points because you think you need to to get financed for some future bullshit yeah yeah I don't like it I don't like it either dude and there's a number of picks that he made that are like that and bro that makes me think Trump hasn't learned his mother fucking lesson it really makes me think that Trump is gonna go in and fucking potentially do the same shit that happened to him last time yeah I don't know dude I mean I hope I'm wrong and maybe there's a bunch of shit I don't know there probably is but America should be for Americans and until our country looks how it should look and until we are a superior country to every other country in the world in terms of our infrastructure of technology the quality of living the income standard all of these things until we're the best zero dollars to anybody else fucking anybody that's that's my position yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments let me sell let's get to our third and final headline headline number three this was an investor this one this just came out today onion they buy Alex Jones's info wars at auction with backing from sandy hook families yeah you see this yeah interesting the satirical news source the onion outbid rivals for Alex Jones's info wars at a bankruptcy auction backed by families of sandy hook elementary school shooting victims owed more than one billion dollars in defamation judgments against the broadcaster for calling the 2012 massacre a hoax now the cell price was not disclosed when the families confirmed the deal on Thursday quote the dissolution of Alex Jones's assets and the death of info wars is the justice we have long awaited and fought for Robbie Parker whose daughter Emily was killed in the 2012 shooting in Connecticut sent an statement provided by his lawyers and seen by the associate of press now Alex Jones is 50 he confirmed the onions acquisition of info wars in a social media post and said he planned to file legal challenges to stop it quote I just got word 15 minutes ago that my lawyers and folks met with the US trustee over our bank rupsie this morning and they said they are shutting us down even without a court order this morning Jones said quote Connecticut Democrats with the onion newspaper bought us he had it now he started info wars back in 1999 and it's been going on for a long time and again I don't know if that's kind of like I don't know how much info wars is actually worth you know I don't know if it's they just bought a bunch of podcasts equipment dude and some cameras and a fucking backdrop yeah and on top of that you know maybe any contracts that they had signed sponsorship yeah but but it's worthless without Alex Jones right all he has to do is go start another one called fucking you know bozo wars and whatever the fucking wants to call it you know I'm saying info wars yeah I mean dude look it's it's a it's a fucking nothing burger you know I mean they're not going to stop them all we would have to do is call Alex is a hey bro why don't you come sit on our show and whatever ads you bring you keep the money for that and then he's making the same fucking money doing the same shit you know like it Alex has a fucking band base yeah how you can't stop that it's him yeah like that would be like they come in and oh we we fucking forced Andy to sell real AF well I'm going to start fucking real real AF tomorrow really really like like you know like it's it's it's it's it's ridiculous yeah yeah but trying to yeah now I mean dude I'm not sitting here saying and what he said was right or wrong or whatever you know like I think that's very insensitive to make light of a situation where people actually died as people lose their kids I remember that shooting dude it was horrible it was like that was a you know we hear about these shootings and they're all horrible but that was one that was like the first that was like the first time it was like little bitty kids you know what I'm saying and it was horrible and I don't know why he would think that was made up I don't know I don't know Alex Jones I think he makes some good points a lot of times I think he's well read on the shit that I think he knows a lot of shit I think he gets you know a little bit out there sometimes and I think this is one of the cases where he got a lot out there in a bit him in the ass yeah big time yeah and and it's not it you know uh but buying forcing him out of business finding him a billion dollars and all this shit um that's the part that bothers me is like the government overreaching this yeah that's that's what it is it's government over the a billion dollars come on dude like that's insane I agree it's insane I agree you know and it's just like you know well and here's what people people so like when you say that there's going to be people who say well what he did was absolutely horrible okay sure absolutely but there's people out there that actually kill kids that don't get fined a billion dollars right okay there's rich people that fucking crash their car and kill a family and they come out of prison still fucking rich if they go to prison at all that's what I'm saying bro so like this is this is not okay and where people need to really be careful before they jump on this shit oh yeah get them is that it's setting a precedent for them to get you to it does right it does the other part to the bothers me on this man is just like we have to be very very honest with ourselves and very careful when we talk about the freedoms that we have in this country right like if we're going to say we have free speech free speech means that you can say something I don't like anything anything you want that's what free speech means that's the textbook that free speech means that as long as it's relatively true you could say it right I don't know that he had any proof yeah that was true you know like as much as I say there's there's no limits to free speech I mean how many times if we had to file lawsuits on people that fucking completely make up shit about me completely make it up you know what I mean like fuck dude I got people in this building that's all they fucking do is attack the internet for people that fucking tell lies you know what I'm saying so like where it gets blurry though it's like you know is that one an opinion because I mean when the opinion I mean maybe it didn't phrase it like I don't know like that's the other thing I like it's hard to even find what the original point was that was like where this is all contended on you know but I get blurs it does get blurry man it's like my opinions my opinion now whether he said it was his opinion or not or said like this is a fact I don't know but a pain like dude you can't like you get hurt by my opinion that's what fucker Kamala Harris was just in front of the fucking White House saying that Donald Trump and all of us are Nazis where's her billion dollar that's right I want to sue her for deaf me too you know I'm saying yeah like you know I'm saying but like listen bro calling someone a Nazis a big fucking deal and if they're not a fucking Nazi then where is the fucking accountability to those people right but there's accountability to him right right so I'm saying this what this really was is this is not we know everybody else yeah this is a fucking intimidation tax that's all this they wanted they wanted to fucking hit Alex Jones with a billion dollars to shut people like me and you and everybody else up Rogan shut up PPD shut up for seller DJ shut up you're gonna lose all your shit that's right you know it's fucked up it's fucked up man other things sue their quickly on government overreach did you see this Biden's FBI raids home of Polly market CEO after gambling platform yeah that's retaliatory dude successfully predicts Trump's victory yeah that's that's straight up payback political political revenge pro yeah well I mean that shit's all gonna stop here in a couple months I love that pretty guy as long as fucking Trump actually gets in I still dude I still cannot shake the feeling that these people have a plan and they are not I would say as the days go by when I'm starting to watch like the media companies fire their fucking personalities and shit and I'm starting to see like some of these changes being made I'm thinking less and less that there's a plan but like 2% less you know I still think these people are gonna try to fucking kill Trump I think they're gonna blame it on Iran I think they're gonna try to get all Trump's people fired up to go to war with Iran then they get rid of Trump they get the war with Iran they all make a bunch of money they remove the most capable American males from society by putting them to war who are the resistance of their plan and their their policies and their you know platform and then they get to say oh there's free and fair lectures look Trump won but they killed him you see what I'm saying so everything that could happen from that standpoint benefits them and it just when all things are all things the simplest thing makes sense and the simplest thing is not oh they're just gonna give up and let them walk right in the stop that's not simple is not stopping itself bro no I do 100% it never has never has you know so I mean we'll see I just hope that I hope Trump and his people are very fucking careful well I hope to I hope they're very on top of it yeah I also hope to that the majority of people also will be smart enough and be able to use common sense to know that if that does happen and they do try to blame it on who did it yeah it's not them not only that bro I hope that people I hope just people in general are aware enough to pay attention and like kind of just like watch right like if you see weird shit happening wherever you are especially if you're in the vicinity of fucking Trump like in his town you need to say something I just dude I don't know man like I think you guys who listen regularly and have listened for a number of years you know I have a unique ability to be able to see things coming down the pipe and that is that is just what the fuck I'm seeing and I'm just being honest about it yeah man guys it bothers me dude like I don't like it yeah dude yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumbest fuckers where we bring a headline in we talk about it and it gets one of those two options so with that being said let's get to our thumbs up I got a video for you we're gonna start with all right okay now you guys have you guys have been listening watching for any extent of time you guys know that
