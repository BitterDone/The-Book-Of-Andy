right into the elite that whole intro oh man uh guys if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com guys can find them there's uh as always let's get into our headlines head on number one uh gotta go to Twitter there was apparently somebody's account got hacked on Twitter and I think of all accounts that could get hacked this was probably the worst one um Elmo Elmo's ex account uh goes rogue as anti-symmetric hacker slams Epstein files and calls for people to kill all juice like so Elmo yeah Elmo um you know the sweet little innocent Elmo yeah he uh as account was hacked as an anonymous antagonist used the lovable red monster as a mouthpiece to promote anti-symmetric views boasts an obscure crypto toy company and belabor on controversy surrounding the elusive Jeffrey Epstein files now of course they've all been deleted um but nothing's deleted so we have him here for you um the official Elmo account um and it starts with Elmo says all juice should die fuck juice Donald Trump is netting y'all who's puppet because he is in in the Epstein files juice control the world and need to be exterminated um he then tweeted out uh release the files at real Donald Trump child fucker um and then uh kill all juice I mean this has been it's Elmo's official account Elmo's official account how how do they how do they not get that taken care of immediately yeah oh I mean you know it's the end of that man so it's like soon as shit goes up you know yeah people automatically got a screenshot and the fucking save it um but there's been a lot of memes going around of Elmo yeah people are actually hyping them up um Elmo history X has been gone and uh going up on twitter um but yeah I mean it it brought again because people are not letting go the Epstein shit um and over the weekend you know we released that Saturday CTI for everybody um but since between now and then um that was at truth social that Trump uh truth throughout that long uh yeah doctoral thesis statement um kind of just you know trying to relax the waters there a little bit um for those that haven't seen it we have the whole thing here I mean I don't know if you want to read the whole thing but there was a few parts in there that I thought were pretty interesting um just the language that he's using man it it is it is weird okay um because there was a whole controversy with damn bond you know might be quitting arguments with Pam blondie I mean it's been going on but then something happened this is interesting um you have what let's catch everybody up to speed basically what what it appears to be what I believe I know for sure um is that Epstein was an intelligence asset most likely from a side that would leverage either real events that happen or events that didn't happen but leveraging the uh those events on high profile people whether it be in our government potentially Hollywood to do or don't do certain things or create or mold certain narratives um through his influence all right um and a lot of people were starting to believe that it was directly related to Israel the government of Israel um and their intelligence agency and it's so in question because it was almost like unprovoked okay but former Israeli prime minister furiously response allegations the Jeffrey Epstein was connected to Messiah um who which one uh this is uh this guy here his name is Nathtali Bennett okay Nathtali Bennett decided to go to Twitter um this is his tweet um he says quote as a former Israeli prime minister with the Messiah having reported directly to me I say to you with 100% certainty the accusation that Jeffrey Epstein somehow worked for Israel or the Messiah running a blackmail ring is categorically and totally false Epstein's conduct both the criminal and merely despicable had nothing whatsoever to do with the Messiah or the state of Israel Epstein never worked for the Messiah this accusation is a lie being peddled by prominent online personalities such as tuckle Carlson pretending they know things they don't they just make things up say it with confidence in these lies stick because it's Israel there's a vicious wave of slander and lies against my country and my people and we just won't take it anymore now I don't know about you but that was giving me some bill vibes and Bill Clinton vibes you know it was totally unprovoked nobody asked him to chime in on this nobody asked from force two piece um his two cents on this but um he decided to make that in now uh Megan Kelly very quickly clapped back on them very publicly as well um and responded directly to the tweet reads the United States attorney who spiked the case Alex Acosta is on record saying Epstein was an intel agent and he was told to get rid of the prosecution if Epstein was an agent it was clearly either for the United States or Israel both the deny it what would you expect them to say she puts in parentheses he had multiple odd Israeli connections this denial is meaningless well no shit it's meaningless I mean dude uh those aren't my drugs my pain like you know oh yeah guys you caught me uh we were blackmailing all the celebrities and blackmailing Hollywood and the music industry and everybody important in the world so that uh you know we could control the narrative and basically do whatever we want and anybody that doesn't go along with it we just debank them de-platform ruin their lives through cancer culture label them racist and some anti-semitic bigoted and uh you know we we were doing it so I mean what do you expect him to say of course he's gonna say it's not true now that doesn't mean I mean really dude him coming out so hard and saying this feels like panic to me you know it feels like like if you really want if it's really bullshit then what do you do in chiming in and if it's uh if it is really bullshit what's the uh what was the other prime minister's name um who was seen visiting the ex prime minister who was seen visiting yeah who'd Barack okay who's been seen with Jeffrey Epstein dozens of times in his properties dozens of times hiding his face if he was doing nothing wrong why was he hiding his face um look dude uh nobody's buying it that's what it comes down to you know what I mean like nobody's buying it and you could come out and you could say oh it wasn't me and it didn't exist and the next thing that's gonna be this the next phase of this and by the way this fucking idiot who hacked uh elmo's page right you guys going out there and saying oh we need to kill all these people and eliminate them and this and that you're causing the fucking problem you're the ones making the problem unsolvable because then it comes across as generalizing an entire race religion group of people which we all know isn't true and when you start saying things like elmo saying here where he's like kill everybody dude this is where they have the justification to make laws that if you ask about Epstein or say that Epstein was a Mossad agent they arrest you for anti-semitism or hate speech they're already doing this in European countries so all of you to know that it wasn't like how do we know that it was had how do we know that that isn't part of the fucking play too listen man the bottom line is is that it's it's very frustrating to try to solve this problem when we have people who are generalizing the extermination of an entire group of people because then you can't have a relative conversation about who's actually doing it um and what they're doing you know it becomes it becomes this insane ridiculous shit and yeah you're right dude who's to say that that's not some sort of Israeli op to even say that so that those things get banned right um but I can tell you dude the way this is going the next thing is going to be if you question Jeffrey Epstein your anti-semit and the next thing after that will be if you question Jeffrey Epstein your it's hate speech and we're gonna arrest you and it comes from people not understanding the entire play and quite honestly being lazy with their words and their articulation yep you know it's not all Jews and it's not even close to all Jews and you're playing right into their fucking plan by saying that shit and it honestly dude like the amount of generalization towards that topic is is is fucking disturbing yeah you know it doesn't fix anything well no it's like saying it would be the same saying kill all white people or kill all black people or kill all this because there's a group of elite ones doing some fucked up shit like that's not like I don't understand how that's not understandable and I think it is understandable the most people which makes me think that some of this shit is propaganda you know I don't know dude but like it's starting to make me feel real real sick like just about human beings in general man like bro we're like I posted this video in my Instagram story over the weekend of this young kid who was I don't think it was in the US he was probably seven or eight years old and he was having a birthday party and he wanted to celebrate it with the trash guys okay so they set up a table and a cake and some snacks and sandwiches and the trash guys you know come by and they celebrate the kids birthday with them and it's like super wholesome and you know that's how people are bro people are across the world they're good people they they are taught to hate and they are taught to divide and they are taught to separate and the fact that the world looks the way that it does with a bunch of supposedly wealthy civilized people is disturbing you know like so this is what we're gonna do with our with our power and our authority you guys are just gonna fucking ruin the fucking world and you know you're already the richest people on the planet but you're gonna oppress everybody else to squeeze another couple fucking nickels out of them and make like it's just dude where we are in humanity is to me I almost wish I had stayed a sleep so to speak because it's so disgusting to me like this these are grown people these are grown people that have no care or or empathy or any sort of concern for for you know 50,000 kids being killed in Gaza or anywhere like it doesn't matter if it's Gaza or Israeli children or Iraqi children or down so it doesn't yes it doesn't matter bro these are fucking kids and we have these adults who are worth more money than anybody on the planet at the top of the food chain across governments globally who have no problem oppressing the people below them for what for a little more power for a little more money like what the fuck is going on bro it's it's it's very evil and I'm all for capitalism dude it's the best system in the world no question I'm all for wanting to be wealthy it's very important but what I'm now for is people who are already the wealthiest people in the world squeezing one last drop of juice out of the poorest people on the planet so so what for what reason you know what I mean and it's just starting to really like it's just starting to really bother me like the world shouldn't be this way it shouldn't it shouldn't be this way there should be no reason for any government or any group of people to be blackmailing other people to push some sort of agenda that's like that's ridiculous shit bro we live inside of a fake world you know our music's fake our fucking entertainment's fake everything has an agenda our money's fake like dude it's just it's ridiculous and it and apparently it's controlled by a small group of elite people that have coordinated you know across the world and I don't know man like it's almost at the point where we're not to be able to talk about it oh 100% you know yeah and it's crazy and like speaking to us not being able to talk about it apparently allegedly over the weekend as well um the lame max will well that's a whole other thing she's trying to talk about it bro that's a whole other thing let me I'll tell you exactly what's happening here and I've not seen a single fucking person pointed out all these fucking people think they're real smart all these influencers and talking heads and I'm with this organization and that organization bro they don't they they lack the ability to deduce and put together the pieces I have not seen one person be able to effectively do it the way that we've done it here for real for the last four years we got plenty of receipts everybody's like oh she's gonna talk she's gonna blow the whistle are you fucking stupid are you are you fucking that stupid that's not that is not what's going to happen they kept her alive for a very specific reason you know what that reason is it's so she can validate that there was no fucking list all right so she's in jail all these idiots are like oh she's gonna come out and talk and tell the whole thing and this and that know the fuck she isn't because they went to her and they said hey here's your opportunity you could come out and validate that this was all blown up and bullshit and you get to stay alive or we'll kill you okay because if that was the case but she would have been done it dude you don't think it was a chest piece they kept that chest piece on purpose these people are 20 steps ahead of all these fucking idiots on the internet like real talk no like she's gonna come out she's gonna fucking say oh it was this and this and this all these people they're gonna be able to smash it because they look she even said that it wasn't that no shit you know what I mean absolutely like dude nothing she's gonna backtrack on everything she said she's gonna say she was cursed they're gonna remove culpability and then everybody's gonna breathe a big sigh of relief you know Alan Dershow is he even talked about I mean he's trying to call her a victim now you know I'm saying like they're already said they've said it up bro I know they're said in the fucking I know but what bothers me is like like dude our country has no fucking hope until people learn to think seriously yeah like yeah dude they assume that these people are operating above board these people are not operating in good faith they are liars they are cheaters they are criminals they are corrupt they have zero zero regard or reservations for lying straight to your fucking face and I don't know how people can't understand that it's like and it's all of them it's fucking all of them dude it's all of them they will lie right to your face okay so it's like George Carlin said you know it's a big club and we ain't in it so that's my take on that up steenshit like she's just gonna validate what they're saying now whatever the narrative is now that's gonna piss some people off and then you got and then you got like all these other business guys who are attached to this company or that company and they talk in their interests and like dude there's just nobody really like that has the people's interest at hand like real talk I know I do I know I do and people may say you know this or that or whatever but I know where my heart is bro and like I wouldn't come on here and put myself in the line of fucking danger having to have security and if I didn't believe in this shit but like bro these people this government and this this shit it's too far gone dude that's the reality and until like you know I think the hope for Trump was that he would dismantle and rip the fucking corruption out because because that's what he ran on and that's what he said but I think people are losing faith in that and I think you know a lot of people have lost faith in that and I think until he does that it's going to continue to get worse and if he doesn't do that the people are going to have to do it and that's the reality they will have to be a revolution okay because and there will be because historically that's what happens and and people will say why isn't it happen yet because things haven't gotten bad enough historically when revolutions happen it happens when people start to starve okay we're not starving yet when people start to starve like when the dude up in New York starts putting in you know state run grocery stores and there's no food in them and shit then we're gonna start see fucking people say oh we should roll but the truth of the matter is by that time the people are so weak it becomes that much harder and because of information and because of technology and because of everything that's going on you know it's it's a harder time to have a quote unquote revolution probably the hardest time in the history of mankind and not just because of the weapons but because of the way the financial system works and all these things like dude everybody's like oh they're gonna put us on a digital currency at the fuck do you think you use now yeah right right what the what the fuck do you think you use now like what do you think like you know I'm saying how much gold and hard currency do you have in your home you're fucking already on the digital system you just can't see it yet and you know they well they could shut it off whenever they want they already do that they could track you anywhere you want they already do that like all of these things these people say they don't know yeah they're already doing those things and no such thing man when we when we sit here and like have a logical discussion about what has to happen for our people to be free we have to have someone that's gonna tear the fucking corruption right out of the government and not give a fuck about doing it and the problem that I see with Trump is like and this is the same thing he did in fucking uh fifth his first term he comes in saying all this shit and then he tries to like play ball with these people and it's like that's not what people want and I think he's making a massive mistake bro Trump is thinking that Trump that people are following Trump people are not following Trump they're following the things that he claims to stand for they are tired of the corruption they are tired of the of the lies they are tired of the manipulation they are tired of the financial oppression they're tired of paying more of their money to the government than they get to keep they're tired of the artificial division they're tired of the media being pure propaganda they're tired of all of it dude they're tired of being told you know that they're criminals or that they're racist or that they shouldn't get along with these people or this or that people just want to fucking get together bro and have a goddamn barbecue and fucking chill but we can't because these fucking super rich elite fucks can't maintain power without squashing everybody else and until we get someone who's gonna go in there and rip the fucking guts right out of it nothing will change until the people rise up and fucking just do what they gotta do and by the way that's in our declaration of independence you are not violating the law talking about a revolution you are not violating the law talking about what is required of the citizens in the declaration of independence it very clearly states that when a government becomes corrupt we have a duty as American citizens to fix it and that's not illegal for you to talk about that's our obligation to citizens and it's protected by free speech so if you really want to understand what needs to happen one of two things has to happen Trump either has to fucking pull the guts out of the shit and the corruption out which doesn't look like he's gonna do and everybody can say well he's part of this or part of that or part of this you still don't know what the fuck's going on okay you don't and I don't nobody does all we can do is look at the things and draw conclusions but it does look like he's leaning towards not doing those things as much as he said that he was going to do those things which in that case leaves us in a position where we the people have to side what it's worked to us to fix this country once and for all because I'm gonna tell you something most of the people that I know that voted for Trump did not vote for Trump to come in and fuck around with these corrupt people we voted for him to go in clean fucking house put people in jail and give us our fucking country back and that's not happening okay so maybe that's on the agenda maybe that's something that he plans on doing I don't know but in my opinion the strategy should be do that shit right up in the beginning so that people can see how the country's gonna feel look and operate without that corruption so that they buy into it over the next three fucking years that's what I would do if I were president I mean because look dude and then people are saying well dude what if he's under threat or what if they're threatening his kids I'm sure they are you don't fucking run for office if you're not prepared to trade your life for the what what you're trying to do yeah okay like that's part of what risk that's under correct that's part of what signing up for this is okay I don't come on here and speak my mind which I think I speak my mind more authentically than anybody on the internet without fucking fear okay I don't do that without understanding there are risks I'm not I'm not I'm not ignorant to the risk the risk just mean less to me than our country yeah and you know if that's the case then he shouldn't have ran you know what I'm saying so I don't know dude but I I think there's a lot going on I think it I don't know I we'll see what happens yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think yeah man guys appreciate you let's keep the crews moving I think this is I mean I try to take it at a different angle sometimes but like you know there's always the main stuff going on then there's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes right so let's catch up on some of that stuff it's because this is a hot one Biden tells New York Times he did not individually approve names of many pardoned via autopist this is a hot story coming out yeah and this is actually what we thought this is actually what we knew what's happening I mean it's not really a surprise but let's dive into this a little bit from a president Joe Biden admitted to the New York Times that he did not individually sign off on each of the pardons issued via his auto pin signature to batches of criminals at the end of his term though he reportedly delineated its criteria to staff and the final months of his term by an issued four large sets of pardons three of which were categorically or categorical clemency actions covering large swaths of people the times noted Sunday on the per the outlet Biden approved standards to give out categorical pardons the criminals in his final months of office but staff ultimately ran a final list of names that supposedly met the criteria through the auto pin though it had been it revise after Biden delineated the requirements quote Mr. Biden did not individually approve each name for the categorical pardons that apply to large numbers of people he and AIDS confirmed rather after extensive discussion of different possible criteria he signed off on the standards he wanted to be used to determine which convicts were qualified for a reduction in sentence even after Mr. Biden made that decision one former AIDS said the Bureau of Prisons kept providing additional information about specific inmates resulting in small changes to the list rather than ask Mr. Biden to keep signing revised versions his staff weighed it and then ran the final version through the auto pin which they saw as a routine procedure the AIDS said now what's interesting with all of this is that the only clemency okay the only one that was actually signed by Biden's own hand was the one that he gave for Hunter Biden that was the only one all right now if remember on January 19th of 2025 there was a large that was a final big batch of pardons that came out and so if this is the case and this is the position of a lot of legal scholars our own attorney general for the state of Missouri and Jubilee that would mean pardons that he pretty much gave his entire family Nolan Void Anthony Fauci Nolan Void Mark Mealy general who admitted in front of Congress that he would intentionally warn our enemies of any impending war yeah Nolan Void and then all the people on the J6 select committee all Nolan Void and so that you notice how quiet these people have been having said a fucking word yeah a word now Obama just came out today you see what he said he told the Democrats they have to toughen up also and that laying down in the fetal position is not going to get anything done what what do you mean like just trying to rally the troops I guess I mean that was the first time they can't say anything because Trump could just fucking rest him especially after this he needs to bro no shitting east that's what he was elected to do this knees that that's what he was elected to do if Trump does not fucking handle business the way that in that way meaning removing the corruption completely tapped the bottom not scolding them not embarrassing them not tweeting about them I mean fucking handcuffing them and putting them in prison at a fucking minimum for treasonous activities and crimes against humanity and conspiracy conspiracy is an actual crime okay then this will just fester into something more no and it will be worse and we're going to find out a lot because I know he knows that he fucking knows that yeah yeah and and dude painting the country in red, white, and blue and having celebrations and you know it's not going to cover for people understand they see the corruption they see it all right like it seems like these people are talking to us the same way like like they would in 2008 or 2012 like like no we see the power structure you know the reason people are upset about Epstein is not because of just the trafficking which is bad enough it's because people understand that the power structure that maintains the control and oppresses the average citizen manipulates the citizen lies to the citizen creates financial hardship for the citizen the entire power structure is based on blackmail and the average person is seeing that okay and they're tired of that so trying to pretend that that's not the case anymore is not going to get it done and it's not going to go away so you know to keep saying this is about trafficking only is it's like that's like throwing a breadcrumb at people like people know it's not about trafficking they understand the ins and outs like a lot of the stuff that people are talking about publicly now was known by people who were paying attention years ago years ago so here's a go well there maybe hope there maybe hope because this comes out and then this bombshell comes out I don't know if you want to call it a bombshell FBI opens investigation into decade of Democrat party antics and misconduct opening door for appointment of special prosecute so this just came out this was under the direction of cash but tell their FBI is opening an investigation into a decade of department Democrat party antics and misconduct according to just the news the investigation has been ongoing for several weeks now the investigators are looking back at Hillary Clinton's illegal home brew server the investigation is expected to reveal credible information of wrongdoing ignored by the FBI the previous FBI administration recall that according to the FBI November 2016 the bureau found thousands of potentially relevant messages including messages sent to and from Clinton herself while she was secretary of state but the FBI reportedly found most of those emails to be personal messages or ones they had already seen the FBI was protecting Hillary that's exactly what was happening but this dives in to the whole operation crossfire hurricane it's a full blanket investigation that's covered that's allegedly supposed to be covering all of that from Obama to Andrew McCabe to comey to the DOJ side with Lynch all of the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC like this just got announced today and apparently it's been going on for several weeks now but it just got publicly announced there is an actual official investigation happening with this that's seen files released on day one we'll see dude listen this is this is all bullshit I'm calling bullshit right now okay that all this is is another fucking crumb to keep people pass the pacified yeah bro and till I will not believe a single fucking word of any of these people until there are massive arrests of these criminals period yeah period period because how the fuck is Hillary Clinton still walking around free okay when it's been proven that she made up the steel dossier with her team paid to have it made and then used it to divide the country for eight years under the direction of approval of Obama who was then president how are these people still walking that is fucking treason okay this whole idea that these people have it within their rights to use the press how they would music culture to manipulate the average citizen and make their lives harder that's that's fucking unacceptable bro that's insane okay these people deserve to be fucking dealt with they need to be tried for treason they need to be tried for for Fauci and his whole crew and everybody bro we will not be able to move forward people have not forgotten about all these things they have not forgotten about what happened to COVID there's fucking millions of people walking around right now with a vaccine inside of them and they're scared shitless because they're like fuck they were forced to get yeah that's right dude and and dude they just pardon this dude out in Utah who was being threatened with 35 years in prison earlier this month in July for destroying COVID vaccine and giving out fake cards okay and then he got pardoned here just like a day or two ago but or that it got dismissed but I mean we're still people have been dealing with this dude and until people see accountability and truth and these politicians understand they can't just do whatever they want nothing's gonna change yeah dude it's even like the the you know the Butler assassination attempt like there's stuff coming out on that now because there was this GOA report that just listed out a bunch of different facts that are just now coming out as official facts about this thing and you got the former secret service director Kimberly Cheatle she responded to it but I want to show the claim so the facts that came out from this investigation is that these are the key findings from the GOA report or GAO report 10 days before the event high-level secrets service officials were briefed on a classified threat to Trump quote once those officials reviewed the intelligence they could have then requested that person know within their chain to command be briefed on the specific information officials failed to share this information leaving federal and local law enforcement entities planning and staffing the event unaware of the active threat including members of the Donald Trump protective division local law enforcement officials told the GAO they would have requested additional assets for that rally had they known of that credible threat so they knew that they knew something was happened in 10 days before seeing in live streams one of his rallies the only one they ever fucking live stream live streams it they knew about it and they failed to do fucking anything about it listen dude these people are criminals bro they are criminals and the fact that Donald Trump seems to come in and try to fucking play with these dudes it's like what the fuck are you doing bro like it really does make him look like he's part of it you can't play their game when they're not I'm sorry like I'm sorry dude I know a lot of people trust him and I hope he does I really do I want to like him I want to fucking back him I want to cheer for him I think most people do but until these motherfuckers are fucking cleaned out like for real I'm not gonna I don't believe anything anybody says yeah I gotta see it I talked to somebody very high up last night okay very high uh very very high uh not Trump not the vice president but somebody right there and this person said very directly to me that there's so much going on behind the scenes now by the way this is a person they have not been on the show but I have been close to for a very long time they said very directly to me that there's so much pushback and so much fighting from the deep state behind the scenes right now that it's it's unbelievable and so um I can't really say more than that but allegedly that's and I trust this person um but yeah I mean it's not just going smooth back behind closed doors which could explain a lot of the the hanging I'm all for benefit of the doubt bro yeah but what I'm not for is by the end of this term these motherfuckers aren't dealt with we're fucked as a country I think that's what a lot of these people are expected bro they're expecting that like the Obama's the Clintons the fucking fact that ride this out and then be good right that'd be good we should get through this time we're fine you know like that's what they're expecting and I don't actually expect them to be sooner than that because I don't understand like think about it through the fuck my first year of the time they're good because well like I said the people will be the only the only time Trump has to do this is between now and midterms no all right um yeah dude uh I mean that's pretty much it you know you either clean house or you full of shit and you go down in president is one of the biggest lame ducks ever yeah and we know he's I mean listen he's an ego guy and he cares about his fucking he's been getting destroyed on truth I know truth social well you know what I'm saying like that long post he posted that like I mean dude he's been getting lit up well everywhere so it's like I know he knows it yeah but we know it's all they got to do is give a little bit more transparency to what is actually going on yeah you know like um Tulsi Gabri came out and said hey uh there's a lot of shit going on behind scenes blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and and I watched that and I'm like all right well that makes sense you know it's the way they're going about it that that is causing people's spidey senses to go off you know I'm saying yeah um but at the end of the day dude like if he doesn't do it if he doesn't do it the people are gonna have to and the people don't have to do it if the people don't do it then we're gonna end up in a situation where you know it's gonna be not good yeah guys jump in this conversation tell us what you guys think down in the comments love to hear it um with that being said a third and final headline headline number three now we've talked plenty of times I know your position on AIs you know it's changed um we've had experts come in and talk about it um and I've always been on the belief if there is benefits to people cool and I think there might be one all right and it just got displayed um headline number three reads paralyzed patient reveals incredible abilities after receiving neural link chip all right that's an interesting one it is it is it is weird all right but let's dive into this this is Elon Musk uh one of his companies called neural link um let's dive into the story paralyzed US military veteran is able to play video games control electronics and even design 3D objects by using only his thoughts thanks to a coin size chip implanted in his brain and backed by tech magnate Elon Musk RJ a quadriplegic uh who lost use of his limbs following a devastating motorcycle accident is the first patient at a Miami hospital to be fitted with the telepathy device developed by musk brain in a face company neural link the surgical milestone was completed earlier this year at U Health Tower the flagship hospital of the University of Miami Health System RJ is one of just seven people nationwide to have received the trip let's check this out we currently have a clinical trials in the US for a product that we call telepathy which allows users to control phone or computer purely with their thoughts neural link is implanted with precision surgical robot is physically invisible and one week later users are able to see their thoughts transform into actions i'm about to play a video of our first user and what noland is doing is he's looking at a normal off the shelf MacBook Pro and with his neural link devices you're going to see he's going to be able to control the cursor simply with his mind no eye tracking oh and here we actually have noland playing Mario Kart noland is not the only cyborg playing Mario Kart in this clip we actually have a whole community of users as mentioned earlier and this is literally five of our first users of neural link playing Mario Kart together over call one of our cyborgs and i think this is for the first time someone playing a first cyborg cyborg i think i like we got a double check i think i did hear that but i was like you just move past that pretty quick he did say cyborg here i think i think you need to say cyborg hold on all right noland is not the only cyborg playing Mario Kart in this he what he called him cyborgs bro fuck we're here what that's not cool i keep going away that's not cool man it's not cool oh it's not cool this is literally five of our first users of neural link playing Mario Kart together over call um when i'm about to show you and i think this is for the first time someone playing a first person shooter game with a brain computer interface Alex shooting another i work basically all day from when i wake up i'm trying to wake up at like six or seven a.m. and i'll do work until sessions he's really unable to leave his house now with the neural link device we're going to show you clip of him with his kids at the park i've been a backman for a long time but i go outside now and i can control the computer with telepathy that's watching and he always brags about how good his handwriting was so we actually got to put it a test we gave him a robotic arm and i think this is the first time you tried using the robotic arm to write anything and this is a sped up version of writing at the convoy trial and drawing something and you're about to see him and his uncle uh playing again rock and paper scissors shoot rock paper scissors shoot cyborg's bro yeah i mean look dude don't call him that this is how they do it people are gonna think i'm shitting on the pier by saying this yeah this is how they do it okay this is how they get chat gpt accepted by everybody even though the people who are accepting it don't realize that it's going to eliminate their value in the world for the most part they don't understand that going on a user-versal basic income is going to mean poverty not not prosperity and they do it through greed okay they say hey look here business owners you can do all this shit with none of the overhead all right and then they get to adopt and it's no different with this chip with this chip right now that what are they doing they're showing you a story that no reasonable human being could argue with like i mean bro this is great yeah like yeah this is great shit yeah okay i can't say that it's not it's great i i think it's amazing that's amazing no all right but what happens after this what happens down the road what happens when you give the neural link to somebody who's you know an evil fuck yeah right okay and then what happens when everybody has the neural link and everybody has rock in their brain and everybody can know everything at once then the average human has to get it or they can't even be competitive right so you know dude this reminds me a lot of you know the bible man where they say in the mark of the beast you know like this is transhumanism this he just said cyborg they called him cyborg and floated over it listen bro that's because it's normal already in their mind they've already committed and it's already going and and it's not going to be able to be stopped because the average person cannot think past what they are shown and we've seen that and people say oh Andy you're not giving people enough credit no dude we've seen it the whole thing that happened with covid bro is writing people's faces and they they they they couldn't see it and this is the result of decades of demoralization to the point where you can't show people anything that will change their mind until they're legitimately enslaved by it excuse me right exactly like you could show people all kinds of evil things you could show them for example how many episodes did we do on covid how many experts did we bring in how many times did we show the the reality of how they were reporting cases and deaths and the the insurance data of the all-cause mortality rate on the vaccines and the cycle rate on the PCR tests and all of the the the ivermectin the hydrochloroquine that everything like we talked about it with data almost nonstop that entire time and nobody fucking listen and nobody nobody realized that it was bullshit until like a couple years later and and with AI AI replicates so fast and learns so fast and involves so fast that a couple years later is too late and and dude we're already past the fucking point i mean it's it there's no way to put it back in the box they launched it exactly how i said they would launch it years ago with greed to the entrepreneur they did exactly that and you know they're doing it exactly again here and and and i understand it's a hard thing to argue with when you see men who have been paralyzed who are now finding some joy and some relief and some ability to live a normal life i think that's fucking amazing and so does everybody else but the problem isn't with these kind of situations it's the rest of it yeah and so you know when i see this you know i think it's really good stuff but do we really believe that Elon's primary motivation for doing this is to help these guys or is it something bigger is it something more powerful like do we really believe that you know we're not gonna have GROC and i mean Elon's already set on tv bro there's gonna be more robots than there are people yeah well i think the truth is too man it's like everything can be anything can be corrupted right like i mean you even look at the idea like i mean i know the the facebook you know being created by the cia i know that's that's a that's a talk out there right but like let's say even just on the good value right like it was a great it was something you know social media in general you know it was used to connect people and people all across the fucking globe never been connected before yet but like there's still evil people who use it for bad things we just saw Elmo you know i'm saying like there's plenty of ways that things can get corrupt even if it does have good intentions in the beginning okay so true all right then the problem becomes when evil people are not held accountable and there's zero regulations for the next ten years well what do you do about that okay yeah but i'm when i'm saying is if we live in a society where evil wasn't tolerated and was held accountable appropriately it would be an easier thing to say okay this is okay this is cool yeah right but we live in a society where evil is not held accountable so that's that's where the concern comes from yeah you know yeah so i'm happy for these gentlemen i mean this is great this is great shit it is it is fun i mean it's pretty wild to just think just the level of humanity where we're at i mean just a control ship which i mean that's wild man that is freaking wild yeah well wait till you know they're able to control automobiles and traffic lights and lights yeah like dude it's gonna get it's gonna get to a point where if you don't have it you're you're an ill equipped human being you know what i mean it's a part literally yeah right yeah yeah fuck man like think if you think if you were if you took someone and they knew everything that grap knows and then you put them against someone who's just one of us that person gonna run circles around you no matter what in anything like everything it knows everything in a fucking instant what do you think's gonna happen with that nothing good no no i don't know i don't know man guys tell us what you guys think man down in the comments let us know with that final second of the show we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck as always i got some some this might be some hope for humanity or at least you know the testosterone filled men potentially right um a thumbs up or dumb as fuck hell on reads golfer beaten down thrown into pond by NHL enforcer breaks his silence i saw this okay all right so last week uh video went viral that showed a man verbally abusing another golfer on Alberta Springs golf course in red deer Alberta Canada on July 4th the man taking the verbal assault quickly had enough grab the

had over five million views on twitter uh with this uh initial tweet saying can you imagine running your mouth at the golf course only to get fed by former NHL or Nick Terence Sky Terensky Terensky Tarnaski there we go we'll just took me a couple of butchers but uh the bangs were straight out of the WWE and the guy was warned mess with the bull you get the horns hockey players are the best so

that's a big boy yeah big boy who's a fucking goon in the NHL that's what the fuck he did and by the way if you watch the whole video he actually did a great job restraining himself yeah he could have smashed that guy hard and then you know this is one of the typical icy red dudes you know what I'm saying oh yeah like whatever he deserved it so that says that when he punches his bang yeah yeah he's got a shirt chest man he's got a shirt that says bang bang bang on yeah so like dude this guy's like this guy apparently is like this is what he does yeah that's all he does is fight he had like a like 500 fights or something they ain't yo Jesus or some kind of crazy number and a bunch of fucking crazy penalty minutes to cheese but yeah I mean look bro he dispense a little justice on this dude yeah guy deserved it well so I feel like if we would have if this situation would have happened five years ago what do you think the junk guy or the dudes who got his ass be what do you think his reaction would have been what do you think the world society oh he would have said look bro I don't think I think he would have handled it exactly how he did handle it only little pussy bitches getting fights and then threaten to sue right and all this shit right right I'm the victim bro you ran your mouth you got beat up it's okay it's happened to everybody I've got my ass kicked before and you know what I deserved it yeah right right and if we as men could just accept that as reality the world be a much better place all right Andy because here's the thing the man who was on the receiving end of a beating from a former pro hockey player oh not better to golf course last week is now admitting he was drunk and surely and he is apologizing for causing the ruckus that led to the fight that's the rightful thing to do here we go it's yeah go ahead here we got a clip here it is yeah that's me you're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation yep that's me guys they got they got dropped like a bucket of balls and a pond now my finest moment I know looks real bad play 36 holes in golf we drank way too much and my mom ran faster in my brain all jokes aside guys I'd like to apologize to all the folks on the course anyone caught up in it and anyone who had to deal with me that day I lost my cool and I've learned from it just one of those days where you should have kept the card on the path you know stay hydrated keep sick on the ice maybe stick the key 36 holes life right there's a shit summer golf man I mean look dude that's what you do that's what a man does I mean you're not gonna win every fucking thing bro and sometimes you're gonna be the asshole and it's not everybody else sometimes it is you sometimes it's you you know and you know you've got to say sorry guys I'm an asshole you know like where somebody's got to tell you I just I just think that's the way it should be like I don't know like I've been an asshole plenty of times and you know afterwards I always felt bad and you know apologize and say it fucked up like I don't really understand what the whole why people have such a hard time apologize what the hang up is there yeah like what you're not supposed to be perfect bro like if people do dumb shit you know like fuck if I if I had a you know I mean look I've had plenty of times where I've had a few too many things to drink and gotten into it when I should know I mean it's it's okay it should happens man yeah it should happens but it wasn't the alcohols fault that's the that's the piece like to me I think society's healing I'm proud of this dude dude I mean what how can you not respect that that's what I'm saying like I mean all right not you definitely got rock bro but like bro imagine being like in one of those situations where you know you're fucking hammer and you're like you know feeling a little bit you to feel a little fucking hoppy you know I'm saying too many netty lights and then you got the fucking dude who's like job is to beat the shit out of people at a cell is like the guy took me guy they picked the worst guy oh my god yeah I mean look and this is why hockey players are the best because you know what they tell you the truth you get in fucking fights and then it's over and it's over and it's over bro it's they are the best baseball guys are close second close second yeah yeah yeah I'm listen I'm happy for this whole situation all the way around yeah there's no arrest no there's no lawsuits bro we should be able to fist fight and then be friends afterwards it's not supposed to yeah and like if you're not competent in fist fighting don't get in a fist fight keep your mouth shut you know saying like bro with the amount of dudes that are trained in fighting now like you you should be cautious about who you talk to and how you talk to yeah and what you saying and and and dude you know seeing reds not gonna get it done bro like when he fucking crawled out the fucking pond the first time on all four well bro you could see what was happening like when he was like standing there and he was like they're like bro you're not scared anybody and he's just like his adrenaline's going higher and higher and higher and eventually you just don't care you're like fuck I don't care if I get my ass beat ding ding my fuck yeah and like and that's usually how you get your ass beat because you ain't thinking right well I guarantee you probably didn't think that he would have brought into a fucking NHL fucking pro boxer that he did know because it was hilarious on a fucking go the amount of air that was underneath him when he tossed him like the last little hip toss oh man that was great you want to see it again yeah I do there comes get out I just like when he crawled out the pond bro this right here yeah looks like he's in that movie the ring bro that's I was thinking like that was like a WWE move with it like crawling back up into the fucking wrestling man bro and that is buddy over here he's like trying to calm this dude down bro listen don't get in a way that just move yeah just move I actually think he had them self pretty good the big guy yeah like he could have been he could have been way harder on that dude why is that I mean because I was even I mean I know with all the fights and hockey there's still rules yeah you know he's not gonna just fucking ground and pound yeah you know yeah man it's uh he apparently he did comment on it to ransky he went on the podcast but it hasn't aired just yet so I know what his take is on the whole thing I it'll probably be the same as ours yeah it's probably hey man fucking it is what it is you know fucking drunk idiot yeah right yeah I mean school look how many times does that guy been drunk and probably got his ass kicked probably a few you know I'm saying alcohol is bad for fucking people with high testosterone yeah like it really is yeah not a good mix no not a good mix yeah so thumbs up on this yeah I like it I think I think more people should get in fist fights and not be fucking pussy's about it and I think you know and I'm not talking about these gang fights where all your friends jumping I'm talking about a one-on-one fucking scrap at the end of it you're both so tired you're like fuck that was stupid now let's drink alcohol yeah I don't know dude like that was the error that I grew up in like it was a normal thing I don't know if kids still do this shit like I don't do the do do young kids fight anymore or do they just go online talk shit mostly that and then and then it's no then shoot yeah yeah then what shooting yeah I mean when I was younger growing up it was like it was normal like you had a problem with someone you fuck a fist-fought him even if you didn't know how to fight and it's just what it is man and sometimes you lost sometimes you won and honestly man like out of all the times I got in fist fights out usually afterwards it made the friendship better you know what I mean yeah so I don't know man yeah well thumbs up for this man one one you know society changing one golf course at a time yeah fuck yeah well guys Andy that is all I have yeah guys all
