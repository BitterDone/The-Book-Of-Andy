What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about it lies the fakeness and delusions of modern society and welcome the motherfucking reality. Guys as always we have DJ. Yeah there he is. Special full length episode today we got a special guest Mr. Tom Saguera. What's happening brother? How are you? Good having me man. Yeah man it's great to have you here too. He's in town doing the Fox Theater. How is it? It's amazing dude. It's one of the most beautiful theaters in the country. I've always been playing St. Louis like my whole career you know I think my first stop here was at Helium. I've done like a variety of different venues I've been to the Fox a few times it's one of the best it's one of the best theaters in the country. It sucks when you came in though man we had the fucking storm. Yeah it was it was took out man it was actually a gnarly descent in the St. Louis. Yeah we touched down about 10 minutes before the tornado and you could tell something was happening. Yeah but yeah we made it through it you know people people were fun last night. Yeah was it good? Yeah it was great. Yeah it was great. Same look let me do look we got to get left off the list of a lot of things let's be real. That's real. You know I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fucking war zone that we're living downtown but we always appreciate you coming through and absolutely man. So what's been going on? Got a new Netflix new series out. Yeah it's called Bad Thoughts. It's on Netflix. It was the most fun I've ever had like creatively making it you know because it was kind of like it really was the thing you dream of where the studio the network in this case was just like pretty much like just make what you want. Yeah because I've been through other development processes and pilots where you know the first time you meet with executives they're like yeah make what you want and then a couple of months in they're like take all this shit out. And you're like not like that. Yeah yeah and it's it's a real bummer of a process when it's like that. So this was like the opposite where we got to make I mean pretty wild stories that we wrote it's basically anthology so it's it's like these self-contained stories and we we got to make what we wanted so it was it was really fun. And nobody stepped in and said hey wait a minute dude this is like a little too much. I mean there's a couple times where they were like this is pretty much. They're like this is pretty crazy. You know in the writing process very like very few notes and then in the edit you know they were like this is particularly gruesome can we can we dial this back and we were like maybe. Yeah but dude isn't that the isn't that the like isn't that the point like isn't the point to walk the line in the bush. Yeah yeah I think I mean also I think you know in the stories we were making we were making pretty crazy stories. You know one is about a guy who goes to a barista and they put in he has for a splash of milk and they basically give him like a cup of milk and so he's like hey can you remake this and the barista is really rude and so then the guy kills everybody in the right. Well I mean we've all been there bro. Yeah it's like wish fulfillment. Everybody has encountered a retail person where you're like I'm gonna fucking kill this guy. Yeah I want to and everybody else. Yeah exactly. All of you. So that was like the fantasy of the story and then they were like hey this is pretty violent. I was like yeah that's the whole point. That's a violent fantasy. And then they let it go. I mean I rip a guy's jaw out of his face and things so. I've learned not to fuck with my baristas though man. I know. You should never fuck with people that fuck with your food. Food specifically but like you know the they-them's like bro like they'll get you. The they-them's bro. They will get you bro like I've learned just to leave it alone. Even if it is fucked up I'll just leave it alone man. You just leave it alone bro. The problem is dude is the they-them's a catcher for not being a they-them. My my they like me. Well that's because you're a black. That's true. I'm my pot. Yeah. No I do get a pass. Yeah. You definitely get a better treatment than we do. It's all how things have changed. That's a little different now. That's a little different now. Dude that's sick. I was thinking before the show that was like because that was first of all bad thoughts was fucking awesome. Oh thanks man. It is absolutely. If you guys have not seen that yet you need to go watch it like right now. Please. It's definitely in line with our audience for sure. Oh dude. Yeah. We're no stranger to fucking crush the fucking line. I want to ask on that like how did it-so where these just like how much of- I want to-okay I got some question is how much of that stuff was like real shit that actually happened to you or like are these like or was it just like okay like let's just create the funniest shit we can possibly think of. I mean there's- Is there some reality in there? You know like the coffee thing came is like it's like this cathartic thing to write because you go like it came from the the whole thing where I'd seen so many times I'd go hey I get a splash of milk and I'd see them go like one two three four I'm like you know what a fucking splash is like a splash is a splash you know and so you know you can talk about that you can think about that but the most fun thing to do is to write a story where you go this thing happens to me all the time yeah here's like a different version of how you know it's like it's a fantasy right so it's a it's a war plan right yeah but it's also like it's like the healthiest way to channel like those feelings and emotions you go like well you can just complain about it or you can like write a story about this fantasy so that's like one version of a story right I mean there's a bunch of different ones in there like there's the me with the twins I don't know if you some that's the black and white one where I just had this I had this idea where I was like hey what if we do one where a woman sees me in a window and tells me to like waves me in and then what I pitched was the woman is dropped at gorgeous and then she's like do you want to have sex with me and I go yeah and she goes okay well first you have to fuck somebody as gross as you and I go what and then what we were gonna do was have a woman come in and we were gonna deep fake my face on her so that it would be a sex scene between me and me you know like that was the idea and then one of the other directors Rami Hishash he was like what if it was a conjoined twin oh and I was like oh and I liked it more so we wrote the story so I play Joseph who looks like me and then I also play the the twin on the back of her on her back growing up and so then I do kind of have sex with me like that was the whole it so these were just I mean it's no different than you know every other day yeah yeah you know so they were all like they came from all these different places but yeah it was all a lot of it came from that writer's room just like throwing ideas or which is like the most writers room is like this where you just sit down you have a board everyone's writing shit down and you're pitching and then every few I don't know every hour or something you go like oh shit and then when you get excited you're like I'll be back and you run out you just sit and write right and then you bring it back to the room and you guys read it together and it's like it's a very fun like kind of atmosphere it's like a hangout it's like a hangout like super funny comedy writers and like it's the best because you you're getting like eight nine different people's minds on the thing and then you kind of you know you you end up there's no you you let your ego go you don't go like well this was my idea you yeah it's whoever has the best idea that you kind of go like that's it yeah yeah I mean dude that's you know that's in line with anything I think great right yeah for sure great leaders you know you're the leader of your team it's you know it's about picking the the best product not the fucking idea at a hundred percent and like I think a production like a show is not unlike kind of running a company in a way where the best thing you can do is is try to surround yourself with the best talent like you want the you like I want the best production designer you know director of photography like all these people that are in charge of different departments and you want people to like be great yeah you're like fucking go kill it yeah like your ideas yeah like let's let's hear him let's do him I think that's the difference between you know I mean dude you know a gazillion entrepreneurs and and I really think that's the the biggest difference between great entrepreneurs great business people yeah and and shitty ones is like the shitty ones think that they have to have all the ideas and they don't want to surround themselves with other people yeah and the great ones are like fuck dude everybody smarter than me here that's right like that's what I I want everybody to be smarter than me that's I mean if I have like any gift in what I do it's identifying great people yeah and being like hey come work with me yeah you know like that's what I try to do well is like I go like I'm okay you're great yeah you come work with me like that's what I want to do is yeah have great people around yeah bro and and you know it's it's interesting because like people will come here and they you know that are like oh dude you know everything's so cool you're doing such I'm like bro it's them yeah these guys are fucking good you know so I always feel like a little bit guilty because I'm like I get a lot of the credit but my team is fucking amazing I feel like that with the the show entirely it's like it's my face and my name yeah and everybody kind of like goes like it's you you you and I'm like well it's partially me but the reason it is what it is is like these 50 other people do you look at it like do you look at it like hey man this is just my role on the team yeah I mean I feel like yeah you know you have a role I think in you know the thing is like it's so different like stand up is so singular right it really literally is just you you write the stuff you perform it yeah you hold a mic and it's just you on stage and it's a very kind of like the only way at tour works is with a team but stand up is very singular but a show or a movie is the absolute polar opposite it's like it's like running a business right where you're like maybe you're that in this case like the CEO of it but then you have to hire an entire team and you if you if you are like no no no everything runs through me whatever you make is definitely gonna suck yeah you know you really have to like empower people and go like you run this shit too and you kind of you run your department you know you have to let them encourage them to like take over in what they do that's the only way a TV or or or film like TV show or films going to be entertaining well you you you run your own media right like you you have everything yeah we we have like a YMH studios yeah so like we produce a lot of podcasts we produced the show bad thoughts we're producing a feature film so yeah it's you know it runs through our company but it's all about like hiring great people yeah for sure thousand percent it's big man well I thought something else was interesting time though we I've been noticing too you you've had like a transformation journey oh a bit a little bit a little bit of a glow up yeah let's talk about it yeah well okay sure let's talk about I mean because I mean well dude it's like a group effort man you got jelly roll down uh you know 200 pounds yeah dude he looks fucking great yeah I just saw him in concert this past Tuesday at bushy stadium with a postman he looks amazing yeah well we did the 5k two weeks ago yeah and I hadn't seen him in person since the 5k the previous year which was like almost exactly a year to the day and he was down 130 from 130 pounds from last May and 200 overall and then at the 5k he was like next year at the 5k I want to be down another hundred I want to be 240 he'll do it I'm I totally I'm glad he's doing that bro because like he's such he's so good at what he does and all I was thinking when he was like big big was like fuck it's gonna be another dude that the dies yeah I know I mean also I'll tell you this like so we got to Raymond James were the bucks play that's where I had the 5k and you know like last year we did the Rose Bowl and so they had us start in the parking lot in Pasadena and they laid out this track like on side streets right and then you kind of run back through this parking lot and I was like I was imagining something like that I don't know the layout of Raymond James Stadium right so I just show up and they're like hey there's a lot of uphill and I go what do you mean and they're like well it's they made it all within the stadium well the only way to hit 3.1 miles in the stadium is you kind of follow this path and then you take the corridor like the ramps down and then you take them up nine stories all up right and then you go across the stadium down again and then up again so I was like yeah this is like half a mile that's just all incline which like you know well that's hard enough to do when you could drink a beer all day it's hard to do honestly like if you're like if you're like moderately fit yeah right and so like when I heard he was coming because I knew he was coming with there like he's coming later this afternoon because he had flown in from a show we were out there I was like yeah I don't know if he can do this man right we were like you know he's still big dude yeah and then I was thinking like cardio and knees I was like man it's gonna be 90 by the time he degrees outside by the time he gets here and I go this is like fucking all incline so I was like actually worried and then like when he got there I was like all right well you know I don't know if we tell him or he crushed it yeah he did it at 3.40 like all these inclines and yeah he crushed it yeah it sounds like camel bag mountain for us oh yeah fuck that well you ever you ever did camel bag um Arizona no don't bro that was miserable yeah dude that was fucking miserable we got we got half dude we we started so we had this big event there was like a couple hundred people like a like a group thing sort of like a group run club right yeah and they were all meeting down there did you camel back and DJ and I got up early we had been fucking drinking all night and I was like all right let's get there early so we can like get like up the mountain book so nobody sees this fucking dying right yeah I knew it was gonna be we were polling people before yeah I'm saying I think that's where we fucked up it yeah yeah polling people and it was like a 50 50 like hey how is it and we either got it was death or was the easiest fucking thing they've ever done yeah yeah yeah you know I think that's where we fucked up that cuz like I'm like we don't really know what to expect I will say there's this thing I mean it's not like a new observation but like when you're doing it cuz what I was doing the actual this run I feel like if I had been just alone I'd been like man fuck this yeah the fact that there's like thousands of people yeah and you start for you you hit that turn and you see the I had no idea that it was nine incline ramps up I was like mother and then you just you just do it yeah pure pressure it's pure the pure pressure really does yeah and then I found like I'm on this path like you know it's all mapped out and I see this guy and he's like shirtless and kind of yoked like like midway and he's let's say I don't know 100 yards behind me and then I got it in my head I was like I can't let this fucking hot guy pass me so every time I would like wrap around and I'd see him coming I was like you cannot let this guy beat and then you just like keep running hard and every time I was like man I want to like slow down catch my breath I'd be like that fucking hot guy's gonna beat you and then it's just gonna it's gonna make you upset so I just and I told him afterwards I was like I didn't want you to fucking pass me man he was like really I was like yeah dude like he was my motivation but I feel like if I was alone you'd just be like I'm tired fuck this yeah yeah where we started like 30 45 minutes before oh yeah I didn't want to see everybody see me die yeah so like I got like I wanted to get like halfway up before we started this motherfucker shows up with walking sticks like he's and all this equipment like he's going up fucking Mount Everest be prepared yeah you know what I'm saying so we get like we we we're like dude legit we're like struggling we're it's hard we're like up there and I'm like fuck we gotta be this we gotta be close and he and he tasked me on the shoulder and he points up at the thing and I see this like little line looks like fucking ants like go and I'm like fuck yeah so dude I'm like dude me to ever stand there I'm like dude maybe we should just go back down no one's up here and right as I said that dude the group is coming up they're like Andy are you on your way down and I'm like fuck so we ended up doing it but how far is that is that dude it was I don't know it was only like straight up yeah but yeah yeah yeah it's like you know there's not a path bro like you're like using your hands and shit to find a way yeah I'm not built for that shit now dude yeah I was not big boy friendly yeah but uh but no dude you're your transformation has been sick man thanks man I mean I think it's probably like and you know like anything where it's just kind of what you prioritize yeah you know like you think you think you prioritize things then you realize that just thinking about it is not a priority like you have to do things so I think I just put more of an emphasis on training more and you know like eating is obviously like such a big thing especially when you travel for a living because you're just in different cities and you know you are man hotel gyms and yeah hotel gyms I mean food is I think for us the biggest thing right because like when I started my career as a stand-up doing the road you know comedy clubs are notorious for like you know it's bad food it's not good for you it's like it's mozzarella sticks and chicken wings and and that's kind of and we're there late and that was just I don't know I'm 23 you don't even think about it you just start eating that shit and then 10 years go by and you're like you've gained 50 pounds and but you're also just like and this is what it is you just kind of resigned to like you know I'm up late I sleep in we eat like shit I'm on the road I'm a comedian who cares and then all of a sudden you're like approaching 40 and you're like what am I fucking doing with my life you know like you're just kind of a mess really you're on a you're on a path that you realize can go a certain way and I think especially in comedy like we kind of like romanticize it we're like like we make it cool to be a slob yeah I'm a comment you laugh about yeah you're like who cares we drink beer and eat like shit and sleep in but then you're like yeah like you don't have to do that you know to to do stand-up like it's not a prerequisite even though you kind of let yourself yeah justification yeah you justify it and then you're just like I don't know then you just hit a certain point where you're like this is not a great way to live like you can take care of yourself and then I think the biggest thing is you end up you know people always see you physically transform but you just feel so much better you know like you physically and mentally you're like I'm thinking more clearly I feel better I'm happy like you're probably able to create better shit oh my god like yeah now I tell people it's like a lot of my days are really slammed with like you know 100 things right and I go when I come into my office we have like recordings and interviews and add things and then like you know we're we're gonna shoot things and we got meetings it's like a full day I I've learned that if I work out first like before I go in I'm just like a so much better version of myself like I come in and like sometimes I even staff are like damn like you're in a good mood and I'm like yeah I just came from the gym like a favorite and then I actually feel like I have energy for that day yeah whereas opposed the other way of like where I just show up I feel like I'm dragging that day yeah and in dude I did the exact same about two years ago I think I will come in here because we always talk about what the fuck's going on in the world and I get super pissed off yeah and like I would come in here bro and like I'd be so fucking pissed off and then I figured out if I train right before like I was that's you know what I was doing right before this I train right before even though I still get pissed yeah like it's it's like it's like not nuclear it's like it's it's tolerable yeah you need it you need it dude it's yeah I think we all you know everybody thinks of a or a lot of people think of that as just like like working out as just like for your muscles you know of like oh you're trying you know stronger whatever which is obviously good for you but I think the what it does to you mentally totally is like there's like there's like there's just the fog of sleep goes away yeah things just fire faster and I actually literally feel happier me too I actually I'm in a better mood yeah I'm not like a naturally happy person yeah so I have to like like I you know actually to be real dude like naturally happy people kind of fucking annoy me yeah like what the fuck is wrong with this person yeah dude like but what are you rushing or something no I do I don't know like I don't know I'm Sicilian but like I don't I don't know what it is bro like the chipper people you know I know yeah I know it's like fuck man yeah what the fuck did I do wrong I know you know so but yeah dude working out does it man like it definitely helps me a lot it's so did you guys like all get together and like who is the ring leader of of this I think it was like a slow birth loss of shit time too didn't he he's he yeah he has he goes up and down quite a bit yeah so like he was he trimmed down and what look was looking great in his special that he shot he shot it in November so it's been like you know six seven months and in just those six seven months I think he's put on like 30 plus pounds yeah but he also you know he's he's kind of a he's a weird athlete too like he's somebody where if he was like all right today I'm just gonna clean it up you know in two weeks he'd be down 15 pounds yeah and like he he just bounces back real quick and then he falls off because he just we're on related parties like he you know he's fun it's fun he's on the road he drinks he eats like a psycho and then he gains all this weight and then he just like pivot's back now I think it's you know the older you get you're more like dude this is crazy like just hang out in one weight group but but yeah he just does that for me I just feel like I I still can gain and lose but I have like a a tighter window yeah where I get if I'm like right now I feel like I'm at my max I'm like all raining it in being like I was too much you know I mean like yeah I don't want it to go you know what it's like to let it go exactly how much work it is I'm not gonna do another 10 like I'll rain it in now yeah it's too me to I was about 40 to figure that out yeah it took me the same yeah yeah I was like fuck this is not worth it because I would get in shape and then I would go like I would get down to like 250 which is in shape for me and then I would fuck it be 350 and then I would be 250 and then I did that like three or four times yeah fuck I think it's I mean yeah there's a certain age where you're like I can't do this like this not it's just not good but I don't know man it has to stay on your mind like nothing will nothing will just like happen you know like I feel like a lot of people they're like the the the curse of it is that you can think about it all day and not do anything yeah do you know I mean like there's people who like wake up and they go I'm really unhappy physically like with my body you know all this shit and go to bed with the same thoughts and like not change anything right like this forever forever yeah it's like a version of insanity yeah and then they end up telling about it they end up selling themselves on some fucking bullshit like oh well this is just the way I always trying to find it yeah yeah it's like I yeah I mean eventually it's hard to tell yourself that shit you get tired of telling it and you just go you also just accept that like okay Ben like I'm gonna have to eat this way yeah if I want to eat the other way then you accept what comes with it right so yeah it's a lot of like yeah man lean protein and you know it's like like I want the pasta but I'm like no yeah and then the workouts I feel like are they're not like I don't resist the work like I like the workout but the work of it I think is you still have to find the time you know like that's the big challenge yeah you got to find the time so a lot of it is just like I mean that's why great like Sean comes with me is that you know sometimes I'm like well I guess there's not enough time to work out and then he'll be like what the fuck are you talking about we can just go right now yeah okay like that kind of shit yeah dude because the truth the matter is yeah even a 30 minute quick workout is still get the job done man if you like clearing your mind if you hit it yeah you can make 30 minutes go along what yeah for sure definitely real man well one of the other things so we talk a lot about like you know culture stuff things are happening right now right and you know since we have a fucking global figure in comedy I wanted to try to I guess ask you what should take on cancel culture and comedy and what what have you seen the ebbs and flows go in that I mean I feel like the big conversation piece of that was like a few years ago when that idea kind of was floated but I also feel like it's kind of here here's the difference between the world today and 30 years ago like 30 years ago if you were a comedian or somebody and you said some shit that upset people maybe there be a new story about it but it's mostly that some like it would mostly be somebody is mad they would just tell somebody else yeah there's no way you knew they were mad but there's also no way that back then people weren't mad about shit do you know what I mean like you just the differences today we have all these devices where people can tell you that they're mad about what you said and I feel like like like like a lot of comedians will be like oh you know like they're they're complaining that someone's upset about what they did and you're like yeah that's part of the thing dude like you're you can't you can't be a comedian who goes I'm gonna say whatever I want to say and it's not cool if somebody gets upset you're like that's how it works like you know I mean like you're you're the one who's actually being super complaining right now like you have to let people say that they don't like what you said like that's the exchange I'm gonna say some shit and like yeah you every comedian wants you to love everything they said that's just the way it goes even the ones who they all want you to so some of them are just complaining that hey people got mad about this that's bullshit you're like no that's part of how it goes like you're the complaining little bitch right now right because you're upset the people are upset because my thing is like what where is somebody really being canceled in in stand-up let's say I'm talking in the comedy space because some of them will be like oh I can't say this like yes you can sure you just can't dictate that everyone will love it you know dude that whole saying of you can't say this is so fucking annoying it's a it's a tired trope bro yeah like oh dude they want let us say who won't let you say yeah you won't let you say what they're really saying is they're like I'm I'm mad that some people are mad about what I said it's like that's the exchange bro I've never seen someone get canceled that didn't come out bigger I'm never seen it happen because it's like it's a made up kind of like you're not really canceled I mean are there a few examples probably I can't even really like where you go you said some shit and now you can't get work yeah like because that's really what canceled means right and I think look yeah there I mean yeah there's a people the worst people I think in society are people who go like you said something I'm going to try to contact your employers yeah so that you lose your job that's a weak piece of shit that's that is the worst and I have like zero respect for the person that goes I don't like something somebody said I'm going to try to make this person lose their like their livelihood that's insane yeah but I'm like in comedy like right who's who's stopping you from selling tickets bro like say whatever you want to say also if you don't if you stop selling tickets that's on you yeah that's not like somebody attacking you just fuck it suck the market is dictating why you're not selling it so I just don't really buy that like comics are being canceled I really think that like if you say wild shit and it's really funny guess what people will be like that she was really funny so it was crazy let's be real dude like the best comedians in history the best stand-ups in history when you go back in like the fucking 80s like Eddie Murphy before he was like a dad on TV you know the guy was fucking raw oh yeah and like the lyrics and like bro like these kids these days but they're a little fucking vaginas like go fucking watch that shit bro like and you know what you know what like then you look at Chappelle like when he was doing a Chappelle show and like yeah these things made culture stronger because it taught us that we could all laugh at each other and make fun of each other well that's your pal example too which was like great was that like he put out a special and then everyone you know there's people like walking out a Netflix and like it was all in the news and people were calling them transphobic and they were like always being canceled and you're like what are you talking about like I mean you go to the show I went to a show with him the following week I was at that I was I was opening on that show and there was fucking 18,000 people at the show yeah and you're like yeah I don't think this cancellation is like working can't believe this is awesome right that's right people were like overusing that term and it's like you know I don't he doesn't need me to defend him but it was like one of those things where I'm like no no like you're saying he's being canceled what you're what really happening is that some people are really pissed about something he said and that's fine like that's how the world works like not everyone's gonna be like yay for everything you say but he's definitely not canceled like yeah yeah he just had you know there's a he's pulling he's doing stand-up in an NBA arena right now and there's it's completely sold out like I think it's working out yeah no shit makes it worse too bro because like they're like Dave Chappelle comedian says you know trans people aren't whatever it's like he's a fucking comedian well the reason it's funny is cuz fucking true bro like that's the fucking thing like it's true that's what that's why comedy's funny it's fucking true you're able to say truth said everybody's thinking about nobody knows and just laugh about that's why it's so important to culture man like everybody's you know the all this tension and shit this comes from people being too serious about shit and taking things to too fucking you know much to heart and like a lot of times the people that are the most upset about these like stand-up things the funny thing is not only have they not been to see that stand-up live sometimes they don't even watch the special and they write the article yeah so it's like they're not even actually they haven't seen they haven't seen the actual performance what they'll do is they'll read an excerpt like lit like read it so they just are reading the written word and then they write an article about which is like it's just this click-bady bullshit man it's not real it's the world we live in it's not real it's like it's it's like this manufactured thing where like then people read that person's article who also haven't seen the thing and the funny thing is all those people that are like the most upset dude they wouldn't go to that show anyway never about they're just commenting on some shit because it makes them feel like they're doing something to express how wrong these other people are and it's like dude they're not even going like it's all just my point is it's just all noise like it's just this side show thing that's not you can be distracted by it or the better thing you do is you just ignore it and you just realize that like it is somebody trying to get attention for themselves it is right to do with way they don't have anything creatively to create on their own no it's it's like all the fucking reaction videos on the internet which some of them I like but like dude some of these motherfuckers their whole fucking thing is all I do is react to other people shit like bro that's not creation of anything I know I know you know and that's like a cheap way to get attention in my opinion yeah it's like yeah that that is a whole lane but it's it goes like those people you see the reaction video so you know what it is half of the people that write articles they're doing reaction articles and they don't even watch the thing to react to they just pick a word and they go I'm a right article about this yeah like okay it's crazy man so you're so you're on tour right now um I was looking at the like it's a long tour you're going on for this two years it's a two year tour um I you know my last tour was actually even busier um but this one is like uh yeah I mean you basically hit every major North American market and then you select other global markets to do and you take your time like I like to take my time like there's no point of like rushing a tour yeah so it's like yeah I'll just take a couple years you know uh next week is my last week of spring tour and then I take most of the summer off okay so it's like you know get some rest hang out with the family pick up in the fall I'll shoot it in the next special in the fall and then next year 26 I just have like some things to film but I won't actually like tour so it'll be like a much different like schedule for me yeah what's the best and worst cities you've uh you've had to do stand up well the funny thing about and you gotta say saying Lewis it's fine no no no the funny thing about picking back best of worst is that you learn over the course of time that sometimes you have a bad show in a city and then you go this city sucks for stand up and it really was just that night you should be right right yeah or like conversely you'll go this city is great and so in your mind you go it'll be great then you show up in the show is like okay and you're like what happened it's like those things those can change year after year you can go to a place where it was great and it's bad and bad now it's great I think what you fall in love with are cities almost like separate from the show you know what I mean like it's always fun for me to like I love going to Denver because I like the city of Denver I like I like the atmosphere I like the restaurants like I have a good time and then the shows have typically been really fun for me um it's always fun to I like big cities so I like going to New York I like doing London I like to you know I mean like but I have a lot of great places that I mean I love the beauty of like like British Columbia you know like in the in the northwest like the Vancouver area I just like being in that atmosphere and you know Chicago's always been like a super fun city for me to go to and like crowds have been fun so I have fun in a lot of cities man yeah that's everything so you're like living life as you go too yeah yeah you're trying to like you know like you know a lot of times you don't have time to do that much shit a lot of times we're doing like Thursday one city Friday night so you don't really like get to enjoy the city that much yeah but you know sometimes you do have a little more and like like New York for instance I just love the fact that you can walk the streets and you feel like you're in this vibrant city you know it doesn't matter what time it doesn't matter that's like it's like it's and it charges you it charges you up and I'm usually there for like couple days so it's just so different than where I live in Austin and I mean been going to New York like most of my life and it's just you know it's just still like the greatest city to visit and and have fun and totally agree dude it's my favorite place to go to for the exact same reason like dude you could walk out on the street fucking 230 in the morning bro and it's like it's new and also like you realize that it is funny that you can literally bring up anything and they're like oh yeah we have a store you want elephants feet yeah we have that like anything that you bring up like New York hat any cuisine any type of store whatever you're looking for like you can be like I want pencils or you know I want to fucking yeah pens made from metal that are crafted from the 18th century they're like yeah there's a store over here yeah have that like anything you want that city has which is like it just feels like you're I don't know like in this manufactured city almost like I almost didn't feel real for me still what's your favorite place to do to work outside of outside the US besides London well I mean I when I started like touring as a stand-up I would do Canada a lot that was like the first place to to to leave the country even though it's not that big of a departure and it was always fun to do those shows up there um Australia has great just they're they're very fun people like Australians are fun so I think it translates to their crowds like I've had a lot of really fun shows in Australia the people in the cities are great um but I've done you know I've done stand-up in uh South America in Argentina in Chile I've done Mexico City I've done a lot of European cities and I've done Asia too I've done Tokyo Hong Kong Singapore so all those like the Asia tour was fucking just so cool because those cities are so different than what we're used to and like the food is unbelievable I've never had better food in my life than in Tokyo I had I knew that it would be good I didn't know that like did you know what it was though well yeah yeah I didn't know like how amazing uh let like you order a salad in Tokyo and like every bite you're like this is the best salad I've ever had that's crazy and then they're like you order a fruit plate and you take a bite of a strawberry you're like what the and then you realize like how poisoned our food in this country which is like one of the most backwards things you're like why is our food so you know we're just spraying everything with pesticides and then in Tokyo I mean I'm not kidding dude like you just you order an omelet or like in the hotel you tired like we're not going to go out to a nice crazy we're just going to go like here in the hotel in the lobby and you order a sirloin steak and you're like this best fucking steak I've ever had in my entire like like every meal was like that everything we had we were like this is amongst the best food I've ever had and it was every day no matter what we had and then you order a cup of coffee and you're like Jesus Christ this is the best coffee I've ever had in my life that's what it was like to eat in Tokyo yeah I don't know Tokyo man I like food I've never been to Asia at all oh dude let me tell you man like there's there's a lot I'm but the first one I should say there's a lot I haven't seen but in the place those those places that I've been I mean Hong Kong is a spectacle it is like New York roided up like it literally you like you think you're seeing the downtown skyline and then you go like around this bend and you see something like 20 more times more buildings and you're like what is happened like it's this massive thriving alive city not that Tokyo isn't but the thing that stands out from Tokyo is like the Japanese people the culture you know everybody in Japan like the cashier at the 7-Eleven takes great pride in being in is in their job and you like you sense it you know I mean there is no like oh no man yeah like there is none of that people have like so you this this whole Japanese culture and way of being like it really is impressive you know the pride people take in excellence it's all about the reason like some of those foods are so great is they're like yeah that guy he makes coffee and he's done that for 45 years he takes pride and he takes so much pride in it it's like this meticulous like perfect thing and you see that kind of in all parts of life they are like gracious like for a city with so many people I mean you know on the morning commute like there's this famous thing you can find online of like the rush of the subway and you don't like it's all organized there's no like people like fucking off and like being like they're like oh yeah no one's being an asshole because they know it's rude to be an asshole in the you know I mean like in the morning commute like things like that where you're like wow and then Singapore is the cleanest like you know like may almost make it because they beat people's asses yeah they don't fuck around yeah bro yeah they fucking can you ask bear ass right in front of the whole there's this thing when you land in Singapore where there's signs and you're going up you're walking up to do you know customs and it's just like drugs punishable by death don't you just cry it's like it's like all over and then they hand you the form and it's like we will kill you for drugs and then you're like filling it out and you're like do I have any drugs on me and you start drugs is 99 before I need to check real quick do you start to panic you're like I got to go through my backpack real quick because what if I have like a edible I mean they're like oh they will hang you yeah oh shit but then you get into that city and you it's like I mean it's like it's the cleanest place you've ever been people again super polite it's just it's a really cool experience I mean I can't encourage you enough to do an Asia trip yeah baby sick dude I got invited to by one of the guys on Instagram he runs like all the elephant reserves he invited us to go over there and let's go see the elephants let's go elephants are fucking sweet big yeah well they're smart to you bro yeah super smart yeah oh but I'll get like confused for one you could you probably be able to ride one man I know you can't ride a horse okay I can ride a fuck your horse no you can you fucking kill the horse time you got you got two two boys right I have two boys yeah yeah they're not like little kids though right six and nine oh it's just young yeah yeah that's sure has that changed like your outlook on comedy at all um the shit you talk about maybe I mean for sure you talk about it because excuse me uh I I always felt like you should just talk about whatever's going on actually happy yeah so like you know when you know your first hour set is you like you're in your 20s it's just like observations and it's like TV shows it's going out you know drinking part whatever and then you know it's like you're you get engaged you're like well I'm gonna talk about that you know like you're married like you know those things that are whatever you're experiencing it's like you know my dad died talk about that you just talk about whatever's happening so like kids sure it's like I don't want to do an hour on having kids but like I always have something because they're they're part of life they're part of my life and you know they're too little wild dudes man they're just just ruining everything we have like basically there's such little shit yeah and they're both in jujitsu and it's just like it's so funny because the older one he's like I think I'm stronger than you I'm like you're definitely not stronger than me dude and he's like you want to try I'm like yeah sure I think you're nine I will fuck you up and then he'll try to like you know mountainean I'm like just pick him up putting down he's like oh wow you definitely still stronger yeah I know this doesn't have like no expiration date but I'm gonna I'm gonna remind you of this for a while yeah yeah yeah yeah make it so bad so we don't even try to get what's that you gotta make it so bad you don't try to get no he's like he's coming it sounds like he's gonna keep drawing it's coming yeah it's not saying every day I get home he takes his shirt off he's like and he goes I'm gonna be so fucking jacked and the thing is he has like these like he's like lean you know I mean like he's already like kind of muscular and I'm like I I don't want to tell him but I'm like yeah you probably it's coming yeah it's coming yeah man you're also an author yeah you wrote a book we got uh I like to uh play alone please yeah let's head about well it's a collection of like stories and essays and my first my oldest um he was doing a lot of like two sent two word things when he was like a little kid you know and kind of like mixing around certain words it's like waiting for him to say his first full sentence and then you know I mean like he'd be like I do I know I'm like oh he's he's not like we were waiting for like that first full sentence when he's like I don't remember man like 18 months or two or something like that and the one day I got home and I sat down next to him like in the playroom and he just looked up at me he goes I'd like to play alone please and I was like okay so I was like that was really exciting that you said a full sentence and also he was like get the fuck out of here um so but the the book is just like a whole collection of us stories um you know some of them from my my days on as a comic some of them from before then but like all all types of different stories yeah what did you do before that before before comedy before comedy well when I graduated college my actual first first thing I did is I went to Boston and I um my friend was doing real estate and he was like he's like this is a crazy easy way to make a lot of money which for like a fresh college grad I couldn't believe it the whole system was that if you Boston has 61 colleges and universities in the Boston metropolitan area which is crazy amount and all those people need housing and so the way it works is like you just if you're working a real estate office people just come in and they're like I need an apartment and then you show them an apartment I don't know shit about Boston I don't know and they're just like here's this one and then if they sign up for it they have to pay first last and another month equivalent to the real estate office and then as a agent you get half of that so it's like oh damn you know free money you just throw it was just like this thing I did it for a few months but it was one of those things where I was like even though it was like to me it was a ton of I mean I'm 21 and like they're just like here's $4,000 here's eight I was like holy shit I was also like oh I know I don't want to do this yeah it was like a real life lesson because I was like if it was just about the money I should stay here and just keep doing this because it's like crazy amount of money but I didn't want to do it so then I went to DC and I actually worked for America's most wanted that was like really yeah a show the show yeah so I always like out fucking hunting people or what I mean I was I would I was a researcher so like but they would I had interned there in college and then they offered me a gig and the job was like you had I had to read all these like stories about like fugitives and different crimes and then I would go in like the bullpen and pitch to like our story editor hey we should do I we should profile this guy and you give him like the whole story in the background and then they would discuss and then they would go like okay we're gonna do that story so then you'd be kind of like an associate producer on this particular person and I did that for my first day was September 10th 2001 oh fuck so yeah it was a Monday and and then yeah we kind of started doing some different shit after that and but after three months of like yeah I hope we get him too I was like I was like I don't want to do this anymore either so I moved the LA and my whole my whole desire in moving to LA had nothing to do with stand-up I really thought that comedy acting was like what I would do like you know I had like you know Will Ferrell and all these guys I was like I want to do that you know so I kind of went out there with like that objective and I I was going to the groundlings which is like a comedy improv school and troop like they train you and then they put on shows and when I was in that school you know just taking the classes I met other stand-ups who were like they were the ones who were like you should try stand-up they're like you I think you would like stand-up and I was like I don't even know what to do and these guys kind of took me around to watch them like hey watch them do I don't know how you even prepare for it and that got me started doing stand-up but I always still wanted to do the the comedy acting thing which is like why the show bad thoughts is like so fulfilling to me because I also remember that that was like my first dream like my dream was to do stories yeah you know I mean and so I still love stand-up stand-up has been amazing for me and I it is so fun but I always wanted to do that shit so in my in my head like making the show feels like oh this thing I wanted to do for 20 years you know I mean like it's very fulfilling that's real man dude so I'm I'm a lot younger obviously obviously yeah well I mean I know it's hard to tell you I'm like don't cry plus you paint your beard I get it keep going I could be like 40 you know man but dude like I remember the first time I heard about you yeah there was a video at a basketball that's the first time that was the first time that was like memorable for me yeah that's pretty memorable yeah you know I'm talking about can we talk about it yeah sure all right so I got I got the clip this is the OG clip let's watch this clip you'd never seen this Andy no oh wait you're not this the best part hasn't happened yet oh fuck oh fuck pretty bad what kind of injury was that too at the same time it was double-wimmy so my shoulder and arm no what happens like a lot of people don't know so we had been playing basketball for a while I mean how the fuck do you even do that man it's pretty crazy actually yeah and so you do that on purpose absolutely not so what happened was this is the part that like because people only see this clip yeah so right before this Bert and I are having a dunk contest okay and so we start it was a rim that you can lower it so we were like who can dunk higher so I'm 247 right there by the way yeah you were thinking so we do it 7 and a half 8 8 and a half 9 I dunk on 9 he doesn't it's over like I already I won the comp like there's everyone's like yay and as we're like walking away to do our network and do something completely different one of them is like hey man I think you can go a little higher and I was like huh and they're like I think I think you got a little you got a little more room in you and I go I remember internally being like I don't know man that was like that felt like the kind of the limit you know I was like okay so they crank it up to 9-3 so that like the hoop is set at 9-3 I'm back here like there's a guy off camera he's like hey man dig deep and I go I got all right yeah and I remember internally just being like man I don't know if I have these extra three inches right and so when I'm right in there when I push off what you don't with the reason that's like my left patellar tendon snaps okay so the patellar tendon snaps and then instinctively like it's not a thought thing you're you know your body like I guess tries to protect your head this arm goes here I land on it shatter the arm so it would was left patellar tendon and left humorous like that I mean that's the the scar I don't know if you can see it from there and then I had major nerve damage so I had another surgery to take a nerve from here and put it in here so but that happened you know you see the video and you're just like what is this but like it was that we were doing all this shit the real reason that this likely is that I was like out of shape and like yeah I used to play basketball fucking 20 years before then and then we just show up one day and you're like oh let's like put the demands of like jumping as hard as you fucking can on this out of shape body and then your body just goes nah bro not too bad that that's how it feels though because like you you remember that you could do shit exactly and you think you could still do shit yeah and then you figure out very quickly that well there's a the term that I was told because you know I went to the hospital I had surgery then I went to recovery center all this PT like all this shit yeah the term that I had never heard they were like oh you're at the time when you're doing this you're a deconditioned athlete meaning like you are you're so out of shape that you're putting the demands of what you did on yourself when you're like oh I'm 18 this is what I used to do but their your body is like no we're not at all prepared for this and then your body just goes go fuck yourself yeah but man I saw myself on video this is probably about a year ago I was a this is so stupid but I had this fucking rotted tree in my yard and I was like trying to make a video of like me pushing it over yeah and fucking dude so like when I push it over I like ran three feet and I saw the video and I'm like holy fuck bro like you cannot move anymore yeah and then I showed it to my brother he's obviously I haven't heard the end of it but yeah dude I'm that you can't you can't comprehend that like I forgot it yeah no you don't I never had it bro well this is like you know the basketball dudes men in their 40s and basketball if they're not continuously playing especially like if they just go I'm gonna play I used to play ball I'm gonna play today it is the what leads to like the most like they go oh dude all we see are like ACL Achilles tears like all the time yeah because it's it's you don't basketball is so accessible to us like we all grow up playing that you don't realize like what kind of demands if you're not playing regularly what force you're putting on you know it's like so explosive like it's pivoting it's jumping as hard as you can and if you're doing that out of nowhere it's you know it's it can really obviously it's fun yeah yeah and look that looked painful yeah it's pretty man um let's talk you say why H why am H studios yeah so how long has it been rolling well I mean it's the flagship show for us is called your mom's house why am H and then we started producing other people's podcasts um god how many you got now I mean it's like fucking 15 no but it's probably like seven eight maybe something like that we're a lot we launched another one but yeah I mean it just became like you know we sort of slowly built the infrastructure to do it like you know obviously you start with like the physical space and then you have a team that can produce and like you know the the tech guys and the the social media started to branch out from there and then yeah it just became this thing and then we we we start our own ad sales company so like instead of having like an like an like an outside company we have an internal company so we we built an infrastructure to do all this and then it just kind of naturally became like this thing for TV film too so it started with that and then it started to branch out um yeah so is this in Austin it's in Austin yeah so so do people come into the building to record their shows yeah see a multiple studios we have multiple studios yeah it's fun it's fun and um yeah it's a it's a fun environment like it's you know it's a it's a lot of comedians are popping in and out and like staff is just fantastic there and um yeah it's like uh it's now it just feels like you know like the yeah the the norm but it was a slow for sure slow process yeah that's cool man we thought about we were thinking about doing something similar up here but then we figured out that uh nobody wants to come here at all yeah where to your office. It's a flyover statement that's what a lot of people call it yeah flyover statement yeah I mean I can't food and good people here man you know I know it's it is I mean look it's way easy it was way easier to book people in LA yeah you know it's like people it's just easy to be like drive down here but yeah we tried to like you know you monitor we monitor schedules like who's coming into the play the venues and all that stuff and sometimes if it works out it works out some people do fly in for it you know which is it's nice I think they sometimes have other business in the city which helps right if they're coming in for for another event for yeah awesome's a hub right now yeah it's been it makes it a lot easier it's big it's come really popular sweet man I love it down there dude I think Austin's cool as fuck yeah it is a good time man it's a good time like walking around like the people you know they're a little weird yeah they're they're a little left but like they're not fucking California left no it's like it's a blue city in a red state but the thing is you're still in Texas dude yeah like you know I mean like and the truth is I feel like it's actually pretty mixed yeah like when you're in the city even if you're like oh this is a pretty you know liberal place or whatever it's it's just moderately yeah they're cool they're not fucking ass yeah yeah it wasn't like this pushy shit it was cool because we stayed we went down there a few few weeks ago month ago a couple months ago what was that a couple years ago decade ago yeah yeah I think I remember like 1940 or something 1940 yeah but we stay right around the corner from the mother ship yeah and down there and I was a sweet area like even at night I think it was like on Thursday night my fucker was past shit was jumping down there sick street is it packed like that all the time sick street is like that's where the club is yeah that area is a is a I mean yeah it's a party area it's bars and clubs and yeah it's always popular man well sweet let's get it I want to I want to do some reaction clips with you guys so I got some viral clips that are happening right now okay and we're gonna do what we just talk shit on a little bit yeah it's fine um it's fine I think but no it's definitely we do it's different for sure for sure so I got I got three clips are for you to to react to this first one

I'm not gonna like he scares the shit out of me yeah he's there's different humans out there yeah and that is uh that guy was probably built to do exactly this to to laugh like he's got three fucking brain cells firing and and just mall people yeah he looks part fucking animal yeah how good of a fighter is he he's amateur but I think he's on defeated right now under he's on he's amateur fighters moving up but uh he's I think he's at like 320 some thousand on on IG right now I mean he's growing for seven coming huh he's up and coming yeah he's a scary dude dude that's the kind of dude where you're like oh shit he's kind of guy I shoot him I'm not fighting you actually create a marketing play bro like like if I was like a dog food company you know I'm saying like it's positive smell of fucker like dude this dude is straight up on our shit yeah yeah he's saying you want to be an animal yeah fucking eat this shit you know like there's a play there yeah good good there's a dog man yeah that's right yeah yeah yeah fucking first human athlete for dude I feel like he like he looks like a character in the bible like a he looks like a movie character like the guy that's in for sure kind of like you should be in here you're in Munich for whatever reason and like you just turn the corner and he's like oh shit yeah you all you all black yeah yeah now you better have a gun with that yeah it is uh fuck yeah I don't even know if that'll work yeah it might not yeah he's like silver bullets bro like yeah that's some different that's a different yes right that's a different kind of dude right there oh come here look at his traps good guy all right next one um let's go to New Orleans you have been in New Orleans many times yeah I like New Orleans bro New Orleans is sick um they got a new story down in New Orleans they had 10 inmates escape a jail hell yeah through a cell wall where the toilet was I saw this you saw this oh yeah man yeah so it was a rectangular hole uh in the cell it was big enough to squeeze through and then they actually wrote on top of the walls right above it saying too easy lol suck my dick they wrote too yeah so let's check this clip this is from like the news conference and they're showing them all all leaving out in sure let's check this out bro what the fuck are we watching here oh they're pulling the door trying to escape you have the broken fucking doors I'm just pumping the door because I'm trying to get into that sale that's the sale that they broke out of oh damn where you see them exiting the loading that door as you know if you notice they are carrying and blanking it with them bro this road that they're going out of is behind this building as I explained they subsequently go through another door hop the highway here at some point you will see them come through here and they scale the fence through this door that uh that's near the construction site yeah you steal that fence and then they get out of your escape crossing all the way to my gym wait to stay on top of shit guys the cool thing about this story is that they escaped uh around 12 30 and the sheriff's office there found out at 8 30 at the hall fuck and then they notified the public after 10 30 so it's just a cool little 10 and a half hour head start for these guys well they caught like two of them so two or three yeah but that means there's like seven moves out there still and I'm surprised they had to escape right I thought they just let these motherfuckers out now I mean they uh some of them are are in for murder now we have to shoot some wild dogs out there right now I say they get they get Frederick down there to go go check go catch you know yeah now that is it that's crazy bro that's wild they just moved the toilet and just didn't open to wall and we're able to escape and then scale while unlike nobody sees that that's really nuts to me at a jail that's our taxpayer dollar spell yeah that is I feel like a common song should have been playing right there yeah I'm saying freedom bro it's like the Shaw Shankleyemption that's what it was that's what it was um last one let's go to some sports but not maybe put this in so apologies

an accomplishment bro did you guys see that baseball clip where the two plays happen at the uh the two exact same plays happen the same inning like like decades apart would know fucking one inning after another it was uh it was yeah it was the same fucking play the dude you have to look it up man it's it's fucking crazy this is like a glitch in the matrix yes 100% it's unbelievable we have to find it throw it in there because I get it's like holy shit but anyway like this they they the dude hits a ground ball at the third basement it goes office hit the shortstop catch it throws them out at first same count same inning like everything's the same matter no no but it's one team does it and then the next in the oh wow like in the same inning yeah yeah dude it's like you can overlay the clips I don't know yeah dude I'm I don't know either man yeah that's that's that's the freaky stuff that does make you go like what is happening here I got you got it mm-hmm bro it's admit it for real like there's shit that's happening and it seems to be happening more and more it's like fuck like are we really in the matrix we know the aliens are coming dude they're telling us dude did you know did you know that fucking the lit did you know that the lady who wrote the you probably know this but like that I didn't know this to recently but the lady who wrote the matrix also wrote terminator oh I heard about that yeah and she said that like that like it's supposed to be like a fucking sequel or whatever yeah John Connor is supposed to be Jesus Christ to save the world from the blood official intelligence and bro they interview is fascinating I can't think of her name you got that clip though I got the clip yeah it is same Christophe check this out same inning that's the same game yeah same inning same pitch speed same fucking count same number of outs and the inning same play yeah it's it's weird that's not like a if you guys aren't watching this it's not like it's a regular ground ball like yeah then play one more time dude watch watch the position of the players yeah that's that's freaky that's crazy yeah one of the odds that the way it's especially because of where it went and then the bounce yeah the shortstop on both and dude that was one that's the top of the inning the bottom of the inning same pitch B same count same exact play like dude yeah I wonder if everyone in that stadium was like what was going on I don't know man like dude more and more shits happen when I'm like fuck man you follow all because my wife is obsessed with all the alien shit dude I don't cover we cover we yeah we cover it pretty regularly but like I don't I'm not like super super super super yeah because she follows like all the congressional like because the hearings and shit well just that I don't know the one thing like real aliens are the government you know I'm saying like it's one of the things it's really crazy is like you we used to have this thing where you'd be like what if you know and then you have these whistleblowers that were like you know working in top secret places in the government they came out and they go like here's all this shit and then they need like security because they're scared they're gonna get killed and they basically go you know we we do have you know whatever uap's and we have uh alien bodies basically we've had them for years and then you're like why how come nobody is reacting like it's so weird that everyone's like like they confirm it they're like we do have this and everyone's like yeah anyway and you're like right wait this isn't freak people out anymore right I always felt like it was strange that you would have somebody confirm this stuff and we've had these and so has China has one and like you know different governments have these bodies and and has this technology like reverse engineering technology and then everyone's like yeah okay dude it was weird how they did that they did that shit during covid yes like you know all the shit was covid was going on and they fucking run in the death count and all this shit and then they're like oh by the way aliens are real aliens are real and no one say anything but nobody cares yeah that was weird because communicated with you for our lifetime that's been the big debate yeah our alien is real or are they not of course and it's just like yeah you know uh it came out and then people are more worried about their fucking TikTok dances demon they don't even mention it well yeah even it actually even makes it feel more like deliberate and calculated that they would kind of like slow play it during a time of unrest and and and have it just kind of like you know here you go and then everybody's just like yeah and then you have people going wait don't you want to yeah make this a bigger deal yeah see I don't know if it's like a real thing or if it's fucking like the government you know I'm saying well like being conditioning shit man I don't know it seems like there was a lot of people that didn't want like these these the whistleblowers were terrified yeah you know so I don't think that like it doesn't feel like the government was trying to say like go ahead and do that you know but the funny thing is that these guys were terrified to to say what they said and then basically people were like I don't care yeah anyways it's like it doesn't show about my habit dick or not like yeah yeah bro it's crazy no shit dude that's weird it is weird man um Tom can we do another game I got another game for him what's the
