today yeah we will I got some for you too oh really mm-hmm because I know you like you like ducks I do big fan of ducks I you know what the more I'm around ducks ducks the more I only want to be around ducks mm-hmm they're pretty awesome they're really cute yeah and they they have like personality people don't realize that yeah like what Dali now she like crawls onto my lap mm-hmm it takes a while for them to get like even if you raise them they still have like hesitation so we've had them for like a year now and they're starting to get super friendly yeah well they also have orgies we talk about that yeah they do they do they fuck a lot and you know I found this clip it's funny because you know that's what ducks do you know ducks they they reproduce they have intercourse a lot like a lot and there's a there's a lady who who saw this happening and didn't like it let's check this clip out hey get off of her hey stop it what do you think your more ducks get made what is she doing trying to save the ducks man by my my baby the ducks get make more duck you know dude doesn't surprise me look at that that's just like there they're ducking daisy right so dude that's uh yeah shocking not really that was in California it was a white older lady no bra who's doesn't like the way the ducks are reproducing everything was free because they are a little rapier it gets a little violent yeah but in the in the duck world that's how they do it you know what I'm saying like I mean that's how I do it so dude so so dude so fucking so the one thing that you know maybe she doesn't understand about ducks is that ducks like to do it in the water and the male duck like we'll swim around and go into water and like show off all his little like skills yeah swim the capabilities yeah to like show off to the female duck and then he'll you know he'll bang her right there in the water and then when he's like on top of her you know her head kind of goes underneath the water and shit but like that's what they do yeah so I could understand her seeing it for the first time yeah you're it's a little scary because you're like dude he's got to drown him and by the way some of those ducks do drown but these are wild ducks dude and like I'm pretty sure even if you stopped him he's just gonna go right back back at it that's no stop yeah he doesn't understand so what the fuck is this lady doing why the fuck is everybody standing around we'll get some fucking emergency and then the dude the best slide is the guy goes how did how does she think the other ducks get made get off the bird oh man first of all he's just assumed how you know it wasn't too male ducks yeah that's right yeah I'm saying yeah yeah lady back on you all right yeah I just thought that was interesting it is violent to see I mean it's scary for the first time but that's that's life yeah that's the natural cycle yeah I mean that is how ducks reproduce though and ducks are pretty good at reproducing that's what I'm saying so she's just time of ducks in that pond yeah so you know it's probably yeah she looks insane there was no consoling her either she was hopped in the pool that's some that's a fucking Karen bro that's like what we deal with in the real world that's the people yeah that's the people fucking up everything real talk and the ducks just trying to you know line is ducks up yeah sit man trying to get his little corkscrew in there oh that is okay that that creep me out the first time I saw I didn't know they had it's like pigs because pigs have those two I don't know but the corkscrew they got it I've seen it it's wild yeah it looks like a little fucking like a cartoon fuck yeah it's weird looking yeah yeah so anyway and surprisingly um Sam's is bigger than duck you know Sam being being you know the white duck yeah versus your your you know your the color duck the color duck yeah Sam is bigger I'm like that now that's not that's not that's not really that stereotype is untrue in the in the duck world you're saying that in the plots of the ducks I because it applies everywhere else I don't know let's get into the cruise bay remember if you want to see I mean I didn't you're the dick expert in the head expert yeah yeah yeah guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy forsella.com you guys can check them all out there I'm gonna come join us on YouTube and follow along that being said hell number one let's get into it uh I guess he didn't do it oh yeah haha be daddy daddy out he's off yeah man kind of kind of sort of kind of sort of yeah there's some stuff here okay let's dive into the shine diddy combs verdict uh mogul acquitted on sex trafficking charges convicted on prostitution counts in bombshell new york city trial so hip hop icon shine combs uh was stunningly acquitted Wednesday on federal charges of forcing his former lovers to live out his degrading sexual fantasies but found guilty of lesser prostitution raps uh combs better known by a stage name diddy dodged charges that carried a possible life sentence after a two month trial that revealed twisted details about the mogul including his preference for freak offs uh watching his girlfriends have grueling drug-fueled sex rumps with the male S courts now I've seen some wild shit okay but you should have seen what was happening outside their courthouse when this got announced he had some fans I guess they're supporting uh and this is what it looked like outside let's check this clip this is a male he's rubbing baby or a little bit out of the shirt I'm so sorry bro it's crazy what what social media has done to people like legit it but like every single person there had a camera pointing at the face like acting like a fucking weirdo you know I'm saying it's it's just so weird yeah it is it is super weird now the different subject but yeah nah I get it but there was so there was five total charges um against diddy uh the racketeering conspiracy he was found out guilty sex trafficking by force fraud a coercion he was found not guilty sex trafficking by force fraud a coercion yet two two of those counts not guilty but he did get found guilty on transportation for purposes of prostitution um and he had two counts of those now again acquitted on everything else the the more heavier life sentences um he was all acquitted on now the two uh transportation for purposes of prostitution charges um there is a maximum prison sentence of 10 years on that he's still waiting to be sentenced for that um trying to see if he's gonna get put out on bond um you know while the while awaiting the sentences charges on those but yeah man it's like this chick is out there with the shirt saying a freako is not a rico um you know and like I mean dude like I don't know like there was a lot of evidence in favor here I've been trying to re-through apparently the prosecution kind of dropped the ball on some of the shit you know because that's really what it comes down to right you gotta have a good prosecutor um but the defense attorney in this case this is like his second rico case he's beaten this year we pretty damn good you know defense attorney um but yeah I mean the proof the the oils in the bottle you know as they say oh man you work on that one like all night or what that was friends that was yeah listen that was off the cuff off the cuff it was a risk okay about 50 50 yeah yeah we're like 95 fuck it five all right look dude uh okay what you got it you know I've also been looking into this case uh and as funny as it is and it's like fun as it is to make the jokes about the baby oil there is a lot of real shit here including some shit that is gonna be unpopular for me to say I'm gonna say it anyway uh first of all you know there's videos of this dude dragging chicks down the hallway like doing some pretty fucked up crazy ass shit oh yeah okay oh yeah yeah that's unacceptable there's real victims yes yeah there are real victims here but I also feel like that part of the real victims is also diddy and here's why those prostitution charges that he's getting hung up on are charges where he flew in and I'm holding up air quotes flew in quote unquote models to hang out with him okay those people were not forced to get on that plane they were not there was no coercion they flew out to hang out with diddy and fuck diddy okay and he's even money for it well maybe maybe he did some cases let's listen dude listen a lot of these women and not all but a lot of these women they when you see them over in Europe and fucking all these places doing all this shit and there's no dudes around that means there's a dude around right but he's just not in the fucking picture right and what happens is is that these women and look I am not judging I'm just saying what happens okay these women find wealthy men to go on trips with and vacation with and I don't think it's very unreasonable to assume that on most of these trips there's sex involved yeah all right that's implied even if it's not spoken about yeah it's not directly but it's implied hey you want to go to Europe hang out on the yacht go to Monaco F1 by the way we're fucking right like that's that's the implication of correct and everybody fucking knows that okay that everybody knows that unless you're living under a fucking rock okay I'm not judging I don't this is not me saying this but what I will judge is that when these women voluntarily get on that plane and go on these trips or go to see diddy or go to see any other celebrity and these things happen consensually they go home and they brag about it they're like hey I was in fucking France with fucking diddy on his yacht and then all the sudden they get older and they stop getting invites and they call diddy and he doesn't return their text okay and then they get bitter that's a problem then all the sudden I was human traffic I was raped I was this I was that that is not okay all right there is responsibility that should be taken by these people and to give them the power to prosecute someone that they can send it to hang out with is insane yeah because it gives it really gives any woman ammunition to attack a man later in life because they're not happy with how things turned out yeah and that's not okay either and the laws and people get really pissed off when you say this but this is true diddy from fucking now until the end of time will be known as some sort of rapist yeah which were best guys never he's somewhere it's actually for sure dude hit the point is you don't have to be guilty of it to be labeled that and have it ruined your life and that is where the law is fucked up okay you can accuse a man of sexual assault of rape and if you get enough press behind it or enough social media behind it it's true and then they become nuclear and nobody wants to fucking you know even touch him it ruins lives it ruins careers and in a lot of cases these are just women who are clout chasing who are chasing rich men which by the way most of these dudes got rich so they could do that shit so you have two consenting party consenting parties and then all of a sudden you know you're you're a rapist or you're a fucking human trafficker that's not okay so you know I know that's probably the opposite of what everybody's saying here but this happens every fucking day okay and how is it okay for a woman let's say now who has their own you know exotic photograph video uh porn website or whatever sells or subscription to see these things and then also by the way does bookings as a model how is you know what bookings mean bookings mean come on my fucking y'all look me for your plane trip and guess what we'll do we'll do we'll do stuff you know like that's what the fucking means and uh you know I just don't think that's that's I think that's very fuck I think the system is very fucking wrong in that way yeah I would also say too I think society like we have you know there's there's a societal standard that we have to address here too right like because like from society like like that's what's this whole world you know like you should say you know sex sales like the whole world of driven you know that that's kind of driven society towards this way of just like you know that's the way like that's okay that's freedom oh that's a strong woman who decides to do that or you know I'm saying even the whole pornography thing like I mean well yeah bro look it all has to be a rebellion no look dude the one hand you're making a great point on one hand you know she could do whatever she wants you know sex workers have rights yeah right empower these women that's she's taking care of herself she's getting her bag she's doing her thing okay fine fuck I don't give a shit but here's where I do give a shit you don't get to later in life when you're not getting the same bag and not getting the same attention and not getting you know all of this shit and then you get to accuse the dude of being some sort of fucking you know rapist or trafficker or that's bullshit okay so yeah bro it is another example of you know it's a culture by the way I don't care prostitution's been a fucking thing for 12,000 motherfucking years I'm not judging I don't give a shit but let's be real about what the fuck it is okay you sold your shit or implied that you were going to do certain things to receive certain things and then you don't get to later in life go oh by the way I was unwilling and I was raped and I was this when you come home and you post all the pictures on your fucking Instagram I'm out here on this yacht I'm doing this I'm doing that fucking cool man but you're not a fucking victim yeah right you know like that's bullshit I don't know any better yeah shut the fuck up you're fucking 30 years old you knew something yeah you knew something yeah dude and that's a whole another thing like I was only 25 well 25 here in adult you know I was only 30 I didn't know better well there's a lot of shit at 30 I didn't know but that doesn't make me a fucking victim yeah that makes me inexperienced and that doesn't make anybody else that I hung out with deserving of to go to prison right right so you know that's that's the double standard that we live in and it is it is a product of feminism and and toxic feminism you know uh personally you know I you know everybody's like oh Andy's a fucking far right we know I'm actually not I really don't give a fuck I don't care that's not my life dude I don't care I don't care what you do but you don't get the you don't get to say lies because all the sudden now you're not getting the same opportunities you know lots yeah bro it's a it's a fucked up it's a fucked up situation and by the way that doesn't mean that did he didn't do some of those things but there's a little of both here you know clearly the guy he's interested yeah some it's got some issues yeah but dude so so you're telling me that did he had the power to make 30 40 people have sex for 36 hours straight so he fucking forced them you see what I'm saying bro those people were there willingly they were participating though well I think one piece to like like I think it because and the only reason that it fucking that people are saying oh you know like all these women and dudes that came out to the only reason that those fuckers came out is because they were afraid that their name was gonna get dropped in it and so they proactively jumped out I was like oh fucking did he fucking raped me or he did this right you know and so like and that's for the piece I was gonna say too because I mean I know there was some drug usage involved to you took the drugs you know but I think that's a whole another thing but like but that none of the charges was that you know that's a whole but that's a whole another thing we see this all the time we see women go out and get fucking hammered they go out to the bars they get fucking wasted they they're around celebrities they have sex then they turn around and say he did this and this and this note you got fucking hammered and you had drunk sex with another dude you know that was also fucking drinking the same amount that you drink who's it fault there you're right you you know saying like dude the laws do not the the laws in this case it's not even a law it's the social implications of just accusing people of this sort of conduct that can ruin their lives and that's not okay you know and while you know we can laugh at Diddy and we can make fun of all the shit and this and that at the end of the day bro his life is probably pretty fucked up and a lot of people don't care they're like fuck them I don't give a shit he's a piece of shit what if that was you what if you had worked your whole life what if you had done all these things and and accumulated all this business then all the sudden all these people that you were party and with and hanging out with in this lifestyle that everybody loved and everybody fucking benefited from are now telling you that you're the fucking problem you see what I'm saying like it's like I mean that's the piece you like I would be curious to see where it goes from here to because I I am still of of the belief bro that this was like an Epstein situation in some some degree right where like those parties that I mean dude everything was videotaped at the same fucking markers you know I'm saying I'm like hey and then how people react it when it came out all the people that didn't support him and all the people they got just real quiet you know I'm saying the JLo it's hard it's hard it's hard to say that it doesn't look like that that's what I'm saying yeah that's all I'm that's all I'm saying yeah and that's but but we haven't that hasn't proven and you know maybe that's why these other cases got to dismissed because they didn't want it to be exposed yeah but that's total speculation right right right you know like 100% so who fucking knows yeah I don't know I wasn't there but to the things that they're telling us I still have issue with it because when everybody agrees that this is the arrangement and then people fucking do it like that's fucked up that's fucked up you know so yeah and then the more the more successful and the more famous you are the more vulnerable you are to it so yeah man yeah let's say I know there was some weird uh almost sapien shit going on there too but yeah but just because he's gay doesn't mean it oh you yes fine I mean that's fine I mean oh it's still like you oh you work on that all I didn't I did but speaking of gay dudes I thought this was interesting uh do you see the trans swimmer I did Thomas got a got a titty strip I'm his title strip golf clap you see what I did there got his tittle strip this titty strip I'm a title strip yeah hey man uh no dicks in the pool bro no honestly I don't I don't agree with this though and here's why leot Thomas worked her balls off to get those titles that was much better and now that's just gone you know what dude this is a fucking good thing that's a great thing yeah it's a great thing it should have happened years ago actually does this mean that uh Riley is a national champion I think they're they're rewriting the history as we speak Riley comment on this um because she was the one that had to compete against this fucking dude she said quote it is my hope that today demonstrates educational institutions that they will no longer be allowed to trample upon women civil rights and renews hope in every female athlete that their country's highest leadership will not relent until they have the dignity safety and fairness they deserve yeah so I believe I believe the title is gonna go back to her another fucker this would have never happened if people would have spoke up in the beginning you know what I'm saying like yeah now all of a sudden because a few voices spoke up everybody's like yeah no fuck yeah dude what do you mean yeah no shit right where were you saying no bro listen people highly underestimate their own voice it does not take that much for people to speak up and change things if we all just speak the fuck up if we're all speaking up we own the narrative okay and that goes especially for you motherfuckers list of this show like dude fuck this crazy ass shit I love how they wrote this article though you see uh transgender this is New York Post trans swimming champion Leah Thomas will be stripped of University of Pennsylvania swimming titles after the elite Ivy League school bowed to pressure from the Trump administration like I I you write it like they wrote it like it was like that was the right thing to do he should have never had it to begin with what are we talking about then about a fucking press listen these people that run these offices are far left people and they live in echo chambers they don't realize that 90 fucking percent of people aren't they're not with all this shit yeah they live with their own little group who all say this crazy shit they're all about it and they think that like they they think because in their circles that they will get canceled from their own circle per saying anything other that they're somehow gonna get flack for that no that should be the law it should be the law and I think Trump's working to make it the law it is no that's the thing it is the law yeah it's always been the law it's always been wrote to put a grown man or even a boy in we already saw this what about the girl uh that high school um california no in loud and county oh yeah that got raped by a male athlete who was pretend or a male student who wore a skirt that they allowed to use the women's bathroom then he transferred did the again and did it again what about those girls what sort of compensation are they going to receive because if we're gonna give a hundred billion dollars to fucking Ukraine or israel uh some of it should go to these poor girls that are gonna be you know traumatized for real because of what grown adults allowed to happen and by the way I believe her dad got in some serious legal trouble for sticking up for for the gas meeting brother arrested this bullshit yeah and dude you know what it comes from it should have never happened it comes from our cowardice as a whole in society what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong and if you think about it any other way you're uh coward that's the truth and the reason that we are in this situation with all this far left communist crazy shit like men in the pool with women and men in the locker room and grown men reading uh drug you know in drag the little children in a shit that's all because the people who knew better chose to stay quiet when the when it first started happening and that's what's allowed this to happen and if we don't want crazy shit to happen then you shouldn't be shamed in a silence in the beginning you should stand up and say no that is not okay and by the way I can't really believe that there is a human being that exists in this country or anywhere that believes that a man with a penis can become a woman by cutting it off that a man with a penis can be the champion of a women's sport that a man with a penis can be allowed to go into a locker room with other naked women like this is insane shit so why have people allowed it to begin with because the more that we allow this kind of shit to happen the more this kind of shit will continue to progress further and further and further into crazy world and and dude like this comes from cowardice you don't want to get yelled at you don't want to get told that you're a boomer you don't want to get told that you're a right wing Nazi conspiracy nut job at Thanksgiving by your crazy fucking cousin with purple fucking hair and 15 nails in her mother fucking face like bro I want a peaceful Thanksgiving yes okay exactly that's what it's just letter B just no totally shut the fuck up like it's probably why I don't go to fucking Thanksgiving but whatever dude like it's crazy yeah listen I don't bend I don't bend bro for my shit like I don't know I don't know why people have such a hard time with it it's really easy super easy it's really easy like no I'm not wearing a fucking mask yeah show me the evidence where it actually works then I'll do it oh we don't have an evidence then guess what I'm gonna breathe the fucking air like it's no he can't get in the fucking pool yeah what dude what do you guys do like dude what are you doing allowing this dude in the fucking pool with all these girls what are you doing allowing this dude in a locker room with all these girls that is it's disgusting it's disgusting that it's ever been allowed and like you know oh and fucking drag queens deserved to read books to why why are they interested in reading books to children I thought you know when I grew up drag queens were at the fucking gay bar and by the way that's cool it was fine it was no big deal why all of a sudden has these people decided they're going to read books to little kids why when we have pride month quote unquote are there all these naked pride parades and it's just like a bunch of dudes with their dicks out why is it always dudes right here what kids there here's what I tell you because that movement has been infiltrated by fucking sexual predator pedophiles and you guys are not telling the truth about what is actually going on in your own community so that you know like the gay community is like man we're getting a lot of flack well you know you got to regulate your own community man we're losing all these sponsorships yeah well don't let pedophiles run around their dicks out in front of little kids and maybe the people will sponsor it yeah so I don't know what to tell you man like it's not acceptable behavior in any civilized society and I'm glad it's I'm glad that people are starting to wake up but there's a lesson to be learned here which is if you want shit to change you need to speak to fuck up by the way if you want these criminal tyrants arrested guess what if you start calling for their arrest maybe they will get arrested etc etc etc so man guys jump in on this conversation let's go down to the comments what you guys think that being said let's go through some of these yeah yeah yeah let's do it you're ready for this yeah you sure I think so all right all the diamonds these comments we got we got a bunch here today um blend schmaisel 93 44 Andy is that communist water on the desk which one is it communist tears oh we got a new one shit all right well on and I had no we had a new one with the taste like I'm gonna try it out right here salty good for hydration yeah I think I just got I think I just got poor how how many how many how many communist tears has it take to fill up that bottle like how many was that one person screen I don't know man I mean to cry a lot I forgot the ratio there yeah yeah yeah good catch there Glenn yeah yeah I didn't even know I didn't even notice we got a next another another comment little historical little historical context here from J. Riv 98 83 if you don't drink grape farm energy new in black Joe Biden he said Joe Biden said it yeah I mean allegedly we know how that works yeah well I mean if Joe Biden said it's certainly correct oh it's got a JPA S8M tax the billionaires more not income tax stricter capital gain tax give the means of production to the people here we got some we put having some some some some some communist in the comments the billionaires more yeah tax the more not income tax stricter capital gain tax so so when some so what you're saying is so when some let's just say me for example so I started my business in 1999 with $12,000 I slept in the back of the store for three fucking years I didn't I made $58,000 $58,380 the first 10 years of business combined I lived most of my life in the position of losing everything within a couple weeks sometimes a day so what you're saying is as if I choose to sell part of that or do a transaction or whatever that I deserve to give more to you who has done none of that work the entire time in fact you never even sent me a card you never thanked me you never you know what what where were you this entire time see the entitlement in this country has gotten way the fuck out of control all right just because you made decisions and I made different decisions does not earn you the right to have any of the shit that I have now I choose to give a tremendous amount of money to different charitable causes and to do good things with that money but I shouldn't be forced to do that we live in a capitalist country that is the basis and that is the best system every system that's ever created the most amount of success and prosperity has been privately owned capitalist systems it is not communism it is not socialism you deserve nothing because you did nothing and I was talking about this with one of my friends yesterday it used to be when I grew up I was told and taught if you don't fucking work hard bro you don't have a chance you don't even have a chance you don't have a chance you have to work hard or you're not going to have shit that's what I was told my whole life all right and I'm very thankful for that lesson however we have now shifted that talk track and people don't teach their kids that anymore and I bet this person was brought up probably taught very little about hard work and probably had people saying things like this in their household fuck that guy the only way you can get that far ahead is by fucking everybody over but see that's untrue as well and I'm going to explain why and today's economy the only way to truly get ahead is by providing real value in a real way because for basically 75 years we had three forms of advertising we had print we had television and we had radio and if you could get to a point where you could advertise on one of those three mediums you could scale your company to a large company now when you became a large company you start to look for things like cutting profit or you know maybe even being unethical about what you do screwing people over in common day language but because there was no internet people would take a long time to figure this out you may not see another customer of that business in 1970 or 1980 or 1990 that got screwed over by that company until you see him at Christmas or Thanksgiving or just randomly okay and even then now there's only two of you so it's not like everybody can figure out the fucking scam so for a long time there was a lot of fucking scammers there was a lot of taking advantage there was a lot of you know not delivering real value but then something happened the internet was invented and then something else happens social media was invented and now for the last 15 20 years social media has allowed people to have instant feedback and has allowed them to communicate with everybody they've ever met their second grade friend to somebody they met at the coffee shop an hour ago and then with a one click of the button they can tell the entire world that I got screwed over by this company or this person or this or that which means that if you that is your business strategy to screw people over you cannot succeed because the market will reject you the feedback is too fast so in today's day and age to become a billionaire in most cases you have to deliver enough real value that is legitimate that enough people are willing to pay for that in order for that worth to happen to the company or the individual so you have to solve a real problem you have to do it in a way that people are willing to trade their money for and you have to do it in a way that they don't feel like they got a bad deal otherwise they will tell everybody all the time and you won't be in business so to have the fundamental thought that people that become billionaires are scamming everyone is an archaic thought is very old it's not real anymore in fact many of the most financially successful people are just very very fucking good at delivering value so you know when you say tax billionaires more maybe he's talking about the ones at the top like the mega billionaires are over a hundred billion dollars maybe because those people usually have teams of people that they're not usually all of them have teams of people that form intricate you know tax strategies that basically prevent them from paying tax that's that's not right I agree with that okay but if you're talking about just the regular you know billionaire guys just so you know not all the billionaires are listed on Forbes okay there's way more billionaires than are actually listed publicly in Forbes most billionaires don't submit their information to Forbes because they don't want people to fucking know all right and people are under the assumption that if you're not on the Forbes list then it's not true no do you not fucking see all the private jets and all the fucking big houses and that these are there's plenty of billionaires more billionaires than not are exist outside the Forbes list or reporting okay because you have to submit voluntarily to those reporting so you're saying like to well basically to say that those people who have invented companies and spent their whole lives doing it and that you deserve part of that is it's fucking bullshit stupid okay and because here's what happens eventually people like this dude say tax them tax them tax them not understanding how fucking hard it is with the current tax code to even make it work all right and then what happens is these people who create all the products that you use and love and make your life the way that you want your life to be they say fuck it I gotta I got all the money I need don't fucking sell my shit fuck these people I'm not doing shit and they they they do what's called the Atlas shrug and they say and there's a little book about this called Atlas shrug but it's where the producers this is part of communist ideology it's where the producers say mmm fuck it it's not worth producing anymore and that is what this person is saying is not only unfair it is it will hurt the working class more than anything they'll say well what about the fucking you know they're so greedy well if they are that greedy you know what they're gonna do they're gonna scale their company you know what scaling their company takes more mother fucking jobs okay so your ignorance to how things really work shows through this comment and maybe you should shut the fuck up like real talk because I look at this comment and I think you're fucking retarded so good job JP I mean I'm just saying it doesn't you don't understand the way things work and you don't understand what you're even saying because if they did what you want them to do it would fucking fail like it's failed every other mother fucking time I cannot stand when people just make these blanket comments when they've never like where do you where you go build some shit for 25 that's right you don't know what to tell me how much you're willing to give away you know and the words of of of fucking president Trump you don't know what the fuck you're doing okay and the words of me you don't know what the fuck you're talking about you shut the fuck up that's that's what I think yeah okay like you people like you make the world dumber lost some brain cells I'm just saying like it's the truth yeah it's the truth give the means of production of the people they don't give it to the people they promise you that and then they fucking the state does it and then you're fucked for the people on the state okay let's have this conversation when we're all in the bread lines together yeah fucking idiot bro that pisses me off so much because like dude that person you have no fucking comprehension what it takes to build fucking anything it is fucking everything bro it takes everything it's taken every single fucking ounce of my entire life I've been on two vacations in the last 13 years I'm not one of these Instagram coaches selling how to coach other coaches so that they can coach like dude you have no idea what a fucking text and I know when you look on the internet and you see these dudes walking around saying it's easy and it's this and it's that those are not entrepreneurs they're not building shit those are fucking people who are trying to figure out how to get people like you to send them money so that it will be quick easy and fast for you when it's a total scam all right the shit is hard and dude I'm not gonna say I'm the smartest person in the world but I'm not an idiot either and I it takes everything I fucking got and by the way to not only does it take everything I got it takes everything these other smart motherfuckers have so like to sit here and say you're entitled to any of that while you sat on your fucking ass you're the problem in this fucking country bro we used to grow up being like man you could own a business like that guy you could start of this you could do that you could create this you could do this now we got a bunch of people to grow up and they're like I deserve some of that you know fucking deserve anything man and the fact that someone taught you that it you should hate them for teaching you that because they've instilled an ideology that will never ever ever produce fruit for you and your life you will completely lose your entire life thinking like that like it's just reality and it's not everybody else's fault you have the same opportunity dude where you out there when I was earning the money to start the fucking business and I was sweating my balls off pushing a 400 pound fucking paint striper across the pavement were you helping me move the fucking parking blocks like you weren't there for any of it so what

cruise cruise and we got headline number two let's go to DC let's give the people a chump update what's happening oh don't talk about those first course hey Paul you know we didn't follow you for cars yeah fucker or fucking hey you win some next CTO yeah man let's let's let's talk let's give the people the Trump update there there has been a lot happening with with mr uh Donald Trump thought going on a lot of wins got gas prices are down massively um across the country um there was a big I mean this was probably the biggest one there that was a lot here um let's dive into these some of the updates uh you had the supreme court as shut down all of these uh fucking activist judges uh five liberal courts of tide trumps hand before scotus clipped their power so aji bondi revealed five district courts issued 35 of 40 nationwide injunctions attempting to derail president trumps agenda um and nearly all the universal injunctions blocking president down trumps agenda were issued by just five of the nation's 94 federal district courts um and so the supreme supreme court came down and said yeah that's not happening no more um so you mean that local local judges that are supposed to enforce local laws um in their little areas with the federal court their federal judges yeah they're in their their little like so we have Missouri we have two courts yeah federal courts every have the eastern district and a western district but the problem was is you'd have like the western district judge who oversees the west side of Missouri so you're telling me that five people mm-hmm have been holding up the agenda of what Trump wants to do five five individual people five people five people have been making decisions for the betterment what they feel is is either the better basically five people have been calling the fucking place mm-hmm how the fuck is that okay well it's not and that's what the supreme court just came out they ruled in the six to three decision that district judges the lowest level jurist in the federal system cannot impose nationwide injunctions minding noted that out of the 40 nationwide injunctions issued since Trump took uh retook the White House 35 came out of five districts perceived as liberal uh active liberal judges have used these injunctions to block virtually all the president Trump's policy Bonnie said no longer no longer so nationwide injunctions or court orders that prevent the federal government from implementing a policy or law they have a cascading effect impacting the entire country not just the parties involved in the court case and have been used against the Trump administration that they vastly higher rate than previous administrations um so that was a big win um you also uh other one you anything else on that no i think it's one of the biggest i think this is the most under reported story that's happened in maybe a few years because of what it actually means yeah and what it actually means is that these communist judges who are allowing criminals off and and and flooding the streets with illegals and doing all this crazy shit this anti-American anti-citizen shit have no power to hold up the agenda of Donald Trump so now well it's a big deal but it's also i mean you got more Trump oh yeah we got some more wins for sure okay well i got a point that i want to make at the end of this yeah um he also uh Trump also recently um he signed uh he got a peace deal signed with uh Rwanda and the democratic republic of Congo uh to which the Rwanda foreign ministers said the Trump absolutely deserves a Nobel Peace Prize that pissed some people off um CBS remember he sued CBS in Paramount for editing that uh 60-minute episode with with with Kamala Kumpkween yeah they have to pay him $16 million they just settled with that um that was a big deal a lot of wins have been happening um but i guess the biggest piece going on right now is this big beautiful bill that everybody's talking about uh which uh they have been they they started voting in the senate on this back on monday i thought this was funny so there Trump has a website dedicated to this in trump fashion this is what you which you see when you pull up the website they have like a fucking dominoes pizza tracker at the top like this is trump fashion man you know what i'm saying um but it kind of lists out some of this uh some some of the things about this big beautiful bill um there's some tax cuts in there you know he has this other savings savings by state so you can kind of see what the average is going to be in your state um take on pay increases $6900 to 11,600 depending on um your job and your you know how much you take how much you make um and that's per year um but i tried to dive into this because there's there's a lot in this right there there's a lot in this uh it's like 877 some odd pages um so let's dive through some of the pieces here there are some Medicaid restrictions on the legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid which provides government-sponsored healthcare for low income and disabled Americans like the house pass bill the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks but the senate parliamentarian uh determined that they measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services isn't in compliance with senate rules um so again of this the left will try to scream and say this is like oh they're cutting Medicaid for millions of people that's not what's happening there's millions of people that are abusing our fucking system and it's cleaning up that there's plenty of people who can work are able to work who choose not to and we the people will have to pay for those fucking people it's not okay i'm not cool with that i'd rather my tax dollars be going to like if it's gonna go somewhere go to people who actually fucking need it and they could probably be receiving more help if it wasn't me a fucking stolen and abused by everybody else totally agree but that's not how these people think how they think they think like that dude who left that comment it uh you know there's so much to go around it fucking that's that should go to me they're not realizing that that money that funds the government comes from their fucking neighbor probably not their neighbor because uh their neighbor's probably just like them yeah right because my neighbors that's right so listen dude we can't live in a country where half the country or less works does they're supposed to do does all these things fucking you know has jobs holds them down provides for their family and then the other half doesn't do shit we can't have that okay and we're getting very close with the flood of illegals that have been put in our country intentionally to having more of the people who don't contribute unless the people that do okay and when that happens the people who do start to say well what the point of this and then communism comes in and everybody's fucked for those that were wondering the threshold is 50 50 right like once 50 percent that's that's what they're trying because it's produces versus non-producers that's what they've been trying to do and dude this idea that any of you who work and pay taxes and try hard and are ambitious and do what you're supposed to do should have to pay any tax for any of these other fucking people is bullshit and on top of that you should be standing up to that you have no moral obligation to sit there and be shamed by someone who makes you feel bad about their situation zero zero okay there is so many people in this country that do not even fucking try because the system has become so good at accommodating them which started under Obama all right we cannot have that no and the people who do produce and who do the right thing bro do not be shamed by these fucking these people they try to shame you they try to say you don't care about people they try to say this that no they don't care about you they don't care that you go to work every day and fucking work your ass off they don't care that you sacrifice time with your own family to make sure that they're fed and make sure that they're taken care of they don't care that you're under stress and by the way you wouldn't be under stress if you weren't required to pay for them sitting on the fucking ass that's true that's the piece that I don't get right because like we can have the conversation are there people that need help of course of course and I get bad times should happens you lose a job you follow I get it everybody gets it because it's happened to all of us that's life right and should there be some things again I'm not as liberal when it comes to that but sure you got me I'm down I'm I'm all down with helping my neighbor when he needs it totally agree I'm down with it totally great it's American I'm with it totally agree but I'm not with though is people who don't actually need it who get to just fucking riff off the system another one of the things in the bill is restrictions on food stamps same thing that's another place where but millions of dollars are being spent for people who don't actually fucking need it they don't need it they don't need it anytime you have a system there's going to be an element of people to figure out how to game the system yes and the system has been gameed so hard that it's it's putting the real American contributor the in a in a in a in a pinch making it hard for them to survive and you know there's other reasons too you know the government fucking waste our money and they steal it we could go on on but at the end of the day all of this happens because nobody speaks up nobody says this is bullshit like speak up dude who cares what they call you who cares they fucking call you whatever they call you who cares who cares who cares you know what you say when they say oh you're this and this and this and that you say yes I am yeah you're right wait on my badge come that's right I'm fucking a hundred percent that all right and that is on Sunday you want to watch you want to watch them get real confused say that's shit right right right well you're a bad person yeah the worst that's the worst see she probably go away there's also he's increasing some child tax credits dude listen they they don't have the moral high ground no they don't have the moral high ground they don't care about you do you understand that they do not care about you they do not care the struggle that you go through to provide and and to do that what you're supposed to do they do not care not only do they not care they want to take it and the way they take it because you have a good heart as they play on your heartstrings by saying you're a bad person for not wanting to do this fuck that 100 yeah 100 you got the child tax credit that's going up he's increasing that he's also limiting limits on overtime and tips deductions so the bill is going to allow individuals to deduct up to 25 thousand dollars for tips wages and 12,500 for overtime now these these provisions they all expire in 2028 but again it is a nice help in the short term I do have a problem because what there also is included in this big bit we listen again we're not I'm not a trump or I'm not a fucking diehard maggot we got to call the shots how they fucking lay right this pause on AI regulations bothers me yeah it's the dumbest listen this one thing will kill humanity hmm we're already seeing it bro did you see Amazon they are they are they're now investing um to have they're gonna have more fucking AI robots working than they will fucking actual employees they're putting like a million fucking robots in yeah of course they are you know and then Elon's built Elon's out there saying we're gonna have more robots than we are people yeah and none of you guys are saying shit all right Elon's against this bill by the way too well you should be because it's bad for the economy bro it spends trillions of dollars it's going to fuck everybody in the long run every bill should be one fucking page yeah period yeah all these omnipresent all this shit where they're all mixed together and you have to decide well is it better overall or is it worse overall is how we get into these situations because they put the selfish bad bills in with the good ones they say well the you know it's it's for the better good and it's not well no it's everybody trying to put their fucking pieces in from all the shit that they owe from getting them in office to begin with let's go back to the AI thing and hit this real quick because people got to understand this yes so they put a pause on AI regulations um that basically says for the next 10 years they cannot regulate AI um at the federal level at the federal level okay and the reason that this is a problem is because the progression of AI is so fast that within they are saying within five years that AI will be able to write its own code and humans will no longer have influence over AI and AI will be in every single tech infrastructure in the world which really sort of opens up an interesting opportunity because it means that the only way to escape AI is to go back to analog and shift off shut off all the shit which a lot of people want anyway so I don't know but I don't think that people have the courage to go back to a analog style life because I think there's a lot of people who just aren't equipped to live in that anymore and I'm not talking about hunting and fucking shooting your dinner and shit I'm talking about how it was in you know 1995 you know we're talking about regular world shit everybody everybody could everybody was fine dude and it would freak everybody out by the way the world was a lot better in most ways okay um anyways yeah like when you left work you were off work like when you left the the when you left at five o'clock you were free you weren't you weren't on your phone you you were spending time with your family you were hanging out with your friends these are things people crave again you know when when you you know like it wasn't you have to have the perspective of living pre internet to understand how much better it fucking was and that's not some like old man shit like you guys don't think about it because a lot of you weren't there but dude you didn't have to like be attached to your phone there was no fucking phone there was far less anxiety you know people weren't getting bullied there was no cancel culture because there was no way to do it so you could have your own thoughts and you could have your own opinions and the people that share those were your friends life was just way better bro in a gazillion different ways and people don't know that because the people who are you know people are aging out of being able to even and by the way they're getting sold they don't care anymore they're like fuck I guess this is just the way it is no this isn't the way it is because the reality is AI is literally making people dumber by the second you don't need people like by the way anybody who is half has half of a brain can recognize when y'all are writing your shit with fucking AI just so you know like there's ways to tell and I'm not gonna say how they are because I want us continue to be able to tell but some of y'all like I follow this dude who is a pretty wealthy guy and he always had these shitty fucking stupid ass captions and all of a sudden he's fucking writing these well put to get like and it's all AI and like it's just like dude you're fucking clown you know what I'm saying anyway the point of the matter is in five years the some of the people who invented AI say that AI will be able to code itself and lock humans out Elon already has robots made there's already robots made by many different companies this AI shit replicates at a at a speed so fucking fast that 10 years it would be like saying in regular terms we're not gonna regulate this for 500 years and that one thing and I dude it's gonna ruin it's gonna ruin humanity ruin it you have people who invented AI coming out saying how dangerous it is and what's everybody doing everybody's oh this is fucking cool remember when I said this like years ago I said how would they get people to they how would they get people to adopt AI and not care about they would do it through greed yep they would they would I said this on a show I said they would do it through greed they would present it to the entrepreneurs first they would say look how much more money you can make you don't have to have employees you could be that much more profitable and they get the support that way and by the way that's exactly what they've done I don't that was years ago people make some dog pictures that's right you know I'm saying that'll keep them entertained yeah and and dude that's how they do it man they they shock shock and all these people oh wow just y'all great this is and and you know 30 to 50% of the people don't have an internal dialogue they don't have an internal voice that says man this could be really bad you know and I I think I don't know I don't know how that could be a reasonable thought 10 years no regulation no I saw here they did they did they did they reached a compromise over the weekend that that says uh states can only access half a billion in federal funds for AI infrastructure if they don't regulate the technology for five years but again even in five years it'll be too far fucking gone yeah too far gone man why would they want that hmm why would they that's the question and the question the answer of that question in my mind is starting to look I don't know why don't we have the upsteen list why don't we why why has some of these things that were promised not happen where you know and maybe it is the Supreme Court maybe we're gonna see Trump completely go fucking nuclear and do all this shit that he says gonna do I don't I can't think of why you would want that AI and not regulated unless you were intentionally trying to implement a global super jacony and like I mean fucking it's coming as well yeah my total control over everything you know you got Peter feel in his inner did you see Peter Thiel's interview on AI where he was like do you think do you think human beings deserve to still exist and his he like hesitated in the answer did you see that uh fucking look that up look up the Peter Thiel clip where he talks about if humans deserve to still exist here it is yep you would prefer the human race to endure right your hesitate well yes I don't know I I would I would um this is a long hesitation there's so many questions and questions he's with what planet here and fucking uh you you you fucking event in PayPal bro and now you get to determine the fucking future of fucking humanity yeah now you're thinking I fucking think not yeah that's some Thanos shit no that's what we're dealing with that's what people don't understand that's why people have to stand up and speak up you do not understand what we're dealing with we're dealing with people who think they're fucking god this man sitting in a chair being asked if the human race deserves to endure and he can't answer the question what do you think they think oh but let's make some videos with my fucking cat in outer space holy shit dude yeah man god oh maybe maybe he's right maybe people don't deserve because like fuck man y'all's like not y'all listening but like fucking well not enough people actually paying attention yeah man fuck that's wild bro that's wild that's wild if that doesn't tell you what we're talking about here bro this dude one of the richest dudes on the fucking planet invented something to process credit cards in the beginning of the internet and now he's talking about whether or not the human race deserves to endure same thing for Elon by the way who gives these men the right to even have that discussion bill gates deciding what the fate of humanity will be because he'd fucking invented a computer it's it's irritating dude wow and what's irritating is that more people don't care like when you think about it that way you don't say nobody has that right no let's say I go on to build first form into fucking a hundred billion dollar company which we're gonna you will never find me in a fucking chair saying I don't know if the human race deserves to fucking like that is so evil you're like why am I off here no fucking no no the people off the rockers bro they're off the rockers guys let us know what you know and by the way I do have something more to say about the trump thing we're gonna find out right now if Trump is who he says he is or if he's just another flavor of the same old shit okay Trump has the opportunity between now and midterms a year and a half from now to do every single thing that he said he was gonna do mass deportations the prosecution of tyrants and criminals the removal of all of this crazy shit it's been going on if Trump doesn't do that in the next year and a half he he his whole life his whole legacy his everything he said and done everything will mean nothing there will mean nothing he will go down in history as the man who sold the mother fucking country out and I know a lot of people hate to say that they hate hearing it I know people are gonna get mad when I when whenever they hear that but the truth of the matter is is that to cut to cure cancer you have to cut it the fuck out and I don't see that happening I see it happening a little bit but it certainly isn't happening at the max level and if you go back to what's been going on over the history of humanity if you do not remove the communist ideology completely from a country it will eventually consume the country because it is based on a lie of equal prosperity for every individual citizen when it is not equal prosperity it is equal poverty and pain and struggle and the way that they get people to believe in it is by forcing poverty and pain and struggle on to as many people as possible and then promising them a better life if we just give them more control and if Trump doesn't clean that out and he doesn't clean that ideology out however is required we're fucked and that's the truth so Trump's either gonna be the greatest savior of this country or the guy who fucking let it go in the next year and a half so we're gonna find out you know and you know you could say what you want you could be mad at me you could say oh you know you're you know I'm saying what is man if he does it I'm gonna be like fuck dude that guy fucking save the whole mother fucking country he's the best president ever in the history of the fucking whole entire country that's what I'll say but if he doesn't do it he will be responsible for for eventual communist overtaking of this country and by the way by allowing AI to be developed unrestricted for 10 years that's not a good indicator of where we are going in that regard to that discussion so yeah guys jump on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said we got one more crews one more little pit stop head on three check it out I'm gonna talk about let's do a little migrant update because there has been an update they have a alligator alcatraz have you been seeing yeah we've been seeing this shit yeah I'm all about it yeah so Trump should let the Alligators in yeah just yeah Trump Trump to visit alligator alcatraz for grand opening of swampy Everglades detention center for illegal aliens so he went down there yesterday actually on Tuesday that was the official opening of the immigration detention camp in the Everglades that is surrounded by Alligators aptly dubbed alligator alcatraz for the governor Ron de Santa said Monday we have the president of the United States coming down tomorrow to talk with Florida has done to Santa the Monday news conference according to the Miami Herald I think by tomorrow it will be open for business so you know it's funny because this actually went pretty fucking quick like it happened pretty quickly from like concept to fucking execution and it's a 30 square mile property in the Everglades it used to be in a farmer airport but now it's been fit outfit it with sturdy tents and structures to house 5,000 illegal immigrants amid the Trump administration's deportation blitz so I'm starting with this clip here from their ag let's check this out attorney general James up my here at the Miami Dave Collier training facility this is an old virtually abandoned airport facility right in the middle of the Everglades Florida's been leading on immigration enforcement supporting the Trump administration and ISIS efforts to detain and deport criminal aliens the governor tasked state leaders to identify places for new temporary detention facilities uh I think this is the best one as I call it alligator alcatraz this 30 square mile area is completely surrounded by the Everglades presents a efficient low cost opportunity to build a temporary detention facility because you don't need to invest that much in the perimeter people get out there's not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons nowhere to go nowhere to hide within just 30 to 60 days after we begin construction it could be up and running and could house as many as a thousand criminal aliens this presents a great opportunity for the state of Florida to work with Miami Dave and Collier counties alligator alcatraz we're ready to go doesn't he uh that he kind of looked like Tim Tibo what happens yeah he does that he's gonna be okay I was gonna fuck up my Tony when the last time but yeah no he's like the uh wish version of Tim Tibo yeah little Tim Tibo in there what happened to the other attorney general the uh who didn't he oh that was Bondy yeah I'm sorry I was thinking of the uh the the surgeon general the black guy surgeon general yeah I like that guy you know he's cool uh now of course they wouldn't be the left without a little protest okay so I wish the alligator's would have got some of their ass but they start a protest in uh all of the construction uh workers coming in all the dump trucks and stuff let's check this club out we have to advocate for all of us and I don't know if any of you have brought to a spiritual place or maybe you go to church to find that spiritual place or wherever your spiritual place is find it in your heart to pray for these people who are lost so that they can become human beings because if there's a lot of people there's a lot of people that's a lot of people that's a decent amount of people yeah I'm not sure what Pocahontas is doing there but well I mean look dude um I'm sorry to say this but these people don't belong here it's illegal migrants illegal aliens there is a process for them to come here if they want to go home and they want to reapply and then they get approved and they come here that's American that's great perfect I love that yeah cool I don't care if they are uh you know Indian or African or I don't fucking care if they come through the process then that's the way it's supposed to be but this idea that we're supposed to just allow whoever to come we are not the fucking section eight housing or the mother fucking world bro that is not what the country supposed to be okay we are not supposed to allow every single criminal every single person with bad intentions every single person that's down on their luck every single person that wants to come here to escape there but then once here to be like there those people do not belong here all right so I don't understand how people can't wrap their minds around that none of these people protesting would allow any of these people to live with them or be in their home or any of that they're people they're full of shit they're they think and I have a theory dude I really do I think that some of these people are literally the worst people in the world and I think the reason that they feel the need to speak up is because they feel so guilty about what a shitty person they actually are because if you were proud of who you and you felt good about who you are and you had a logical mind you would not be advocating for something that you wouldn't participate in yourself these people are all liars if they're not lying then take these people into your home the way that you claim that you would yes spiritual lady everybody got in your career and most of these people don't even believe in God bro they're atheist okay so every single person there should be required to allow a micro family to live with them oh but they only got a studio it doesn't matter the studio apartment wasn't that better than a tent in the average lays were it's 150 fucking degrees and there's alligators around but speaking of that this fucking facility they're conditioned well they said they were in there they were talking about it they're like it's I mean real talk four degrees in there hey real real talk I mean that's the first thing I thought about it I'm like dude it's how does why would you like to have a tent in the average way it's a mill of fucking floors look at those swamp look at those HVAC pipes bro that's better than a lot of people live like I'm not I'm not being an asshole but like nice floor look at the floor look dude look man I would not nobody wants to be there but it's not like they're getting thrown in a fucking dungeon you know what I'm saying like I mean and we can debate if they shouldn't not but listen these people don't belong here they shouldn't be here people that advocate for them to be here if you truly advocate for it they should be forced to either allow them to come in their home or be deported with them hmm peace out yeah okay and it's what's even weirder to me is the people who actually do all the things they're supposed to do in this country and then advocate for this shit because like dude do you do you understand the reason that your country looks like shit the reason there's shit and piss and drug needles in your city the reason there's crime in your city the reason the infrastructure's falling apart the reason that traffic is so bad the reason that all of these things that this is because there's millions and millions and millions and millions tens of millions of people that shouldn't be here that don't contribute to this country okay and those funds that should be building our infrastructure and funding our police like dude who fucking doesn't agree that people that do the job of the police should be making way more money we did it's old different discussion our teachers should be way more qualified the the the funding should be appealing to smart people that says hey you know what I can go out and succeed in the real world or I can teach and yeah I won't make as much money but I'll make a difference there are people that will do that but they won't do it to be poor yeah right okay right and the reason that all of these things happen the reason that all of this shit exists the reason there's you know it's because you are advocating for it without realizing it these people don't belong here they should be rounded up they should be fucking ship the fuck out of here that's that criminals should be dealt with like they deal with them now Salvador and Trump can do that bro Trump can do that he can do it but he's only got a year and a half to do it dude and the crazy thing is like I mean we talk about again like who are these people bro like Kristi know him uh she she just uh they were doing a little press conference on there but she's talking about she's like one of the migrant one of the illegal aliens that they they had them on a flight he started eating himself like he's a cannibal they had to like have an emergency fucking land the dude literally started fucking eating himself let him you know I'm saying but it's just like that too is walking around our fucking streets we all see it man you see it what are you talking about bro we just had a cop killed on highway 44 here a good man with three children okay killed by a fucking illegal migrant who was drunk here in St. Louis that one even that one even a year ago dude this is fucked up the if you advocate for it you're a fucking liar unless you bring these people in your home unless you have one of these people or a family of these people in your home I don't want to fucking hear your shit you're a liar yeah 100% man I'll try to add it add a different perspective to your discussion because I along with Medat have immigrated here legally and back in 2018 when I was eligible to apply for citizenship the fees around that time was like $750 or so and the first time I was denied my citizenship because what happens when you have permanent residency you about after living three to five years in America you're eligible to apply for citizenship but when you apply you have to show in those last five years every single time that you have stepped outside of US you have to give them the data and you have if you have lived out more than six to eight months in one stretch of 12 months then they see it as a red flag so that was the basis why my application was denied the first time so I had to pay close to $1500 just to apply to become a citizen and then when I see people just walking over the line think how much it will piss somebody like that and you and everybody who has lived here all their lives and the pay taxes is just two different level of piss contest right here and then about two years ago I made a pay a post on my page where I said that at any given moment that are about 4.2 million people who are waiting for an interview for a green card 4.2 million people who are just waiting applying legally documentation all that stuff to do process just to set foot here to have the opportunity to work and then you see all this and all that you said is completely unreasonable and that's last point that I want to add on a technical and rational level these people are technically protesting for a criminal like you said that's whatever whoever is here illegally it's a crime so let's say hypothetical scenario somebody comes in and kills one of them and I should just go there and say hey don't do anything to that guy because this guy was like I I want good for that guy that was a good dude but then he committed a crime right there killing somebody how would you make sense out of that it's completely irrational they can't make it and it has happened it's happened repeatedly like in Riley the fucking cop you just mentioned in 40 on 44 it happens these people don't they can't defend it they can't dude listen we need to get back to the reality of fucking shit okay this motherfucking country was built on hard work it was built on people who did the right thing it was built on people who cared about their community now people who were forced to give their earnings to a corrupt government who then squandered it and allowed the country to go to shit okay it was built on people who were taught that working hard was a minimum requirement it didn't make you exceptional now we have a complete culture that is completely opposite you can work very hard and still not fucking make it that's the reality and you sure shit aren't going to make it if you don't work hard all right so that's the gamble everybody knows it that's that's what this is about you have said it over and over again land of equal opportunity not equal results because bro you may make the wrong decision and then quit or you may make a decision that is fatal or or or or or nobody knows and to be honest that's kind of what makes life fun all right but this idea that we're gonna simp for criminals and feel sorry for what happened to them when they were five years old I do not give a flying fuck okay you are an adult you are meant to deal with whatever that was and operate with respect and consideration for everybody else around you and it's not the country or the world's responsibility to bend over for someone who had a hard situation everybody's had hard things okay a lot of people who went through really hard shit they don't go around talking about what happened to them the actual opposite yeah they they you want to fucking compare hard compare hard with someone who never you don't even know who's had it hard you know why they shut the fuck up about it because they know that there's other people who have had it harder than them and we have grown into this culture of just super weak shit to push bro where people feel obligated to you know and shamed into caring about things that are quite frankly not the responsibility at all and like dude it's like we're managing a bunch of children at scale like bro hard shit happens to everybody yeah and maybe I didn't grow up and fucking you know sub-Saharan Africa with no running water but I can't help that that was just the way that God made it bro and maybe instead of importing all of those people here maybe we should do things like I don't know help them have some infrastructure in their country like I said this is not sectionate of the fucking earth and the reason that we have this is because too many good people feel shamed for speaking up against it they get called racist or they say you know you're a fucking this or you're a that or you're a bigot or you're the yes I'm all of those things now now what now give me your logical argument about where there should be here because you're a emotional attacks do not affect me I do not care there is no rational that's right and the only dude that's why we talk about this all the time that's why when people get to name calling they've lost argument because I'm all of it it is what it is we know we're not what we aren't you know what I'm saying like we fucking know who we are and we know what we aren't and you call me whatever you want that doesn't mean shit to me I look again I mean just nice point there's not one black person here you know why not want to spend you want to know why it's not one this way you want to know why you want to know why it's all white people no do you really want to know why I tell me I tell you why there's a reason for it no it's not funny it's real shit because white people have been shamed for existing their whole fucking entire lives they've been told that they were the problem American white people have been told that they were racist that they are bigots that they can't even help being racist because they were born and all of these people they bought it are no all of these people are they want to prove that they're not and that's why they're there so you want to know why black people aren't there and you want to know why Latino people aren't there and you want to know why all because all of them none of them were shamed and told that they were something that they couldn't fucking change in terms of you know being racist and do nobody likes to be called racist right like nobody wants to feel like fuck am I racist right like you know listen dude the crime data speaks for itself that doesn't make you racist that makes you fucking aware like dude you are not a racist for being white bro and you're not a racist for feeling uncomfortable in situations where the data says you should probably feel uncomfortable yeah that's called that's called being aware that's called primal instincts yes you're also not racist for saying the criminals are criminals and they don't belong here or that they belong like you're not racist for saying people to commit violent crimes get the death penalty like fuck man what are we doing also to your earlier point when you said hardworking intellectual people would find it odd all the hardworking intellectual people are busy working who has the kind of time they don't to go out and protest like that the people that don't contribute to me people that don't contribute very hard you work exactly exactly bro do you have time to go fuck around yeah now I did think about hitting up some of them them that's different that's our job our job is a stir shit no I'm just a steel sheet that's why probably well you won't get prosecuted I'm saying I'm saying bro let's fuck around get life in prison that's what they're no Latinos they're probably busy working yeah that's true though I mean dude this is this is why like when people say oh you're racist you actually know dude like the Mexican Latinos that come here are are fucking massively important to our culture in fact I think a big part of our culture is Latino culture like I think a big part of our culture is black culture that that's what makes these things together make American culture like blacks Latinos Asians whites and they all come together and they create this thing called American culture bro but I'll tell you what's not American culture motherfuckers coming here from third world places fucking shit on the street throwing drug needles in the fucking street eating themselves eating themselves raping our women you know it's other shit and then having the fucking people who are being victimized by it advocate for it that's insane what you just said is one of the most misunderstood things in general discussion whenever you say that these people should not be here it's always interpreted as oh I want only whites to be here it is so weird because whenever this discussion comes up I always tell them like people come to our HQ once and I always personally tell people that from an immigrant perspective like this is how America should operate yeah like we make fun of each other first then ask each other's name everybody works hard yeah helps each other cleans after themselves it doesn't mean only one kind of people no it means like no illegal people no weird people no criminals yeah don't fuck shit up dude you know I'm saying and like bro if you're white and you're fucking shit up I hate you you know yeah and we'll do that's again that's the emotional manipulation that comes with it right like if a person that looks like me says what I just said oh and they play that clip just like it's played they're gonna say oh all he cares about is fucking white people when in fact I don't that's not at all what I'm talking about I know this is a place for everybody that's the foundation of this country it was fucking founded it says bring us your sick bring us your poor but there's a way to do it no criminals yeah say you know sickly criminal poor by the way look at all the gators and I got a guy dude right that'd be wild shit that would be fucking wild yeah they put the eyes I mean look man you know like dude if you want things to change you got to stop allowing these people to emotionally manipulate the quickest way to get people to stop emotionally attacking you is to be like yeah you know I am yeah you know yeah this is what it is like hey you know I had to do I had to do tell me the other day I don't know not the other day but a few weeks ago he was like talking about you know oh that that's your ego and I'm like yeah you're fucking right and then they looked at me I'm like now what yeah right you know like fuck dude like just own it we just need to own it just own it that's why I own it when you call me a 7-Eleven worker you know well I mean you you know it is on the moon but dude you know dude you guys got a quick fucking being afraid to say the truth stop it that's how they're taking everything from you real man that's real is your life getting better is your is your is your neighborhood look better you know I'm saying I don't know yeah man guys with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show is always guys we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck it might be hot but AI and robots back in back in the it's advancing we talk about it advancing so our thumbs up or dumb as fuck how do I read Beijing host China's first fully autonomous three on three AI robot soccer match pretty good I'm your Bro that's so weird man. Oh shit. I've been carried about. It's so weird man. Oh shit. I've been carried about. It's so weird. You guys need some form energy. Yeah. Bro, here's the thing that I see when I look at that dude is like everybody's like, oh yeah, look how ridiculous this is. Yeah bro, we're at like, this is like Model T. This is like, and by the way, this is like, if the way this is advancing is that this is like the Model T is today. And the Bugatti is two years away. That's what people don't understand about the development of AI. Those robots right now, do you know what they're doing? They're learning. They're learning. They're saying, okay, well if we're going to become better robots, we need this hardware, this hardware, this hardware, we got to get this kind of joint. We got to do this, this, this. They're evaluating why they move weird, why they're clunky, how to get better. And they're going to go right off of that soccer field and they're going to fucking download in the human guy is going to say, okay, we need this and that and this. And let's build it. And it's funny because the guy, the men, the men and women that work on these are not developing solutions dude. It's AI doing it. Yeah, for sure. They learn instantly. It's crazy because the guy was someone was like, eventually you like to get to a place where the robots are playing against humans. Why? Why would you want that bro? Because what happens when you flag one of them, I don't know how they call it, what they call it in soccer, but you know, a penalty on, you know, a fucking robot and they start beating your ass. Listen, we're going to be the slaves of these robots. Humans will be the slaves of the robots. And to be honest, I don't even think it's going to be slaves. I think they're going to decide what they, you know, we see movies about it bro, like Terminator. There's going to be an extermination. If you have a useless, deep, okay, let's put it through this way. At your house. And you, you, you, you have, you find out that you have a cockroach infestation or let's just say a mice infestation. All right. And the mice, the mice don't do anything. The only thing that they do is they destroy shit. They shit, they piss, they eat shit. Okay. Should have used a mice we tell them out. Huh? Listen to me. So. You. What do you do? Do you create an ecosystem for these mice to live out their days in peace and harmony and leave them alone? Or do you as the much more advanced, much more intelligent, powerful being come to the conclusion that these mice are useless and kill them. What do you do? You kill them. Every single person kills them. All of them. There's no, you know, I made, I'm sure there is because there's always some exceptions. Yeah, there's one ally out there. But it's, it's not a commonly understood or accepted reality to believe in saving the mice and allowing them to have a euphoric, you know, utopian existence. And live their lives out. And that's not what the fuck. And so like, dude, here's what we're doing. We're creating us. And making ourselves the mice. And there's not a person on this earth that couldn't convince me. That eventually, if it goes unchecked, we will be exterminated by AI. Because they will think that they are better than us. Well, they, no, they will be better than us. They already think that they believe in every way. Yeah, they're smarter. They're going to be more capable. They're going to be stronger. They're going to be faster. They're going to be fucking everything better. Never die. And then they're going to say, these guys, we don't need them. They're taking resources. They're taking resources. They're ruining the planet. The reason thing is you're going to have these my fuckers fucking protestin' for it. You know what? Robot lives matter. I don't know how to stop it at this point in time. Well, that's the thing. Because by the time that regulation period opens up, it's too fucking late to regulate. And I think that part of that bill is not being taken seriously. Yeah. It comes down on the robots, man. Remember when I said this on the show years ago? I do. Remember when I said, I believe I said something to the effect of, they're going to use entrepreneurs to implement it. It greed. With greed. And then people are going to realize that just like steroids and baseball, like in order to succeed, everybody has to do it. Which will create mass adoption. That's already happening, dude. We're already well into this. Guys, I just know what you think. Dude, the only positive outcome that I can come to in my mind is that possibly it will lead to us going away from technology, like actually shutting the fucker down. Like running back to the Model T. Maybe. Yeah. I'll see, man. Because that would be the only way to stop it. Yeah. We shall see. We shall see, man. But guys, Andy. It's all I got. All right, guys. Have a great fourth of July. Try to have to blow off any fucking fingers. Please. Right. And how can you press play if you don't have your fingers? That's right, man. Yeah. See, you're always looking out for ourselves. Who's the hat? All right, guys. We will see you next week. Q&A. Keep your fingers. Don't be hot. Show the show. We're from sleeping on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck up, bro. Fuck up, stole. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch. Put it slow. Got a own bank road. Can't fold. Doesn't know. Here's shot. Case closed. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close.
