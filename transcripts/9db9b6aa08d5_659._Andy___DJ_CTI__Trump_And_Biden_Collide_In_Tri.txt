What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the real estate about the lives of fitness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today we have Andy and DJ proves the motherfucking in that that's what we're gonna do that's what CTI stands for it stands for cruise the internet if you don't know the deal by now then you just don't fucking know by the way we're not gonna do the rest of the intro I think I'm about done with that like if you guys don't know by now you never know yeah huh ask somebody that's right uh we just got done recording a special show for you guys that were tomorrow with our good buddy the iron cowboy James Lawrence uh you guys are interested in hearing that stay tuned that's gonna come out tomorrow so we're on a little bit of a time crunch so in lieu of the entire intro let's just get into the show let's get right into it man I got it. Uh pay the fee I mean we could still say that yes we are going to say the most important part yeah all right I need you guys to share the show okay if you just brought me one person every single time you listen to one of the shows that we spend all kinds of money and all kinds of time producing how big would the show be what would the message do what would the world look like if everybody was out there listening to real AF so do your part don't be a whole share the fucking show there you go all right yes let's get right into it yeah Biden's uh he's apparently fit for duty this is the new intro uh did you see this the new reporter everybody talking about no this is one of those days where I don't know what's going on okay oh this is good this is good um yeah so so this is a uh AP article Hillary's Biden continues to be fit for duty his doctors say after president undergoes annual physical they actually so so do you think like obviously they're lying right like well are they no they got to be hold on are they though remember because their plan is going exactly as planned so he is fit for the duty that they have assigned him see bro that's that legal bullshit that they play too oh we got to play the same shit man when they say the economy is great they mean it because it's exactly where they want it to be when they say the border is great man you what you got yeah I mean fuck man dude listen when they say things are going great they mean things are going great because they are accomplishing exactly what they set out to do when they say there's no problem at the border they mean there's no problem at the border because this is what they intended to happen so we have to start understanding like they are not lying when they say Biden is fit for duty he's fit to do exactly what they need him to do which is destroy the country and then we can all pretend he's just some senile old man instead of somebody that's intentionally trying to destroy the country so he is actually the perfect guy for duty for them that's bro that makes so much fucking sense god damn it's the truth fuck it's the truth we keep looking at these people you got all the guys out here and by the way I like most of these guys but I call them the conservative talking heads but they are and they still all right dudes I know most of these dudes I like them but you guys keep saying can you believe this no shit this is the point this is what they're doing bro like this is what they intend to do so yes we should believe it and we should understand that when they say they're doing a good job they mean it that's crazy that damn it what well I mean it's obvious to me I would just make so much fucking sense man when you think about it in that context it makes so much fucking sense it makes so much sense man be like man dude listen let's just stop the show bro I can retire fucking fix the world right there bro yeah I mean one thing they did try to bring up is about you know how he walks you know he has a weird walk you kind of like drags his feet yeah you know like yeah you know okay he's gonna I'm sure he shocks the shit out everybody touches cuz he's definitely creeps him out it when he touches it it is yeah I don't have it he's gonna sniff you but it's the most sniff walk they they huh that's a little sniffing they they they did try to give some light and shed some light to his walk and they're saying that it's because he suffers from neuropathy and his feet yeah which is like you know meaning he can't feel it's like absence of feel touch you right there's no sensory response shocking pains yeah I don't know all of that creeps up your legs he's probably got what happens when you're a thousand it's bound to happen you know I'm saying but there was a doctor that did comment on this uh doctor uh Mark Seagal he's a professor of medicine at the George Washington University suggested something link could exist between his physical health and his cognitive ability because that's the big key here like they're not testing it they're not even performing any tests no bottle went through a few tests when he was in office Trump went through a few when he was in office like it's a routine thing they have not tested they will not test him and they're like oh well you know you watch his action there's listen to his speech he's doing fine right but this this doctor he's not he's not the doctor that did the the the physical unbiting but he had this to say it's quote some neurologists have told me that this gateway your feet are kind of glued to the floor uh is more consistent with fluid on the brain or possibly not enough blood flow to the areas of the brain he told Fox News on Thursday quote I'm not saying that he has that I haven't examined them but we didn't see any imaging of the brain MRI and again no cognitive testing so it would make sense you know it would I think it makes sense but that that's that's been the uh the kind of one of the big talk of the towns but uh I mean come on man yeah anybody with the common sense can look at this guy and tell like this is the this is the grandpa that we put in the corner at Thanksgiving and don't listen to anything he says yeah like oh really grandpa cool there like that's who this guy is and he's that guy for a reason why is he that guy for a reason what are they trying to do that's where people need to start taking their brain yeah I mean this guy's the perfect guy to do what they what they're doing yeah and and then that he's done a great job yeah great job guys let us know what you guys think on this conversation let us come down the comments but with that being said let's get into our headlines remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them linked there that being said headline number one this is a big topic let's talk about it headline number one reads Trump and Biden collide in split screen trips to the border with immigration in the spotlight so they're both down in Texas right now at the same time I know we touched this just a little bit on the last show but there's been some some various today this is today this is right we're in the shows recorded but there's some some interesting developments happening down there right now so let's get into this so again both by both president Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump are visiting the Southern border Thursday in a dramatic split screen moment at the 2024 presidential campaign ramps up over an issue that is can found it administrations of both parties for decades immigration it's Biden's second trip to the border since he took office his first was to El Paso in January of 2023 this time he set to visit Brownsville a border town in the Rio Grande Valley that has long felt the impacts of migration up close quote he wanted to show that it was important for him to go down there to hear from Border Patrol agents to hear from first responders White House press secretary Karin Jean Pierre said at a briefing Wednesday Biden will also deliver remarks to urge congressional Republicans to pass more border security funding a White House official said Biden campaign advisor to NBC News that Biden is quote going to be pretty hot on the border and direct at Trump speaking of the bipartisan border security deal that fell through after Trump pushed Republicans to vote against it the advisor added quote we needed to go to the border to crystallize that this is on him uh Trump correct so he is in control okay so Biden is the president right and Biden has led in 10 million illegals depending on who you ask and they've sent almost 200 billion dollars to Ukraine and the bill that they passed was going to send tens of more billion dollars to Ukraine and to the Middle East and very and out of all three the border was going to get the least amount of money and so Trump said don't pass this and so now the entire border situation is Trump's fault yes okay I just wanted to clarify okay that makes total sense perfect yes but because it's another definitely Trump's fault definitely yeah now in other news that was this uh in Texas they tried to pass some legislation that allowed uh like local law enforcement to arrest these illegal uh invaders right um and as of today a federal judge uh this had already Texas lawletting police arrests at legal border crosses blocked by federal judge a federal judge that Texas may not exercise immigration authority without permission from the federal government and I see a lot of people online trying to blow this up and like oh no but we got we got to understand that you have to use what the law allows right and like it's not this is a jurisdictional issue I mean it's kind of simple like yeah they're local police state police even they don't have the powers of of a federal immigration laws you can't super-seed that right um but that's not the issue what's funny here is the border patrol and their response to this situation and we touched this on on Tuesday's episode that came out that it would be you know Trump would use this kind of the spotlight and he's gonna pull a lot more support he's gonna get the support from from the police in that area the first responders and it's exactly what's happening uh look at this head on the tell-on-reeds border patrol union tells Biden to keep our name out of your mouth ahead of Texas visit um the border patrol union uh issued a fiery warning on Thursday to president Biden telling him to keep our name out of your mouth hours before the president is due to meet with officials at the border an urge passage of a senate border bill here is the official tweet from the official count of the border patrol union it reads attention president Biden keep our name out of your mouth today now if that ain't a fucking sign I don't know what is never release them into rest of shit I mean how about you guys at the border patrol union instead of just tweeting mean things you actually stand the fuck up and fix the problem how about that how about you guys and all your little sheriff's departments and all the little police departments who are tweeting out goofy shit uh how about you stand up for the people that you sworn out to protect yeah how about that I'll be I'll be impressed yeah when we start seeing that not tweets so yeah it's interesting but it's just bullshit like most of the shit that meet these people fucking say and do yeah you know let's let's tweet about it while the country fucking burns right you know what I mean that's a big problem that we have in America right now is people think that like that's action like this is theater yeah like you you signed up to do a job to keep the border secure you signed up to be a police officer you signed up to be a sheriff you signed up to be in the military you took a oath to serve the people of this country above any other interest and right now there are other interests that are violating the oath that you took and your response is to tweet that's why the country is the way it is right now that's real shit yeah I know and people don't like to hear that a lot of my friends are police officers and a lot of my friends are FBI and a lot of my friends are CIA and a lot of my friends are in the military but that is the truth and until the men that swore to uphold the oath to protect the citizens of this country above all else start to uphold that oath on their own we're going to continue to go down in flames yeah it's what we take because that's the line you guys are the line and I'm not saying this out of anger or being mean or being a jerk or trying to be a clickbait or say shit I'm just saying that's the job you signed up for and that job is not being done right now so at some point in time these men who signed up to do this job need to start doing the job whether the orders say so or not yeah yeah that's my take that's my opinion that's real shit man it's real shit you know they got a little bit more context right so Fox News they reached out to the White House then of course to respond to this but the union did issue a statement saying that this visit was just a little too little too late so they said that uh quote but even if you were to put the proper policies in place at this late hour he'd only be doing it to try to save his presidency and self-serving actions when time is winding down should always give Americans policy commonsense dictates that as a lame duck he'd revert to open board of policies if reelected the union said um immediately the day after he was reelected they would go right back to it for a couple reasons one it's because what they want but two they want to show you fuck you they want to show you that that's what these people are about they they will do this just to rub it in people's face they will listen mark my words if they somehow maintain power whatever they're saying today the next day they will come out and reverse that stuff and then they will say what are you going to do about it right that's what that's their plan it's further demoralization and destabilization of the United States of America so that's nice that you guys are saying that and I we all appreciate it but when we talk about too little too late look in the fucking mirror yeah it's real shit I don't you know I didn't really I mean I feel like I get Trump's reason for going down there right but like I also kind of don't you know maybe it's just the is it's it's more of a campaign you know checklist they got to run off but I don't agree I don't disagree with the end like there has to be some action there and and I feel like we we started seeing a little bit of it from Texas trying to stand up and do certain things but it's like you know now you start battling the the fight is not it's not on the Republicans we're getting they're getting counted by the administration constantly shutting the shit down you know and so it's like we gotta get to a point where I will we'll we'll fuck what they shut down this has to get done has to get done man because we're in a very vulnerable state right now as a country now we're past vulnerable we're in it we're an unsafe state it's our country is being invaded our our entire society is being pushed to the brink of collapse intentionally these people just like I said they would years ago are starting to commit tons of crime uh specifically towards women and I said that years ago we talked about what's happened in Europe and people said oh you know he's a big it he's a he's a racist look no I'm stating facts of what's been happening and this has been happening in Europe for years and if you guys take your head out of fucking Instagram for an hour or off a tic tac for an hour and pay attention you'd recognize what's actually happening what's actually happening is you're being replaced and you don't understand it okay they don't give a fuck about you and I told you a long time ago that these people are gonna have more rights than you okay now we're not allowed to arrest them now they're allowed to be police officers now they're being talked about allowed to join the military to gain citizenship and what else did I tell you was gonna happen I told you they were gonna train them I told you they were gonna arm them and in fact a lot of these people are already trained all right so what do you think's going to happen when this summer because they are going to do this this summer you you guys think you know George Floyd was bad wait until this summer when it's the migrants versus the citizens of the United States and you're forced to join in because there is not enough police and there is not enough military to handle the millions of migrants that have been let in what kind of chaos do you think will happen when those riots start to pop off do you see the acceleration of the promotion of these crimes that they're committing across mass media that is a ramp up they are starting to ramp up migrant crime just like they ramped up crimes against police police officer crime against black people in 2020 now they're doing that with migrants against a citizens and what they're going to try to do in my opinion after observing this starting to ramp up is to create a riot situation all summer long total disruption that the American man and citizen is going to have to participate in yeah so and they're already starting the talks of like trying to civilize and you know cattle on the side of migrants like oh well you know you can't call them migraines they're not all Eagles you can't call them all Eagles like they're already trying to put a column whatever the fuck I feel like calling them you know what I want to call them gone yeah I'm being serious I know I know but like they're already starting that they're trying to already start to put them in these protected classes I'm not talking about our friends from Mexico I'm not they're not making I know I'm not like dude some Mexicans get super sensitive because they're like you're talking about my fate no I'm fucking not bro let's be real yeah Mexicans have been here forever we fucking all get along with with the Mexican Americans and the Mexican Mexicans that live here we all enjoy each other's company we get along we work together we're not talking about you guys we're talking about the same motherfuckers that you guys don't like right which are these people from these third world countries that are coming here fucking shit up for you too so let's be clear about who we're talking about if you're Mexican and you happen to come back across across the no one really cares about you guys like we're kind of like the same people a little neighbors yeah that's right it's neighbors yeah like you come borrow some milk we trade some culture it's all good man yeah fuck yeah fuck music guys like that's what I'm saying yeah you know and I see them trying to loop they're trying to loop that message into the disruption isn't that isn't that like that's a standard part of the gameplay right yes yes bro listen umbrella listen when these riots start to happen yeah when these riots start to happen bro they're gonna try to get all black people and all Mexican people to be on the side of the migrants the people of color that's what they're gonna try to do yeah absolutely we're my pockets yeah through the callus well it's mypox what's that it's like I don't even fucking know this my pocket yeah my pocket that's a thing yeah it's something people of color let me see so you don't just people you guys are mypox yeah my pocket let's see my pocket means it's an acronym that refers to black

France yeah guys let's keep this show moving man we got him number two have not number two reads uh text from Nathan Wade lawyer appeared to show more than speculation about fanny willis is fanny willis a fair read the full exchange more is coming out of this this is just the you know I tried to keep you guys up to date with what's happening down in Georgia and bomb show stuff is happening but something a lot more deeper and I think we got the connection back to the White House as of today so let's go into this a little bit so a trove of dammin text messages from Nathan Wade's farmer divorce attorney seemingly showing his affair with Fulton County district attorney fanny willis started before they claim uh have finally emerged text exchanges between Terrence Bradley and Ashley Merchant who is representing one of farmer Donald Trump uh co-definance in the Georgia election fraud case were revealed in uh in full for the first time on Megan Kelly's podcast on Wednesday here's the text messages okay so Ashley text uh it is my hope they do the right thing before then Terrence replies you are my friend and I trust you they will not they're arrogant as fuck referring to fanny and wait um she think she won the other day when she didn't have to be opposed um that wasn't a win Ashley responds saying Thompson will set them up Nathan can admit it all on the 31st and if he doesn't then Thompson will make fanny sit he basically gave Nathan a chance to protect her but if he doesn't tell it all uh then fanny will have to sit Nathan's finances make it look like he owed a lot of cash when he began this um and then these text messages Ashley asked do you think it started before she hired him Terrence replies absolutely it started when she left the DA's office and was judged in south Fulton Ashley liked that message and then Terrence continued saying quote they met at the municipal court CLE conference Ashley responds that's what that's what I figured when he was married now Terrence was brought on the stand and asked about these and he said no I've never knew they were I guess he didn't know they had the text messages here's his response let's watch it was two pages of text messages between you and Miss Merchant correct correct all right now the first page starts off by saying Miss Merchant like just date don't hire him do you think it started before she hired him you see that what do you say what do you say he's a day he didn't know they had it shot off being play it back play it back oh bro this is great was two pages of text messages between you and Miss Merchant correct correct all right that's there it's looking at his own text message starts off by saying Miss Merchant like just date don't hire him do you think it started before she hired him you see that oh man yeah fuck yes I see now the thing is he went on then as soon as that came out you know you went into now oh I can't recall I couldn't you know I'm playing the game these motherfuckers are guilty now the question that I've had that I feel like a lot of people have was like okay but like why how did okay yes we know this is all fucked up but like how did a little prosecutor in Fulton County Georgia decide to pick up this case and charge Trump and his campaign and 18 other people with the Rico act like like no who just thinks of that like what made her do this right what we now have a link this Breitbar reporting this Breitbar headline reads exclusive farmer Biden aid paid Fannie Willis's deputy DA Jeff DeSantis $131,000 in 2023 and it gets deeper than that let's do this is a really really great reporting on Breitbar outside I got to get him credit for that let's dive into this so Democrat operative in Fulton counties deputy district attorney Jeff DeSantis this gentleman right here okay um received four payments totaling $131,000 for providing consulting services who representative Gabriel ammo out of Rhode Island a farmer Biden White House aid who worked with local elected officials federal election commission records show the money flow is significant because sources with direct knowledge of Fulton County's office told Breitbar news DeSantis is a Biden plant inside a Fulton County office to target former president Donald Trump DeSantis's payments were previously unreported DeSantis was working at county DA's office while operating a consulting firm named 2020 insights LLC sources told Breitbar news deputy district attorneys would likely have to sign an oath that prohibits them from working outside their county employment agreement by census's oath if he signed one remains a disclosed now here is the here's the proof of the payments okay um and you can see that they began in July of 20 of 2023 there was four payments that were made in succession and from July 21st of 2023 to August 11th of 2023 he was paid all of this money hold on they said it was consulting and on the line sheet they have it written as advertising right to pass it through that's a flag right there for sure right yeah now it's also curious that DeSantis contracted with ammo so who who is ammo who's that guy that this is ammo right here raising his right hand um ammo who worked in the Biden administration as the deputy director of the White House office of intergovernmental affairs before running for congress in 2023 where he worked as the principal liaison to mayors and quote local elected officials according to his White House bio ammo also served as an advisor on president Joe Biden's 2020 campaign and later served on his transition team quote that is the connection to the White House once source told bright bar news quote DeSantis did this he's the one he is the one pulling all the strings he was the one that walled her speaking of willis walled her off he was in every important meeting he is the brain child behind this end quote DeSantis is a wealthy and successful democrat operative he ran willis's 2020 campaign and raised four million dollars for her um quote he had over four million dollars in donations for running the district attorney's race one source told bible news about DeSantis's fundraising quote why would you want to take a major pay cut to get a seventy thousand or eighty thousand dollar prosecutorial job the source asked quote I have no idea why DeSantis has professional experience far greater than in than the average county employee he was the former executive director of the democrat party of Georgia with extensive knowledge of campaign finance law he was also the deputy director of compliance for the DNC according to his official bio there is the link there it is so what happened here because there's a lot of moving parts here so they pay this dude to come in and basically put together the case against Trump correct okay correct yep so so you got you got ammo this guy who just want to elect both these dudes right both of these brought both these dudes in right so those guys on the Biden side he was straight from the Biden administration this guy the uh DeSantis guy is a is basically the you know the big power head in Georgia when it comes to democrat elections yeah commissions and things like that um so it up what how it appears is that this looks like a piece of shit 100 percent mean for real I mean that that that looks like a fuck home yes dude yeah fuck man he looks like he smells like high dog water to you he looked yeah whatever yeah um but this guy from the Biden administration ammo and this guy DeSantis are the ones that got together who directed ammo from the Biden administration to to reach out and get consulting about any of this right what it looks like then write it off as advertising right it off as advertising so I'm gonna pay you $131,000 to make sure that this goes through yeah that's crazy well dude that's that I mean look and then this nigga liar yeah I'm sorry guys damn yeah I like a suit though that's a clean suit man I like that look I'm gonna see you'd have a nice suit too if you were still in six hundred thousand dollars of taxpayer money no shit I have a nice suit without doing that yeah you can get a nice suit without that that's right well you know what fuck them yeah I want you about that I think that's I think that's that's where we just go from now on fuck them yeah I just played all these people fucking burn for treason what for real I mean they these are treasonous people these are people literally interfering with legitimate democratic you know process yeah well you know and these people that's the big conversation people don't understand this is not about the past bro this is about interfering the future people do they've interfered with the past so they're comfortable interfering in the past which makes them comfortable doing shit like this these people will progress and progress and progress until they are stopped tyranny and oppression never stops itself there is no situation in the history of time where tyrants got tired of oppressing and said oh you know what I'm gonna be cool now that's not what happens these people get away with more and more and more and more and eventually you catch them and when you catch them then they say well so what and they keep going and so the this concept that you guys think is gonna work itself out politically is is likely to not happen unless what we said earlier happens where the people who have taken an oath to protect this country from people like this start stepping up and doing their motherfucking jobs okay otherwise dude they're gonna they're gonna keep going they're not gonna stop there's no boundaries or guidelines or moral limitations to what these people will do to get their way think of think of this think of thinking of yourself as so important because I know the people listen to show don't think this way like we're all out here in the real world and think of thinking of yourself as so important that you are literally not even okay with but pleased with excited about cheating an election or interfering with democracy because you think your way is better and you think that's the way it should be and you don't give a fuck what the majority of the Americans want it's about you and what you want think of that level of yes and that is what we're dealing with we're dealing with a very small minority of people who have no problem lying cheating stealing committing crimes committing fraud committing you know instigating issues to get their way and it disturbs all of our peace it disturbs all of our ability to make a living it disturbs it takes all of our time these last four or five years guess what we're not getting a refund on those and our entire society has been flipped upside down the social dynamic has been tarnished and in some cases maybe ruined for a long time until people can come together and realize that they're on the same team so what these people have done is more than just steal some money or get in the way of an election they've actually stolen our lives for the last four and a half years all right and that's what we're dealing with these people will never stop until they are stopped they won't they won't relent they won't they're evil they are remorse no they do not want you here they do not want to share this with you they do not want you as an American to have anything dude your ship belongs to them and fuck you and that's their attitude and until people really understand because most people have a good heart and most people are say hey hey I can I can actually you know what the truth is you know you drive the rounds those little stickers say coexist those motherfuckers don't want to coexist with anybody okay we're the ones that actually are willing to coexist and our ability and our want for ourselves which is to be left alone and to not bothered has led to a level of tolerance that has ruined the country all right these people will not leave you alone they don't believe in what they say they don't believe in tolerance they don't believe in coexisting because if they did they wouldn't be jamming all the shit down our fucking throats at every turn so people of America need to really understand that you are not dealing with reasonable people just because you are a reasonable person these people want what you have they want you to not exist they do not want you to have anything they want to make your life hard they do not want to be like you they despise you they look at you and they say look at those peasants look at those deplorables that's what they think and that's the that's what we're dealing with here we're dealing with people who are born into power and money who believe they hold elite status over the rest of us and until we come to realize that that's who we're dealing with and that they don't think like us and they don't believe like us and we have to stand up for ourselves nothing's going to change so that has to happen guys and like dude I'm not saying go out and like you know I'm not saying this is a five defcon five or all to actually read alert I'm not saying you got to go get your guns right now but I'm saying you should be prepared and at the very least right now you should be standing up and speaking the truth and calling this bullshit out saying we're not going to fucking tolerate it and joining in in the verbal narrative and then in the engagement of getting engaged in your in your local community the schools the the commerce the things that are going on politically in your community those are the things that you can handle none of us can change the world but we can change what's going on right around us and that's what has to happen you know you know like I mean like here's my thing like the community of folding you know and like and I and I think about this hindsight right like I get it because they got everybody I'm sure down there to you know hate the orange man orange man bad right but like okay but like how much is hating him worth it right because so far they've spent probably a few million dollars of your taxpayer dollars to do all of this shit and there's zero remorse fan he is is taking the dude that she's still near money with and taking vacations with it yeah these people are criminals you know what I'm saying so it's like it's like a folding county where you guys at when you where I think I think this is why we're seeing such a mass exodus from the Democrat party you know at least temporarily from the black community you know it's happening at scale now like by the time the election comes around dude I have a feeling that most of black America is going to be on the side of Trump when you start to see Snoop Dogg and you start to see these cultural influencers start to come out and say this publicly things are changing and we're seeing it in the streets we're seeing it in the on street interviews and the Democrats are terrified by this and they're trying to guilt and shame and you know do the same thing they've done to everybody else to the black community now right and the black community is not having it they're like yeah bro that ain't gonna work on us fuck you and which is a beautiful thing because it's really cool to see people start to realize that what's actually happening I think we're at a point in time where the harder they push the more people are gonna wake up and I don't think they know how to I don't think they I strategically I think they're all in I don't think there is a backup yeah I don't think they're able to I think they've already shown their cards too much um whether they're aware of it or not but I feel like any backing up just like you know Biden's fake border deal and all the shit I think people are seeing it like people people are like bro that's bullshit you're not really fixing and I think these people are still treating people like they've got them gaslit and they've got them fooled they don't have them fooled so people are seeing what's up and the harder they push the more people are gonna wake up and this woman here Fanny Willis bro she's piece of shit she belongs to fucking jail you know for a long time because what's happening here is wrongful prosecution it happened to New York I truly dude and this is just real shit I hope that when the when I don't even want to say what I hope happens but you can guess these people deserve to be punished publicly and dealt with permanently so that people know not to fuck with our fucking system like this you guys tell us what you guys think jump in on this conversation down in the comments let us know I would that being said let's head to hell on number three from the woman that brought you the one of the probably you know the biggest prosecutorial misconduct cases you just referenced her in New York she's back in action who's us that about Latisha oh really yeah guess what her next case is what hello reads New York attorney general sues world's largest beef producer over methane emissions and climate commitments yeah these people want to kill you dude she's being paid millions of dollars I guarantee it on the backside by these big companies like fucking Bill Gates owns shit to push these cases through and I fuck these people isn't that funny but like all the crime that you got going on in New York City all the migrant issues and the invading issues that you got going on you go from Donald Trump to now attacking beef and that weird I'm in that weird it sound weird these people are total communist bro and just like we had when we had Curtis Bowers on the show we talked about how they're using the climate initiative to push communism into reality and this is what's happening and this is another example of that yeah that happened to this so New York attorney general Latisha James is suing JBS the world's largest producer of beef over the company's emissions and for quote green washing by allegedly misleading the public about its environmental impact and an announcement James noted that beef production has the largest greenhouse gas footprint of any major food commodity and their animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions according to James JBS USA's various net zero pledges for 2030 and 2040 are therefore misleading and not quote feasible given the scope of its worldwide beef production operations quote as families continue to face the daily impacts of the climate crisis they are willing to spend more of their hard earned money on products from brands that are better for the environment. No they're not that's why those brands are going on a business and that's why you're trying to force them down people's strokes. Nobody's nobody is willing to do this at all that's why you're doing this. James said in a statement quote when companies falsely advertise their commitments to sustainability they're misleading consumers and endangering our planet quote JBS USA's green washing exploits the pocketbooks of everyday Americans and the promise of a healthy planet for future generations she added quote my office will always ensure that companies do not abuse the environment and the trust of hardworking consumers for profit. The lawsuit was applauded by state Democrats of course and national climate advocacy organizations like earth justice mighty earth friends of the earth US and citizens campaigned for the environment and stand that earth quote JBS repeatedly claims that it will reach net zero by 2040 this claim was found to be misleading and yet JBS continues to assert it said Peter learner an attorney at earth justice quote while it is critical for every company to reduce its climate change impact JBS would need to implement enormous operational changes to achieve this goal however JBS is doing very little and is not taking anywhere close to the steps that it would be required. So so they're saying that we're going to do something in the future we're going to do something about 2040 by 2030 then 2040 and they're being sued because she believes that it's not possible to do and they're not moving fast enough okay well that's ridiculous that's fucking ridiculous I mean I'm not shocked this bitch crazy no she's not she's doing exactly what the plan is she's a soldier of the plan she's not crazy at all she is being promised a good outcome for her in exchange for these actions that she's taking and she is willing to take those actions for that outcome that she is too stupid to understand will never occur for her because she is what's called a useful idiot all right and a useful idiot is someone who the communist use to push the initiative into play which we've talked about many times over the course of the years here when we talk about communism and then after they take power and they're in control of everything these people come back and they say where's my prize and their prizes face the fucking wall and they shoot them in the back of the head that's what they do and so your dumbest fuck you're playing right into their hands and it's your ego blinding you not being able to realize that you're a pun in their game and you will not be at the sitting at the table like they've promised you they do not intend for you or any of these useful idiots or propagators or pushers of their agenda to sit at the table with them you are a fucking clown by definition the tisha you are a clown because you cannot recognize that you are being used yourself do they imagine what like what's going to be the impact I mean obviously they're trying to push in the insects and the crickets and all of that stuff right like I mean that's real thing all the bio milk and all of that shit right and nobody's buying it nobody's buying it right but so so okay if nobody's buying it okay well let's just sue the world's largest beef producer yes and all of the you know trickle down effects that that's going to have and all the other resources and systems and producers that are in place that are affected well if we're being real that's you got you guys who make that beef that's what you get for pandering let's be you shouldn't ever get okay look I'm gonna be real is what she's doing fucked up yeah but what they're doing is fucked up too because you're not telling the truth and the truth is this fucking animals have been here for millions of fucking years bro and they haven't hurt the environment okay what's the next thing we're gonna eliminate all the people oh they're already talking about that and have been talking about that for years they've been talking about taking the earth's population from eight billion people to 500 million it was on the Georgia guide stones all these people in the world economic forum talk about it openly and you're too busy scrolling through the fucking Graham to take it serious these people intend to do this okay first it's going to be the livestock and then it's going to be you because their intent is to starve you this is what communist do have you ever read the red famine oh no you haven't you don't know shit that's the real thing most people are totally clueless as to what this is all about go back and listen to the podcast that we did with Curtis Bowers a man who is very intelligent and has spent his entire life studying communism what episode is that while we're five ninety two five ninety two go back and listen to that and understand what what is going on here we are in the midst of a communist revolution these people are trying to fucking remove you from the planet that's what's happening here by many different means okay and real talk the beef company you should just say hey real beef it's the best for you don't believe this bullshit because that's the truth and you know what that's a good marketing campaign for you that direct and real talk I just throw that shit on the fucking label myself they're my company and it worked because it's me but the thing is is that they should take the stance of hey don't eat this engineered fucking bullshit because you know it's fucking bad for people so take that stance if you're marketing real food for real people how about that with your beef stop trying to panor to fucking vegans who aren't even beef anyway all right like that's what you get for fucking around if I'm being honest you're pandering a message that isn't even true so never play your game about twenty forty four yeah stop playing the fucking game and start saying fuck you no that's just yeah yeah fucking environment that bitch don't give two fucks about the environment and here's any of these other people that say they do you're not fucking flying around a private jet she's vegetarian is she I don't know oh if she was she eats a lot of vegetables yeah you can eat that many vegetables she's a fucking idiot oh man at this point in time like if you truly believe in all this shit dude like you're you're really in a dangerous spot that's the truth yeah yeah like if you believe in any of the climate change it you believe in yeah yeah it's dangerous yeah it's very dangerous none of it's true you don't look into it and you're willing to argue to the death about it like think about that that's on some shit that you ain't even really even looked at they don't even really know about it no no now bro guys that's what you guys think jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think on that topic

carrying a risk of time in jail or intensive care the games kicked off Saturday with the star-spangled banner played on electric guitar the spectators sipped sipping canned beers behind metal barricades cheered and frequently shouted expletives as a dozen teams battled in contest inspired by relevance from America's most surreal state what expletives did they cheer yeah I don't know
