year so it's kind of new for us but anyway that's kind of the rundown on the show guys we have this thing that we call the fee something you'll notice about our show that you will not notice on most other shows is that we don't run ads and the reason I don't run ads is because I do not want to answer to someone who is running ads about the things that I say I want to be free and open to talk about things from my perspective the way that I feel they need to be talked about and so in exchange for that I just ask that you guys share the show and help us grow the show you know I get messages every day from you guys and I love you guys who share the show but I get messages every day you know about how everybody should be listening and these messages needs to get out well that's why I need you to share the show so don't be a hoe share the show all right what's up man how you doing good yeah see you got a box of clean acts over there yeah a little personal time for a show yeah that's what I got them all sticking under the ass now man you know I don't know if it's just like time of year I very rarely get like sick so I know it's not that I'm not contagious and I know different colors not everything I think it's just like a like allergies yeah our temperatures are weird right now yeah like we're going between hot and that's a hot like you'll leave the house and like this is that weird time where you like leaving the morning wearing like a full parka yeah you come home and fucking you know swim trunks yeah you know I'm saying like that's this time of year and then by the time it's dark it's full park again that's what I'm saying but like I love it though you know some people don't get the season the season change you know like if you live in like Florida or California or even like South Texas you know you get a lot of the same I like that we get the season change for sure I mean because like all the crackheads have to adapt yeah that's what you know I'm saying I know I was gonna say it's just because I like the variety of weather I mean I guess that's a bonus too no no it's cool to see them like you know have to change up the gameplay and the shit you know oh man it's cool though man it's a good day you know some will call her a good day I say it's a good day because you know this is one of the days I feel like that we were really able to see what America was about you know I'm saying and so it's obvious topic now it's September 12th when the shows record aired but today's a history of anniversary of 9-11 you know I'm saying and I think this was historically one of the first times that we got to you know have a common enemy or at least what they gave us right was well in our lifetimes yeah right you know and and just seeing like how America united during that time yeah even for me as young as I was during the time I remember that I'm like man this is pretty cool you know where nobody cared about your race or you know you know what religion you were like we all had a common enemy to face you know yeah I thought that was pretty cool but um there's of course you gotta leave it to get old Joe Biden to fuck it up so I don't know if you see this so so apparently like you know every single president since 9-11 happened they they go to one of those memorial sites they go to ground zero they go to the Pentagon um isn't he in Alaska or something yeah and he's in Alaska um he just came back from a trip but um he's taking all type of heat um within reason um you know but apparently he just sent Comma over there uh and she's at the Pentagon or no she's at ground zero he's in Alaska um got anything on this I mean look I I the vibe around 9-11 you know when 9-11 happened I was 21 years old um I was on my way to school uh well I had school that day and I remember I woke up and we had an answer machine you know I don't a lot of you guys don't even know what that is what's up yeah so you know my phone rang and it was my mom and I was still in bed and I could hear her talking on the answer machine and I heard her like say something like you need to turn on the TV a plane just flew into the world trade center and I thought like like a little plane um I thought like a sezna or something like that you know what I mean yeah and so I did get up and I went and clicked on the TV and and not even like a minute later the second plane like came into the frame and I saw the whole thing happen like a long live TV and you know I I mean I it was it was like surreal it was surreal that it was happening like I remember watching it being like holy shit like what the fuck is going on I think most America felt that way yeah um and it was such a symbolic like in your face active aggression right and everybody united you know everybody the streets were lying it didn't matter you know if you were democratic republican it didn't matter if you were black or white didn't matter where you came from the american flag was everywhere everybody was united and you're correct in that assessment the problem with it is and you know there's like a there's there's we have to talk about the reality of it you know thousands upon thousands upon thousands of innocent Americans died that day but there's all kinds of things about 9-11 that never added up and that never came to the surface and that never came to reality and it when people first started you know so for the first three or four years after 9-11 everybody was united everybody was like yeah let's get the terrorists you know which was basically made out to be anybody that was Arab which was wrong and Americans bought a hook line and sinker and through the the manipulation of the pain and the frustration that we had as Americans they changed a lot of things about America you know they introduced the Patriot Act they introduced TSA they started doing all kinds of different things that weren't in the interests of American people under the name of fighting terrorism and of course you know they went to war and killed millions of people in the middle east that were innocent and had nothing to do with what was going on and so the narrative is really changed and I think you know on on 9-11 if you look at the internet it's it's very polarizing you know you see people who say never forget and you know they get insulted when you point out some of the the quote unquote conspiracy elements about it you know like Donald Rumsfeld saying the day before 9-11 on 9-10 2001 that the Pentagon couldn't find three trillion dollars right yeah like the only office that had the records of that crumbled yeah right or or the insurance policy that was taken out on the towers you know previously that year that paid the insurance beneficiary for plus billion dollars right like we have these these things that all point to it being an orchestrated tragedy to unite Americans in order to produce the war in order to benefit these politicians and these very evil corrupt elite people that we talk about every single day on the show and it wasn't really until COVID happened when enough people saw how that because I was very sloppy how they did that like yes people bought it but there was a big number of people that didn't buy it and that wasn't the case at 9-11 everybody and when 9-11 happened like was like holy shit we all we all bought it yeah and when 20 when when COVID happened not everybody bought it and it opened up the narrative for people who had doubts about 9-11 to kind of explore those doubts and look into it and now we have what I think I don't think it's mainstream but I think it's getting to be mainstream where a lot of people realize that 9-11 was conducted heavily by our own three-letter agencies for a certain specific purpose and then we start throwing in the idea of how the CIA allegedly executed Kennedy and like all these things and it opens up a lot you know if we want to talk about the real terrorism that's the terrorism you know that's the terrorism it's funny how you know Middle Easterners were painted as terrorists for so many years in this country and you don't hear anything about it anymore like they're not worried about all these western African or Middle Eastern or third world country citizens coming across the border not saying a word about it where 10 years ago would have been like man they're going to suicide vest everybody and riled everybody up and I really think that what this this you know from my perspective you know and I have a different perspective because I'm old enough to witness both these events it's very interesting how they manipulated the country into believing certain things and how easy it is to believe or manipulate people into believing certain things you know I was one of those people who bought the Middle Middle Easterners and Arabs are terrorists for many years you know like my position back then was very much so like let's just fucking wipe them a fuck out yeah and like bro that's very I mean I'm embarrassed to admit that now because I have so many friends that I've met from that area of the world who are great people who who who who have basically the same values that I have and they happen to be Muslim you know I happen to be a Christian and you know what I'm saying like these are good people and we've been manipulated so heavily in so many different ways and it's just interesting to look at nine look at how the narrative has changed on 9-11 on social media over the years because now it's like this argument about like who did it what was involved and then you still have people who say you guys are crazy but dude it look man it's undeniable there's ev it there's tons and tons of evidence here and I think the best thing that's happening because of all of this is that people are legitimately asking questions about everything now you know there are these people's ability these corrupt three-letter people you know I'm not saying the whole agencies are all corrupt but I mean a lot of it is more than one person let's be real yeah um these people are orchestrating tragedies in the world that are unnecessary and the only benefit certain classes of people when that's not the natural state of humanity the natural state of humanity is peace and harmony and goodwill and we we continue to have the jar shaken for the benefit of a very very wealthy very very few in number segment of the population and uh you know every time this this this anniversary comes around I think more and more people are waking up to what's actually going on because it's it's running congruent with some of the fuckery that they're playing right now you know yeah yeah I had a back and forth with a lefty on Instagram think uh last night you know but they were saying like you know all these conspiracy theories like you know we should just leave leave those people alone you know like it doesn't do them any justice and I'm like you know well here's the thing if there's a possibility right that that thing was that 9-11 was orchestrated that it was um a involved you know plot that led to the justification of a 20 year plus war the led to the justification of you know thousands of American soldiers dying right a mass a whole generation of you know patriotic fighters dying right if there's a possibility that these conspiracy theories are true does it not do justice to everybody that you have lost their lives or loved ones does it not do justice to them to get to the bottom of it to get to the truth of it like what justice you can't have justice without truth right that's the whole point you know a lot of people want to sweep this under the rug because they want to you know just look away you know it's like when you have a big problem in your life and you decide to like look the other way the problem doesn't go away it's bigger it gets worse it gets more powerful and it takes more from you and that's a big problem for a lot of people because it's such an uncomfortable thing to look at and say could people really be that evil yeah well I mean look at what they've done over the last three years I mean most of you guys listening even if you disagree with let's say 60 to 70% of what I say you understand that there's still a ton of truth to the fact that what just happened over the last three years was engineered to happen I think that's why they're so there's there's that's why they're so afraid of it is because they probably believe that it's true they're just they're so afraid of accepting that and that being the actual truth I you know I'm saying one thing I do want to show real quick that that I thought was interesting was this headline from newsweek China mox us on 9-11 anniversary with cartoon so the Chinese state media which is a state you know all their media is ran ran by the state right they released this editorial cartoon and dude has shook me right initially I'm like man you know what fuck China but then you really start looking at it and what it is for those that are audio right now it's it's a it has the statute of liberty issues holding a piece of paper that says 22 years after 9-11 and the behind her is essentially the the the the broken places of like Iraq or Afghanistan right with bullets flying overhead Malatav cocktails are you sure that's supposed to be the Middle East or Afghanistan that certainly looks like some of our cities right now yeah thanks you know are you sure that's not them showing the state of America right now with the bullets flying back and forth and the Malatav cocktails and the burnt buildings because that looks like a lot of what typically from the outside most people would look at and say the prestigious cities of America New York City Los Angeles Chicago that's what they look like yeah yeah yeah I mean that's definitely a take on if you're sure that's what I thought when I first saw yeah like I don't like you know they try to spin the whole of the market like I mean is that a mock or is that a true depiction of where we are right now I would say if you consider that the background is our own cities I would say that's pretty accurate yeah yeah I just thought it was interesting man any any words on President Machia should just be in the palace because I don't believe that he cares at all I believe his I these things don't bother me anymore like when he walks out of the Medal of Honor ceremony or he says something or he does something that is inflammatory I don't get riled up because I understand what the man's purpose is yeah the man's purpose is to come in and just deconstruct America step by step by step and do everything in hand to make America worse and then for us to blame it on him being seen aisle and old and not knowing what's going on and like I'm not going to buy into that like by me saying oh I can't believe he walked out of the Medal of Honor ceremony or I can't believe that he didn't go to 9-11 like I can't believe he shut down the strategic oil reserves in Alaska I can't believe he stopped the pipeline I can't believe he's letting crime go on like this in the cities I can't believe he's letting the border stay open I can't believe I can't believe I can't believe it because I understand his role and what his purpose is in this and I fully believe that I fully believe this man is completely compromised and his role is to go in deconstruct America and do all the dirty work because if you imagine let's just say and I'm not a fan of Gavin Newsom all right I don't think most of you listening are well let's just say but we can agree that the man is competent in terms of his ability to communicate he is not brain dead he's he's he's a strategic thinker he's capable he can have a conversation if they had a man like Gavin Newsom doing these same things that Joe Biden is doing it would be undeniably obvious to people that he's doing it on purpose and that would cause a revolt and so what's actually happening here is we have a fall guy in the White House that they are portraying to be senile and stupid and old and decrepit and shitting his pants so that we'll all just say oh it's just old Joe Biden doing dumb shit instead of recognizing what it actually is which is an intentional demoralization de-stabilization of the greatest country that's ever existed yeah that's real shit man I think I think we're starting to give him way too much that's my shot I'm just saying I think in general they're starting to get them give him way too much attention you know I'm saying especially for something like this like listen that's what he's supposed to be doing again that's focused on what we should be focusing on which is is honoring and remembering those following the diet yeah and I also think that by you pointing out the truth about what actually happened that's actually the best way to honor these people like there's no there's no honor in lying about what actually happened to these people are pretending that it didn't happen you know that's just because it's uncomfortable to talk about doesn't mean that we more and less the innocent lives that we're taking but I think it's a reality that we should also consider the one and a half million innocent people that were killed all the way across the globe you know it's interesting how people have these big bleeding hearts for all these people coming across the border when they're coming across our border but when they're over there in Iraq or they're in Afghanistan fucking kill them yeah I know it's dude like the hypocrisy there doesn't align yeah we'd rather have those uncomfortable yeah know what's uncomfortable to talk about syphilis you know what's not uncomfortable to talk about the truth is about thousands of Americans losing it shouldn't be you know I'm saying that's how I look at it yeah how do you know that syphilis is uncomfortable I don't know I just imagine that that would be a really you're a friend or something yeah I'm no no no yeah I just oh you got personal experience oh that's the clean access or four I just feel like it would be uncomfortable to talk about you're just guessing yeah I got you yeah it's so yeah hypothetically speaking hi hypothetical guess okay yeah you pretty uncomfortable yeah guys in this CTI man so let's get this cruise uh go and remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you can find them there you can also check down on YouTube in our description below and find the links uh link there as well all right so that being said let's get it right into it our first headline headline number one headline number one reads liberals turn on new Mexico governor over gun suspension quote violates the US Constitution uh this is a very interesting development out of new Mexico so uh let's let's dive into this so democratic new Mexico governor Michelle LeWine Grisham is coming under fire for members of her own party after temporarily suspending open and concealed carry across albuquerque under an emergency health order quote I support gun safety laws however this order from the governor of new Mexico violates the US Constitution no state in the union can suspend the federal constitution there is no such thing as a public health emergency exception uh to the United States Constitution California Democratic representative Ted Lu which that was definitely a shot out of the left field very uh not expected from that guy um I think we've we posted a few of his tweets online that guy has something else but it's interesting to see him stand up on this matter um and I'm happy to see it so um Lahan Grisham suspended temporarily suspended open and concealed carry laws and Bernalillo County for at least 30 days starting September 8th the announcement was spurred by the fatal shooting of young children including a 13 year old girl in july a five year old girl in august and 11 year old boy this month uh quote as I said yesterday the time for standard measures has passed the governor said according to her office this press released on the order quote and when new Mexicans are afraid to be in crowds to take their kids to school to leave a baseball game with their very right to exist is threatened by the prospect of violence at every turn something is wrong now uh even david hog jumped in on this conversation which I thought was again I mean it's kind of it's kind of scared me almost that there's so much pushback from this side like I don't know you know but but this is what he tweeted out um this was a response our passing uh this uh state of emergency that she declared um he tweeted out saying uh quote I support gun safety but there is no such thing as a state public health emergency exception to the US Constitution uh Stephen Crowder even jumped in saying uh quote what uh saying quote wait did I just agree with david hog um there's Ted lose original uh tweet there now she responded to Ted loot okay this was her tyrannical response that she had to say she's tweeted out saying uh quote hey Ted conceal and open carry our state laws that I have jurisdiction over if you're really interested in helping curb gun violence I'd welcome you to join our next police academy class um and that came uh before she oh yeah I say you got them yeah two back there already defunded yeah fucking dumbass she's getting sued national association for gun rights sues over new Mexico governors can still carry band um so that's going down uh but here's the thing it's not just happening uh what we're seeing this more on the local levels right so this is not just the state so this is a state example right but we actually got it going on here in our own backyard uh St. Louis city mayor uh St. Louis mayor wants to ban AR 15s AK 47s on city streets uh putting out a bill uh for local ban um saying the legislation would be designed to prohibit military grade weapons on city streets prevent the transfer or sale of guns to minors take action on military grade guns and similar untraceable for arms listen we can't get military grade guns anyway people understand that it's already yeah that's already if we could I'd have some when I hear somebody say that that's just shows me that they have no idea what the fuck they're talking you mean like the the 40 the 40 round magazine clip yeah the first guy might yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah all our 40 rounds in two seconds and point five seconds yep 40 rounds and one second it's like that uh that uh that's Simpson picture of the revolver with the glaucoma magazine yeah you know saying like these people just don't get it no they don't know what the fuck they're talking about which disc credits are argument completely anybody that does you know so what we what we said and so I was looting too I feel like you know it's it's interesting that all of these typical leftists are jumping in on this issue to to you know to kind of hit on her on this what is there something deeper here bro I don't know if it feels the same because I feel the same as one trying to say weird yeah so if you notice the david hog and the the luch wheat and then like a whole bunch of other tweets from other of these radical leftists don't have been almost verbatim yeah almost like you know uh the winter of death you know almost like don't kill your grandma almost like medicine yeah huh horse medicine yeah almost like that it's almost like there's a back channel that all these people get information about what to say and how to say it you know like you see that clip where all the newscasters are saying the exact same thing that clip is so scary yeah here it is right here yeah I am Foxin and Tonyo's Jessica headly and I'm Ryan wolf our greatest responsibility is to serve our treasure valley communities deal pass a lustruous communities eastern I with communities mid-missing communities we are extremely proud of the quality balance journalism that cbs4 news produces but we're not concerned about the trouble of training there's also one side of news stories playing our country plaguing our country the sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media moral arming some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first the sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media more alarming some media have been published on the state of foreign history without checking facts first unfortunately some members of the media have their platforms to push their own first Prime genere controlled zoofold the streets and this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is Is Extremely Dangerous To Our Democracy. This Is Extremely Dangerous To Our Democracy. This Is Extremely Dangerous To Our Democracy. This Is Extremely Dangerous To Our Democracy. This Is Extremely Dangerous To Our Democracy. This Is Extremely Dangerous To Our Democracy. This Is Extremely Dangerous To Our Democracy. This Is Extremely Dangerous To Our Democracy. This Is Extremely Dangerous To Our Democracy. This Is Extremely Dangerous To Our Democracy . Alright so like bro come on now. So, so when we look at that clip, that's what these people are doing in a different way. We're just not privy to the communication on the back end that they're all getting. And for my, my read on this, what was a temperature check? You know, these people like to check the temperature of society on what's actually going on. And I think this woman was tasked, meaning the governor of New Mexico was tasked to try this in a state. And if we're just being honest, bro, everybody forgets about New Mexico. Like no one, no one's moving there. No one talks about it. There's nothing going on there. No, being real. Yeah, I'm not trying to be disrespectful. It's a new Mexico. Albuquerque. But like I'm just saying, like, you know, uh, bugs, bunny and the fucking road, you know, the road runner and yeah, right. Like they're all there, you know, but like the point is is that there's not a whole lot going on there that people really talk about in mainstream very often. So if you were going to temperature check, what better place to temperature check? Because dude, there's like 10 Republicans in the whole state, right? It's all Democrats. So in my opinion, how I see this and how my brain works is it feels like she's trying to run a temperature check or she was tasked with running a temperature check. And the backlash was so immediate and so harsh that they panicked, meaning the leftist and people who are all organized together, panicked. And they all retracted it once to make it seem like this is not what they're trying to do because this would have severe political and societal implications. If people really thought that this was going to be the next step, like if people really thought that they're going to come for the guns and ban guns like bro, we'd have an uprising of violence. And I think they sense that immediately because even with how blue and how left New Mexico happens to be, there was still a massive resistance immediately by the people. Good work, by the way, to resist this. And I think they saw that. I think they issued a statement right away. It's a whoa, whoa, whoa, you know, not all of us, right? And I think this was just a big temperature check. And that's how I see it. So I do think there's more to it. Yeah, it's like, it's just weird. And it is verbatim. Yeah, it is verbatim. Look, we have to stop viewing things at surface level. And we have to start looking at them 10,000 foot view because this is a coordinated effort amongst a whole lot of people to accomplish certain things in our country. And they're all working together. So there's, there's Twitter files and Facebook files and all these, these all prove how these coordinated communications have started to happen. And apparently there's still other ways that this is happening. So, you know, I'm not sure, but like their statements are almost identical. Yeah, right. And that's not an accident. And it's not just one person copying, lose tweet. And then the next person copying their tweet, they're all saying the almost the exact verbatim same shit. And this happens on mainstream media. We've all sought through COVID, you know, they all use the same phrases, the same wording over and over and over again about all different things. And this is no different than that. It's just, you know, I think they push a little bit. They got immediate resistance. They panic. They thought that it would cost them a whole lot of shit because here's the reality where they're really going to fuck themselves in the election is in the Senate and the house. All right. If people on the local level vote, all of the blue people out of the Senate and the house, which, you know, there's a high likelihood of happening. It's possible. Yeah. They lose all their power. So they can't just worry about the presidential election. They also have to worry about those elections. And so I think this spooked them. I think they got scared and I think they backpedaled immediately because we can all admit that this is out of character with David Hogg's natural opinions on anything. Right. Like all these people are anti-gun to the max. They don't give a fuck about the Constitution and anything that they do to pretend like they care about the Constitution is only to protect their ass so they continue to push the Constitution out of the picture. Yeah. But what if it's a play for them to like, you know, make them, you know, have an amendment to the Constitution because they're all setting it up like, oh, we have to respect the Constitution. Have to respect the Constitution. What if they're like pushing that to make an amendment to the Constitution that would then? Yeah, I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't think that's a fetch. I don't think that. Yeah. I do like what Elon Musk had to say on this topic. Elon Musk reacted by asking how soon she can be removed from office must put out a tweet on X, which said, quote, at risk of stating what should be obvious deliberately violating the Constitution is next level legal. How soon can this person be removed from office? I just thought that was great. Well, in about five minutes with a whole bunch of people guns. No shit. No shit, man. Yeah. Moving on this conversation, let us know what you guys think. hashtag and fringe on these down in the comments, guys. Let us know what you guys think on that topic. But before we get to our second headline, as always, let's cruise some comments. Sweet. Yeah, let's cruise some comments. I got a good one for you. This comment, I believe this, this was not a CTI comment. This is from YouTube, but I don't know CTI. So this cruise the comment section brought by at Claire. Claire Sylvie. She says watching Andy practice saying no, so funny, also 100% accurate. I think so that's a reference that was episode 571. No. Right. Yeah. That's from our Q&A that just posted yesterday. So you guys haven't seen that go check that out. Yeah. I think that was actually one of my favorite parts of the show too. Yeah, I'm pretty charming and funny. I mean, I don't blame you guys. Yeah, well, I mean, I was talking about more like the actual, like, you know, the ability to say no in real life though. Like, that's important, man. Yeah. And people have a problem with it. You know, we live in such a soft society where people want to carry the weight of other people's reactions. When in reality, the responsibility for someone's reaction to you saying no is not your responsibility to carry, right? They have to. There's a boundary there, right? And a lot of people avoid saying no because they don't want the person to be a upset or to think a certain way about them. When in reality, that's not something that you should really concern yourself with. If you want to live a happy, healthy, productive, stress-free life, it gets pretty heavy carrying the response of everything that you communicate to someone else that happens to be your position or your thoughts or your feelings, carrying the reaction of those things. That's a heavy thing to carry. And I think a lot of people suffer from a lot of anxiety by not understanding that when you say no, that's perfectly acceptable and how they react is something for them to carry enough for you to carry. Crazy. It's hypothetical reaction. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? Because like what you think they're going to react, that's not always typically how they react. Yeah. Most people just, you know, they create the worst case scenario in response in their head. And that creates a situation where they avoid having the conversation altogether. And communicating effectively clearly is literally the first skill you need to be successful in anything in life. And when you observe how people try to hesitate or run away from conflict or move away from conflict or move away from tough conversations, it's really no surprise as to why they don't really move anywhere in life because it's impossible to get any better or make any progress without a real conversation or real answers. Yes, no, maybe so. You know what I'm saying? No, absolutely, man. Absolutely. Guys, you guys should go check that episode out. That was the most recent Q&A episode, 571. Shout out to Claire. Appreciate that catch. I like those Q&As. Yeah. Yeah, I like those. So go check them out. Guys, again, we want to say thank you to all of our real ass fans for not being host and sharing the show. So let's get back into it. Got headline number two. Hell, I know, but two reads, Blinken refuses to criticize Musk who says he did not Ukraine's request to use Starlink for Russian attack. Now this one is very, very interesting, man, because it came out right before the weekend and it kind of got swept under the rug, bro. Like nobody really talked about how big of a deal that this actually actually was. So let's dive into this for those of you guys that have missed it. So Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, twice declined to criticize you on Musk after the Spakes ex founder said he refused to help the Ukrainian government access his Starlink Internet service in order to attack Russia. Blinken was pressed by CNN's Jake Tapper to comment on details in a new book confirmed by Musk, including that he refused the Ukrainian government's request to activate Starlink, a satellite internet service run by SpaceX and Crimea. So it could launch a submarine drone attack against Russian naval forces. This was Elon's tweet in response to the book being released in response to this whole conversation. This is the tweet, the initial tweet that went out. Okay. This came out on September 7, 2023. Elon says quote, there was an emergency request from government authorities to activate Starlink all the way to Sevtsyapool. The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor. If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation. So Tapper asked Blinken whether Musk should face repercussions after he quote effectively sabotaged a military operation by Ukraine, a US ally against Russia and aggressor country that invaded a US ally. Quote, Jake, I can't speak to a specific episode. Here's what I can tell you. Starlink has been a vital tool for the Ukrainians to be able to communicate with each other and particularly for the military to communicate in their effort to defend all of Ukraine's territory. Quote, I don't know that you can't speak to it. You won't speak to it, Tapper fired back. Musk says he was reportedly afraid that Russia would retaliate with nuclear weapons. Musk says that's based on his private discussions he had with senior Russian officials. Are you concerned that Musk is apparently conducting his own diplomatic outreach to the Russian government? Really? None of this concerns you? Quote, Jake, I can't speak to conversations that may or may not have happened. I don't know. Blinken responded. Quote, I'm focused on the fact that the technology itself, Starlink, has been really important for Ukrainians. It remains so. And Jaybrit, Tapper kept trying to go on. So Tapper argued it says, Quote, it sounds like Starlink's so important the US government doesn't want to risk offending a capricious billionaire who did some things that I think in another situation the US government might want to say something about. But let's move on. That's not what it is. It's not what it is at all. No. In fact, he's saving all assets. That's not even it. That's not why, listen, yes, yes. You know what I'm saying? No, no, no, I agree with you. Yes, that's what's happening. But that's what Tapper is saying is not why they're not attacking him. Tapper is saying that they're not attacking him because they don't want to offend him. That's not why. They want to continue to use Starlink. They know that Elon will just shut the shit off. Right. And that'll be dead in the water. So it's not about offending. It's about actually still being able to push the situation the way that they want it to go. They're actually, those two actually want the same thing. One guy knows something. The other guy doesn't realize yet. That's what's happening. Yeah. Tapper's not, he's not smart. Okay. Not a very smart guy. But yeah, so the article continues. It says, must tweet last week came amid backlash over an excerpt from Walter Isaacson's new biography, Elon Musk, that was published in Washington Post. Isaacson claimed in that excerpt that Musk had Starlink's connection in Crimea shut off. The Musk said there was never Starlink coverage in Crimea. There never was. Isaacson then had to post a clarification on Friday writing, quote, to clarify on the Starlink issue, the Ukrainian's thought coverage was enabled all the way to Crimea, but it was not. The Musk asked Musk to enable it for their drone subattack on the Russian fleet. Musk did not enable it because he thought probably correctly that it would cause a major war. Then Musk responded to that, saying much appreciated Walter. The honest is meaningfully different. If I refuse to act upon a request from Ukraine versus made a deliberate change to Starlink to thwart Ukraine, at no point did I or anyone at SpaceX promise coverage over Crimea. Moreover, our terms of service clearly prohibit Starlink for offensive military action as we are a civilian system so they were again asking for something that was expressly prohibited. Now here's where it gets weird. SpaceX is building Starsheel for the US government, which is similar to but much smaller than Starlink as it will not have to handle millions of users. That system will be owned and controlled by the US government. Although I get that wish eventually is what it sounds like. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe if they don't press on them like Tapper wants them to do. Maybe it's the fact that what's his face blinking actually understands that Elon might say that's Starshield thing that we were working on. We're not doing that anymore because you guys tried to abuse this other thing. That's why we can't comment on it. That's right. That makes perfect sense. That's why people tend to forget bro with this stuff. These are nothing more with massive games of chess, like three dimensional fucking chess. And most people kind of play or are still playing checkers. That's the biggest problem. This is fucking chess. It's not that most people are playing checkers bro. It's that most people in our country are so fucking oppressed and so busy and working so hard to try and survive and get by and take care of their family that they can't follow what's actually going on. And that's the big problem. It's not that people don't care. It's not that we don't have a patriotic country. It's that these tyrants have made society so uncomfortable for a large percentage of the population intentionally so that those people will be distracted and not be able to really follow the narrative of what's actually going on. And so that's what we're dealing with. We're not dealing with a bunch of weakness. We're not dealing with a bunch of people who aren't quote unquote Americans or patriots. Sure, there is a small percentage to the far left that fit into that narrative and category, but they've been trying to use social media to make us think that that's the entire country. And that's part of the demoralization process. And then part of the destabilization process is them making it so hard that you can't really follow along with what's going on or resist it because you're too busy trying to fucking survive. That's what we're dealing with. That's real shit, man. I'm just glad he didn't do it. I'm glad I'm glad I'm glad muslim do it. Yeah, I mean, you know, who knows how that would have went, bro. I think he knows how it would have went. I think that's why he didn't do it. Yeah. I mean, he was talking to those guys. He was talking to people from their government and they probably said, look, if they do this, is what we're going to do. And I'm sure they're not fucking around. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah, man. I don't know. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think. I personally think that Russia and Putin is showing incredible restraint. Oh, bro. Against retaliation efforts. They should have, they should have, they should have, they should have, they should have, they should have, they should have, they should have, they should have, they should have, they should have, they should have, they should have, they should have a new extreme pipelines. Dude, look, man, I, I don't know these guys. I don't know any, I don't, you know, we haven't been contacted. That's right. But all I can do is deduce from what I observe. And when I observe Putin, not getting more and more and more aggressive, you know, they blew up the pipeline, they blew up that bridge. They've been doing all these things to, to fuck with him. And he knows it's the United States and he knows it's NATO. And this dude can very easily retaliate with the flip of a switch against all of it once. He's got enough weapons to do that. Like it's a click and every single place where these people are could be hit. And he hasn't done that. And I think the reason he hasn't done it is because I think he's the opposite of what they tell us he is. You know, they tell us he's a criminal and he's a tyrant and he's a this, he's a that. Well, they also tell us all this other shit where the exact opposite is true. Right. You know what I'm saying? So at some point, we have to start asking ourselves, is our own government actually lying about this man because his actions and his restraints that he's showing are actually proving that he's a pretty reasonable human being, but that reasonability is going to wear out eventually. And I think that's where they're trying to push it. I think they're trying to push him to a point of instigating some sort of major attack so that they can have their war and they can disrupt the election process or whatever they're going to do. And that's the thing that it's coming because, you know, for a man like Putin who's extremely, I would call him a nationalist, right? Like, I mean, he's extremely patriotic of this country and his image and the image of Russia, two Russians are extremely important. Right. So all of this stuff has gone on the still dossier, Trump, Russia, collusion, Nord Stream pipelines, the NATO advancement, Ukraine shit going on. All of this stuff continues to go on. At some point he's going to have to defend his national image. If not for him for for for for Mother Russia, like they had to defend their image to their own citizens before he gets caught off from his citizens, right from being weak, right? Right. And so it's like the question is like, how much more can go on that scale before it tips over? That's the scary question, man. Because in my opinion, I feel like we're past a tipping point. I think the whole narrative that we've been fed about Ukraine has nothing to do with what they've told us. You know, we cover this the Friday after the the Russia, the initial Russia invasion of of Eastern Ukraine. You know, we're we got to hold that speech where Putin was talking about the bio labs and he was talking about denatsifying Western or Eastern Ukraine. And you know, what have we been told? We haven't been told anything. All we're told is this Putin's crazy and he's invading Ukraine because he wants Ukraine. And he wants to spread power across, you know, he wants to spread his empire all the way across Europe. I mean, this is the same shit that they that Hitler did. And so they're trying to paint this man to be that type of a figure. When in reality, he's not showing any of that stuff. So like it's almost like he's trying to expose who the real enemy is through restraint. Yeah. And it seems to be working because it's a pretty good job. Yeah, because a lot of people, you know, when we first said that about Ukraine, people freak to fuck out. But a lot of people have figured out like this is a huge criminal money laundering scheme that is not in the interest of anybody over here. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely man. Let us know what you guys think hashtag www.x. You get it? World War X. You see what I did there? Yeah. Good job. Guys, let's get into our third and final headline headline number three. Headline number three reads communist revolutionaries set fire to American flags and protest outside Jason Aldin show quote, we will try it right in front of your concert. Now this one was interesting. Aside from it coming out, especially on the day that we all know what this is, right? So I obviously saw this as just a ploy. But like none of it really makes sense. Let's dive into it. See where we get out of this. A communist revolutionary group burned American flags and chanted anti-US slogans during a disturbing staged protest outside of Jason Aldin concert in Chicago on Saturday night. Yes, probably the feds. Yeah. Oh shit. Around 20 communists. That's it. 20. Belonging to revolution club Chicago assembled outside credit union one amphitheater in Tilly Park shouting phrases like fuck the US and all its might as they tortured the flags according to the video shared by news to. The group was also film taking jabs at Aldin song try that in the small town labeling the Georgia born artist song quote a piece of fascist shit quote guess what Jason we will try that in the small town activist Rafael caderas. I mean Castro I mean caderas a California resident who flew out to the windy city to take part in the protest told the Chicago tribute quote we will try that in a big city and we will try that right in front of your concert. Now here's the thing. So I checked it and of course you know if you go to 18 US code 700, the creation of the flag of the United States and it's penalties and it listed out says quote whoever knowingly mutilates defaces physically defiles burns maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon any flag of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year or both. And that's exactly what they did is members of the revolution club burned or glory law enforcement quickly to send it on the protests announcing by megaphone that the group was an unlawful assembly and concert goers were quote alarmed and disturbed by their presence video shows quote you are disturbing the public peace without the authority of law a tindley park police officer told the group through a bullhorn over the chance quote we are ordering you to immediately disperse failure to comply can result in chemical or less lethal conditions being deployed the officer won the group who cheered at the officers ultimatum. Now according to them, nobody was arrested. No reports no no no no no no no arrests were made and they kept going on now I was able to look into a little bit about this this network. This is Bob a vikian a radical radically different leader. This is apparently the guy who is running the revolution communist party in America. This guy here and I don't know why this reminds me of like those 3 a.m. M.F.O. Marshals I'm getting like those vibes from him like he has a special like it's the fucking it's the fucking ear mic that is that what it is. You know you know I'm talking be a professional guru without one of those. Bro everybody knows the fuck I'm talking about it's like 2.30 a.m. you wake up and this guy has been like a billion dollars. Yeah, I'm gonna say a brand new type of toaster you know I'm saying like that's this guy. Yeah. But yeah, this is the guy man and what what have we got on this. They should all been arrested. They should all been fuck I mean and then first beat and then arrested and the irony here. The irony is that these people are so ignorant that they can't understand that like the only thing protecting them from actually being beat and prisoned which is what would happen under a communist regime is the fact that they live in America and it's not communism. Yeah. Like that's how fucking stupid these people are. They're literally so fucking stupid bro like their IQ must be like sub 50. Yeah. Legitimately like these people are so dumb they can't even recognize that the only reason they're allowed to do the bullshit that they do is because they live in a country that actually you know contrary to what I say most of the time is somewhat free. You know what I mean like under a communist free insert in regards to look bro over in North Korea you know when the fire breaks out in your home I mean you may not even know this but like in North Korea if you're if you're fire your house catches on fire and you don't save the portrait of the president and you go for your kids they'll put you in fucking jail. Crazy. Yeah. Like dude you cannot do this shit in communist countries and these people are so they are so confused and so misled I mean they can't understand that they are the useful idiots that these books talk about. These are the people that don't know any better that are mobilized to do the work of marks and mal and Lenin style. Yeah and all these people right these are the people that they call useful idiots throughout history that they've been able to mobilize under the promise of free shit and equality and these people misinterpret that and they think that that means you know everybody's going to be wealthy like they look at wealthy people and they think communism so we can all have that but reality is is communism so we can all live like San Francisco right or LA or Chicago and I'm talking about the worst parts not the rich parts right that's the equality that communism produces and these people just can't understand it dude like honestly in my opinion any single person with communist police whatsoever should be exiled from this country should be removed from the country dude I'll be honest I think this the penalty for the desecration of our flag is too light. Yeah there's do me that's an ad there's too much tolerance man wait there's too much tolerance like there what's the reason that we're in the situation we're in is because there's so much tolerance in this live and let live attitude by Americans and they say when this is the land of the free living let live they can have their views not if you're communist no can't have them not if you're because those people are that's right not pedophiles either those people are subversive they lie about their views they lie about who they are they work their way into the system and then they actively work to deconstruct the system that's not a valid argument between two different ideologies that's not you think one thing I think another thing and we're going to argue out for the best ideas those people know they don't have the best ideas that's why they have to lie to subvert and get into the system and deconstruct from within that there is no place for that in this country that should be illegal these people should be exiled they should be removed from society and and and that's that's being nice in my opinion yeah like the reality is is this a mind virus that you cannot cure so they can either not have a place here in this country or we could do whatever the fuck we need to do to get him out of here one last thing on this this radically differently I would I'd be willing to bet you like Tim Bucks he wrote his own bio like listen to his bio says Bob a viking is the most important political thinker and leader in the world today Tim Bucks he wrote that for himself is it who is who is this guy again so this guy is apparently the leader of this little this little click yeah so you go so this guy is a communist yes yeah so he he I'm gonna pull up this website real quick what kind of name is Evacan I don't know let's search it look up Armenian is it this has yes says it has Armenian origin well here here's here you go Bob how about this fuck you how about how about you try to do that shit around here yeah because I'll come on and beat you fucking ask myself yeah yeah like bro I'm sick of these people there I'm trying to read dude people listen since you wrote this whole website there's no that of course he did because he's in nobody of course he did listen to this being a communist today means following Bob a viking and the new path that he has forged yeah yeah he's gonna lead you guys right to the fucking camps anybody that's what these people have to do with people that don't agree with their ideology because they can't win on ideas they're right this is why I was trying this is why I was trying to say a minute ago they cannot win on ideas so they have to subvert and they have to cheat and they have to lie and they have to steal and this is what creates a scenario where where you know we have to consider like how much of this should be allowed like as America free for people who are liars cheaters and thieves and who represent themselves to be something that they're not in order to cause damage to the United States to me that should not be allowed now oh man fuck listen fuck you Bob no bro listen this tolerance in the in the tolerance in the United States from people who understand the concept of freedom have they have to understand there's limits to that there's certain things that cannot be live and let live pedophiles for sure communist for sure these people are the bane of our fucking existence here in this country they have no good intentions for anything that they touch everything is about destruction everything is about creating fear everything is about creating division everything is about causing harm everything is about wrecking so that you can rebuild and in their way well if their way was so fucking great how come they're not open and out on stage debating someone who actually has good ideas and thoughts because they can't because anybody who hears the debate is going to think these people are fucking insane that's great point man this was one of the most recent Instagram posts it says we can no longer afford to allow these imperialists to continue to dominate the world and the term and the destiny of humanity and it is a scientific fact that humanity does not have to live this way isn't what what's the fact well it must be all the other times communist succeeded yeah exactly you know all the other times that you know the the communism's killed more fucking people than anything ever in the history of earth combined more than every natural disaster combined more than every war combined and that was just in the last hundred and fifteen hundred and twenty years people don't understand that this ideology doesn't work it's not practical it's not real and it's so destructive and so harmful because they try to eliminate and kill not just the people who disagree but the people who can't contribute so what they do is they try to activate these quote unquote useful idiots who have no skills no ambition no life and they're just jealous hateful lazy people who want what the other guy has who's worked his whole life for it they want it so they activate these people to go out and and preach these messages and then once they get in power they kill those people because those people don't contribute to society in any way shape or form that's why they're called useful idiots at the end of the day if you get Bob in power here Bob's going to tell all the people that are out preaches message to face the fucking wall and put a bullet in the back of their head because they're not productive that's what people don't understand about communist so these people these communists who actually run around and say we're communist there's they don't even understand what the fuck they're doing they're actually arguing and fighting for their own demise and they can't understand it now they think they're going to be on the team they think that they're going to be in with Bob right i'm sure that sixty million Russians that were killed during the whole demours believe that they were going to be in with fucking Lenin or Stalin as well right like they believe that i'm on their team they're not going to fucking kill me and they killed him and by the way it's interesting that you know anywhere between you know 40 to 60 million people were killed in that holocaust and they don't want to fucking talks about it it's not even mentioned that's ten times the alleged number that was killed in the in the world war two holocaust but we don't even talk about that other one you know why we don't talk about that other one because these motherfuckers are fucking communists and they don't want you to know how brutal their regime actually is that's a fact man that's right i'm gonna reach out i'm gonna see if you want to get him on the show no no no no not at all i don't want him within five feet of me bro yeah i don't want him with the eyesight of me real talk that's interesting like bro those people who barked at flag i'm surprised that you good American country boy citizens who go to jason out the inconsourers didn't beat the fucking shit out of those people i think it's so i i was trying to because i thought that too and i when i tried to read into it apparently like the concert was already going on they these motherfuckers are smart because there's a thing they're they're pussies right yeah they all did it why everybody was inside they did it for about 30 fucking minutes and they dispersed right before everybody else came out is the the consensus that i got so there wasn't like they were standing out there why everybody was in mind going yeah bro and they these communists always mobilize the same people they mobilize the people who don't have shit who who were you know coming from nothing who fancy themselves to be intellectuals who who who do listen we we know somebody like this okay you and i know some you know i'm talking about our buddy from New York yep who fucking thinks no who fucking thinks that he's an intellectual when he really isn't yep you know exactly what i'm talking about another guy right yeah so that's the kind of people that get into this shit you know it fucking people get killed over it i don't know man i'm sick of us i love how he's fucking uh it makes me angry to look at the image yeah i could go on and on i was leaving it that it boils my blood to look at the image of someone being allowed to burn the American flag in America i can't fucking stand it that should be a no fly zone like if the American the American people would stop tolerating that kind of behavior that kind of behavior would stop like if you knew that the consequence of burning the flag that you were gonna get your ass beat publicly yes with the pole that you wouldn't know of people wouldn't do it just saying just saying guys chatted on this conversation let us know in the comments guys what you think for you Bob or whatever you think that means you know i'm saying uh so let us know what you guys think about it's f you Bob well i was gonna but i said for you for you two purposes okay so like you know they can take it how you mean it take how you want you know i'm saying see what i did there i guess guys let's get into our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumbest fuck uh that's where we bring a headline up we'll talk about it again one of those two options so so that with that being said our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads coast guard arrest a man trying to run a giant hamster wheel across the Atlantic all right we're a quick quick guess where is this guy from he is he from the US yes are you asking like what state he's from state i mean that sounds like a California thing oh man or Florida yes Florida i mean there's some weird people in California well the reason i went with California was because of the eco stuff right gotcha yeah god like okay i see where yeah that's that's reasonable that's a reasonable estimation yeah uh so yeah let's dive into this so the article reads try as he might reza balucci can't reach his destination without running a foul of the united states coast guard the key problem is his vessel a giant floating hamster wheel made of booze and wire self-propelled by balucci running inside balucci who lives in florida after being granted a asylum for my ran was taken in by the coast guard last week aboard his vessel following several days of back and forth with the authorities according to a criminal complaint filed in US district court in south florida the coast guard cutter valiant uh came across balucci in his homemade vessel about 70 nautical miles east of tb island uh Georgia on august 26th as the coast guard was preparing for hurricane franklin uh he told officers his destination london england more than 4,000 miles away balucci was asked for the vehicles registration he said it was registered in florida but he could that he couldn't find the registration according to the complaint the coast guard assessed balucci's vessel known as a hydropot and then determined he was quote conducting a manifestly unsafe voyage according to coast guard special agent michael pares in the complaint which does not identify balucci's starting point the officers then approached balucci in a small boat and instructed him to join them uh they were ending his voyage due to it being unsafe balucci replied that he had a 12 inch knife and would attempt to kill himself if the officers attempted to remove him from his vessel according to the complaint now the officers return to the cutter and state nearby when the officers try to again over the next day or so to get balucci to join them on the small boat uh balucci displayed two knives and threatened to hurt himself if officers boarded his vessel balucci also quote threatened to blow himself up along with his vessels now the officers saw him holding wires in his hand and believed him the complaint says and this apparently is not his first time this was far from balucci's first encounter with the coast guard he has attempted voyages in a similar homemade vessel in 2014 2016 2021 all of which resulted in the US coast guard intervention pres notes here's his makeshift hamster will what what is going on in Florida like why does all of the craziest shit happen I mean you toss coming in second I don't know man I think this is like you know it's the culture of first you know everybody wants to be first at something you know you know the first this president the first that teacher the first guy to run across the ocean in the hamster like bro like we need to get away from the first and get back to being the best as shit that actually matters you know that's my take that's real shit yeah I mean like dude I'm so tired of hearing this it's so brave all right it's the first this of that like dude who fucking cares if it sucks you know I'm saying like we're not built on the first we're built on the best and you know running your hamster wheel across the fucking ocean I mean what do you what do you think that's gonna create for you do you think that I'm not trying to shit on your fucking dream but maybe you should have a better dream I'm not gonna lie it doesn't look too bad like it looks it looks okay like it looks safe bro the guys out in the ocean where the hurricane coming like they saved this dude's life but here's my thing oh here's why I'm gonna disagree with you on Andy all right I personally I am to the belief that the less dumb people we have procreating no I agree I'm okay with it yeah natural selection let's do it bro if you want to go and take a hamster wheel into a fucking hurricane by all means I think that's a valuable legitimate point we should have it I think we have to stop protecting the dumbest motherfuckers in the world let them fucking do what they're gonna do that's what I'm saying it's like the cops who tried to stop the doof from surfing during coven like no no if you want to get me from the sharks and shit let them get this and dude people get mad when I say this about abortion yeah they get super mad about it like you guys bitch complain about you know a abortion but like you don't ever stop to consider that the people who are getting the abortions are the same people who are like terrorizing the whole civil society at mass you know I'm saying so like why are you arguing for them to continue life in the life cycle when in reality it's just gonna create more people of that mindset that you're gonna have to deal with and your children are gonna have to deal with and so like dude that's a very harsh position and I understand that but we I think it's also a real position it's not idealistic thinking and you know until we have real people who are willing to legitimately take care of these kids and raise them right I don't think people should have an opinion on what people do with their own with their things I you want to stop your bloodline listen dude exactly like I actually do not that's that's how I see the world I don't see it like I don't see it like these other people see it and you know that gives me a lot of heat because the conservatives are the ones that tend to listen to the show more than you know the guys over there I'm a massive world yeah so like but like you know you guys complain about how the world's going to shit but then you don't get mad you get mad when the people who are creating the world going to shit decide that they don't want to reproduce like which one is it right right I mean I think that's a very logical real argument and I know that rubs people the wrong way and I understand respecting human life and I understand that but how many of those people who actually say that they believe in those things are taking these people's children and actually raising them not many of them have another fair argument I know it's no it's it's the true argument it's the real argument people just don't like it yeah people people you know I'm an evil person for bringing that point up but the reality is is it's real and so I my point is I agree with you like I don't have a problem with people destroying themselves if that's what they want to do yeah and if this fucking idiot wants to run out in the middle of a hurricane and doesn't appreciate that they're actually trying to save his life then let him fucking do whatever he's going to do I don't give a shit and you shouldn't either that's what I'm saying yeah I mean look dude we we we continue to allow to save these people from themselves and they continue to weaponize themselves against all things civil and all things real and all things normal yeah yeah like we're creating the whole problem that these motherfuckers you know because of our empathy and like dude at some point these people aren't gonna have the empathy back towards you right like that's what people fail to understand they fucking hate you you know you're trying to save them but they hate you and they're gonna kill you I understand the alignment with Jesus Christ when we get into talking to the biblical conversations about that but there's also a reality like are you willing to allow the enemy to to continue to save the enemy over and over and over again and then to the point where they get into enough numbers that they actually kill you and your family okay destroy your future yeah destroy your children's future I mean or can we just say fuck the enemy and deal with them and that's the worry about it yeah that's that's my that's what I think that's real man that's real so where where where what what do we give him this I think it's dumb as fuck yeah yeah I think I think this guy's dumb as fuck and like you know no offense like I can appreciate people doing challenging things but um you know this pretty dumb yeah yeah yeah I agree I'm gonna go double fuck all that as well and like dude what does he think he's going to gain from this like what do you you're gonna spend the rest of your life saying I'm the only person I'm the only person ever that ran in a hamster wheel across the ocean like cool party trick man like you could like get online and learn some basic magic and fucking have the same response you know what I'm saying like yeah like dude it's just I don't know I mean I can I can I guess if I'm gonna pull something good out of it I can respect the fact that the guy's tough enough and then good enough shape to actually do it because that's a very hard thing to do I respect that aspect of it yeah I mean listen that there's definitely some engine it doesn't look too badly built I'm gonna be honest like I don't know if it would if it's holding big boy weight but you know like I mean I don't do that type of shit anyway but like it doesn't look terrible I wouldn't say it's completely unsafe you know I'm saying bro you ever seen the perfect storm yeah you have yeah that's what the imagine being that thing in the fucking seat in those kind of seas yeah that's what I'm saying dude like no thank you yeah yeah and like I don't know that's whatever dude I think it's stupid yeah that's my personal opinion wait wait that's fine that's all good because because that's all I got all right all right guys well that's the show appreciate you guys uh share in the
