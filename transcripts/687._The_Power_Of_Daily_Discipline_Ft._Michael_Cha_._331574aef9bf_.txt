What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the real estate about it lies to fakeness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today instead of our normal cruise the internet episode we have a special guest I'm gonna get right into it let's do it yeah Michael Chandler what's up bro dude living the dream dude I just got the tour of the HQ here absolutely ridiculous so pumped up to be here man thanks bro it's so good to see you man you too man yeah awesome so a lot of you guys may or may not know but Michael and I grew up 10 minutes from each other and we've been trying to connect for years yep and dude it's really cool to finally have you here especially after the big announcement this weekend crazy 48 hours ago yeah what do you say I texted you right after I was like hey one day's about to be lit yeah yeah what was the big announcement there's just there's just there's just fight yeah this is a little thing we're gonna get into it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so dude how are you feeling about everything dude honestly you know I've kind of made the joke I really have been in a very unique position the last it's been about 16 months really you know got down with my last fight in November of 2022 January I get a phone call hey you want to do the ultimate fighter against Conor Gregor fight it right after the season my answer of course is absolutely we do the ultimate fighter and then since the foot the show wrapped up in August we've kind of just been gone back and forth so I feel like I call it MMA purgatory I've kind of been I've waited too long to not stay on the train of fighting Conor I've had enough behind the scenes indications that the fights definitely happening even though media even though the fans even though everybody's like this fight's never happening it's never coming back so honestly it's a huge weight lifted off my shoulders that we can finally talk about it I've known for months that the fight was gonna be June 29th but wasn't exactly public about it and now we can talk about it now the cat is out the bag and we got 75 hard days between two right now we were talking about this this morning so he sends me a text like 6 a.m. and he's like bro I was gonna tell you later but do you know how many days it is until my fight and I'm like no and he's like 75 days and I'm like holy shit man the fact that I'm so crazy with the godfather of 75 hard is and now we are we're about to go into this training I mean I've already kind of started but yeah the fact that it got announced and this is the first Monday after it gets announced say five days man just a dream come true it's exciting I told you bro I'm gonna go hard as hard as I can for I'm already on I'm like day 30 on 75 right now but I'm just gonna finish that out and do phase one so I can be done on the same day you're done yes so I'll be done on five day dude let's go back yeah this is gonna be doing it with you not the same stuff well I mean I might DJ punch me in a face yeah there you got a couple of squarters you guys got yeah you got a you got a full basketball quarter over there you got the gyms I heard there were some mats but you had to clear them out for some of you guys usually right there next to the court yeah the guys trained jujitsu there every uh I don't know Tuesday at Thursday Thursday Wednesday Thursday 7 yeah dude so crazy man yeah man so dude how did this all the the fight I mean was there a lot of negotiation or was it pretty much like okay we could do this I uh I already kind of had my stuff set up because I I had the foresight to negotiate with the UFC hey here's my contract but if I fight Connor here's my contract and we came to an agreement um so it's kind of already been set and I'm very happy with it and low and behold obviously that fight happened to the UFC knew about my contract they were completely okay with it all happening and the UFC's awesome and they they have been absolute dream to work with behind the scenes even though there's been so much craziness going on you know I mean just for a quick timeline of people who haven't really followed it all there was the big you know the drug testing thing because Connor was outside of usata the drug testing pool and that was a big hangup then he got into the usata testing pool then they switched drug testing agencies now he's going to be in the new drug testing agency for six months um so it's just been how do they test you for that is it consistently completely random so I got I got my location on my phone so my location they know where my location is technically they could call me right now and I have basically two hours is at the time limit if you don't show up to where they are or them to you in a two hour time frame you get aware about its failure um you do get three you know you it's not like a one and done you get suspended but if you give three whereabouts failures you get suspended for the the minimum two years so it's completely random we are under we're still under wada so it's the same thing the NCAA NFL NHL MLB uses I believe um and it's completely random and here we are dude now it's it's been cool to watch you come up and do your thing especially being a fellow St. Louison right Missouri and you know every time we talk it's always a conversation about two freaking red net Missouri dudes putting it together man dudes that weren't supposed to be here and so here we are like what I guess we'll keep going and it's been really cool bro to follow your career and see you come up and see you do what you've what you've been doing and what you're gonna do um I mean when you when you think back and you think like you know growing up in in house springs and high ridge you know which isn't exactly you know for people that don't know it's it's it's it's it's not porous just it's regular America regular America middle class yeah in middle class midwestern you know place and uh you know to be where you are right now I mean it's fucking awesome dude and like when you think back to like all like did you ever I think this is might be a silly question but I just got to ask it I mean did you ever think like this is where you wanted to end up or or how did this all play out for you no I mean honestly I didn't even know professional athlete like for me to be a professional athlete never really thought about it I don't really think I ever you know first of all I was four foot eleven a hundred pounds in high school then going into high school I wasn't gonna be the star quarterback I wasn't gonna be playing basketball so I knew I had to wrestle wrestle 103 pounds so I never really thought about profession being a professional athlete man but the so the fact I've been a professional athlete now for 16 years and had the success I've had is just crazy and then in the sport of wrestling there's really no path after I mean you can maybe go to the Olympics in that but that's not it's professional athletic style or something yeah it's professional athletics kind of but it's not a it's not a big glory thing you know it's it's it's training for the Olympics and I was never going to be able to do that but yeah wrestling Northwest high school was never never a state champ and truth be told nobody really wanted me at the division one level I had some scholarship offers from some local schools Lennon Woods Central Missouri State Missouri Baptist but for some reason something in me said hey if I'm gonna wrestle I'm gonna try to wrestle at the highest level and I took a chance and I walked on to Mizzou and coached it and know my name coach Brian Smith is still there you know he didn't really look at me there for the first year ended up after my first year I got a starting starting spot but I went to I went to the University of Missouri completely okay with riding the bench for five years if I had to going through all the workouts never never reaching the pinnacle which would be becoming an all-american the division one level but so I took that chance on myself walked on and ended up becoming an all-american captain of the team four-year four-year starter four-year national qualifier from Mizzou and then friends of our tyrant woodley Ben Asker and wrestled with both of those guys they were kind of like my big brothers I'm the oldest of three boys so I didn't have older guys to look up to a lot those were the kind of the first big brothers I had and they started fighting and ended up graduating in May of 2009 my first fight at Lake of the Ozarks at some holiday in ballroom got it like I got paid 500 bucks and after we paid for hotel if we paid for travel and gas and food I think I lost like 38 bucks so I was negative for you know but that's how you kind of get going and then man then through Bellatour and now on the UFC and now fighting the biggest combat sports athlete of all time Conner dude that's crazy 75 days so how many fights did it take you to go from like fighting in the bars because do we all know what that's like because that's like a big thing around you man we all love to go watch the local tickets and they're fun you watch they're they're fun and you're seeing people fighting at at kind of that that level where it's like dude I just want to get somewhere and I got to fight my tail off to fight more than just the opponent yeah yeah dude for sure I mean I love the local level fighter yeah no they're always fun man yeah fun and character filled and the crowd and it's just dude it's like it's the the epitome of you know kind of just beer drink beer drinking parties and then like a fight breaks out you're like let's go man yeah yeah so dude how long do you take you to go from that to Bellatour man I got I gotta say I have a very very fortunate path when it came to that I had that first I only had one local show really one local show like the the like of the Ozarks Missouri it's still on YouTube um I thought a guy named Kyle Swadley who wrestled at Linda Wood I think he was one of know at the time it was first blood promotion and then they you know as you know you because you've probably seen some of the strike force fights that come to town or Bellatour they partner with a local promoter and the local promoter finds local talent because how do you sell tickets you get a guy like me who's got 200 something people from high-risk Missouri I can sell tickets to them and that's how you put butts and seats and sell out the arenas so I fought strike force undercard strike force undercard one in Kansas City one in St. Louis and then I had a I had a moment where they said I had a strike force offer and I had a Bellatour offer but to me strike force was kind of just a a big wide open net of hey you're signing with the organization and then you're gonna get some fights and then eventually maybe fight for the title if you get good enough or you are good enough but Bellatour had a clear path because back then they used to do a tournament so I fought two fights in two or three months and then I got the go ahead to say they have you in these first two fights you'll be in the tournament then I got in the tournament I fought March April May so I fought three fights in three months and then I fought Eddie Alvarez who was the number three guy in the world at the time so I somehow go from May of 2009 to November 2011 and I'm fighting for a world title against the number three guy in the world so it was just a crazy crazy meteoric rise really and I had finished most of my opponents I think I'd finished nine of my or sorry eight of my nine fights and like seven of those in the first round and then I had a knockdown drag out war with Eddie and it'll beat him and it so it was very very quick honestly which is which was awesome as a huge blessing but there was there was some growing pains that I had to go through because I hadn't sometimes it's the right path but it's a little bit too quick right sometimes is you're the right guy you're just not the right guy yet and I think I I use the the training that I had all those years through fighting and I looked across the cage against Eddie Alvarez who had like 30 fights at the time or 20 something fights and I'm like dude I'm gonna I'm gonna beat this guy I know I'm gonna beat him and I go out there and I beat him and then you know later on I had a couple losses and it's been little ups and downs here but it's it's constantly continued to grow and it's so it was a very cool path and you know being outside the UFC for so long coming over to the UFC and then getting a title shot my second fight and you know fight in the promotion was part of kind of that build up that led me to where we are today did you have to handle the crowd pressure during that time like that fast track did you ever have any like self doubt of like do I belong here or was it did you kind of just were you able to block out the noise I'll say what it was and and because I can I stand firm on knowing that I live a champion lifestyle more than anybody else I have ever met in the sport of mixed martial arts and that's nothing against anybody else there's other guys who do it right I just truly believe I do it better and I do it different and more attention to detail but I was building up this body I was doing all the physical things but I wasn't really taking care of the mindset part of things I wasn't really I wasn't really winning the battle between the ears and you do start to feel the pressure you do start to hear hear the doubt or you do start to drink your own cool aid of hey he's the next big thing because right I beat Eddie Alvarez and then immediately like that's cool he beat Eddie Alvarez he's a top five guy in the world but we want to see him fight Anthony Pettis in the UFC wouldn't see him fight Benzen Henderson who were the champions at the time and you start to feel this pressure and I started to get this I started to get this so much pressure put on myself to be perfect right because you win the world title you're you in your mind you know you earned it but you don't really know if you deserved it maybe it was too quick so then I have my first loss to Eddie coincidentally lost the rematch and then I lost three fights in a row six hundred eighty eight days I went without winning a fight so and for those that do follow the sport or don't follow the sport that's kind of like a career death sentence for a fighter losing three fights in a row so I did I started to feel that pressure I started to because once you win a world title and everyone's looking at you now it's not just hey I'm gonna go in I'm gonna have fun today right if you meet me and you're going I could beat you for four minutes and fifty seconds of around but if I lose ten seconds of around to me that was a failure so I failed every single day and when you when you feel like you're failing every single day when you're really not it's all about perspective I felt like I was failing every single day every single day wasn't a day to get better and have fun and enjoy this beautiful life that I get to live it was either hey I'm perfect or I'm a loser I'm I'm gonna perfect I'm dominating everybody or I'm a failure and so I kind of fell into that trap and right now I was I was back then I was sad I was depressed I was upset I was mad I was all the emotions but now I look back at that and think man I had to go through that I had to be forged in a major yeah I had to man and and and it now it's made me a better fighter it's it's it's propelled me to where I am I'm a better husband because of it a better father because of a better businessman just a better man because of it yeah people don't stop to think you know when you're pushing to be great or pushing to be the best at what you do you're going to it's always it feels like you're losing it feels like you're struggling right because you're pushing the boundaries and the boundary to push it you you have all these setbacks and all these doubts like when you lose three fights in a row bro that's a mental that's a mental battle you know what I'm saying and people sometimes think that like winning and moving forward feels good but it doesn't ever feel good it always feels like a major struggle I think of the times when I've elevated in my life dude and they've been the hardest times of my life no doubt like no doubt yeah but like you said dude it's what teaches you everything you need to know yeah you know yeah and when you and when you have a a setback or a loss you know I I talk about these three big mistakes that I made to you know right away and and it was partly because you know you kind of you start to hear hear all the chatter and hear all the noise but but until something bad happens and you're like oh I knew it what they said there it is they were all right when really they weren't yeah right but it was my perception of it right so I immediately I wanted to hide from everybody I got offered to come out and present the or presented an award at the World in May awards for five to the year and all the different stuff wasn't answering my phone I wanted to hide from it right now man I wear my losses on my I wear my losses on my sleeve I'm almost proud of them I'm almost I'm almost just proud to be in to be the man in the arena right and not almost I am proud to be that man in the arena because it doesn't matter if I fall flat on my face my next 10 fights I'm gonna pick myself up and you're still gonna see the blueprint for how a man continues to operate through the series of assistitudes and the ups and the downs of what we call life mine is just in a cage right and then I forgot how good I was you know you have that first loss you're like well I just I'm just not good anymore right you know dude I was just as fast just as strong just as powerful when I walked into that cage is when I walked out of that cage it was just my perception in my mind you know and then you kind of fall into that comfort jail cell of self pity you start pointing the fingers you know all these different mistakes that I needed to make that really were immature and I'm glad we all have to go through those immature moments we all have those immature moments but they make you into the mature man that you are today you know and even thinking about you know the old story about the man pushing the rock right God comes to an a vision says push the rock right by the hill and he's pushing the rock and he's pushing the rock and he can't you can't move it he can't budget maybe it moves an engine that comes back to which is right his shoulders are jacked up his hands are bleeding and he finally is just like God why would you why would you send me on this journey if you knew I wasn't going to push this rock up the hill and he's like dude I didn't tell you to push the rock up the hill I just told you to push the rock just push the rock it so it's the obedience in moving forward and like you said that visual of thinking about the hardest some of the hardest times in your life is when you are winning right because you're always pushing and you're always forgetting about what people are saying and continuing to move forward doesn't always feel good yeah that's why people follow you and watch you and we don't follow you because of the the virtual certainty of your success but because of your failures that's what we love as human beings yeah because we can all relate yeah right we we fail eight times out of 10 nine times out of 10 that's the reality of pursuing anything worthy do you ever stop and think how fortunate you are to have had those lessons at such a young age in life because a lot of people they don't they spend their whole lives and they never learn what you're talking about and because of the circumstances of your life you were able to learn these lessons as a young man not as an old man yes think about that no I do because especially in a sport like mixed martial arts that obviously I am so truly blessed to be in the sport man it's it's made me who I am it's made me a beautiful life a beautiful fortune a beautiful living and and the the platform that I have everything goes back to mixed martial arts and I've seen so many guys who maybe had more talent than me or maybe had were even bigger than me at one point and I've continued to gain ground and continue to pass them up and continue to grow bigger and and and it's just but it was only because of the lessons that I had to go go through you know in doing it with as much humility as I possibly could and and it really does have so much to do with how I was raised right my mom and dad went through things their entire life they went they were working two and three jobs nonstop my dad was up every single morning put in his carpenter work boots on every single day at five in the morning and watching the way that they operated watching the way that they lived their lives watching the way that they always just tried their best and tried to be a better person today than the word yesterday um it it kept it's got me so grounded and I'm so fortunate to have that and there was times where I would look back and and be mad at the way that I was raised or the way that I things that happened in my in my young man brain as I was growing and but it's all kept me so it's kept my perspective so crystal clear and knowing that I was created for great things but I mean I ain't greater than anybody else you know and it's in it's such a beautiful thing and and I really do feel for people who who have somehow fallen victim to the entitlements and the ohleer than that was in the bigger than now when I deserve this and I deserve that when I'm like man I don't deserve anything I know I work hard enough to deserve it more than this guy but I'm gonna work harder than him in order to force my deservedness and continue to force more and more accomplishment through the deservedness through the work that I do there's nobody working harder than you bro no I try not try I know I know you you you may not say that but it's the truth there's nobody working harder than you yeah and I know I my biggest thing is taking pride in the small the small little hard work the things that nobody ever sees the little disciplines where it's just me and my supplements or just me and my shopping cart and at the grocery store or it's just me and that piece of litter right there or that's me and this little decision I can make to be like okay this is how 90% of people would do it but I'm gonna go ahead and go the extra mile and to do this right now because we act as though are these little acts and these little thoughts that they happen in a vacuum and they happen in private and maybe they do happen in private and people people they don't see them but they do eventually manifest themselves into your circumstances right so I've just that's the way I was raised and that's the way I operate and it doesn't matter it didn't matter here's one thing to you know being trusted in the small things if you can be trusted in the small things then and only then can you be trusted in the big things right so this training camp that I'm about to put put on starting today and moving forward to fight the biggest combat sports superstar on the planet will be no more disciplined no more hard no more extra than when I was fighting Kyle swaddley my first fight ever or fighting David Rickles a guy who maybe you guys have never heard about or or Derrick Campos one of these guys I I was training and the doing the small things right whether I was fighting the number 150 guy in the world or I'm fighting the biggest name on the entire planet in the history of mixed martial arts so if I could be trusted with those small things that's how you end up in this spot you know and it even feels uncomfortable to say because it's not really me it's just it's a thing you're doing it's a product I'm a product of my environment yeah and how I was raised and it is you because it's a choice yeah that we all get to make we all get to make a choice about how disciplined we're going to be and we all get to make a choice about how serious we're going to take our lives and we don't always start at the same spot but we do have a choice with what we make of that and when I look at you I look at a regular guy who comes from what I know very well just a very regular place you know St. Louis is St. Louis I love it everybody here loves it but you know it's it's a different place man it's very blue collar it's very hard working it's not LA it's not Miami and I'm thankful for that people are often like why do you still live there I'm like bro because it's not that yeah you know but you when I look at you dude I see someone who represents those Midwestern values who represents and not just in your work ethic in your life as a man as a family man and when I I had a very cool experience that I think you'll you'll enjoy this weekend I had I was I was working out in the gym and this guy comes walking into the gym holding the football and I'm like I can't see him all the way across the gym like who is that why's he got a football and he's walking right towards me and he gets closer I'm like who is that who who's here and then he gets like for me to you away and I'm like holy shit dude that's Jerry Rice that's Jerry Rice and he's got a football in his hand what's it what's that football for many hands it to me I'm working out he hands it to me and he and it says to Andy hold the standard and like this a little message and sign Jerry Rice and he says hey I'm here with Ben Newman thank you so much for allowing me to come out this place is amazing and I'm like and I don't get star struck yeah dude this Jerry Rice you know you don't get star struck the best Jerry yeah like very like when we talk about the greatest ever at what they did like you you've met a lot of great people I've met a lot of great people people who were at the top of the game but when you say Jerry Rice dude like it's undeniable he is the greatest NFL Y receiver ever in history and he's standing in front of me and so I'm like halfway through my workout and I'm like all right well I'll skip the workout for this yeah so we start talking and we hit it off immediately and I got to talk to him for about two hours just me and him because they were running an event so I went to locker room and I got to sit down and we had a conversation and dude this guy he dude you remind me a ton of them like exactly the same kind of thing normal guy comes from normal place has figured out the very same thing that you're talking about it's about the discipline execution on a day by day basis it's not some big play it's not get lucky it's not talent it's win the day and when you win the day you win tomorrow and when you win tomorrow you win the next day and dude it was so cool hearing him tell me this because I thought you know yes you can win the day and you can become very good but when you see someone who ran a 4 7 40 in the NFL because let's be real that's not fast for a wide receiver there's guys that run 4 7s on every single high school team in this state okay who became the greatest receiver ever and you hear him talk about how hard he worked and what he did on a daily basis and how he became who he was it just inspired me so much because I thought yes you could become very successful winning the day but in reality like when I look at you and I look at him and I look at guys like that there's actually no up or ceiling when it comes to that it's not talent it's not skill it really is how long do you want to execute and how at what level do you want to execute and dude it was one of the coolest conversations I've ever had and bro you remind me a lot of them let's it's really cool too because I mean I feel you know sometimes things have to get I don't know worse before they get better right or you have to you have to kind of go the sensational route I mean I feel like we've become very sensationalized as as a society right and we see we see all of these crazy successes and and of course yeah there's there's there's lightning striking in a bottle or whatever you call it or it does happen yeah there's these things that happen dude but as a whole the people that are at the top the people that get to to those lofty places it really is just normal everyday people doing normal everyday things as fat or as as disciplined as possible and and not being afraid to take the long road yeah hard road yeah brick by boring brick we do it every single day and then eventually you look around you're like how did I get here yeah right I mean and you knew you were on your way right but it was enjoying the journey and and and enjoying and taking pride in the small things right because once again he who can be trusted with the small things then you can be trusted in the big things right when he ends up in the hall of fame he wanted to get there but he's not going to get to the hall of fame unless you can be trusted in the small things whether whether you believe in God the universe serendipity whatever it is it's going to work out like that it's the small it's how do you eat an elephant you eat a big old elephant one tiny little bite at a time you know but taking pride in every single one of those little bitty bites every single one of those boring bricks doing it perfect laying yeah perfectly yeah that's what Nick Saban talks about you know he talks about we're not going to run the play until we get it right we're going to run the play until we can't get it wrong and that's what it comes down to and I think what's important to point out about what we're talking about is that most people who have big dreams who have big goals who have aspirations and you young guys who listen you need to really listen to this okay you guys have to understand you may not be LeBron James you may not run a 4 240 you might not have this exceptional talent but what Michael's done and what guys like Jerry Rice have done is they've taken very average up rings and skill sets I mean you were 103 is that fair to say 103 pounds yeah I mean is it fair to say average right yeah I have very very average well most people with Dean average yes most people will start like everybody out here starts at a place like that and they say because they're not that gifted guy on the wrestling team or they're not that gifted guy on the football field or they're not that gifted guy with business who happen to start something in two years he was worth you know 50 million dollars or whatever right or 10 million or a million right these we we tend to like sell our sell short and we say well dude I don't have that I don't have those parents that lended me the money to start my business I didn't I didn't I was a born with 4 540 speed you know I don't have good genetics we tell ourselves all these stories and we failed to realize that there is a way and the way is what we're talking about with Michael and Jerry Rice these guys and by the way that's been true for me too I don't have special talent I don't have special skill set but what I do have is I have grit and fortitude and I'm willing to get up every day and do everything I can do to get there yes and I appreciate the sentiment that you have thrown my direction right now but let me let me just talk about you for a second now for for those eyes listen listening I'm here at the HQ when I was I was gonna ask you if you even have a cleaning crew here but I did see someone come around I saw no less than 10 people wash their hands and then they're cleaning down and wiping down the countertops in the in the in the gym every single weight is lined up perfectly every single dumbbell is is lined up perfectly the place is spick and span and it's a it's a we mentality and you leading from the front I mean you don't you don't have to I don't even have to know you to walk into your establishment to see your team and see the way that these people operate and it is the physical manifestation of the way that you do one thing as the way that you do everything and it is the little things right first form is not going to become the one of the biggest companies on the world because your weights are perfectly right that's really not right maybe it does maybe it doesn't matter at all but it's just it's a it's a standard that is set right and that and that's what people can really see I mean I wish people could see and and and really see it because it is inspiring in this this place is a it's it's people here but it just the building itself if I was walking into this building it's itself just the bricks and the mortars and the pieces of equipment and the walls and that kind of stuff this is perfection personified right it's it's absolutely but it's a standard that you that you set and you're leading from the front to right it's not hey you guys all do this but really whenever you put the weights you got your butler behind you putting them all yeah no yeah right yeah it only works if you live it yeah man and it's but it's it's those little bitty things done with enthusiasm and done as if it's not even a question there is no question it's going to get done and it's and it's going to be done well we're very blessed to have you know because of how authentic and open I am about my feelings about the world and my standards on the podcast we are very blessed to have high drive high standard individuals want to come to work here very rarely do we get someone that's not like that you know and and I'll tell you a little secret about that that a lot of you guys you know we have a big entrepreneurship listenership here on the show if you want your team to do that you all you I get this this is probably my most asked question how do you get your team to do that stuff what do you do do you a fine no dude look it's very simple and I think you'll agree with this you already said it those little things that we do they add up into the big things how we do the big things so when you're a leader and you're trying to get your team to execute at a high level what you have it's not hey do this it's this is how it is hey man look when we straighten those weights you're making an investment in your discipline and your attention to detail in your ability to recognize something that needs to be fixed and fixing it and every time you do that you're making a deposit into your own skill set which will translate into how you execute in your career in your life and here your goal is to make money and build a career so if you can build that skill set better you're going to do better as a career and and so when we teach our team that you know they're already exceptional human beings they're already high drive they're hungry to get better they they buy into that immediately because they're like yeah dude I'm looking to get better yeah like you said it's not the actual weight itself yeah active the weight but it's what it does to that's right that's right deserve it this so one little that one little penny in the bank yeah deserve itness to be like we were all created with greatness inside of us but not everyone deserves to get to that if they don't make the requisite sacrifices I have the requisite discipline right even and and and obviously my my life is has been fitness and and and fighting and wrestling and all these different things and business now in our business yeah but every single little practice I mean you don't see the results you know I'm putting dollars in the bank in the discipline bank today that I won't see until June 29th right I'll start to get a little bit more shredded or start to get a little bit more fast or start to get a little bit more x y and z but it's it's doing things today and maybe not seeing results for two months but that is exactly what you're talking about two of these little things that add up to the thing when you stand at your greatest moment of opportunity or your darkest hour you have to be able to ask answer that question did I do enough am I enough and you are enough if you've done the little things leading up to it and that's the thing dude the path does not get easier now so we have to build ourselves into these people that can endure the path because you just said that hour of darkness that's coming for all of us and it looks different in different ways and by the way it doesn't just come for us once it comes over and over and over again it comes in the form of losing a job or comes in the form of getting a divorce or comes in the form of getting an illness or a death in the family and there's all these things that come at us for our whole lives and if we don't build ourselves into someone of determination grit resilience discipline we're in a situation where we can handle these things and and and and dude our families our friends our significant others they look up to us for these things and if we're not there to handle it that's a life failure that is a life failure and people don't realize how much these little things actually create the character skill set because I call it a skill set right because we're developing it it's not a trait people aren't naturally highly disciplined I mean maybe some people are but really it's something that we build and we can all build it and you mentioned the litter thing right that's a big deal for me like I will walk freaking half a mile out of my way if I see a bad going because I'm like dude I can't let it go yeah I can't let it go I'll remember that you know and when we little things like that people just don't think about and then you think about if everybody did think about those things how much different would the world be how much different would the world look if everybody said hey I cannot let that go I've got to fix that you know what I mean yeah and and and dude we live in a completely different society in general society of excellence high standards treating people with respect that's one of the things I love about you most bro is as good of a fighter as you are you're a better dude you're a better man and a better husband and a better father and it's very very admirable dude and I really appreciate the standard that you set as a man not just as a fighter it's it's it's really special bro thank you yeah I know I just it was actually funny because I was just with my wife you know and we've kind of been having these conversations because you you also well one thing going back to what you just said too you you can be a absolute optimist in love life and full of joy and all those things and still admit that you're going to suffer hardship you're going to get kicked in the mouth there's going to be bad things that happen you're going to get things that you don't deserve to happen to you but they're going to happen so you have to be built up and ready for those things and even right now having the foresight to realize what's about to happen in my life right and it's in it's what I asked for this I prayed for this moment I asked for this moment and even talking about my my wife this past weekend it was just like you know pray for continue to pray for humility pray for wisdom man because the enemy is going to attack and this is going to be big and this is going to be an out-of-body experience in this in my eye my the temptation for my eye to be taken off of the ball is going to be so immense right so you you have to know that you got a big battle ahead of you and you got some things that are going to happen to you but you can still be optimistic and know that you're the man for the job know that you have earned it know that you're right where you're supposed to be because the next season for me is going to be you know it's going to be I can't even really put into words what what's going to happen I can't all I can do is ask for wisdom and know and know and hope and pray that I'm able to operate right and that's what you got to do every single day because life is going to continue to get thrown at you man let me actually there's what so you know you mentioned your mom your dad your upbringing what what was the support like when you decided to get into fighting what what was it was mom like no my baby like I mean did you have any of that no my mom's my mom's pretty rough around the edges man like she's a she's a sweetheart sweet little Betty little little bitty Italian lady and she's she's an amazing soul but she's a little rough around the edges right when it comes to like she loved wrestling man like she was getting arguments and fights in the stands like you know the wrestling wrestling community is like bro that's Midwest mom yeah exactly you know and you know but you know but obviously for me too I had my my big brothers right tyron and Ben who we looked up to and my mom idolized them as well she's like well tyron and Ben think you'll be all right so I think you'll be good I mean and it wasn't the way that I wrestled anyway it wasn't real slick and and fast and whatever it was just it was basically a fight every single time I stepped on the wrestling mat anyway you know is that I wasn't allowed to punch legally or kick in that kind of stuff it was aggressive but it was aggressive man because it really was you know hey because I started wrestling as a freshman in high school like I I didn't really have I wrestled a couple years when I was younger like but like five years old when you're basically running around the mats and just playing games playing tag and then I started really taking it serious and dedicated my life to the sport when I was 14 years old and I've been doing hand-to-hand combat since so I wasn't going to be able to out slick you out technique you out wrestle you but I could freaking out fight you I could out cardio you I could push you off the mat run back to the center and head butt you and and get my hand on it make it very uncomfortable make it right this you might beat me yeah you might be better than me but you don't you don't want to wrestle me again that was kind of the mentality I had and then as I got more and more skilled I've been able to dial that back a little bit you see a lot in my fight style you know that's kind it's kind of the way I bro you're fucking bulldog and I was 14 yeah so I told you that that remember after the pourier fight remember me texting you and I said I said bro that was even though you lost I said that was the greatest fucking fight I'd ever seen in my life and it was because of how tough you fought that fight bro yeah like that was I don't know how you feel about no I do know it's one of those that was a loss yeah that was a win yeah you know like and that's and that's what you realize too man it's it was a loss on paper yeah absolutely you're gonna you're gonna but man retire you look at it and other was a loss on his record but dude I won dude right look at the fight I have now every single time I've lost it's been another win it's another it feels like a demotion but it's a promotion if you've done the right things you get rewarded yeah yeah fuck dude does anything change because you're cuz you typically you fight at lightweight right but this is a welterweight fight yeah so so that's 170 I think no nothing's really gonna change I'll be able to eat a little bit more yeah I can eat a little bit more carbs this this you know a lot of people I'll fucking love cars yeah yeah well they bring up Michael Phelps right because everyone's heard the stories like dude are you just pounding the calories with how much you're training and you'd be flabbergasted to know like I'm usually eating between like 1200 and 1500 calories per day and training twice a day five days a week or five days a week once on Saturday and then two of two of those five days in between I'm hitting a third cardio session a third workout on 1200 to 1500 calories a day it's shrinking my body down losing a little bit of muscle getting rid of all the fat and then dehydrating myself at the end but so for 170 you know I'm like 185 ish right now because I've already been training for the last four weeks so I'll probably eat enough to keep myself get like shred down a little bit lose a little bit of body fat get myself right where I need to be which is going to be like that 177 mark and then just a nice little easy water cut at the end it's going to be the best camp in my life man I can't wait to fight 170 that's awesome do you what's the difference between your what's your normal fight weight 155 okay do you do you think that there's a a difference in the cardio aspect that those two weights um like fighting that 155 versus fighting yeah yeah like in general the two weight classes yeah I think there's I mean there's a generally I don't listen man I don't know a ton about MMA I'm a fan but I'm a casual fan yeah but generally the lower the more you get up in weight class the higher the lower the pace right this lower the pace so yeah 155 there's there's better cardio than than at 170 you know but for me I feel like I'm I'm gonna be just weighing in at 170 instead of dehydrating myself to 155 and once again I'm gonna do the exact same training camp just eat a little bit more baby thank god you know yeah drink a couple more protein shakes what kind of diet do you follow man so since I have to get I basically have to shrink my body down I'm eating basically no carbs like starchy carbs at all I'm basically doing protein and veggies two two meals a day with a snack in between um and a protein shake once a day mainly um so it's really just meat and veggies for to low carbs eight eight weeks so this time I'll be able to have oh yeah this this this time I'll have a little bit of sweet potato yeah daily yeah thank god yeah well dude listen man I I I think it's really cool to hear you talk about you know the work ethic aspect you know out of all the guys that you fought and trained with who who do you respect the most for their work ethic who's a who's a guy that like you look at and you're like damn dude he gets it I think Eddie Alvarez yeah um and I say that too because I have inside scoop because I now I train with I train with my coaches you know Henry Hooft who was who is Eddie's coach I think for like four or five years he yeah Henry who is my my head coach right now cornered against me whenever when he coached Eddie against me when I lost my first fight yeah so it's you know it's kind of funny how I all come came full circle but it's numerous times he's been like you know you remind me of Eddie because it because I'm always like 30 minutes early to practice I'll already be rolling out by the time uh coach comes in or other guys are coming in because I want to get there a little bit early I want to I want to be stretched I want to be warmed up I want to be ready because when it's time to go I don't want to take me 30 minutes to get my get the juices you want to get good work yeah I want to get the good work in I already want to be ready he's like you know he's always said that and I'm like yeah and the funny thing between me and Eddie is like dude you cannot try to kill somebody for 25 well almost 50 minutes he and I had two of the best fights in MMA history um you cannot do that with somebody for that many minutes inside of a cage and not have a ton of respect for each other so we have a ton of respect for each other um those were fun fights and it's always good when you know a guy lives that life too right you know he's he he lives the champion lifestyle he does things right he's a good dude he's a family man it's it's the kind of guys that you're like dude this is you you deserve it I deserve it I believe I deserve it a little bit more I want to beat you but dude this is about to be a good one you know yeah that's awesome man yeah I was over thinking too man because when you had mentioned even like you know though that you went three fights losses back to back we're like how many days you said like six six hundred eighty eight man to go that long you know work all that time for this big climax of an event to have that even just that and then to deal with it one time how did you bounce back off of that well so there there is a little bit of a lesson in there and there's and and it was it was the way that I was conditioned right because the sport of wrestling the great the greatest thing about it is you're going to get 30 or 40 opportunities to wrestle per year right yeah if I lost a tough match on Wednesday I'm down on myself Wednesday night I get back to practice Thursday Saturday I get the opportunity to write that wrong to go from the very quick the lost column to the win column very quick you get another opportunity but in mixed martial arts it's like dude I mean I haven't fought since November 2022 and most of the time we're fighting when you get to the upper echelon and the higher levels you're fighting twice a year maybe three times a year but probably usually twice a year so you got to sit on that loss for five months six months right so the biggest thing for me was is getting back in the in the mistake that I made was right away I wanted to hide from it I kind of I didn't want to you kind of lose that motivation to train a little bit you're like is it like an embarrassment big time embarrassment man you know and it's in but now not anymore no no I get it I'm going to go through that to to realize it and anybody who is listening right now and if you have that it really is ego right people don't care that much yeah we we think people care more about us so much more about us than that's what you do right yeah and when you're in and almost like I said sometimes it's it's supposed to be a part of the journey it's supposed to be a part of your journey it's I was supposed to lose those fights or I was supposed to have this shortcoming because if a bad thing happens but a good thing comes from it was it really a bad thing and how many times if you had that play out in your life right and you'd ask you're like well a good thing come came from it so I that thing that I thought was a bad thing I can't really call it a bad thing anymore because it turned into a really good thing and a god having the palm of his hand the entire time and then it led to this and it led to that um but yeah the problem was losing the that fight and then going in like dealing with uncharted territory because I hadn't lost a competition since two or three years prior and wrestling and at and at that point it didn't really matter because I had just become an all-en-eric and I kind of got to where I wanted to go anyway um so I dealt with it in not in a great way not in a very mature way and uh and then I didn't get the opportunity to write that wrong for months and months and months it was probably six months that I had to sit out and go through a training camp figure out who's next who am I fighting next um and uh yeah it's just I I deal with losses so much better now and so much and maybe it's just you kind of just isn't it awesome though too I was thinking about that today they just the older you get you just don't care as much anymore when it comes to like dude I used to care so much about what people thought and used to care so I'm like I'm so solidly standing on my own two feet now and and the 50 if you thought like 15-year-old Michael saw the 38-year-old Michael he would be like ah how did you get there dude because I don't see how we get from here to there because we were we're on like another planet you know but it was just the constant every single day great things in my life and some of the tough things getting kicked right in the teeth and and this sport wants to keep you down as long as it as long as you will let it and it's up to you to pick yourself back up and been able to do it now for 16 17 years that's the key dude you know a lot of people they will they will get in those dark times and and they don't understand that that time is meant to build a new skill set to give you a new perspective and the only way that you can discover that is by continuing down the path there's so many people that have the hardship happen and then they stop right they get embarrassed they get they get because dude I'm gonna tell you this as much as you guys think it's embarrassing to start and be bad at something it's a million times more embarrassing to be great at something and have everybody in the world see if fucking fall on your face that's way worse and it is ego and and I do agree with you as you get older you start to realize it's not as big of a deal but I also think that that comes from us firmly understanding the work that needs to be done to get past that right I think when you're when I at least when I was younger and I felt I felt setbacks I didn't have enough confidence in the work the work that needed to be done to understand that I could pull myself out of it and and and and ignorantly but also thankfully I just got up the next day and kept going dude like I didn't know what else to do so I would get up and I would go and you know think dude I can't I mean most of my business life I live within weeks of being out of business people don't think that about entrepreneurs dude like you're you're living on the edge all the time you know until you get to a you know where we're at now it's not like that anymore but you know most of your life is an entrepreneur the first 10 minutes 10 plus years it's it's scary and you're going to take hits and sometimes those hits are nearly ending of your journey but like when you don't know what else to do you wake up the next day and you just keep doing what you've been doing and because people don't do that and they get embarrassed and they they get humiliated in their own mind I can relate to that bro I can relate to the hiding in the shame and the the embarrassment and the feeling of letting people down and if you guys just pushed through those times and you continue down the path what you'll figure out is what Michael's talking about which is dude this is here to serve you this is here to build you this is here to give you a new perspective and a new skill set which will eventually lead to a place like you were saying where you're standing on your own two feet and you have total real confidence in yourself not fake confidence not bravado beating my chest not running my mouth but knowing that if something negative comes around or I get a setback that it's not a total devastating loss it's exactly that it's a bump in the road it's a setback yeah what I mean what I did what I started doing to and I forced myself to do this you know when I take a loss I'm making sure I get on as big of a platform as I possibly can ASAP and talk about it right because right ego would say well let's just hide because if you get on the microphone all those people who doubted you and they're going to point the fingers now you're on a microphone you're talking about this loss you're reliving this loss in real time on a microphone and I I have forced myself to do that you know bust them with the boys I don't know if you do lose yeah dude will come to my first guy let's yeah that's right I say say loose guy yeah right so yeah so those guys are in Nashville too so I like to make it a habit winsel areas yeah win loser draw man I'm gonna try to go on the bus on Monday and I've done it with black eyes and still stitches yeah my nose you know my noses all jacked up from the the fight before the 48 hours prior because I want to do that because and it's not for the will and Taylor it's not for you it's not and honestly love my fans and supporters but it's not for anybody it's for me yeah so I can get on there and I can sit right here and say yeah you know what look at me look at my scars but this reminds you that I'm still here look at the black eyes look what I've gone through and if I can get on here and talk right now after I just had the whole world laughing at me in my mind and I can brave that and hop on this microphone you know it it well something up inside you and then once you've done it a couple times you're like man I got so much positive feedback from that because people want to see that they don't because they don't expect they expect you to not to lift out not to hiding necessarily but hey let him take some time off it's you know I'm doing this for me and I want to get on here and I'm gonna it's kind of like writing the wrong that we just talked about it's like I'm writing the wrong I'm taking the power away from it until you talk about it until you until you wear it like a badge of honor you own it yeah you're giving it all the power until you take that power back and say here it is it's right here you want to talk about it's okay and it's okay yeah because this is what this is what what what it is this is what it is and this is how it's supposed to happen those areas of us right will be broken the the weakest areas of us where we need to get better where we're falling short where we've got some ego where we've got all these shortcomings those little areas will break and then scar tissue would be laid over top of it and then you will be stronger in those areas where we were weak and that's it's it's life it's like it's life revealing to you where you need to get better let's talk about the technical aspect of improving from your losses yeah do you watch film yeah I was just about to ask that I really film study yeah yeah I mean I don't watch a ton of film I obviously got to go back and watch my fights back yeah wind loser draw obviously I love to watch the winds better than I love the loss of losses but that's another part of the healing process too it's like hey sit down here right now and watch it you know don't watch it too many times you don't want to sit there and have a negative mental highlight reel in my head no just to learn yeah I could have done this better is that what you do yeah and even just watching you know watching yourself whether it be technical whether it be spiritual because you can see those moments where you had a momentary lapse of judgment or you lost a little bit of focus or maybe you got a little bit tired or maybe you made a silly decision to see that on the film yeah and you can kind of see it because it because you start to have flashbacks a little bit and it's not necessarily because it's a fight and you're getting punched in the head that you don't really remember a lot of stuff you're just you're really in that kind of fight or flight mode you're tied on to a tornado so you're you don't remember a ton of it so you need to go back and then as you're watching it you're kind of starting to feel and see the mental glimpses in of what you remember in your mind and yeah just going back and and seeing different areas and then it's also a place of gratitude when loser draw you just go back and then you can hear the announcer's talking you know you're John Anakin Joe Rogan Daniel Cormier whoever it might be and you're watching it and you're like man I'm watching this movie happen and I'm the main character whether I win or lose it's another it's another cool way to to remind yourself man you're doing what you recall to do when loser draw you're not defined by your wins and losses you're defined about by how you care yourself and yeah take some notes talk to the coaches take a little bit of time off stay in shape and stay built up and start kind of the recovery process of the mind and the heart after a loss especially and continuing to be out in the public and and not be afraid to wear it like a badge of honor let me actually because you're obviously good I mean the people love you right like you have a shits on the support the people absolutely love you the NFL has armchair quarterbacks what's the UFC guy what do you ask all man yeah no how do you address those those those people you know Tom yeah no for sure um a C red bro yeah I was in there we got what I was all the dude was headed with the overhand right here yeah hold my beer I'll show you what I'm exactly no I mean oh we got a lot of them man and you know we'll have a special name for no I don't really think so I'm sure I'm sure the you know the the chat might have a delay you know later on what they call them but yeah dude I mean I actually just was talking to some guy today um and I sent him a message and just said hey I hate to sir but I hate to hear about the passing of your of your thread of videos that you that you made like 10 videos talking about how in idiot and I'm waiting for Connor and it's never Connor's never gonna come back and fight me and but fights never gonna get booked and all this kind of stuff so we kind of had a little banter back and forth and it's all funny games because I heard it from a million people um but yeah I mean you hear those people and it is just really funny and and and some of the sometimes you agree with them you're like yeah dude you go back and watch this in slow motion reverse it and watch it five times you're like yeah that was a dumb decision why did I do that or why didn't I do that yeah but what they don't realize is they are they are criticizing and critiquing something that was happening in real time making split second decisions with the information that you have part muscle memory part instinct part training and you just hope that you zig when you should have zagged or or vice versa or whatever and you're just in there you're in there responding and reacting so it is uh it is really funny because yeah I mean it especially mixed martial arts right because there's so many dudes who talk trash who would never in a million years say anything to me to my face or and that's what I've realized moving over to the UFC I mean I went from Bellator I was I was the biggest name in Bellator had the largest social media following in Bellator kind of the the the biggest name there and everybody saw the writing on the wall that I was going to test free agency the day that I signed with the UFC I got like 600,000 followers in like 24 hours right on just on Instagram and that's not in that doesn't mean I'm any cooler than anybody else but it was just pretty cool it was pretty cool how quickly it happened right and then I was like oh shoot man most of the time people were just talking to me because they liked me now it's like people just want to talk to me because they want to hate on me and it went to a way different level which is so good for me because I needed it I really am I got into the sport wanting everybody to love me and I'm like man if I just do the right things and I fight hard and I entertain them and I and I say what I believe and I do it people are gonna love me man everyone's gonna love me nobody's gonna dislike me oh you know it's like you know so I had to get over that and it was really good it was a very immature thing I mean you you know like yeah and and even hearing you speak and the way that you operate and and and you've unlocked things in me because it really is a blessing to be in a in a position where people are hating on you because it means you're doing something right yeah but I was I wasn't ready for it um and now with the whole counter thing now it's about to go to the moon so I'm gonna have to continue to add layers to my skin when you're authentic when you are an authentic human being you are gonna have people are gonna hate you dude like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what it doesn't matter just for that bro it's exactly yeah they're gonna hate the way that you show up that you shine bro you don't it's not even about being successful it's just about being authentic people do not like people with authentic opinions they are very used to seeing people pander they are very used to seeing people go with the flow or tip toe around and when you show up like we do every day and we're like this is what I think regardless of what you think people don't like that in order to say and and and it doesn't matter if you are curing cancer or if you're solving world hunger or you're creating world peace people are still gonna be pissed off about it man and so many people hide behind trying to avoid that criticism when in reality if you are doing something of any significance at all the fact that people are giving you that sort of attention is that is a really good sign and what's really cool is that at least in my case and I know this is your case too because I've seen it a lot of people start off hating they're like God dude I can't stand that guy oh yeah we're done all he ever does is talk shit be desired yeah and then and then after six months they're like this man you know what I used to and how like you dude but I really like you yeah yeah that is my favorite thing because because and you know is a good example of that right now is a guy named Bo Nickel he was Bo I like Bo Nickel's the first one oh there you go so Bo is exactly like he is in a lot of ways yeah he's he got booed yeah you know he got booed at the weigh-ins or he's he got a little bit of boo in the crowd for no reason just the fact that that he's getting this this love from the UFC and he's getting he's getting pushed and he's being promoted and and there was the same thing with me I came into the UFC and everybody's like who's this Bellator punk getting this and getting that I got a title shot on my second fight and I'm like guys first of all I didn't choose this it wasn't like I came in and in all of a sudden I'm in charge of Dana and Dana's making his decisions like this is how they're doing it and don't be mad at me right and a year in and I talked to Bo about this too man because they're gonna hate on you because because they they see it and maybe their favorite fighter is this guy and you're getting more shine than that guy everybody's got their reasons why they don't like you right and then but then eventually you're just like man and I think Bo said that in his post fight press conference or in his post fight speech he was just like hey just give it time I promise you're good you're gonna like me like and that's kind of what I said I'm like dude there's no reason why you should dislike me just give it time in my favorite my favorite interactions are those ones where it's like dude I didn't like you when he came into the UFC because of this because of that or whatever it might have been but dude I've come around I'm like me winning you over is actually so much better than me you liking me from the get yeah liking me from the get go because all you can do is just be authentically yourself and I think it is it is unbecoming to so many people because because they're living a life of they're living a life of knowing that they're not being their authentic self and when they see somebody operating in authenticity it feels weird to them you know and I and I think I was somewhat like that when I was younger right well yeah bro you know and then and I've as I've grown we all try to be what we think the success part of looks like yeah you know and and what we don't realize brother is that it looks like us it looks like who we are yeah you know and we live in social media where it's all marketing and it's all look at me and it's all clicks and likes and shares and when you're an authentic person especially when you're a person who doesn't buy into the debatury of society and it makes people feel weird you know that makes people feel like you're being too good or you're standing on a pedestal which dude I know this in your case that is not the case at all yeah and yeah and that's the I think that's the toughest ones for me is where people like I don't know there's just something about him I don't think it's I don't think it's authentic I don't think that's really who he is and I'm saying I don't know man whatever yeah those people say everybody like what it is so many skeletons in my closet and I was like I don't know dude whatever I am perfect I'll tell you that but show me your first sorry you don't like me but well I think that's where people get in trouble too as they pretend to be perfect yeah you know they're like oh yeah I'm a perfect guy I've never made any mistakes fuck dude I fucked it all up yeah all the shit you know what I'm saying well you know what's funny for me too was going on to the ultimate fighter and I had this surreal conversation with my wife I was just like hey babe I'm I got to be honest I'm like really nervous because you know we're on ESPN and it's like it's you're mic'd up and you know I'm something's gonna happen I'm gonna end up mother F and Connor saying whatever in like and it ended up happening you know it really ended up happening and I'm like and I'm like worried about my father-in-law who I respect like like it's like respect them so much my parents and my sons my like it lives on the internet forever my sons will hear me you know say the F word on ESPN and they bleeped it out to Connor when we got got our little you know put pushing match but my wife who I like obviously she's my favorite human being on the planet the one that I can fight in the one that I love the most out of anybody and she just looked at me she's like hey you're not perfect don't try to be perfect if you try to be perfectly it's not real you're not perfect I love you that you're not perfect I love you through your imperfections and if you swear you cuss or you do this you do that or you come off anyway you come come off it doesn't matter I love you and everybody who really loves you loves you I'm like absolutely dang dude I'm about to cry you know as you're like yeah and then it gave me that permission because it really is a scary thing because you don't I don't want to come off differently than than I want to be right I just want to be myself and do it and if something bad happens or I say something I wish I wouldn't have said I might have to apologize or maybe I don't need to apologize well bro I think that the fact that you know how I see that I see that from a little bit different perspective I see that as a testament to how hard you you put the effort in to not be that way yeah right like if you're just how you are where you don't really curse and you're you're very composed and you have a good disposition and your polite and respectful sometimes when that gets out a whack a little bit it actually just is a testament to how hard someone works to keep that in check yeah and so that's how I see those yeah no I like that I yeah because it because it definitely came out you know yeah I'm like wow whatever but the let's be real dude in a fight situation there are no rules yeah exactly yeah exactly and the funny thing was was that my father and I was was visiting that day to Vegas whenever that whole fight thing happened and I just got done mother effing Connor or whatever everybody was it was funny too because now that it's happened I'm like that was actually wasn't that bad yeah once again and it's weird how as a 38 years old I'm like dealing with this and I'm still learning the uncharted territory of of that right and you're like and to people who are out there like well Michael Chandler looks like he's got all figured out I'm like dude I'm trying to get this thing figured out every single day yeah bro dude can we talk a little bit about your faith yeah yeah man so yeah dude so so was this something that you grew up with or something that you came around or so high right yeah yeah on high Ridge Boulevard there was a little Catholic church up there so we I was raised Catholic we did you know our first holy communion and we did PSR which is public school religion on Mondays we would go there for hour or two on Mondays first holy communion got confirmation and then we kind of stopped going to church for a little while you know three boys baseball getting you know very very busy family and then I got invited by another guy from St. Louis who was on my wrestling team to his name is Kenny Bowen to twin rivers church on Lima Ferry test on ferry one of the two and he's like hey man we got this youth group that we got on Wednesday nights you know we're gonna go after practice I'm like sure dude I don't have a car but if you want to pick me up let's go so that was the first time that I kind of started going to like a spirit filled non denominational church and then after I started going then my brother started going then my mom and dad started going so that was kind of our first introduction to kind of a spirit filled church if you will that's where I really got saved it was 14 15 years old and it was an invitation started with an invitation from a guy who I looked up to is a year older than me Kenny Bowen all the girls loved him he was cutie was handsome he was an athlete like he was the guy right but he was also a really really great dude so that's not always the best yeah dude and at the best when you meet someone who's got all the skill all the talent got all the stuff and you find out that they're even a better dude yeah dude that's the best like it's you know and that's the guys that I always kind of gravitated towards and then wanted to be obviously and then um so yeah I mean that's when I really really when I got saved and then you know it's been my guiding light since then um and it definitely in all sunshine and rainbows and just because you got you know Jesus in your heart and you've accepted them that all of a sudden things are gonna work out for you you know your test your your faith is tested every single day um but it's been the one thing obviously that I've been able to look back on and be like man once again looking at this whole big picture right the bad things that have happened to me that that ended up being good and how God's having the palm of his hand the entire time whether it be through the right person through the wrong person through the ups through the downs through everything it's just been um you know and then now to have a platform where I can you know I don't talk a ton about my faith but it's it's my favorite it shines through bro it shines through it my two favorite kind of philosophies about faith for me and this is how I do it right is live your life with so much joy and zeal and happiness that uptight Christians question your salvation all right that's number one um and number two preach the gospel at all times but but only use words when necessary right you are a living testimony the way that you operate the way that you live your life the way that you love people um the way that you compete the way that you just live life is your your your testimony and your expression of your faith you don't I don't have to sit here and talk to you about my favorite scriptures or try to get every single person that I talk to saved because it's not the right time for the right or it might be the right person but the wrong time and everybody's going through their different things and if I can be a light in that way and uh and that's that's what feels authentic to me and that's how I share my faith as much as possible bro I'd be honest with you uh just knowing you and and observing that part of you has inspired me in that way just so you know thank you man yeah it's it's really cool and I recognize that you live it and um it's just what it's it's one of the things I admire most about you bro then because you've been at the top of the world you're one of the most famous guys in the world um in the most famous sport in the world and you've never let that change who you are and you've always continued to live that message and and be a good dude and uh you are that dude you know what I'm saying you're that guy that I'm talking about when you say you meet this guy who's got this and this and this and this and then you find out dude this guy's even a better human and um it's one of it's my favorite thing about you bro dude thank you man this is cool man yeah and um that's that's uh because I do hear it a lot where people I mean I really thank thank you for talking about your faith and to me I don't really feel like I talk about it that much and in a very uh I think in a very uh formal way if you will right because you think like what is it what is it what does it sound like to talk about your faith right do we have to talk scripture do we have to say talk about God's perspective on every single every single thing do we have to you know do we have to operate as Jesus would do it you know how do you do it I mean I think the biggest thing is is if the Holy Spirit is inside of you and you try to do your best and you're just operating in that way he doesn't have to he doesn't necessarily want you to be talking about him all the time he just wants you to be a shining light to live it just to just live it yeah that's really preaching the gospel at all times but only using words when necessary only quoting scripture when necessary I love you know and and people can tell people can tell how you by how you live your life most of the time where your faith is at and that's a lot more effective than a lot like you said the uptight Christians you know like that one yeah I'm a little uncomfortable I like that one well we see this we see this as a society right now right because things have gotten so far out of control that people are morality people are finding Jesus again which is awesome but what we're what I'm seeing and observing is like people are going so far to where they're standing on their little pedestal and they're preaching at you trying to say this and then really when you look at him you're like well bro are you actually living that or are you just good at quoting the numbers and the passages and this and that yeah and I personally believe in by by no means am I an expert but I personally believe that leading the way in that and how you live how you treat people how kind you are how graceful you are and that doesn't mean that sometimes you don't have to stand for yourself or you know Jesus flips some tables over once in a while you know what I mean he wasn't a pacifist but I think that's far more important and far more impactful than someone who just preaches all the time yeah no one one thousand I think I think it's damaging a lot of times I think a lot of people are so preachy that people who are kind of on their way to finding it are like oh man we all feel it yeah we all feel that whenever you're whenever you're around somebody who you're just like dude you you are unattainable like nobody wants somebody who's nobody wants to really be around nobody wants would you really want to be a Christian if it if it seems like the level at which you need to be to be a good little boy and a good little Christian it's it's unbecoming and it makes it makes me feel uncomfortable yeah right you know you're not good enough yeah like and that's the that is the biggest problem right right like like God doesn't call the qualified he qualifies the called he he is qualifying you every single day whether whether you are whether you like you said no every single chapter in verse or you're absolutely perfect or you have screwed every single thing up but you've had a change of heart and you're trying to work your way you know back into being a man of faith and walking in a certain direction and a lot of times man it's those who have gone through the craziest things the most embarrassing things the most the most painful sinful down in the dumps down in the valley things that God uses the most man those are the people who I can look at him and say yeah but look where he came from and look what God did with his life and look at how look at the testimony that he has and you know you can't have a testimony without a without a few scars man you know because it is it's on it's on it's unattainable you know and then there's there's people who you know like a guy like Tim Tibo you know he's he's very very every single thing that he talks about is his faith driven right and that's what feels authentically to him and that's his calling right it feels authentic from him from him yeah from him and he's he's got a calling on his life for sure and he's that guy but but if if you were like hey man I need you to be a little bit more like Tibo I'd be like hey dude it's not you I don't know yeah that's my thing yeah and that's does that make him it does that mean when we stand at the pearly gates we're not both walking waltz and right in you know no we both are but my testimony is different and I actually did a podcast with Brian Tom who's a pastor and we we were talking back and forth and we were kind of talking about you know because I've spoken at churches before I've spoken at men's conferences I've spoken on you know on the at the pulpit right and and you'd be so surprised at how many people you would think we'd be like well dude how can this guy be a fighter and a Christian it's like well fighting is just the science shiny object right we've all got that we've all got these talents and these gifts and these shiny objects that get people to look both the followers and the non followers and the people who have not come to Christ yet we've all got that shiny thing that we can say hey this is this is going to get you to look now peel back the layers and now let me make you feel something right now through our interaction mine just happens to be fighting in a cage and it's no more it's no more better or worse than anybody else is calling on their life because you know in this pastor said this Brian said he's like man you are reaching people that I would never in a million years be able to reach right right that if you look at it just straight from a faith standpoint and you say well this guy fights in a cage and he can win this many but this guy's a preacher and he can win this many it's not it's not crazy to think that I have a greater crowd of witnesses and I have I have some impact that I can make that leads maybe not that person to me to then give their life to Christ but that person to the next rung to the next rung but I was one of the catalysts that started that right that's the way that I look at it and the way that I operate is just authentically to myself and speaking about it when I want to or or me to or when I'm asked about it or when I feel led to um but that's one of the biggest things God doesn't call he doesn't call the qualified he qualifies the called and he he will well something up inside of you and at different times different seasons right once again the fighter that I am today needed to go through that lost streak or needed to go through this self doubt and needed to go through that needed to have this upbringing that's the that's the faith journey in a nutshell right as long as it eventually leads to this one spot you're going to go through these different seasons and you might and it might be it might be the right path and might and you might be the right person but it just might not be time yet might not be the right time you know I love it I love it I love it so what's so so what's after fighting man um now I know this but I want people to hear and support yeah I mean after fighting man you know so I'm involved in a couple of different companies both through investment and then kind of leadership roles and you know I have a fitness app that I work on and we're building the community I mean obviously fitness is always going to be a part of my life and it's and it's changed my life it's made me a living it's made me a platform it's made me everything right if I hadn't found the sport or for the wrestling and then it turned me into the man that I am today um you know I just I just owe a debt of gratitude to fitness and making people find the best versions of themselves right so continue to work on my businesses build that um I want to speak on stages I want to write I want to just impact as many people as possible um both you know in front of the camera behind the camera on the microphone behind the microphone um and just leave my mark on this planet um you know when I get done fighting and it's really great too like hearing you know we have a lot of the same friends who have who have kind of always said the same thing man it's like you're the fortune you're gonna make and the impact that you're gonna make and the platform that you're gonna make is gonna be tenfold after you lay the gloves down like how long dude I don't know you know you kind of you kind of you know you kind of get into that mode we're like really dude well okay well if you see if you see that man I want to I'm gonna keep on working and I'm gonna keep on talking yeah keep on getting after it and uh you know I I just see myself in a position to be able to use the the lessons that I've learned through the last 23 years of of 24 years of hand-to-hand combat and it's uh it's similarities to the fights that all of us are going through in every single aspect of our life and uh turning it into a masterpiece that's gonna be able to reach the masses yeah and you're close to some of the best entrepreneurs in the world I know you're really good with with ed you're close to ed uh you're close to Dana you know Dana's and people see Dana on the USC but they fail to realize how intelligent and how smart he is as a business man so smart man bro and and and and it was really revealed this weekend and I'm really really happy that it happened but you saw there was 300,000 dollar bonuses this weekend yeah max Holloway won six hundred thousand dollars in bonuses so there's four bonuses one bonus each for the two guys in the in the fight of the night and then one performance of the night and one knockout of the night normally there are 50,000 dollar bonuses which isn't a bad night at the office for a bonus one of the reporters asked hey UFC 300 you should up into 300,000 and about one second later he goes done and he just and it's badass it was very bad ass and I almost tweeted it and I talked to Dana a little bit after the fights via kind of voice notes and stuff but when I was negotiating with Dana it was he and I and he made me an offer and I asked for I think it was like 30% more you know like Dana what's holding you back from you know 30% more he's like you know what kid fuck it done and I was just like and that's how Dana talks right yeah and uh that so hearing the word done it just it it it made me remember if you bring enough to the table the problem is don't out point your coverage the promise don't don't take all the meat off the bone man don't make it make it a make it a win for them and yeah right yeah don't yeah make it make it a win win man make it make it so that if you win they're like dang we got a great investment if you lose they're like dang man well at least we didn't at least he didn't come in and swing for the fence as it you know yeah so it was really cool and I what's really funny about Dana and the UFC is I just don't understand you know obviously he gets a ton of a ton of flack for not paying the fighters enough and fighter pay in this nap man but he's taking care of guys so much better than I think a lot of people even realized well also too nobody sees the inter like people dude people think that you get a bottle of protein here and it cost you 50 cents and you're selling it for 60 bucks that's that's they when they look at the UFC they don't think about you know all the expense all the operating costs all the things that it takes to run a business they don't nobody thinks about those things they just think they they do the math how many people watched yeah how much was it ticket how much was the ticket how much are the how much are the the ad revenue they don't even think about the sponsorship because they don't think that far ahead yeah and then they say okay well everybody should be making a hundred million dollars and it's hard to have now see the superpower that I have and why I think why I have such a great relationship with the with the UFC and why I will always love the UFC as I have the I have the unique perspective of the other organizations right and Bellatore was the number two organization in the world and I would watch how the UFC would promote their fights and I don't think it's crazy to say that the UFC spends more money promoting one fight than Bellatore spent the entire year on promotion the UFC was continuing to elevate the game of mixed martial arts the whole sport of mixed martial arts and Bellatore PFL won championship all these other organizations were just rising with the tide that the UFC was raising and I and I said that the Dana and he actually just uh he actually just talked to me yesterday about this sent me the voice notes we were kind of so he's like because I basically thanked him hey hey man it's been a long journey glad we got this thing done can't wait to go out there and put on a crazy show on June 29th and he was kind of reminiscing about my first phone call with Dana basically he was on he was on the tarmac in Las Vegas about to head out to somewhere we're talking for like five minutes we're having a great back and forth conversation and I said this and it's a hundred percent true it was just as just as true then as it is now and even five years prior I said Dana number one I didn't know I don't I don't know if I would have been the man that you needed me to be a couple of years ago when I had these other opportunities these other opportunities to come over to the UFC so I'm really happy happy it's happening right now and you have not paid me one dollar you have not signed your name on one of my checks over the last 12 years but indirectly your name has been on every single one of my checks because you have built and quarterbacked and championed this entire sport and then Dana's like oh my god I love it he basically hangs up hangs up on me calls hunter calls you back and he said hey dude I know we got some sticking points but dude I don't know what you've been saying to my people but they absolutely love you I love you I've always known we've loved you you're awesome you're every single thing that we need and we want you to come over we're gonna get you whatever we need to get you to come over to the UFC and that's how the conversation went and then and but it wasn't it wasn't a negotiation tactic it wasn't a ploy no it wasn't it was it was so genuine and it is true man it's like and they get they take so much flack but of course they do because the the tallest nail is always gonna get hammered you know and they're gonna continue to get hammered and they're gonna continue to keep looking down while everybody else is is you know trying to grab their anchor and pull them down instead of trying to just reach up to the next rung they're trying instead of them reaching themselves up and trying to get themselves to the next rung they're trying to reach up and pull the UFC down and that's just never a recipe for success man and and the way that he operates man it's it's a it's a special man and it's it's a blessing to be a part of it I think he's such a great example for for a lot of business owners who are afraid to stand for what they believe in and speak for what they believe in now you don't have to agree I happen to agree I loved anyone yeah yeah like I got to agree in this I got this little I got this little note in my phone you know because dude I catch a lot of shit right like yeah you don't say what the what we say and not catch stuff get a little some couple of chair court hey listen the best part about it is I become immune to it it does not affect me I think the best part about I have this note what the people came back came back like I'll show you right yeah yeah exactly no not me we yeah but but I have this note in my phone this is like I don't know five years ago and it says like for when the when the heat would come it would always it's just says very simply what would they know why do what would he say yeah and you know what I just follow that blue pick I'm like you know what hey fuck you this is what I do if you don't like it turn the channel and once again like it's it's very it's it's very hard for people to see that because you're like dude I don't like that guy because he is so confident in himself I don't like because he really does not care like I don't like him because all the things that I have to deal with all the thing all my doubts and fears and insecurities that bother me all the stuff that bothers me I don't like him because he doesn't have to deal with what I have to deal with you know and it really is tough tougher in 2024 than it was in 1924 because of social media and the world that we live in now and keeping up with the Joneses and all of the stuff I will admit and I will concede that it is tougher to live in the world that we live in from that standpoint absolutely criticism stay yeah it's easier to make yeah didn't have to you didn't have to see it back yeah it's easier to make money it's easier to be successful it's easier to do all those things because the internet and all these different things but it is very challenging from that perspective so when we see somebody like that or a guy like yourself and like damn dude I don't like him it's like well do you not like him why don't you like him you just don't like him because you wish you were more like that I mean I want to be more like that yeah everybody wants to be more like that that is that is freedom yeah and that really is you get this short window of opportunity to live on this earth right and if you can operate the way that he's operating man well you got to stand in the fire dude like that's the thing people don't understand like when you don't stand in the fire right when you don't let the heat come and you just censor yourself first of all you're degrading your own sense of worth you're saying I'm not being authentic I'm not being who I am for fear of judgment for fear of criticism and that will drive your self-esteem yourself worth your trust in yourself into the basement because you know you're not presenting what you truly believe and if you would just stand out in the heat a little bit it's like getting out in the sun bro the first day you get burnt you're like oh man yeah I should have put some some block on right not really because I don't need you yeah I know I get darker than you actually got burned the other day actually but but dude we're we're in a situation you get immune to it like you're like yeah that you get conditioned to it it's like a cold plunge yeah like you're the first time you're in the cold plunge you're like oh dude this is horrible and then you you get it more and more and more and more and before you know it you're in there for eight minutes at 35 degrees and you're like bro this is the best part of my day yeah you know and and dude so when you get in that six if people would just step out and just allow themselves to feel it eventually you become conditioned to it and it doesn't bother you it's just like anything else it's like when you start to go out and train the first day it's hard second day it's hard and then it gets like kind of really hard for a minute and then all the sudden you acclimate and it gets easy yeah and uh and because people can't stand out there and take it the first time or the second time or the third time they don't realize that like if you would just stand there and and stand on your own two feet this stuff would stop stop killing you man yeah and I think and I think you might have been the first person that ever really hear like kind of drill it into this this idea of being able to trust yourself yeah this this idea of like self image how do you have a high self image if you can't trust yourself I mean we've we've we've talked about it 20 different ways about yeah doing the small things and setting a certain standard because you know when you're that's another part of it when you when you when you cut corners are you lazy or you you leave your shopping cart sitting over there you do or you litter whatever that's you know whether you thought about it or not or you felt entitled enough to leave your hotel room a mess because the cleaning lady is going to take care of it you're you're losing a little bit of trust with yourself to get the job done so whether it's fighting in a cage or whether it's running a business or whether it's running a household or whether it's being a parent how are you going to be able to trust yourself in those moments if you know you can't get small little things done and and that's that's something that I think you you you just spoke about but people probably just heard it and didn't they kind of glossed over it you really are breaking a promise to yourself every single time you don't stand up for what you believe in that's right every single time that you every single time that you water yourself down every single time that you you comp there was actually had a mindset coach named Jim Henson he called it moving the truth right it's kind of like omitting the truth but you're moving the truth like it's not really the truth but you're moving the truth you make it to accommodate others yeah you make up you make up a story or you or you you say sorry for this when really you're not sorry because you're doing what you're doing what it was authentically yourself you're breaking the trust and promise that you have with yourself and you do it long enough before you know it you're a shell of the man that you were called to be and you I owe it to my family I owe it to life I owe it to my god my creator I owe it to society and I got I 100% honest we fail you even you you're you seem like you're and he maybe even Dana every now and then there might be those moments where oh for sure you know like okay I probably should have just said what I wanted to say there for sure but that's that unlocks things too where you're like okay that Dana's imprinted in penisable he always says what's on his mind I'm sure he's got those moments where yeah but when they become more and more far and few between you're not a hundred thousand percent trust worthy but it's 99.9 percent and 99.9 percent is a heck of a place to be yeah dude you know I get criticized a lot for my positions on things in the world obviously but like first of all I don't expect everybody to agree with me that's not the purpose of me sharing them the purpose of me sharing them is to give my take on it right I feel like I have an a skill set and a knowledge base I have enough life experience to give a reasonable take that should be considered and you know people will say to me they will say why don't you just take it easy on this or why don't you just because dude if I don't say what I believe to be true if I do not say exactly what I believe to be true I am lowering all of the qualities that I need to operate as a human being and if we would just look at it instead of saying oh just let people do whatever they want let dude there's limits to that there's limits to this because eventually when we're pacifying other people and moving the truth to your point we do become we lose our confidence we lose our swagger we lose our belief in self that we need to be us like you can't walk out in the middle of a ring in front of a hundred million people on television or whatever it is right and not think you're the man bro yeah like you have to and it has to be real it has to be real dude and that requires being authentic to self as a baseline foundation and you know I think if people would consider what not being authentic does to their character and does to their belief in themselves they would be a lot more likely to do so yeah and I think it's kind of what I what I said earlier because I was just thinking about it how the older you get you just start caring less and less yeah and is it that you care less and less or is it that you know what it feels like to move the truth and not be authentically yourself that eventually you just start to be like no wait why have I done that for so long and and then and then obviously there's usually the older you get there's more success or the older you get now maybe you've got a wife and kids and you got people or you got your company has now tripled quadrupled 10 extra time in size right so it doesn't matter you've just got more and more life experience and you care less also because you know you used to care and you used to move the truth and you used to pander and you used to water yourself down and it really was just so inauthentic yeah and it bothered me like it like any time I've ever done that in my life I like what dude I remember it forever for like years yeah I'm like fuck I can't wait till I see that guy again because I'm gonna tell him the truth this time that's what I think that's I think when I get the maddest yeah it's really hard for somebody else to steal my joy and and make me mad at them yeah and it's funny too because me and my wife are very similar right like and that's how it is when she gets her most upset it's never anybody else because it's like dude someone can't do that someone can't do enough to you to make you as mad as you could probably get at yourself when you know you've made a mistake or pandered or man this is not who I am why did I do this why did I just tell him this is what I want this is how I want it to be this is how it should be and I deserve it not in a cocky entitled way but like this is what we got to do right you know and that's when you get really mad at yourself right and it's and it's uh that's when I get and I will remember it right but it also sometimes you need to go through that also to to finally put you back in line yeah yeah to put you back in line but also I feel like sometimes that's a little bit of a an inadvertent that you probably shouldn't let it happen but each time it does happen you're getting closer and closer to that person who just doesn't give a heck yeah like I don't give a rip dude you know and it helps you and it doesn't mean you got to be it doesn't mean you're gonna take advantage of people be a bad person not a person of integrity do bad things you do and really really good things but I'm just not gonna sacrifice who I am and how I do things that's right you know well actually this man like like give me a give me a straight fucking answer the first time that Bruce announced you how was that dude my my first experience of fighting in the UFC was I've had some really really really great moments in my entire career but that one was extra extra special so I mean yeah I get those two good chills you're getting chills thinking about it because yeah when it happened because it's one of those deals where I've watched the UFC from afar from so long and I've got to be honest with you I've done interviews where I'm like yeah I deserve to be in the UFC but I didn't really truly believe it you know when I was a little bit younger and then I needed to get to the point where I finally believed it and I deserved it and I knew I I almost forced the door to open about four or five years ago because I went through three different contract renewals or four different contract renewals with UFC or with Bellator each time I was gonna have the opportunity to become a free agent take a chance to go to the UFC and each time it just never felt like the right time until it felt like the exact right time which was you know 2020 when it happened and I was taking a chance on myself I was leaving relative I was leaving relative security Bellator love me they were paying me very well I was gonna come over to the UFC I thought I was gonna take a pay cut turns out I did not take a pay cut and I was very pleasantly surprised um but I was still taking a chance I still there's a lot of people who were like I mean you know and even my wife you know for for years it's like well we got a great thing going but I want you to do what you want to do and I was like yeah babe but if I go there if I go to a barbecue it's over I'm getting cut she's like is that what you want to do I'm like yeah that's what I want to do because I wasn't gonna be able to lay my I pictured the 40-year-old me the 42-year-old me retired laying in bed at night and I just cannot get comfortable because my head is laying on this 40-pound center block of why did you not go test yourself against the best guys the biggest the baddest the best guys in the world why did you not take a chance in yourself you walked on to Mizzou nobody knew who you were everyone from high-risk Missouri was like hey dude why don't you just go to Mizzou Baptist or why don't you just go to CMS you they're offering you scholarship you did it back then how could how could 18-year-old Michael make that choice but 34-year-old Michael can't make that choice after all of God's faithfulness after all the things that you've done right but that moment when I was walking out there to that first fight in the UFC man you can just see the joy like it was it was I knew I was right where I was supposed to be I would and I had zero doubts whatsoever which most of the time I do luckily walking into the cage but that was it was a special special night Dan Hookers number five in the world knock him out in the first two and a half minutes he had just went 25 minutes with Dustin Porier the number two guy in the world at that point and yeah Bruce announced the name and finally watching the UFC from a far hearing Bruce Buffett from afar all those years and now he's saying iron Michael Chandler man it's so that's pretty crazy dude we're gonna wrap it up because I we got some other stuff to do too yeah we got some other stuff yeah but some more some more spotty more you got some more views in this guy so dude let me before we go I like I like to close with with just one thing um what's what's your message to Connor I'm just kidding let's go you know actually I would actually like to clear something up so I actually uh I got to ask this a little while back before the fight was announced and I'm like what's the message to Connor you know Ed and I have been talking about this a lot and he's like the thing we're going to hammer home Michael is that you have earned this you really really have and I know there's got to be a tiny little part of you that little guy from that little town it was talked to do little things that I always talk about he's still in there and there's a part of you that's like hey man yeah you're here but you haven't earned it you don't deserve it right and I'm like yeah no there's there's there's always that little inkling in all of us right he's like but we got a hammer home that you earned this right you have yeah and I and I and I answered this question um a couple of weeks ago and I was getting a little bit of hate from it for it because it kind of came off like hey Connor hasn't earned it and I have earned it we must be very clear Conor McGregor was the best thing for mixed martial arts ever ever in the history of the sport he has built the sport he I'm making more money because of him the next fighters making more money because of him more people know us because of him he's elevated the sport the UFC has done a lot of that as well Conor McGregor has earned every single thing that he's ever gotten he's probably earned more he probably could have made more had there not been some other things decisions that he has made he has done every single thing that he needs to do to be exactly where he is at but when it comes to the last couple years when it comes to who's going to put more work in who has been putting more work in who has been more steadfast more removable more disciplined I'm the guy who has earned it right that's fantastic I'm I'm the guy who stepping into that cage when I do finish him and his eyes roll back in the back of his head I'm not going to feel anything but I am very very blessed man and I earned this and I deserve this and I think I finish him in the second round let's go all right one thing this is what I was really gonna ask sorry I love it I just hijacked I just hijacked you no no I loved it but what I really want to ask because I think it's important because we have a lot of young hungry ambitious people that listen to the show if you could go back from where you are now and you said earlier you couldn't see that 15 year old connecting the dots to be where you are now what would your message be to the young men and the young women and that 15 year old Michael Chandler who is filled with uncertainty and uncertain about the path and really can't connect the dots they know they want to get somewhere but they're not sure how to do it what would that message be man I think the message is going to be it's all going to work out and never ever ever grow weary and doing good people are going to try to put you into a box people are going to tell you do that you have to live your life this way you have to talk like this you have to walk like this you have to do this you have to act like this these are the things this is what society says that you have to do this is what we say you need to do this is what your parents say you need to do this is what your friends say you need to do there's going to be all of these conflicting things and then you're going to get into your path and then there's going to be even more people talking and and And the road to where ever way you're going to go and there's going to be so much uncertainty because you're not quite sure how to build it. If you step on that square right there, is it a foothold? Is it going to fall out underneath you or is it going to take you to the next step? You're not quite sure. All you can do is boil it all the way back down to still it all the way back down to just operating with integrity and doing the best, becoming the best version of yourself brick by boring brick and doing the small little things. Because yeah, when I was younger, if you would have told me that I was going to be sitting here on the cusp of 75 days away from the pinnacle of what mixed martial arts is, I would have thought you were absolutely crazy. I would have I would have told you right there, don't you bring, don't you bring that energy toward me right now because I feel like you're lying to me. There is no way that that is going to happen. And then eventually you get to the point where you look back at that 15 year old boy and you think, man, I'm so proud of you for never giving up and I'm proud of you for making those decisions. I'm proud of you for walking on. I'm proud of you in the face of adversity. You pulled yourself back up. I'm proud of you for the way that you've operated and I'm proud of you for never, ever wavering because it's going to be the things that kept you small, the things that suppressed you. The things that held you down that will eventually springboard you into something that is so much bigger than you ever thought could ever, ever be possible. You're going to get the opportunities for the big, big things because of the things that kept you small, because of the things that held you down, because of the things that you hated yourself for and the way that you did operate and how you were afraid in the fear and the doubt and all of that, all of that stuff is the reason you're going to get this opportunity. So just stay steadfast in that. And as long as you're doing what you can do, as long as you're doing the best that you can do, it might not be tomorrow. It might not be next week, but eventually the hard work will pay off, but you still have to be standing there to receive it when it does. Bro, I love that, man. Dude, thank you so much, man. This has been an awesome conversation. This has been an amazing show. It's one of my favorite conversations we've ever had. And 75 days, bro. 75 days. I give you my word. I'm going to go as hard as I can go for the next 75 days, just to support. That's going to be my way to support, all right? And I know there's going to be a lot of people listening that will do the same. We're going to get behind you in this fight. So I would say good luck. But I don't think you need it. I know you're going to show up every day and I know you're going to do the work. Here I'm proud to be your friend. I'm proud to have you as part of first form. I'm proud of who you are as a man and you're a great example for everybody listening, including myself and bro. I just appreciate you, man. Thank you, bro. It's an honor to be here. Thank you for this. And I'm proud to be part of first form and what you have created here because I'm extremely, extremely proud of it. Well, it's day one, bro. Day one, baby. That's right. Day one.
