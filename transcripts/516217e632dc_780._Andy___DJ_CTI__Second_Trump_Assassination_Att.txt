Just Working through the week has been a long interesting weekend. Yeah, it has man, you know, I really fucked up As you guys know, I made some comments last Thursday's podcast that I quite honestly just didn't fucking mean and You know, it's interesting because I think we've all done that. I think we've all said things we don't mean in certain environments, but You know that usually happens at like work or in the bathroom or at a party when you had a little too much to drink and It doesn't happen in front of the whole world. So it's been a it's been a interesting experience It's been a learning experience You know, I spent a lot of time the last few days being honestly very disappointed in myself You know these these people who have supported for 20 plus years a lot of them are very upset with me and rightfully so and It's been a hard man because These are people that I've tried to support my entire life my entire career and it just hurts dude, you know what I'm saying You know, but but but with that being said, I will say You know, I know you guys are upset. I know a lot of you guys are upset I have had a lot of really good conversations. I've met some really cool people. In fact, I met a couple women Officers who have had you know violent experiences as female officers. I did a podcast Called the 50 podcast with Haley you guys could check that out if you want to check that out. You know You know after talking to them. There's a lot of things I just didn't realize man, you know because I don't look at I don't look at women Officers and think like okay, I don't have to listen to them contrary to what it might have sounded like and I after talking with them You know, it was crazy to hear like how Resistant men are to their authority in general and that made me feel real bad especially because you know I know you guys have a lot of we have a lot of young men that listen to the show and you know One thing I thought about over the weekend that never really occurred to me is that you know I've never had kids. I'm not that that didn't occur to me, but you know I've never had kids and usually when people have kids They start to realize that the weight of their words carry a little more weight with people and I Think I was delayed and really realizing that because like guys. I don't think I'm a big deal, bro I go here. I go home. I do the podcast. I know it's a big show, but like I'm just a normal dude You know what I'm saying and I don't think of myself as some fucking like contrary to what some of you guys may think some fucking you know Celebrity internet select whatever fuck you want to say. I don't think of myself like that And so because I don't do anything outside of here, you know, I Sometimes I forget that there's so many people listening and so many people that carry the weight of the words and That was pointed out to me a number of times and I just want to say directly to you young guys and men in general like listen to these women Go through a lot of shit to do that job and after speaking with them. I know firsthand Which I didn't before you know because I'm not a cop and I'm not a woman. I only have my own perspective which was skewed by one interaction that was very You know frustrating for me and I just want to say to you guys like if you listen to me and you look up to me and you know We do a lot of humorous shit and we make a lot of jokes and we talk a lot of shit here and that's not gonna change But I want you to understand like that shit ain't fucking cool like dude It is very hard for these women to go out Put on that fucking uniform have to deal with people in the worst situations of probably their life, you know people who are drunk people who are high people are in these violent situations or dramatic situations and you know It's harder for them than it is for a big physical specimen man and My point in all this is guys Give them some grace dude listen to them when they tell you to do shit fucking do it and Don't take my Ten-second clip and think that like that's the way it is. It's not fucking. Yeah, bro It's not fucking cool and and it's something that I'm super disappointed in myself For even letting slip out of my mouth, you know sometimes I get Emotional sometimes I give verbally lazy, you know, we record thousands and thousands of hours of audio and dude, you know That was just a really really poor Bad horrible thing to come out of my mouth and I feel really bad about it dude because like these are my fucking people dude a lot of these guys are my friends They're people I've known for years their people I you know fucking drink beer with or play softball with back in the day, you know and I'm just sorry dude like I don't want to make this a long apology but like I know I fucked up and I feel like shit about it and you know, I'm very hard on myself and For those of you, you know, I've seen a lot of the comments and a lot of the tags You know saying that you don't think I actually mean it dude come on man I've been doing this for 20 years. It's not like I haven't been speaking up pro law enforcement this entire time It's not like I haven't been doing things for the law enforcement the entire time that wasn't fake That wasn't bullshit and by the way no matter how upset you guys might be with me I'm gonna continue to do everything I did before because it's important to me And it's important to me that we appreciate the people who do these Difficult jobs in society which if you listen to the show for any amount of time I talk about regularly These people should be way more appreciated and way more paid for what they do and I'm sorry for minimizing that man like it was just a very bad moment for me so Listen, I've been knowing you for some years now. Yeah, I know you. Yeah, I like to believe so well you're with me 18 hours a day a lot of time with you Yeah, and you know, I'm proud of you dude because I look up to you like a big brother You know I'm saying I know who you are as a man I'm proud of you that you know instead of you know trying to do what I think most people would have done in this situation where it's Sweeping on the rug, you know try to know you're facing ahead on man and that that's real man shit Well, and I think dude. I think also I think that's we need more of that Yeah, you know, I'm saying we need more of that shit in society like it I like to stand on what I say like that's the nature of what we do here, right when I say shit I stand on it, but if I say something that's fucked up I think it's important that we all own those things, you know, I'm saying like even if it's just in a In a social setting or a party. It's just a good way to live and I think You know, I think we you know you younger guys especially like don't be afraid to like own your shit I know you see me getting fucking blasted, but dude look, you know, I said some hurtful shit You know sometimes when you apologize is gonna take a minute for people to ever you know Listen to you or feel better because you did something and But don't ever be afraid of that dude because at the end of the day, dude I think this life is about you know, did you do the right thing? You know and whether or not other people you know accepted or believe it or whatever you got to live with yourself And that was one of these you know, this was one of these situations for me You know, I've disappointed a lot of my friends Who I've known for years and years and years dude and it just you know I'm just not proud of myself right now You know, I think I think at the end of this shoot you'll be coming out of this a better man. Yeah, oh dude I already am I've already had like so much more perspective and so many more You know thought processes and and honestly realizations about myself Especially like the thing with the words carrying weight, you know, and I want to clarify that for you guys bro like If I'm fucking you know Joe like know the difference between when I'm joking around or you know saying something serious and I don't know I just I just don't want my words to negatively affect society or put people in a more dangerous situation and Yeah, that's that's about it. Yeah, yeah, what's going on with you? I don't know I got a birthday party this week. Yeah, I got it got my oldest. She's she's turning four. I mean to your point no way Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy But I mean, but to your point man, it's like it's one of those things like it is a different perspective because like I see her Mimicking me. Yeah, mimicking the thing. Yeah, it doesn't so I mean it's definitely a different perspective I didn't worry about that shit before yeah, you know, I'm saying yeah, I get that man And it's different to dude when you like like people will say how do you not think about that when you when you run companies or whatever right well They're paid. That's a different. Yeah, that's a different thing and um it's all different ball game. Yeah, hold it. I can't believe Ryan's four But it's crazy. It's crazy. It seems like she was just here. Yeah, just came out. Yeah, I know I know man It's fucking wild man. So I'll be what kind of party you guys do want to rodeo Barbie. So I don't know if I'm Robi I don't know if I'm kin or the bull I'm not sure yet I Let's get into these headlines This first I didn't really know where to put this. I just thought this was interesting you being of an older demographic. Oh, thanks What yeah, no, I'm just I'm just you have a different perspective of you know things. Yeah, you see how my See I'm getting extra gray here. You are well, that's because I'm letting it grow when I keep it short It looks darker, but when I let it grow it turns into this Sean Connery shit. Yeah, I'm giving like Wolverine. Yeah, I like it. Yeah, I think way But of the older gender graphic you've seen like this, you know like I only like all my phones always look like this right so you have different technology Um or I've had different technology, but I thought this was crazy. I don't really know where to put this not really sure what it means But did you see this? Hundreds of Hezbollah fighters wounded as their pages suddenly explode in their pockets You have you ever had a pager? I did that's what I that's what I'm saying. Yeah, I'm saying so you don't know nothing about pages bro Like you used it. There was a code with pages a code. Yeah, so like it wasn't just you put the number in And call the person back. Uh-huh. You could text with pages Like you know how on the buttons of a phone it has like a bc One or ttt.y. Or yeah, it's called yeah, no it wasn't tt.y But you would you know how like on a phone key It has like a bc underneath it, you know what I'm saying df on the next one You would type the word out in code and then you would have to like try to figure out what what it meant You remember just seeing like fucking numbers. Yes, you're seeing random numbers, but you had to like figure out the code 8008. Yeah, that sounds for boobies Oh, yeah, but there's like we used to talk in the in the code like we we would crazy. Yeah, you know a 77734 no 777 oh Yeah, yeah, yeah, like you would sort of 403 huh? Don't be a 403 boobies is 8 0 0 8 1 3 5 See that Sit you still yeah, but see I wasn't sending those texts in high school because nobody was showing me to boobies But yeah, bro, but like I mean fuck I mean like again like you know third and I'm not I'm not like a third world country Right, but like I mean different countries experience different ports of technology right in the access and so apparently Hezbollah fighters that use pages still but do it like a lot of like all of them like suddenly exploded simultaneously Right like when it this happened today just fucking happen. Yeah, man So hundreds of Hezbollah terrorists were seriously wounded on Tuesday when the pages they used to communicate Exploded around their belts and pockets The officials claiming a hacking attack by Israel triggered the blast Now Hezbollah officials confirmed the wide range attack on its operatives including fighters and medics With one member speaking on the condition of an enmity calling it quote the biggest security breach since it began its daily attacks on the Israel on October 8th Those videos that were uploaded to social media. They show several incidents where seemingly unaware men had devices in their pockets Blow up with the victims crying in pain as bystanders ran away one such video Show's a man shopping at a local. I saw this. I didn't I didn't see the sound of it, but I saw this happened. Yeah, that's crazy Yeah, bro check this clip up But the devices were all detonated. How do they do that bro? So can they do that with our cell phones? That's what I'm listen bro listen It's these are lithium batteries. That's what I'm saying like can they just send a code and blow us up with our phones That would suck man bro, and so I mean those I think if that were the reality it would have already happened to me Yeah But yeah, they're saying through the use of malware the devices could see their lithium batteries over heat and explode one Hasable official told the Wall Street Journal that some members felt their pages heat up and disposed of them Before they before they detonated But as of right now the time of recording at least nine people are dead from it 2800 that actually killed people. Oh, yeah dang. Oh, yeah 2800 people were injured After the pictures exploded across Lebanon There's a few pictures of the aftermath of what it looked like Oh, man, obviously advised, but um dude is just fucking wild man Like that's where we're at with technology. Yeah, I'm saying that so it's like well, bro Like you know the 5G shit that these guys talk about right like and I don't know you know, I I don't know what to think because like I have a hard time believing anything now or Dude, I have a hard time believing anything at surface level at all. There's yeah everything has something like there's some deep Yeah, bro, but like if you're watching those videos on like the nano tech and the 5G like actually signaling the nano particles to reassemble and someone's body and then killing them No, oh dude, they're back when the vaccine, you know hysteria was at its height There was a bunch of videos out from from people, you know, they seem a little out there. Yeah, but uh That we're saying like that they they could use 5G technology to stimulate the nano particles that are inside the vaccine to reassemble and cause death So they could hypothetically Target you because each vaccine has a serial number They could specifically target you if they wanted to kill you. That's crazy. Yeah, through a cell phone tower. That's crazy Yeah, man. I don't know how I think it's probably some bullshit, but yeah It sounds like bullshit, but fuck who knows dude. I mean like how do all I mean you're telling me okay like maybe there was a you know Um something wrong with a couple of them, you know, I'm saying like there's a manufacturing defect or something like that But we're talking almost you know 2,800 fucking people. Yeah, and that's just the ones that you know didn't dispose of it before it exploded Yeah, I mean that is a coordinated attack. Yeah, you know, I don't know how they did it But I mean obviously there's some capabilities that you know But are out there that exists you know, they can do it with pages from you know, what year was it you had your page? Probably like 97 nothing. I'd even make in those. Yeah, like 96 97 are they still making pages like today? Yeah, they still make them for like doctors Oh, okay, I can see that okay. Well, maybe maybe yeah, I don't know either way bro. It's some scary shit Yeah, just be walking around with the fucking explosive in your pocket. Yeah, you know So yeah guys, let us know what you guys think about that that uh Those those exploding pages. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said. Let's get to Get to our headlines But if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com You guys can find them all linked there for you. I was with that being said headline number one Uh gotta talk about it Trump's second assassination attempt This is wild. Yeah, man. Do this is wild All right, which you also there's little any diamonds there for you even jerry was it three weeks ago two weeks ago We talked we called this out. Yeah, I mean, I wasn't we weren't the only ones, but I mean like I don't even think this will be the last one. Yeah But yeah, so let's let's talk about it. Um law enforcement responds after another assassination attempt on Donald Trump So former president Donald Trump is safe His law enforcement responds to West Palm Beach, Florida after what the FBI now says was an apparent Second assassination attempt against Trump this year. Trump who survived a gunshot wound In Butler, Pennsylvania at a rally in mid july was golfing on his course in West Palm Beach on Sunday Law enforcement officials apparently encountered a man who had attempted to assassinate Trump there There are conflicting details It has been as a couple of days. This was Sunday morning when this happened um And report to pouring out from officials And unofficial sources, but Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr said on social media that a AK-47 was smuggled Into the bushes on the golf course There are other reports that the man had also smuggled a GoPro camera Presumably to film an effort to do so now in response on September 15th Trump's campaign issued this statement I'm saying quote now there were gunshots in my vicinity But before rumors start spiraling out of control. I wanted you to hear this first. I am safe and well Nothing will slow me down. I will never surrender. I will always love you for supporting me unity piece make America great again May god bless you all right now They have somebody in custody At the time of this recording that man is a man by the name of Ryan Wesley Ralph He's the alleged gunman at the Trump golf club He's a 58 year old man. He's accused of pointing an AK-47 at former president normal Trump on Sunday afternoon Has a prolific arrest record that spans several decades Ryan Ruth Was arrested shortly after the incident at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida authority said secret service agents fired at him After seeing the muzzle of his AK-47 pointing through a chain link fence One hole ahead of where Trump was playing I'm authorities are treating the episode as an apparent assassination attempt on Trump I'm a background check on the name given by officials Ryan Wesley Ralph revealed That he currently lives in Hawaii Uh, in his face dozens of run-ins with police stretching back to at least the 1990s He's a native of North Carolina which Uh, where he uh his list of arrests includes simple drug possession driving without a license expired inspection An operating a vehicle with no insurance in addition the Greensboro news and record reported that in 2002 Uh, Ralph was arrested after barricading himself in his roofing companies office during a three-hour standoff that followed a traffic stop In which he had put his hand on the gun before fleeing All right, now there was a lot of speculation meaning he put his hand on officers gun on on his gun and then pulled off Uh, okay Now there was a lot of speculation. I think it's important to call out you know like It's real as fuck here. We talk about the truth. Right? And while there are you know speculations and allegations we may push out Um, it is important that we you know, clear any bullshit that comes up Um, so it's been rumored that he was like a Ukraine foreign fighter Um, that is all since the time of this recording has been debunked Um, I'm confident in that uh the ruling on that um now something that is interesting that I would do want to point out Uh, let's go to CNN Okay, um, CNN One of their uh, the journalist there are news anchors is a woman by the name of Caitlin Collins Okay, and she has her own little segment on CNN called the source Uh, which appears weeknight at 9 p.m. Eastern time she tweeted this out. Okay, um, and this was shortly after the assassination term She says quote US intelligence officials recently briefed Trump's campaign about new indications that I ran What's planning to escalate attacks on the foreign from the president and those around him multiple sources familiar with the matter Tell CNN at this point There's no indication that the intelligence is related to the second assassination attempt against uh, uh on Trump on Sunday How the sources said the intelligence briefing given in recent days related to potential Physical and cyber security attacks adding to the overall elevated security threat against Trump Um, so immediately I ran to names get put in this right But who is this guy? Was it I ran? Let's dive into it. We got some facts for you guys um, a picture of his home show the truck outside that has a Biden Harris sticker on it. There's his house. There's a truck. There's a man in on it Biden Harris campaign sticker. Yeah, um, he actually donated 19 times to Democrats Act blue, right? Act blue all of that blue uh-huh Uh, and that's listed out here as well. So was it really our ran Caitlin? I don't think so Well, they started trying to craft that narrative right after the first one. Long time ago. The problem is though There is a uh, lengthy history um That uh, it's not our ran. It's it's these progressive left All right, and it's documented as well documented uh, we go to jasmine crocket Right um, where just before this happened she goes on with jinsaki um, this is what she had to say now again This is before the Trump assassination, but just listen to the narratives that they push Here's one of the things Donald Trump loves to say things such as They're illegal, right? Every time he talks about an immigrant he makes it seem as if they have done something nefarious and it's not true just because they are immigrants does not mean that there's anything illegal about them And what is so wild to mean is that they never think about the fact that they literally have children of immigrants Donald Trump is married to an immigrant as well as jadey vans Your children are children of immigrants and you are going out and attacking other immigrants every chance that you get And honestly again, it just comes down to basic decency in this country I think the reason that you're seeing the polling that you see in Iowa is because people are waking up to the fact that we can't live this way This can't be the guy that is supposed to protect us when it comes to people that are coming out against us This is the same guy that could not say on that debate stage that he wanted Ukraine to win He could not do that this guy doesn't understand who our friends are and he also doesn't understand who we are as a nation Which we are a country of immigrants and the demonization of any group of people whether it's black folk and saying You know what we need to go out and make sure that officers have immunity to just go ahead and kill them criminally Or whether we're talking about those that he says oh all of the Hispanics that are coming in they're going to rape your children Listen the problem isn't the people coming in the problem is this guy and his people here that are doing the bomb threats Throughout our country domestic terrorism is a real thing and he is the guy that stokes it Huh, when was this uh, this was Sunday this is after or before Right listen that might be the dumbest shit I've ever heard my life Like literally I've heard some dumb shit and we all know I've said some dumb shit. That's some dumb shit That is some dumb shit bro, okay like There's a big difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration How much shit did you have to go through to become an American citizen a lot of shit like what you have to do I had to take a test. I had to pay a bunch of money. I had to wait around Are you going through that z-shine? No, I'm done with that, but the same exact thing spent thousands of dollars a lot of paperwork and wait a couple of years for this So That's the legal way of becoming an immigrant And she's correct America is built on the children of immigrants, but it's not built on the children of Illegal immigrants and just because you don't know the difference between legal immigration and Illegal immigration doesn't mean like All right, listen, that statement is so dumb. It's hard for me to comprehend She knows the difference between legal and illegal immigration. I would say it will boil the blood of every immigrant who has come here legally To hear that Ending thousands of dollars not only for themselves, but for their significant others for their families And to hear that she's comparing criminals and illegal people who come here to legal immigration It's absurd idiotic and Borderline just crazy. There we go From the man himself. I was going to say some other word, but I have a sentence for crazy. Yeah Yeah, man, and so like that was before surely Just before the the second assassination attempt But what were they saying after it? Let's go to Hakeem Jeffries Democrat House leader Hakeem Jeffries under fire for his tweet following assassination attempt on Trump. This is what he had to say Extreme mega Republicans are the party of a national abortion ban and Trump's project 2025 We must stop them. We must stop them. How so That's right. How? Did you see that tweet Trump put out where he like listed all the things that they said yeah, bro That's what I'm saying like a tie he went time date by date by date by date and said and said all the aggressive statements that they said about like You know, he's a threat to democracy The country's gonna end etc etc Hakeem has been getting fucking destroyed This is just a few of those comments what the actual fuck is wrong with you Duke is this was just after the fucking assassination attempt Like yeah, that's crazy hour. Yeah, okay This kind of rhetoric caused another assassination attempt on president Trump shut the fuck up fuck all the way off Um, I mean, I mean just just keeps going it goes and goes um And then only that you got Hillary Clinton Saying that Donald Trump's a danger to our country and the world Just one day after the second assassination So this just came out today, but this was this happened yesterday Um, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton said Monday that Donald Trump is quote a danger to our country and the world Just one day after the government was foiled in his bid to shoot former president 2016 Democratic presidential nominee made the remark during an interview with MSNBC prime time host Rachel Maddow her is the clip and boosting Trump back in 2016 But I also think there are Americans who are Engaged in this kind of propaganda And whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged Is something that would be a better deterrence because Wow, it sounds like So so whatever happened at the freedom of speech Whatever happened to being able to say what you believe without repercussions that is the point of This whole entire country, okay, and what I mean by without repercussions I don't mean not making people mad. I mean legal repercussions like putting them in jail, right? Okay, there are always repercussions to what people say, you know that but You know, she is on TV openly calling for the arrest and imprisonment of people that post quote unquote misinformation Well, who decides what misinformation is? Do the people that arrest people or are they also the same people to get to decide What misinformation is is it her definition misinformation because Misinformation is an opinion, all right Well, it's become that it's become an opinion I mean because we've removed all factual logic from society Right, I mean do we arrest the people that were saying that you know hydroxychloroquine and ira mecton were not safe therapeutic do we arrest those people from mr Well, they under her thing they would have been arrested when they said that and then it would have come out to be that they did help right Right like right dude. This is just a totalitarian communist Tactics and this is what it's like in other countries guys like and a lot of other countries or cross the world And if you guys are old enough you remember like our parents and our teachers telling us hey You know in China or this is what they used to say when I was in school They would say hey and China man you can't say what you want to say you can't Criticize the government that will arrest you And that was one of the fundamental basis points that they built value and pride in us as American citizens as a young person Right, they would sit us down and they say hey you got to understand what This country's about it's about this. We have freedom of speech This is why it's such a big deal and other places don't have it and now we don't have it Well, according to her, you know, and this is the danger guys like I know there's a lot of people that You know think this is normal political ebbs and flows and um But this is where we're at we're at a Of fork in the road where we're either going to go and be more free or we're going to become a communist country Run by people like her who gives her the right to make decisions like this who gives these people the right to rule over us Right, isn't it weird how they all seem to have this Pre-determined Pre-ordained pre-ordained destiny of there are rulers like it's it's really bizarre. Yeah, that's crazy, man But as of right now mr. Ralph You know the charges have come out uh for him. He's already had an arraignment his first appearance in court where he was smiling and laughing in the courtroom No way. Oh, yeah The hearing was only eight minutes long and he was charged with two counts One was possession of a firearm while being a convicted felon and the other one was a possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number So what many people called ghost guns or whatever the deface the serial number so it's intractable. Yeah He that was the the AK-47 that was found in the bushes now Lot of interesting things around this topic, okay One thing that I did find interesting is because I don't believe any of this stuff happens by accident Obviously, you know, we just talked about it. Trump's posted it on his on his page, you know the the pages of Of times where these people have pushed and made the subliminal call to actions for people to do exactly just like this Um now is it deeper than that? I don't know. Did you see that that time magazine's Uh cover that they pushed out Uh, just a few days before the second assassination with him in the golf cart. Yeah. Yeah, I did Dude look these are not coincidences. You think that's a coincidence that this comes out a few days before he's almost Assassinating on the golf course and then you know because it didn't go through then they pull it down from all of their publications and remove it from there They're vault of all the things they have um, you know It's stuff like that or the fact this is probably the craziest fact. This is the fact The craziest thing about the situation is okay. They're saying that the guy was laying in the bushes for you know 12 hours Okay, okay, so 12 hours undetected cool. Here's my issue Trump that golfing that he was on Was not a scheduled event Which most of his golf golfing events are right it was not on the counter to that day That was a last minute decision that he made to do How did Ryan Roth know that dude? So me that's the biggest issue. That is even covering it That is a big problem because that means someone that's close close close to him Is doing leaked his location of where they're gonna be and that means very close. So So Look man If I was Trump I'd remove everybody from around you got to re wipe it. Yeah, you got to wipe it all You got to wipe it all and put brand new honestly I don't even know if I would trust the government entity at that point no you might be better off Would just choosing a private fucking company to do well dude all the emperors that were you know I mean, this is a common thing throughout history, you know even even there's there's people who know Things about the JFK assassination that say he was shot by secret service from the backseat of the car Right, so you know from the front of the car. So I mean dude Were you gonna hear something crazy? No, I know a lot of these secrets service guys. They're fucking good dudes, bro And of course, I mean this is not a generalization man, but like and obviously everybody's gonna be entitled to their own opinions Yeah, their own political beliefs and like just because you're serving the United States secret service does not mean that you don't have your own Political belief right and like at the end of the day it's a job. You sign up to do it, right? But like There is a problem here. Yeah, there is a problem here somebody is allowing these things to happen and more than one person knows about it They have to know yeah, it's not just one person that knows but to your point about this julie cizer thing I Yeah Even this a by itself and it's so crazy that you brought this up a julie cizer that everybody knows he was you know The emperor emperor of Rome. Yeah, it was killed by members of his own Senate. Mm-hmm It's interesting man because if you go back to 2017. I don't know if you guys remember this But I found this Trump is julia cizer. That was a play that was put on in New York City It was Shakespeare in the park where instead of you know given the traditional You know julia cizer role and all of that no they had the guy dressed up and he looked shockingly Similar to Donald Trump and where he was stabbed by minorities and People in minority groups Where the ones that killed him and so I mean it's listen dude. Your society's getting way too extreme dude Like way too extreme There needs to be action to correct this you know like how how is this continued allowed To be happening over and over and over again, you know what I mean who who knows like there's people that know this There's for sure this fucking people that know it You know and like my issue is bro like Again when you when you pull it back It's always coming from the same people It's coming from the same side it comes from the same small group of people small group of people It's the Obama the Clinton the you know It's that little group of people the Biden the the Michelle Obama the George W. Bush. It's the cabal bro It's it's always the same they've had power for the last 16 what is it 16 years out of 20 You know what I mean? dude It's wild yeah he asked everywhere he asked the white ball of it man Like there has to be a very dramatic change bro because if not Again like three times the charm. I don't know you know what I'm saying like how do we know we don't But there is a mold and then what happens then what happens if they do kill them right you know what I think they're betting on Them killing him and nobody doing anything about it and then them just moving on with their plan I don't know man. Yeah, I don't know either dude. It's it's very unsettling I mean regardless of what your political beliefs are I think we should all believe in the structure of the country and I think we should all understand that you know sometimes people get their way Sometimes you we get our way and that's supposed to be a conversation and we've drifted so far away From being able to have conversations with people instead of going straight to there are enemy right if we have any Disagreement with someone or we have any Dislike of someone or any preconceived notions of someone we automatically think that they're the opposite polar of us And dude what we find out usually is that they're not that different if we sit down and have some conversations and um You know, I'm talking about the people. I'm not talking about the corrupt government You know, we have to understand that dude if We don't have a two-party country or a multiple representation We move into the category of dictatorship, you know, it's interesting that yeah It's interesting that they keep saying Trump wants to be a dictator on day one but the steps that they are taking are the steps of what Dictatorial regime would do right eliminate your enemies And fucking stay in power forever, you know what I mean? I mean dude like it's funny how they criticize Putin but they behave just like them they're doing worse. Yeah I don't even know if they what Putin does is what they tell us if I'm being honest They won't let it they won't let his speeches be played They won't let us hear what he says and every time we hear what he says it's pretty common sense You know sound that that crazy to me. No, so you know who knows man here's my thing last little bit on this too You know it doesn't like it doesn't matter what side you are this shit's wrong. Yeah, and I think anybody Democrat Republican doesn't matter you can look at this and say hey something's wrong here. Yeah, there's a problem and There should be more than just the typical headlines pushing to make change here. Yeah And I do want to call out we like to call out, you know when people make, uh, you know great points and great statements Did you see where Chris Kromo had to say on this? No check this clip out I don't get it That's why I reached out to Trump I Wanted to just say listen I'm really sorry That this is going on and it's being dealt with this way Not because I'm in favor of his politics or what he says and criticize him all the time. That's my job and he deserves it But he doesn't deserve this I kind of point in 8k 47 atom all he's playing golf And we take solace in the fact that the guy didn't get any rounds off If I had been through what that guy's been through in the last two months you would not know where I am You would never see me on TV again No way I would do that. I don't know how he does He's got kids their adults, but he's got grandkids. He's got a wife people given sh- given crap to Melania Trump Worrying about whether or not there was a plot around his husband. How could she not people mock her And Then her husband has a guy pointed with an 8k 47 where are those people apologizing That's what it's time for We are playing a dangerous game with ourselves. He is not a desperate and waiting Okay, I don't buy it You've got to care when somebody tries to kill someone. I can't hear what he's saying Who the fuck edited that? Jesus I can find the queen whoever edited that should practice their skills man Anyway, he makes him great point. He does the ones I could hear great points. Yeah No, you know what though like it's kind of weird, you know Chris Como like his like you flip flops, you know sometimes like all during COVID and all the way up until he was fired He was the guy saying all of this aggressive shit towards Trump right And then now he's out of that we see him you know We see him go out and he says a couple things and then he says something completely opposite And then he says some other things and then he says something completely opposite And it's hard for me to watch that and wonder like Is he saying that because he Knowes that Trump's gonna get assassinated eventually and he doesn't look like he's complicit it or is he saying it because He knows Trump's gonna be in power and he doesn't want to be punished or is he saying it because he truly means it You know it came across as if you meant it. Yeah, you know, I hope he means it You know, Como says some shit sometimes that I do really agree with But it's just like he's all over the bottom as you wait to a minute Yeah, I mean dude that's common sense message man That's how you know and real talk like even over the last few years I've been overly aggressive sometimes you know like Obviously our show is based in a lot of humor and and extreme, you know extreme you know dialogue But you know we say that stuff sort of joking around right and these guys go on national television to say it very seriously And that's a that's a you know if you're someone at home and you're convinced from watching the media That the country is going to fail if we don't get rid of Trump and you're sitting there and you think like man I could be the hero I could save America you see what I'm saying and do we have a lot of people in our country one You know who suffer from mental illness or lack purpose or lack relevancy and we don't have you know This is why a lot of these school shooters are doing this and they say so in their little manifestos So don't come at me with that's not why they want to be relevant dude and everybody lives in this world now where they feel unseen You know and we look at these people on the internet and we look at these people on TV and we don't think they're human beings, you know, it's just um It's just a very weird time man and I would really We need real conversations dude, you know what I'm saying we need to stop this propagating of hate and aggressiveness towards towards this dude because they don't like them, you know what I mean it shouldn't be You know and it you know, yeah, I guess it's freedom of speech or whatever but like dude when we start Well molding and my and you know being grooming so to speak these people that are at home, you know, like that's a different thing dude And if you're watching what they do it's very clear that it's propaganda and it is somewhat like mental grooming No, you know brainwashing or whatever you call it if I if I was to say that I feel that Kamala Harris is a threat to our country And I thought it's a democracy I got FB actually one of them I do I want to question well, I mean, I think that's true statement, but you know What's the difference between what I think it's a true statement I think it's a true statement because of what is happening by the evidence We don't have evidence of Trump being a threat like that, you know I think these people like Hillary Clinton and these people that put all this shit out those people should be in jail Dude for what they're doing because they're blatantly lying they're blatantly cheating. Did you see the shit about the whistleblower for for Kamala Harris's debate? Oh, you got that okay, all right. See. I'm always ahead All right Yeah, man, this is wild, man Guys jumping on this conversation. Let us go down what you guys think What should happen to the people that are doing this on national TV? What should happen to the people who are calling for you know, we got to stop them like where do you I want to know like for real I want to know where the temperature is with you guys like what should happen to these people because or how should it be handled? Because like dude Very clearly one side can say and do whatever they want and the other side can't So what what what are we doing here? Only one side is producing some very negative negative actions. Yeah. Yeah, so Let us know down in the comments man. It's fucking it's it's disturbing dude. Wow. Yeah. I'm worried about what could happen for real real shit, man Guys, let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said. Let's let's let's go cruise some of the comments This first one Comes from Richard The two a atheist okay. I says well, I'll admit that I was skeptical but Andy for celacol it Can't wait for the media to completely ignore this when it comes out. We got just that And he retweeted this tweet from the black insurrectionist about the affidavit from the ABC was below We got that coming up it just shortly, but I got your Richard. We got you This next one comes from a Gluck 0122 The audacity of white people to talk about immigration while standing on stolen land let it go like Elsa Are you white me? Yeah, half I know, but are you? Yeah, are you You identify as white We we all talk about it. So it's not just why so I'm you guys can talk about it, but I can't talk about it I don't know that's kind of that's kind of like how it is a society right now. You know saying All of us can do it. Just not white people. That's right. I don't think everybody say what everything wants have white people I don't think that her as a white person should be able to talk about why people not talking about it I agree that's a good point because it cancels each other out. You know, I'm saying it's like You know one time zero You know what I'm saying? What are you doing with your hand though there reporting my cancels each other? I'm six six that's that's sign language. I learned that I just made it up Yeah, yeah, that's the that's the move baby. You don't know this move You don't know that's only because you're young never fucking seen that move when you're older you're figured out This last one comes from at Indy Will fitness He says trump has a mug shot many indictments a couple of baby mamas got shot and inspired a rap song That makes him blacker than comla and DJ you guys are awesome Hey, all right Why I play Andy on their way because he knows You know, I got stabbed bro Yeah, many men I got stabbed. I don't have any baby mamas. I haven't been shot. I've got shot at um I don't have any indictments. I don't have any mug shots either You know you did inspired a rap song though. I did oh yeah, I did a couple people made rags about you Yeah, yeah, there's a couple they're on a little little Instagram's music thing I just haven't plugged it into my stories yet. You know, I love that. I feel like I'm really good at that Like music selection my music selections on my Instagram stories are top notch pretty clean Yeah, none of you guys can compete with that. Yeah, that's real man guys. We appreciate you for being real out of fans Keep liking keep commenting make sure you guys are subscribed and hit that bell notification to stay up to date with the latest episodes Coming out from really after that. Yeah, I bet if I uh, I bet if I went and got arrested And actually got shot. I bet I can inspire some more rap songs You know what I'm saying? Let's not do that. Yeah, let's not Guys Andy are second headline headline number two Uh, this headline let's not so much of a headline. Uh, this is independent media sources Let's talk about it. So this uh, this gentleman who goes uh goes by Doc net youtube Or the black insurrectionist on twitter um has a great account has a decent amount of follow it says I am Magga do not tell me I ain't black I wouldn't tell him shit He looks badass and he's mad. Yeah, he does Yeah, anyway, so what's up? So uh, this uh, we have to give him credit So we talked about the debate is extensively the the debate on ABC with Donald Trump and uh Come Queen Harris we talked about this um and uh, you know, we talked about how That it was very hard for us to believe that it was not that she was not pre either pre-fed these notes I know people saw the earring shit. We talked about this um and at the time that was just our common sense It was our speculation um, but since then Uh, the black insurrectionist on twitter you guys can check him out. Uh, he posted this on september 15th Uh, here are the six pages of the affidavit for easier sharing You guys says he made an error in the original posting where he duplicated page five says that I would also like to note that There are several pages after the verification page that were specifics about the job the whistleblower did In a transcript of the recordings he made Um, the transcripts were even worse than the affidavit. So this affidavit Um, is the affidavit of an alleged whistleblower who works for abc Um, and mind you the date on this affidavit a september 9th 2024 the day before the debate actually happened Um, where he goes through he lists out some things, you know I have worked for abc news for over 10 years and various technical and administrative positions since the acquisition of abc news in 1996 I have observed significant transformations in the nature of news reporting at the organization These changes suggest a shift from unbiased reporting to a model influenced by external factors Those shit. Yeah, you know, it's crazy, dude like before you know What's crazy is this guys your age and people that are young they don't know any different They think that the way the news is now is the way that it always was And everybody everybody my age understands that there's a big difference. Yes Like back when I was dude back when I was you know young you know 20 years old They would report the fucking news right like they would get on tv and they'd say this is what happened in this neighborhood This is what happened in this neighborhood Here's what's going on in Idaho. Here's what's going on in Florida But now like it's come it's become complete state indoctrination propaganda like complete like both you watch Fox news or CNN or MSNBC How many of the stories are outside of politics? Very little okay. Well isn't that weird that you know It used to be about everything going on and now they become these massive channels of just political Information quote unquote shut down people's throats 24-7. Yeah, oh nationally and local That's what I'm saying well locals a little bit better, but You know, we still get the neighborhood stories and we still get the you know what's going on with the sports Yeah, we still get that stuff at local news. I don't think the local news is is the same as what you know we call MSM at the national level Um, I know it's not because I know the people I know a lot of people in it, but Uh Yeah, dude. It's crazy and it's crazy that young people will never know that the news used to be the news. Yeah Um, it's so crazy, but one of the the fourth statement on this affidavit and it's a six-page document We'll link this on the website for you guys to check on your own Um, but the fourth point says quote for the record. I do not endorse Donald Trump In his capacity as candidate for president of the United States the intent of this affidavit It was to address concerns regarding perceived biases Uh, within news reporting within my employer's debate Uh, that will be hosted on September 10th 2024 Um, now he goes on um, there's a lot of interesting uh things that he makes um in this uh Affidavit um But saying uh one of the points he says observations pertaining to debate fairness I have noted specific instances related to the debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris The raised concerns about procedural fairness the specific instances of the perceived bias are as follows Uh, the Harris campaign received particular accommodations including but not limited to the providing of a podium significantly smaller than that used by Donald Trump In assurances regarding split screen television views that would favorably impact Kamala Harris's appearance relative to Donald Trump Um, it was agreed that Donald Trump would be subjected to fact checking during the debate uh during the debate while Kamala Harris Would not face comparable scrutiny This was widely known throughout the company that Donald Trump would be fact check the in fact various people were assigned To fact check observations it was perceived uh candidate Donald Trump would make during the debate In fact Harris campaign required assurances That Donald Trump would be fact check this was done via multiple communications with the Harris campaign Whereas the Trump campaign was not included in the negotiations to my understanding any rules Uh negotiations and conversations pertaining to the debate should have been uh should have had both the Trump and the Harris campaign involved the Harris campaign had numerous more calls regarding the debate rules without the Trump campaign aware or on the call Um, he also said uh or alleges that the Harris campaign was provided with sample questions that while not the exact questions covered similar topics Uh that would appear during the debate Furthermore the Harris campaign imposed restrictions on the scope of questioning. This is where it gets real interested They they the Harris campaign Okay, demanded that there would be no questions regarding the perceived health of President Joe Biden Got it. Can't talk about it But there was also uh not allowed no inquiries related to her tenure as a turn of general And all of the peoples whose lives that she completely ruined and fabricated evidence and tampered with witnesses none of that could be talked about The most interesting point here though, and this is something I had no idea about not sure if you knew I didn't know this either Bro, yeah, this last point Is that there could be no questions concerning her brother-in-law Tony West Who faces allegations of embezzling billions of dollars in taxpayer funds and who may be involved in her administration if elected Can't talk about it Now I had no idea what that was referring to um And it will got we got a little bit because there's some clarification on that a little bit later But the important part to realize here is that this was notarized Okay, um by an actual notary Um under the penalty of parodry And without any type of coercion in the state of New York Um, it was signed and dated by a public notary on September 9th the day before the debate okay now MSM of course they will push out that you know it's mega pushing claims of ABC whistleblower right The guy says in his statement. He's not a supporter of bound trump Okay, I'm actually contradicting what's in the actual and his sworn affidavit right um, you know, so you have that um But this is what I'm talking about dude like even this kind of headline that is so misleading right like there should be consequences for that Like it's not you know, they say freedom of the press, but it's not freedom to just lie to everybody and manipulate everybody and ruin people's lives Because you think it's gonna get you fucking clicks right right? Well, I mean and not only that they know that most people don't repass the headline Yeah, they see the headline and they take that headline as as law right Um, but here's the thing The ABC moderator Lindsey Davis admits that fact checking was only planned for Trump That just came out. ABC, you know, she's magga Right. Yeah, completely mags sorority sisters with Kamala Harris, but she's definitely magga Yeah, ABC news is Lindsey Davis one of the two moderators for last week's presidential debate admitted to the Los Angeles times that the plan Was only to fact check former president Donald Trump and not vice president Kamala Harris. Yeah, so much for that uh, you know, Magger crowd Um now outside of that there's also been this guy a billionaire trump backer bill acman Okay, he posted an open letter to ABC news about the debate shenanigans and he says quote I find the allegations credible Again to this, you know, magga claim It's not real at all, but this guy Um, who's you know think you know, he's out as interesting pass and abs and flows on both sides of the aisle But he released this this tweet here and we'll read through this quickly Um, and he tagged the CEO of ABC Um, Robert Eiger he says dear Bob I assume that you have been made aware of this affidavit which was made public earlier today in which a whistleblower states that at ABC Work closely with the common Harris campaign and sharing the substance of the questions Of warding certain topics agreeing on the staging committed uh committing to fact check uh at rodonald trump and not Harris and more disturbing details I find the allegations credible as written and also because the affidavit was apparently made and filed the day prior to the debate It makes mention of Harris's smaller podium and other details that only became public thereafter Well, I can't determine the veracity of these allegations. They do match substantially Uh, what took place during the debate the moderators of the debate david mirror and he tagged them all yeah Um, have yet to respond to the allegations since they have not done so yet Uh, one must draw a negative inference and light of the seriousness of the allegations and the implications for this presidential election And for ABC's reputation and thereby at disney's and the office of the CEO I strongly encourage you to launch an immediate investigation of this matter A democracy depends on transparency particularly with regard or two events Which can impact the outcome of the presidential election I ask on behalf of all voters But you treat these allegations with the seriousness they deserve. Thank you Um, so you put that out now back to this Tony West guy. I'd never heard the story It had no idea who this guy was apparently he is Kamala Harris's brother-in-law. I mean Mary Kamala's sister Um, this is a little input on this Um, so black's interventionist he tweeted this out in the follow-up tweet He says while many people are focusing on what the whistleblower has said One of the most important issues is being left out Tony West is Kamala Harris's brother-in-law and campaign advisor We'll also be part of our administration This is a man who makes Bernie made-off look like Peter Pan I also firmly believe you will see a connection between Kamala fundraising with Tony West connections Part of the scheme that Tony West ran was money laundering funds Through left-wing outlets and then expecting some of those funds to be returned And he self-respecting journalists would have been obligated to ask the candidate Who is a major advisor about these allegations and how they link with Kamala fundraising This is just the tip of the iceberg And I've looked into this There is lawsuits that have been put in where he basically Fucked over a lot of farmers and more specifically black farmers By the tune of billions of dollars And that case is actively in court as we speak But nobody's even mentioned that the media has not mentioned that farmers. Yeah black farmers Billions of dollars and funding and grants and he's a lawyer Um, and he's being sued because of his shenanigans with that Um, and it's interesting because they say you know this was left out of the debate And they couldn't touch this topic, but it's also interesting that no other media sources ever covered any of this It's it's weird Um, and by the way Ben and Jerry's has a new ice cream flavor for Kamala. So Andy, what do you what do you get along with this? Coconut Jubilee I mean dude, I think I think it's more and more of this you know power to this corruption to hang on to power Where people are able to do whatever they want and they don't face any consequences That the other side of the aisle would face and uh, it bothers me to my core. It's it's it's totally fucked up I don't think it's you know like dude where do these people think that it's okay to do these things They think that it's okay to do these things because there's never any accountability for it ever Right this story comes out It's gonna get memory hold the the truck first Trump assassination memory hold russia collusion that they made up memory hold like Dude the press is completely Bearing anything that has to do with what they do or how they do it and the average person is unaware the average person reads that that Magga, you know, magga pushing claims of You know, uh, whatever they said about the what magga pushes claim of ABC whistleblower after Harris Trump debate They pushed that out one time and the people believe that forever. They don't ever think anything different and um You know I don't see anything coming to this unless Trump gets back in and then even if that I'm not even sure something will come of it because he had the opportunity to do a lot of these things Before and he didn't do them. So it's like With what are we doing dude? It seems like it's all theater and it's all theatrics and it's all just bullshit for us to like focus on and You know, this is why I talk about culture being the solution of what's going on. It's not Politics guys. They're not gonna save us. Harris is not gonna save us Trump's not gonna save us Will they make policies? Maybe that make it easier us for us to live and operate? Yeah, I think Trump will do that I think Kamala will make it much more painful for everybody and if we look at California as the example I don't think many of you really want your state if you don't live in California turn into California specifically Where she's from which is San Francisco? So You know when we look at all of this um You know, we've got to make a smart choice and then we have to realize that we are the culture we are the people You know like we have to stick together. We have to work together We have to become the best versions of ourselves and that's what needs to happen for us to like cultivate a prosporous culture because dude, it's like farming man like you can't just flip the switch and make it change right You got to start planning the siege you got to water the siege you got to be patient You got to let the seeds sprout and right now and by the way they know this like they started this 20 years ago right they started this 20 years ago with making changes like putting political correctness out there removing the pledge of allegiance you know Creating cancel culture as a weapon right like so that people can't get along and they can't have conversations And they try to ruin each other's lives over one disagreement All of these things are designed to prevent us from ever being unified and people that participate in them I think are unaware that these are actual weapons, you know self-sensoring You know, that's what cancel culture does it makes you self-sensor um Political correctness it makes you self-sensor, you know The silent majority it makes you self-sensor and what they're afraid of if you look at what the result of all those things are Is they're afraid of all of us coming together having conversations and realizing dang man We all want the same thing as opposed to them making it seem like we all want different things I mean dude look even my friends who are Democrats You know, and I don't I don't affiliate as a Republican or a Democrat or an independent I'm just a dude and I look at the path that's available for me forward and I choose the best one Then aligns with what I think this country should be and if I'm being honest I think we have a long way to go pass this election to create the America that we need to create And that's going to come from us that's not going to come from politicians That's not going to come from the governance. It's going to come from us It's going to come from the people deciding that we are not going to participate in all this propaganda We are not going to participate in these things like political correctness, cancel culture, silent majority We are going to stick up for each other we're going to stand up for each other when we see people getting Canceled or we see things that aren't happening we speak up for that against that that these are the things that That are going to destroy the weapons that they have put on society and create an environment where we can actually get along again Because right now they won't even let you do How many Democrats will even associate with someone who votes different than Democrat right there studies out there that Democrats are highly unlikely to have conversations With anyone that does it or be friends with anyone outside their party And then there's studies for Republicans that says they actually are willing to have conversations and be friends with people but like the fact that you know We have MSNBC and we have CNN and we have ABC and we have all of these we have way more Liberal or leftist outlets that prompt that propaganda and make sense that Democrats are more affected by the leftist propaganda Then the right is by the right propaganda because there's right propaganda too. So If those people are more affected because it's being blasted out more and more and more and more and more and more it makes sense why they're less willing to have conversations with the other side for the same reason that the media has convinced these mentally ill people to Take assassination attempts at Trump right? So we have to we have to realize dude that we are living in the fucking matrix for real like this is a proper Ganda Country social media as a part of it Mainstream media as a part of it big business as a part of it. We are not Three that's just the reality dude. We are tax slaves. We work So that they can take our money and then steal the money as this man Tony West allegedly big as apparently pretty decent at yeah Right, so when we think of all this money that's being taken from us and spent or sent overseas or stolen or Inbezzled or whatever you want to call it and then we think about what we could actually do here with that money Regarding how we can make this country great if it was actually spent on us. I mean does anybody out there any of you Disagree that our tax dollars should be spent on American citizens first. Does anybody? Democratic Republican Do you not agree that the money that you pay in tax should benefit you? I think that's a fundamental commonplace for American citizens to start the conversation But when you want an airplane they say at the oxygen mass falls down and you have a child with a who do you put it on first? You so you can help the child and dude we have to fix what's going on with this What what really is a A theft scheme or a slavery scheme? In this country dude like when and people say hello how we're free like look at you know these other places Have you been to those other places? Because a lot of those places are nicer than here and you know why they're nicer than here Because they're not sending a trillion dollars overseas to all these different things China's not sending us all this money for aid are they not? I'm aware of my I know that's right They said they send a decision maker some money But the point of the matter is is if the money was spent here the whole country wouldn't look like shit And we would have a beautiful country with beautiful infrastructure We wouldn't have a divide population people will be happier they make more money And we're off sitting here arguing over bullshit You know what i mean? We're arguing over fucking memes and you know someone said this or someone did this or something You know like it's all a distraction dude And if we could really come together and figure out what the fuck is actually happening to us and look at it Maybe we could solve the problem and build this country into something great.
