We are recording. All right. Let's just get going about that. Yeah How about that no intro today? Howdy hoes Not fucking love self you know what I love about our people bro, you know how they greet each other now I found out oh yeah, they're fucking people see each other wearing the shit and they walk up and they say hey Don't be a ho sure the show bro. That's so awesome. I saw this one I Saw this one person. I can't remember who it was, but I saw it They actually had a sticker of us on the show with a QR code Of the show yes, and it said don't be a ho share the show on the back window of their fucking SUV. Oh, damn That's fucking I loved it. I love it. I love it. It's like ten it like they get the color right on me. I Love it All right, so we got Saturday Audio exclusive today special sauce. We're gonna work through this. I don't know what we're gonna do We'll pull it. We'll see what we've had half a can of first form energy. It's not an ad and I I'm cracked out of my mother fucking mind Holds it They changed right name to Kyle that's the green one. That's the green one. Yeah, you should be good on that one the Message version that's right That's right. This one right here. This puts you right to the top of the top of the list. Yeah top top top all right All the list. So what are we doing here? Yeah, but so I was thinking about this thing I wanted I wanted to get you to go on it So you know, there's the saying that you know everything happens for a reason right? Yeah And and I personally like believe usually people that it lose say that all the time Well, I mean, I feel like you know like they do they take a lot I'm just saying they take a loss to this And then they just stay right there the whole life I can see that I think I think I use it typically on the positive shit Or like when negative shit does happen and then the positive comes after it's right. Well, that's right So I'm here for it right? Yep But I guess the question is like you know when you are going through the hard time and you have this belief that hey Everything is happening for a reason you're where you are for a reason You know because of the work you've done when hard things happen and you're going through a struggle period right would you've had many of How do you get through that while also in that mindset of everything's happening for a reason like how do you look at those hard times How do you look at those those tough struggle moments or months? DJ, I'm glad you asked Because this Saturday Here's the deal There's two different kinds of people when it comes to the hard times There's the kind of people that say well everything happens for a reason And then they sit there the rest of their life and they don't do shit and they say well You know what it must be a bigger plan for me and my bigger plan means that I'm gonna sit in my basement Eat my hot pockets yelling at my mom because I don't have enough of them right? That's what most people do, but what winners do they handle hard times completely different All right, and I'm gonna explain something to you. I don't give a shit What these people on the internet try to tell you all right every single one of these people that comes out here and acts like they're perfect Comes out here and acts like they got all their shit together all the time comes out acts like it's easy Comes out acts like they have everything in line and they don't have any problems or any stress or any anxiety or any doubt Every single one of those people is full of shit Okay, because the truth is we all struggle. We all have hard times Especially if you have ambition and drive and you want to become something that you are not yet That brings us difficulties. That is the nature of the game And you are gonna have hard time after hard time after hard time and the difference between winners and losers is how we adjust to these hard times We've already talked about how losers handle it They get punched in the face once and they're out of the game bro. They're done. They say hey, it wasn't for me I didn't like that I couldn't do it and it is what it is and then they just take what they can get the entire rest of their life which ain't shit Okay, and what do winners do winners handle things very differently? They understand that the path they've chosen is going to be Layden with hard times they understand the path they've chosen is going to have resistance It's going to have struggle. It's going to have pain It's going to have hardship and that is going to be a regular occurrence along the path They understand that and then when those days come they don't look at it as oh poor me this happened to me They look at it as well. Fuck yeah I'm getting fucking tested today motherfucker and you know what? I'm gonna pass that test and whenever they have the hard thing that happens and then they overcome it They gain more confidence because they overcame something that the previous version of themselves or the rest of everybody else Would have just quit when it happened to them. So we have to understand Test days come they come over and over and over again and they the purpose of these days is so that you can Prove to yourself now the rest of the world to yourself that you are the kind of person that possesses the mental Fortitude the grit the toughness the perseverance the discipline to get things done Regardless of what the situation is and if you become this kind of person who can get things done Regardless of what's going on regardless of what's going on in the economy Regardless of what's going on in your personal life regardless of how you feel regardless of the weather how the fuck can you be stopped by anything other than God You cannot Okay, so winners very much value being tested because every time they overcome the test They look back at it and they say yeah, fuck you you couldn't fuck me up I'm gonna keep going and that's the difference they get punched in a face over and over and over again And they get up with a fucking smile and say I didn't kill me I'm still going and every time you get up and you keep going You're gaining momentum you're gaining steam you're gaining belief because you don't believe that you can do hard things until you've actually done some hard things All right, and this is the reason the entire reason that I put together will live hard program because it's meant to condition you to do things that are Difficult when you do not feel like doing them and if you can become the kind of person who can do difficult things Especially when you'd rather do anything else but the difficult thing there is actually nothing that can get in your way and stop you along the way So they understand this difference Weak people broke people people who lose they have bad shit happened to them and they say well I tried I did my best it wasn't for me. You know what? I had this happen. It was this guy's fault It was my mom's fault. It was my wife's fault It was my boss's fault and they make all these excuses and winners do not do that at all They get punched in the face they sit down for a second and they say Fuck that and they get back up and they keep going and that is a very fundamental difference between people who are successful and people who aren't How they perceive the difficult days? I choose to perceive the difficult days as a test that has showed up Intentionally to reinforce the belief that I have in myself to reinforce what I know about myself And if we all approach the difficult times like that and we continue to push through our confidence will go up tremendously All right, so that's the difference bro You have to be willing to be tested you have to understand that you're gonna be tested What did you train to be an athlete your entire life? What if you train to play football your entire life and all you do was practice practice practice practice practice practice practice practice practice practice practice practice practice and you never played a fucking game Would you think you'd be fulfilled do you think you'd be happy? Do you think it'd be fun? No, it would suck and this is what you guys are afraid of you're afraid of the tests Because you don't know if you're gonna pass it or not But the thing is is that you could only fail the test if you don't go through it That's how you fail so start understanding this is how winners think winners look at the situation in hand the tough thing in hand The circumstance at hand that is just punched him right in the balls and they say Yeah, that's not gonna stop me and they keep going and that's what it's about bro Let me actually this Andy how many how many people create The hard times themselves like they created that situation and called it a hard time Right you know bro most people complain about all the hardships they have and all the unfairness they have and really what they're dealing with is the result of their own poor decision making right 100% right that is most people's hard times most of the hard times that the average person faces are The product of the poor decisions they have made in the past that is it and you still can't fucking address that but Dude the thing is is that they do not understand that the decisions that they are currently making today Will have a repercussion in the future. How can you not understand this? How can you be in that big of a denial? How can you not understand that the reason you have problems today is because that past version of you made poor decisions If you're honest with yourself, it should be very easy to see that real talk now Today you should be able to say okay, that's true That is true the reason I'm suffering and I can't pay my bills is because I fucked off and played video games for seven years The reason I'm fat is because I ate bullshit for seven years or eight years The reason I'm fucking I don't have a girlfriend or boyfriend is because I look like shit I don't make any fucking money and why the fuck would anybody want to date me be honest with yourself Because when you're honest with yourself you can fucking change it and once you acknowledge that the decisions you made in the past Were made by a different human being and this is the beauty of it, dude Once you understand this Once you understand that those decisions that you made in the past have created this situation that is unfavorable to you now And you understand that completely and you are aware of it and you are willing to make different decisions You are no longer that person That is the old you and even though you look like the old you and you earn like the old you Because you've become aware and you're willing to make more and better decisions to create now come down the road You are now a different person right now So you can change your life in a fucking instant by owning all of your shit and being honest with yourself about what's created most of your problems probably all of your problems in your life Which is you and I would highly encourage you to do that because most people never do it most people spend their entire lives Blaming everything around them and everyone around them for their shitty ass life and their shitty situation And they never come to the realization because they lack the courage to admit that it was them Have the courage to look in the mirror bro be honest with yourself because once you acknowledge that and you say I'm gonna do different and you commit to that Bro your life is gonna go a completely different direction You're gonna go a completely different direction your friends are gonna change your relationships are gonna change your money's gonna change your body's gonna change How you see yourselves gonna change because now that you understand that you are in complete control of your outcome Do you really think you're gonna continue to make these shitty decisions? You're not nobody will no it takes complete accountability For your past and your past decisions to come to a place of total acceptance and total responsibility for where you're at and once you're there and you commit to making better decisions and you fully Understand you fully understand that when you eat that food It's gonna make you fat you fully understand that when you play those video games for 12 hours a day It's gonna cost you financially when you fully understand that The alcohol and the fucking all this bullshit that you do is costing you you will cut that shit out The problem is most people don't understand how much it's costing them They don't understand what it's costing because they haven't fully taken responsibility for what they've done in the past and Applied it's a where they are now and decided to make new decisions forward because bro Here's the reality if you reached out and touched a stove and it was hot and it burnt your fucking finger and you knew That every single fucking time that you touched that stove it's gonna burn your finger Are you gonna fucking touch it a second time zero chance because you're gonna fucking stop Immediately and change the behavior and the reason most people don't is because they don't fully accept that where they are as a Result of their poor decision making it wasn't the stove's fault. Fuck no. It wasn't anybody else's fault Bro, you put that shit in your mouth. You put that shit in your body You did all those things that you did instead of doing the work to become the person you really want to become you did that nobody Else did that your boss didn't fuck you over bro. You fucked you over be honest Okay, and what's your honest and you truly accepting your brain? What I do today What I do right now is going to produce a result that's going to come out this Pipeline of time down the road whether it be 30 days 60 days 90 days six months a year five years from now When you understand that what you decide to do in the moment is going to change the outcome on the other side of time And you understand that to be factual fucking reality you are gonna make different decisions with your life period Where's case scenario? It's one less punch you got a fucking bro. No, you listen. You got to understand what I'm saying When you truly fucking understand it not kind of understand it Not I watched a couple Tony Robbins videos and I fucking I kind of like it not Not I'm you know, I'm feeling more into personal. I'm not talking about this I'm talking about total understanding I completely understand in my life that what I do today is coming out this pipeline On the other side as a result. So if I put in today It's gonna if I put in the right things today. It's gonna come out the other side of that pipe With the good things I want if I don't plant the seed today I'm not gonna have a crop the harvest later and that's the reality of your life and once you completely understand that It no longer becomes this big huge battle to do the things that you're supposed to be doing like it It's not hard for me to wake up and do what I'm supposed to do I don't wake up in the morning and sometimes I do sometimes I wake up in the morning and I'm like fuck Fuck I don't want to do any of this shit and you know what those are the test days and some of those days bro I'll sleep in I'll sleep till 10 o'clock bro and I'll get the fuck up and you know this to be true because I'll show up here to 11 But what happens on the days I show up here to 11 oh shit gets to go my shit gets fucking done bro It doesn't matter if I started slow. It doesn't matter if I'm self-loathing It doesn't matter if I have doubt it doesn't matter if I'm fucking sick It doesn't matter if I feel like shit. It does not fucking matter what I know needs to get done always It's done because I understand the reality of how it works if I plant today I'm gonna harvest then and if I don't plant today I'm not gonna harvest and when you're in my position What I plant today is gonna feed a lot of people down the road So like it's no longer about me and that's the cool part when you start to realize Like we talk about personal excellence being an ultimate rebellion when you start to realize that these decisions that you're making today affect other people Fuck dude Now you're in a position where it's super easy to do the shit. It's not even hard It's not even hard You know when it was hard to make these decisions for me when I fucking wanted to make a lot of money so I could drive a Lamborghini When I wanted to be ripped so I could be by the pool when I wanted all these self-fulfilling Outcomes that's when it was hard when it when it switched to holy shit Other people actually depend on me and my example matters and I matured as a human being by the way I'm still very immature. Okay, let's just get that out of the way. I'm not perfect That's why we do the CTI where we talk to talk a lot of shit I'm not the most mature human, but I'm mature enough to understand that my actions today are going to provide Outcome later that is going to affect people's lives. It's going to affect people's families That's a massive amount of responsibilities. So it no longer is about me and that makes it even easier and you guys who are parents out there are new parents You understand what I'm talking about you Don't shit, no brain right you understand the shit's gotta get done I got to put the shit on the table broke because these motherfuckers depend on me. So How do you low back so dude? Yeah, no shit But you know, that's the role of a leader the role of a leader the role of a successful person the role of a Personally, actually human is to understand the role and their role is you're gonna have to do the hard shit because not Everybody can do it and that's what we need more of in this country So there's two two answers to this. They're very simple one own your actual result that you're in right now Understand that where you are right now who you are right now the condition you're in right now is a result of Decisions that someone else a previous version of you made This is why you don't have to beat yourself up over it because someone else a different version of you who was less aware of what Things actually are in reality made these poor decisions and they have produced this outcome that you are in that you are very unhappy with You don't look the way you want to look you're not earning the way you want to earn You don't have a relationship you want a lot of things are fucked up. That's okay Because that person back there made those decisions and because you recognize it and you own it that that's why you have this now Now you're a new person so all you have to do is start making the decisions that The kind of person that you want to be would make right now and eventually after time goes about you become that person in real life And that's what fake it till you make it actually means fake it till you make it doesn't mean Ren a fucking Lambo and stand in front of a car on fucking Instagram for views what it actually means is Fake that you're that person with your behaviors and your actions until you actually become it So who do you want to be what do you want to look like how much money do you want to earn? Where do you want to be in your life? What kind of relationships do you want to be in? Then make the decisions that person will make and after enough time passes You're gonna be that person and that's how the fuck it works Fog a boat fuck a stone counted millions in a coke bad bitch Bull that slow got a own bank row can't fold doesn't know here shot case
