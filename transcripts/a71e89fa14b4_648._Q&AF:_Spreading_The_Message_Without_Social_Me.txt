Yeah, we'll see Well, uh, y'all already know the answer everybody knows already. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're just talking shit That's all right. Yeah, let's get into it man. I got some good ones for you All you do I do all right pull them out. Yep guys Andy question number one Andy I'm 41 years old and I've lived through the boom of social media successfully Never giving in to the urge to join any platform at any time and my 20s is seemed like a burden But given how much we've seen its negative impact on society and its terrible effects It has on our younger generations. It seems to be a blessing and hindsight I was able to be a successful entrepreneur without it doing business locally the old school way through hard work and personal relationships I'm now a successful entrepreneur with the great company here in St. Louis My real question is how the hell do you get your message out to people these days without it without social media I'd like to run for local office at some point in the near future But I'm normally opposed to these platforms also. I'm not a hoe. I show your show through links to friends with co-workers But I feel like that's incredibly inefficient as a man who is built a lot not all of his success has been an early adopter of social Marketing What would you do today to spread your message is if you didn't have any of these tools? Well first of all as much as I don't like The tools of technology as much as I believe That they have degraded Culture and humanity and I talk about this often It's still in my opinion a requirement if you're going to be successful in business I think you can do well and do okay without it. There's lots of people to do I think here's what I mean you could survive without it and you could do okay But there's there's a level that you're going to have a hard time reaching because the ability to reach the amount of people that you can on social media With little to no cost is unprecedented in human history So it's a huge advantage for business and when I talk about technology. I have to weigh the I the benefits of You know all the good stuff that is brought into my life and brought into the business world and entrepreneurship The opportunities that's created with the amount of damage that it's created and you know interpersonal relationships culture humanity as a whole And when I weigh those things out. It's my opinion that the cost Has been more than the benefit and that's just my personal opinion from observing all of it now with that being said I want to win okay, and this is why I tell you guys with AI You know, they're going to put companies in a position where they're forced to adopt it and even the most hardcore pro-human pro-job person They're not going to let their company fail if other companies are kicking their ass and the consumer is adopting the technology So all of this comes down to what culture and society Is going to decide is acceptable. What are they going to support? You know, there was a time in our country where people made truly Moral buying decisions based upon the ethics of a company and how it represented itself and what it stood for And as the culture swings back towards pro-America I believe the culture is going to swing back also towards Real people being employed real Americans having jobs and I think people are going to support that more and more and more And I also believe that humans can still do things much better than AI in terms of connecting with the customer which is what People are craving in the marketplace right now you could almost feel the craving for human interaction Because we spend so much time on these devices and so much time dealing with technology and automation and AI that people consumers are looking for places where they can connect with other people And so I believe that the companies that will stick this out and continue to employ people and continue to You know keep jobs and continue to do a good job connecting with their community are going to be any of the technology AI companies when it comes to selling consumer goods um Or even services so that's my opinion of where we're going um But I could tell you this bro like you can't be ignorant to the point where you Pretend like this isn't a huge advantage. This is a huge advantage. You're able to reach Fucking tens of thousands if not millions of people For basically free through good social media platforms and so I would encourage you if you are Looking to run for office and looking to you're gonna have to have these platforms bro like there's no option around it um I mean you could run a campaign against technology and you could get out and you could canvas the neighborhoods And you could do all the old school things and I still think those will work But I mean dude you're talking about fighting someone who has the ability to reach you know Thousands of people with the push of a button Or actually going door to door and hoping that you can make up that traction through work And I think you can but I think it's gonna be hard and I think the best solution for someone like you Would be to find some sort of middle ground where you're using a little bit of technology If not if for nothing else you're letting people know where you're gonna be and what you're doing for announcements You know what I'm saying you don't have to live on there um But dude as far as what to do you know fuck bro people want to get together with people It's over it's a it's in our DNA. We want to be together with people. So you're you know Things like going door to door. I think things like product Direct male maleers are highly underrated Um, I think things like you know holding town hall meetings. I think things like doing things anything community events runs Rucks workouts Barbecues fish fries these things people like to do and so if you can build an in-person community around doing whatever it is You're into I think you can do very well. Yeah But I think you're gonna leave a lot on the table if you just completely ignore the technology aspect Yeah, I think that's maybe what what confuses a lot of people is like so you because you're yes like technology's great But you're not saying put the whole business on technology or put the whole business up to social media There there is still a very real well. I think we have a problem, dude I think we have a lot of entrepreneurs And people in general see I grew up in an My first 10 years of business were basically in-person business. Okay, it was retail in-person business The things I had to do were like gorilla marketing tactics like I had to go door to door I had to go to actual events and network. I had to meet people in person. I had to do things like flyer parking lots and put signs and bathrooms and fucking bro like I'm talking about the cheapest shit possible to get the word out You know, we're talking like dude. I spent years Walking all over Springfield, Missouri giving out fucking free samples and uh You know little coupons or t-shirts that we had or a shaker cup for years Okay, to get the word out because we had to there wasn't social media you could there wasn't even an option So we couldn't afford radio television and newspaper because we were so small So what what would you do if you couldn't afford radio television newspaper and there was no social media What would you do That's the answer of how you get people so you need to start looking What would you do in those situations and I'm lucky enough to have built a business foundation in that era and then also Come along with technology and then flip those techniques into what you know as we know as social media and the way things are now So a lot of people when they do business, bro There are either one or the other there are there either like this guy who's completely old school No, no social media presence or there like some of these 20-year-old kids that know all the hacks But they don't know how to talk to anybody and they don't know how to actually connect with anybody And they don't know anything so like dude a good place to be is to blend the two Blend the old school in person the ability to connect the ability to care the ability to service a customer and make them understand that You actually give a fuck about them with the tools of technology and the ability to reach people at scale And when you blend those two you end up with a very unique Business that most people can't do because they lack the experience of what it was like to do business before Social media and technology and I personally think that one of the biggest reasons that I've been Successful up until this point in time has been because I know both sides of the fucking coin very well If you put me in an environment if the internet crumbled today and we had to go back to doing business the old way I would beat everybody's fucking ass because I've already done it and I know those skills and then you know We translate those skills into technology and that's what we do with our company So I think the answer here dude is you've got to understand this isn't always just a Cultural hot point to stand on or a point of principle to stand on There's uses for these tools, okay? And if we ignore the usefulness of certain tools We're going to be in a disadvantage. So we have to acknowledge Where these things bring value and that but we also have to keep our principles in mind of what we stand for So for you if you're a 41 year old man and you're sort of you believe in old school and you believe in connecting with people That doesn't mean you can't use technology But why don't you use technology to connect with people you see what I'm saying to show them how you can Yes, so like dude there's This polarization of thought where it's ant total anti-tech or total all the way tech Neither one of those people actually win It's the people who know how to blend the two how do you connect with people? How do you make people understand that you care? How do you serve them? How do you serve them in a way where they say Holy shit. I love doing business with these guys How do you do that and then how do you use technology to aggregate more customers into that? That is the way you should be thinking about whatever it is you're doing whether it be running for political office Whether it be running a business whether it be starting a charity or whatever it is you're trying to do People or people and they're always going to be people They're always going to want to connect with people They're always going to feel that they're going to feel like they're cared about They're going to spend money with companies that care about them All right, but if we just ignore the technology that's available We're going to have a hard time filling the funnel of available customers because guess what? That's where most people are So we have to learn to blend those two together and that would be my advice to you. I love it I love it guys any question number two Andy I have friends that know that I do music They seem to give me positive feedback and encouragement behind closed doors when it's just me and them But whenever I publish a song they fail to support They don't share my content or comment or like my stuff now. I know this is a sense of entitlement because I hear your content And you discuss the irrelevance of family and friends supporting you. Yeah, however This is a unique situation for myself is when they speak to me to my face or in private I get the encouragement But when I post my songs or content they see the stuff but fail every single time to share it my question is Am I being entitled or selfish or should they support the way they say behind closed doors? This feels annoying because when they Do their content I always support their stuff help. I appreciate all of your advice And so if I am being inside without understanding thanks Andy All right, so there's a couple things that could be going on here and none of them you're gonna like All right, I got this little coin over here. It says mercy or no mercy Uh, put it on a wrist It says mercy all right, so I'm be nice. I'm be nice about it But here's Because I can very easily be not nice around be nice about this all right Most of us think we're better than we are All right, most of us think our art is better. Most of us think our we're better a business Most of us think we're better in shape Most of us when we're creating something we think we're better than we are And when our family and friends see us doing these things because they care about us They will encourage us, but here's the thing bro People will not the people closest to you will not support you until other people are supporting you I don't know why it's that way, but it's that way when I was in business coming up, bro Nobody really ever fuck it. So I mean, yes my brother my dad closed people to me They supported but but like People that I was very good to people that I was friends with people they they would giggle they would laugh They wouldn't support us publicly. They kind of snickered and it wasn't until it was very clear That I was going to do something that then those people came around all right, so let's Let's break this down to what this could be okay. First of all you could not be good enough Your shit might not be good enough your shit might just need more work in order for people to like it And that's a very real option for you to consider because our friends and family will tell us we're doing great Whenever we're really not that good right we're over here painting a picture and like oh, he shit Dude that looks like Bob Ross in the Picasso. I like yeah, and it fucking doesn't right you put that shit out and people laugh So we can't take our friends and families encouragement to heart because it's not real they're biased all right, so That's one thing you need you you you may need to get better. I bet you do okay because we all need to get better And that's no offense to you Secondly, you're battling human nature all right nobody wants to be the first person to say that's cool shit And very few people can do that all right So most people wait until something is very obviously going to be successful Are very obviously going to be cool to jump on the bandwagon This is why your friends your family the people closest to you will not start to encourage you Until they see strangers encouraging you which is counterintuitive and it makes a scratch our heads like shit Why is it this way? It's just that way these people are reminded every single day that they're not doing anything relevant They're not trying anything relevant. They're not even attempting to be anything more than what they are And because you are they will pretend to support it, but they won't support it in public All right, but once you get to a point where you're kicking ass and everybody's starting to think you're awesome Then all the sudden bro it goes from them not supporting and they start showing up at your shit They show up at your shop they show up they buy your products and they start saying this shit Man, I always believed in you I'm so proud of you and you're thinking like if you always believe in me How come you never share my shit back in the day? How come you never help me out? How come you never had a conversation with me? How come you never gave me any good advice? Why'd you laugh at me? Why'd you make fun of me? Why'd you make those smart ass remarks if you always believed in me? Because bro, that's what happens these people fucking come around and they only come around Once you're so obviously going to do it and by that point you won't care that they're there That's the thing. So we greatly overemphasize the effects of other people's belief on us falsely thinking that we need their belief to be successful the people closest to you will never actually believe in you until you are very clearly going to win And then they will come back around and support you and some of them never will so it's actually irrelevant So the point here is you've got two things going on one your shit's probably not good enough yet All right, so you need to keep getting better and two you're dealing with human nature People aren't going to support you until it's very obvious that you're going to win Are you being entitled? Yes, okay, you can't expect people to push you out you've got to make it happen on your own You can't depend on anybody. Here's the reality of people in your life Just so we're clear Most people do not give a fuck about you, okay? You're going to realize this one way or the other along the way in life Most people most people you know right now in your life do not give a flying fuck about you They might be your friend. They might be cool to hang out with They might be cool to go to dinner with you might go on vacation with them even at the end of the day That your life falls apart those motherfuckers are not going to fucking be there. They are not going to be there for you All right, you might have two or three people in your life if you're lucky that you can count on if shit goes wrong Okay, and most of us spend our entire lives making decisions around what these people who do not give a fuck about us Actually think about what it is we're doing. So reconcile that in your brain We live our entire lives surrounded by people that don't give a shit about us And we make our decisions based upon what we're going to do what we're going to create and who we're going to become On the opinions of people that probably won't be in our life in five to ten years So we we get scared they're going to make fun of us. We get scared. They're going to laugh We get scared. They're going to criticize and so we do nothing We just hang out with them and do the same shit And then we waste all this time and all this opportunity and leave all this potential on the table for people's opinions that aren't Even relevant to us and if your life were to take a shit They wouldn't be there to help you So you've got to stop making decisions now. I'm talking to this man right here You've got to stop making decisions based upon the opinions of your friends and family And you have to start making decisions based upon what's going to be right for you not just today But in ten and twenty years from now. All right, so They're not going to support you until everybody else supports you. It doesn't make sense But that's the way it is You need to get better and you need to get better so that people outside of that network encourage you and say fuck Yeah, this is this is cool shit And then your people will come and enjoy that's how it actually works All right, so keep that in mind. You're not facing anything that Anybody else doesn't face that's trying to do anything. I don't know why that is you would think that your friends and your family And your your people they would all cheer you on the whole way. They don't They fucking don't and the reason they don't in my opinion is because you're an example of Going when they are afraid to go you're an example of chasing a dream when they are afraid to even dream You're an example of execution when they are afraid to get off the fucking bench And so they don't want you to actually succeed. Yes, they will tell you to your face. You're great You're talented. You're skilled. You're amazing But when it comes time to show up and buy your shit They won't be there, bro, because they're actually afraid that you're gonna make it because if you make it It shows them that they could have made it to and they've got to live with that regret So that's what you're fucking dealing with, bro So stop worrying about what it is people think about you stop making decisions based around what your friends and family think you should or shouldn't do and start making Decisions about becoming an awesome artist or an awesome musician or awesome CEO or an awesome entrepreneur or whatever the Fuck it is you do and dedicate yourself to that get better keep going eventually people from the outside will Care and then you'll see how fake the people around you actually are and when you see how fake they are because they come in and they start saying Andy I'm so proud of you when you were making fun of me for 15 fucking years. You're gonna give a shit Bro, yes, I'm respectful. Yes. I'm nice. Hey, thank you very much But dude when I walk away. I'm like yeah, where the fuck were you when I was fucking dying? Because you know yes, I remember everybody remembers because it's traumatic It's a traumatic thing for your friends and family to fucking think you're a piece of shit And to think you're a failure and to think you're a fuck up when you're struggling your ass off to try to build shit, bro That's a traumatic thing you're like fuck nobody's here for me And it's a very real lesson in life because guess what nobody is here for you And that's the biggest mistake a lot of you guys make is assuming that they are there's nobody here for you You have to put this on your back and carry it and if you don't you will not get there. That's the bottom line Fuck off this man. I want to I want to I want to follow up on this because you know you you talk about tapping in To the dark side using negative energy right as fuel Is it the best kind of fuel is this like this should this be the Yes, yes, you should be like fuck these people Okay, they don't believe in me. Yeah, you know what and then take all that energy and go do your art and get fucking better and better and better and better and better and better Bro might listen bro. I am the kind of person that if you doubt me if you question me if you fucking challenge me I will fucking rip your fucking throat out eventually trust me It might not be tomorrow. It might not be in two weeks You might not ever see it coming but eventually I will win All right, and that's the attitude that you have to have when someone steps on your toes You have to fucking stomp on theirs with your results And you do that through taking their negative energy their negative words their disbelief Putting them inside you and then every single time you don't feel like doing what it is you're supposed to do You think about that shit and you get up and go do it That's how you utilize the negative energy and if you don't learn to operate on that system Because we have all these hippie-dippy dumb fucks around all right telling everybody It's all peace and harmony and fucking inner peace and all this bullshit And they're sitting around with bowls and doing all this stupid ass shit and notice that none of those people ever get better None of those people ever become really anything They're just always sitting in this fucking perpetual state of parallelization Because they think that it's all about inner peace no It's not all about inner peace if you want to achieve things because you're gonna get good inputs believe support Encouragement and you're gonna get bad inputs negativity frustration disbelief disrespect and if you don't know how to use both types of that energy to move forward You're running at 50% capacity because there's tons of people out there that know how to use both Every single fucking great champion that you've ever watched Michael Jordan Tom Brady fucking any of them They I guarantee you bro. They take every single bit of disbelief that anybody's ever had them and they use it as fuel Do you think Tom Brady would have won seven fucking super balls if he was drafted first in the first round Not a fucking chance bro that put a massive chip on your shoulder and you guys who fucking have this Like you have this situation this person's talking about where people don't believe in them, okay? That's a blessing because it's gonna provide you with Unlimited amounts of fucking negative energy dark side energy that you can use to move forward It's a blessing for people to doubt you. It's a blessing for people not to believe in you It's a blessing for people to disrespect you if you know how to use it as fuel If you sit around and read the fucking internet and think you're Mr. fucking sunshine with your fucking Zuzu balls or whatever to fuck these things are called you're gonna lose bro Because this game is real. This is a real game and there's competition There are people who take it very seriously who do everything they can to win And if you think you're gonna only operate on good vibes you're gonna get fucking crushed Fuck me. Yeah, it's a fucking truth I think we should take it take a moment to to acknowledge our word of the day I think it was hippie-dippy dumb fucks. Zuzu balls and Zuzu balls. That's fucking great That's great, man bro. I can't stand it everybody look dude. They're always healing. They grow What the fuck are you gonna be healed and go do something Holy shit Well, I'm all about taking care of your mental health. It's very important It's important but the solutions that are provided by the internet are fucking wrong You have the reason you feel like shit is because you're not proud of yourself You have to be proud of yourself bro and to be proud of yourself You have to accomplish things and that starts with little bitty things that could start with making your bed Brush your teeth eating the right food getting some workout in getting out in the sunshine and moving around These are little wins that start making you believe in yourself over the course of time And if you don't want to fucking feel like shit bro start doing something that you're proud of Yourself for doing. It's very simple dude You're not gonna sit there and fucking zen your way into success dude I'm sorry. It's just not gonna unless you're one of the fucking leaders of it. You know, I'm saying I Drink my fucking cool aid You know, it's like for real. We're all speaking to drinking my cool aid quick message for my sponsors. Yes. They show Fuck dude. I'm just dude. I'm sorry man, and I know some people are into this shit But like be careful because that shit will suck you in and it will paralyze you and you won't do shit That's real shit, man. That's real guys. Let's get to our third and final question question number three It's good good cool aid Guys Andy question number three Andy I have a business partner and I started my company with them six years ago I wanted to ask after 25 years in business What sort of key roles do you and Chris play in business now like do you revisit your roles and audit them every so often Did it just stay the same throughout the partnership? Well in the beginning We just kind of both did everything um We both we didn't have roles and that was probably the first seven or eight years wow Yeah, and just do what we know what we were doing. Yeah, you gotta understand The reason I'm qualified to talk about this shit is because I started at the literal Fucking bottom bro, okay, and we've built some amazing shit Okay out of we didn't get ever getting inheritance. There was never a private equity deal Nobody ever came and fast tracked our success. I never sold part of my company to fucking Pepsi or fucking uh What like or any of these fucking coke. Yeah, I never did that like this is all we own everything here Right this is all built off of that first day in business and it's accumulated and I've done it the hard way And that's what makes me qualified to talk about this shit So like when you hear stories like yeah, we just kind of did what the fuck we did in the beginning That's because bro. We didn't know any better. Yeah, we knew we we knew Less than what probably most of the people listening though. All right, so We just kind of both did whatever we had to do and then um Eventually we had to have a conversation where you know when social media started coming around Somebody had to become the face and somebody had to do the backside And right around that time was when sal joined in with us and we started first form so that's when the roles got a little bit more defined Sal at that time was doing the sales I was running the company and being the face and Chris was running the backend and and that went for both s2 and first form and then uh, you know as we've grown in scale we have executive teams and we have people that help out and do certain roles and run to part and you know now Sal's the CEO at first form. I'm chairman of the board uh Chris still runs a lot of the backend stuff And then he has another business that he runs as well in the cannabis space right so you know our roles our roles Have been more clearly defined But it's still whatever the fuck needs to be done. I mean dude salad. I were sweeping the floor in the warehouse two nights ago Yeah, you know what i'm saying so whatever it's our attitude here is we're on the same team This is all we got we don't have any other options and we got to do we got to do and that's how that's how it always is No matter what the title is no matter what the responsibilities are I could be working on something. I could say hey sal i need your help. He's gonna come out here and help me He could be working on something vice versa. I'm gonna help him same with Chris and really dude honestly That's kind of the same of how we work here with all levels like the guys over here in media or In our graphic design department they i could be walking my and they could say hey Andy Would you look at this and we all collaborate and work together like this is not This our environment here is not corporate like what most people are used to it. That's not my role So i'm not yeah, it's not like that. It's a collaborative effort Wherever the effort is needed You know what i'm saying and i think that's built from our culture and that's built from um Leadership with limited ego. Okay, you have to have some ego people say oh you got to eliminate the ego If you eliminate the ego bro, you're gonna be a bitch Okay, you have to have some ego you've got to believe in yourself a little bit You got to know that you're a bad mother fucker to even play in the fucking game You can't run out of the tunnel at the fucking national championship football game thinking you're a humble little pussy You're gonna get your fucking ass beat okay, so we got to have a little bit of ego But we got to have enough humility to balance that out to where we know when we need help We know what we don't know we're very aware where we're strong We're aware where we're weak and so you want to have a balance like that and i think that collaborative Culture exists through all of our Employees here at the company, you know, yeah at the companies I think when people need help they ask When we can offer help we offer it and we all work together and i don't think there's a The titles here. I think mean a lot less than what they would mean at a normal company. We're else Yeah, I would agree with that. I would agree with that. Let me make sure this yeah, would you In the early days where i mean even now has there ever been a point in time where it's like okay Uh a role or responsibility a job has come up and nobody wants to do it. How does it get done Like it's not your forte. It's not sour. It's not Chris is like how does that work? We figured out yeah Somebody jump sit and says i'll handle it and they handle it. Maybe that's me. Maybe that's Sal maybe that's somebody else. Maybe that's one of you guys. Yeah, I mean Just like how we operate here on the podcast team. There's lots of stuff. We don't know and what do we do figured that figure it to fuck out. Yeah, and uh, you know we got Lots of people who want to win. I think when you have people who are aligned where they want to create a certain end result Um, it's not too hard to get people to contribute and Taking initiative is one of our core values in our culture And taking responsibilities also another one And those are but like if there's a problem I got to take responsibility for that and take the initiative correct it if we don't know how to do something We got to learn how to do something And I think a lot of people hold them back because they cap off what they know they said well, that's not my expertise So that's not what i'm good at and really that's just them saying i don't want to do that I don't i don't want to do that because we all have the capacity to learn like if you have employees and they answer you with Well, that's not really what i'm good at or that's not my expertise You got the wrong employees, bro Because the right college for this that's right the right employee the right leader the right CEO is gonna say you know what I fucking figure it out That and if you want to know how to create value, you know, we got a lot of entrepreneurs here to listen to the show You want to know how to create massive value, dude Be the kind of person that can fucking take responsibility and figure it to fuck out and see it through to solution Without having to be directed if you can take the initiative and take the take the initiative to solve the problem Take the responsibility to make the problem yours own it Find the solution and see it through to the end bro You become an invaluable asset to any company you work for and if your company doesn't value that like if you have if you do that And your company doesn't value that There's lots of companies will pay big money for that. We're one of them by the way, you know One of the things that you have to be able to do bro If you want to be successful as an entrepreneur is you got to know basically three skills You got to know how to lead manage you got to know how to sell and you got to know how to own problems and find the solutions and do it Without direction if you can do those three things inside of a company your payroll can really almost be whatever Whatever it has to be because that's in it. It's a fucking impossible skill to find in the workforce It's impossible most people won't do any of those three things and they want the big check Most people can't manage most people can't lead they can't sell and most people won't take on problems because they're lazy And they just want to collect a fucking check and those three kinds of people need to get the fuck out of your organization if you want your organization to win Yeah, I mean actually four ways on that back in of course Yeah, listen man. This is this is part of the woke culture corporate environment that exists today People believe not here are my companies. Thank God. I fucking love coming here bro Because I work with like the baddest motherfuckers on the planet bro Not only are these people good what they do They're also great athletes and their toughest fuck they're out here running a hundred miles and all this crazy shit all the time Yeah, dude, they're just bad-ass motherfuckers So like when I talk about this I am definitely not talking about our organizations at all But what I will say is there's a lot of organizations where people just don't give a shit And a lot of you guys work at them. You know what it's like you show up there people are there for a check. They're there for To do time and then they go home at the end of the day think of how unfulfilling that existence must be Think of how disgusting you must feel about yourself to go to a work Place contribute nothing do nothing expect a check and then expect more money for just Skink it out shit. Yeah, and dude you wonder why you're depressed and you wonder why you don't feel fulfilled It's not the fucking job. It's you. You're not applying yourself. You're not trying to create You're not trying to contribute. You're leaving all your potential untapped on the table Dude if you just took some initiative and took some responsibility and learned some fucking skills Like managing people and selling some shit bro your paycheck could quadruple With the right company and that shit is not that hard to learn I mean dude you come proficient in those things in two three four years You know in the two three four years in a lifetime. That's a very look. You know what I'm saying? It's not much time. Yeah, so You know the reality is is look man Most business cultures are fucking terrible because the leadership is terrible They show up at fucking 11 they go home at fucking three they show up Tuesday through Thursday and then they expect their organization to run awesome That's not how it works man. It's never gonna work that way You're gonna have to be if you're gonna if you're leading an organization or you're leading a department or you're leading a team You're going to have to be the living breathing example for what the fuck you want your people to be That's what you have to be otherwise. They'll never become it because they can't even see what it looks like This is what I'm talking about too when I talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion a lot of people laugh at that They're like oh that's some corny shit. Okay, I broke motherfucker You know what I'm saying right here's the reality personal excellence has to exist it is an obligation for us because when people observe it They start to become it. How could someone become anything that they don't observe and you take this same idea that we talk about culturally Especially on CTI with you know being fit being intelligent being someone who's financially successful Being someone who treats people right being someone who gets engaged in the community Being all these things that we talk about when we talk about personal excellence Okay, and then take that same idea and put it in the leadership inside of your company If you're not operating on that standard and they don't observe what it looks like with their own eyes now What you say what they see they will never become what it is you want them to become so a lot of you leaders out here that you know You say oh, I got all these problems my employees suck no bro you fucking suck Because if you were the shit they'd all be the shit Most people want to be good. They just don't know what the fuck it looks like they can't identify it because it's so rare This is what this is the same problem we have in our country our country doesn't give a fuck because nobody gives a fuck It's going to take certain people stepping up and saying you know what I care and if you're and I don't care if anybody else cares I don't care if anybody else in my neighborhood gets their ass in shape I don't care if any of my friends give a shit I'm going to be better It has to start with one person and that one person is always you and when you change the epicenter of your energy Which is you your entire environment changes the people around you change they get better their attitude changes And all of a sudden you've got a team of people that are working towards a common thing And if for if nothing else you're not surrounded by a bunch of fucking hack losers Okay, so like dude You are the epicenter of your environment and when you change your environment changes and that comes down to take your Responsibility taking initiative and becoming the example that you want to see in your environment And whether you're leading a company or whether you're just trying to be a good parent a good example or a good dad in your neighborhood The principles are the exact same I fucking love it. Yeah, they're the same. I love it. I love it man. Well guys Andy That was three. Yep. All right guys. Appreciate you guys go pay to fee Yeah
