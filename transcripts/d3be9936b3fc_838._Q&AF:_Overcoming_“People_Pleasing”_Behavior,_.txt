What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and it's the show for the realest say goodbye to the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys. Today we have Q and A F that's where you submit the questions and we bring you the answers. Now you can submit your questions for the show a couple different ways. The first way is guys email these questions into ask Andy at Andy for salad.com or you go on YouTube in the comments section drop your question down there and we'll pick some from there as well. Throughout the week we're going to have cruise the internet we call that CTI that's where we put topics on the screen. We speculate on what's true and what's not true and we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world. Sometimes we're going to have what's called real talk real talk just five to twenty minutes and we give you some real talk. The other times we're going to have 75 hard versus now 75 hard versus is where people have completed the 75 hard program come on the show they talk about how their life was before how their life is now and how they used the 75 hard program to for lack of a better terms fix their shit. If you're unfamiliar with 75 hard it is the initial phase of the live hard program which is the world's most famous mental transformation program ever you can get it for free at episode two zero eight on the audio feed again that's two zero eight on the audio feed only there's also a book the book is available Andy for salad.com it's called the book on mental toughness it includes the entire live hard program plus a whole bunch of chapters on mental toughness how to develop it why it's important and how to use it in your life to increase the quality of your life now we do something different on this show we don't run ads you're going to find that we're the biggest show in the world that doesn't run ads so in exchange for that I ask very simply that you help us grow the show the show makes you think if it makes you laugh it gives you new perspective you learn some new things do us a favor and help us spread the word all right we like to say it like this don't be a hoe show the show all right what's up hey good morning good looking yeah that's right I am good looking what's going on with you bro nothing dude yeah yeah just counting down the days for the launch of the new msco project we're down to days now and we're not going to talk about when it was launched or when it's going to launch you're going to have to be on the email list to know when it launches so if you're not on the email list you should go to Andy Priscilla comm subscribe to the Andy Graham which is your daily I don't know pep talk you know and you'll find out about when the mfco launches where it's going to be and how you can get it so how excited like like let's be real like no no proof of shit but how excited are you for for that coming back very because it's more than just teaching people how to make money at this point you know the first time we did the msco project it was about how to become successful and now it's about not only how to become successful but how to become successful in all areas of your life accompany with the idea that it is our duty to become the best that we can be in order for this country to become the best it can be there has been an abandonment of personal responsibility and obligation because we have been quote unquote free for so long that people think they are free to live a shitty life and that America will just exist if all of our people here live less than the standard of what it should be and that's just not how it works so the goal here is for me to teach people who are young not just young in age but young in experience how to build a life how to build a company how to make money but also understand our obligation to becoming the best people that we can be so that we don't have what just happened for the last 10 years in this country or 12 years or 15 years happen again which is the removal of personal responsibility you know and ambition you know where we started to get into a situation where people started to see ambition success and winning as some sort of negative thing right that is all programming it is not negative at all it is the it is your obligation to go pursue the best possible version of yourself because other people are going to follow you whether you you know understand that now or not and you know there was a time in this country where people understood that sacrifices were made and that citizens had an obligation to try their best to be their best and that's something that we need to restore with the younger generation and all generations and so you know I'm excited because it's not just about like you know hey let's go out and make some money you know what I mean it's about like hey let's go make some money and become the best that we can be and set the right example and show other people how it's done so that we can create you know a movement of citizens that stands for personal excellence because when we are personally excellent in all areas other people notice they start to pick up the pace they start to join the group the standards raise and the standards of this country get better so you know it's it's a big mission but you know I'm not CEO of I'm not actively the CEO of uh you know first form anymore or or really any of the companies anymore I've moved into chairman roles and investment roles I have the time to dedicate to this so I'm really uh I'm really excited about it dude it's gonna be awesome I feel like there's a lot of people out there now who have gotten on that page I'm understanding the obligation it's just okay but like now let's give the tools what do I do right then a lot of entrepreneurs I feel can come out of this too bro which we need well I mean bro there's there's I mean tens of thousands of entrepreneurs that started with the old MSEO project that are now you know eight ten twelve years in doing well yeah so there's no doubt of the impact that it makes but um you know I just think that there's so much misinformation and there's so many liars and there's so much bullshit that the lack of real entrepreneurial experience and information is just it's just lacking yeah um and the principles that that make up a actual successful life and business uh it's a little more complicated than just getting ripped you know I'm saying like um so you know I'm sharing my 26 years of experience building a portfolio that's worth 10 figures uh you know with everybody else so I'm excited about it I'm excited to get through it too man um well uh it's Q&A so let's make some people better the day guys Andy uh I got some good ones for you let's knock these out question number one Andy Andy I've always been a people pleaser um and it's exhausting yeah I want to set boundaries and prioritize my own happiness but I'm afraid of upsetting others how do I begin to change this mindset and stand up for myself I don't want to go another year being a people pleaser how do we do that well look there's nothing wrong with pleasing other people are servicing other people and a lot of times when we talk about you know when we talk about entrepreneurship and we talk about serving the customers we get into this mindset which isn't bad by the way of trying to please everybody but the problem is we can't please everybody it's impossible and a lot of times when we try to please everybody we end up a ban in our own self in that pleasing and that's where you have to draw the boundary you have to realize that when you're when you're serving or you're giving it's not being reciprocated um you know it's time to draw a boundary of some sort like in a business environment you know you serve serve serve they give you money right and a friendship environment you know you serve serve you get nothing back well you should probably stop that because you're pouring in and getting nothing back and we are we are energy beings and when we pour all our energy into one person or two people or people in general and we don't keep any for ourselves or don't get any back we end up in a situation where we feel drained or feel exhausted like he's describing or she's describing the question so how do you do that well saying no is a skill that people have to learn and you don't have to you know just give this long explanation about you know why you're not doing things that you know you wouldn't normally otherwise do so or other people want you to do that's right and dude at the end of the day dude you do have to look out for the best interests of yourself because no one else is going to look out for you it's the truth so there's a very fine line between being a team player and also making sure that you are in the spot that you need to be in and most of the time when people can't set boundaries is because they have a hard time saying no because they're such they're so used to pleasing everybody or trying to please everybody that it feels unnatural of them so just like anything that we uh you know have to get good at you have to practice saying no and then just letting it be you know no is a complete sentence it's a skill to practice and when you mean no you should say no and when you mean yes you should say yes and sometimes that is going to be uncomfortable because people have been used to you saying yes to things that you were now saying no to things and um you know but reality is is once you move away from those people and you just start operating like a normal human nobody has a problem with people saying no you know what I'm saying so this is just something that you need to work on saying no without you know overly explaining yourself now if there's people like in your family or close friends or you know they might be confused by this so you you might have to sit down and have a conversation hey look I'm pouring all this and I don't have that energy dude and I'm not getting anything back maybe they just don't realize that that's the dynamic so innocently ignorant correct yeah well they become accustomed to it yeah right like when you start putting silk sheets on your bed you sleep in them every night you stop appreciating those silk sheets after a while right so it's important that you know you realize that maybe some people are doing this with just because you've been so over accommodating for so long and they're not aware so communications a big deal uh the ability to say no is a big deal and um you know you have to understand that you have the right and the um yeah I mean you have the right to to make decisions that and you should make decisions that are good for you you know and there's a balance in life like sometimes you make decisions that are good for other people that may not be as good for you knowing that that's going to create a better situation long term there's all different ways to think about this but the end of the day most people have problem with boundaries because uh they they've not you know maybe they have a a fucked up parent or somebody that's made them feel guilty for everything um you know and and you end up having a hard time setting a boundary because you feel guilty every time you say no dude you're gonna feel better when you set those boundaries you know and those people that try to guilt you and try those people are manipulative you just cut those people out bro yeah I don't have I don't deal with that shit no more like I I personally used to have a really hard time with that I used to I used to be able uh I used to let people make me feel guilty when I didn't give them what they wanted in the moment and honestly dude like it was one of the hardest things I had to get over sometimes I still struggle with it because I am that kind of a person of a good heart man uh well it's yeah and people take advantage of it and especially when you have financial means uh you know and you've got a money tree in the backyard yeah I mean dude look it's beat to be successful you you have to learn to set boundaries and say no otherwise you won't be able to keep your money so this is not just a skill that's gonna make you feel better it's also a financially advantageous skill to learn yeah 100 percent I was I was on I mean I was gonna ask you this because I actually I heard you you say this before I forget where we were man but you were like other people's reaction to your decisions is not your concern was like the gist of it and I think that you got me like saying no that's true that that's true in some situations you know if it's your family or your your uh you know your brother or your wife or you know I mean like it's not as cut and dry as that you want sure correct yeah so overall you can't you can't hang get hung up on how somebody else is gonna fill about something that you're trying to do for your betterment of you 100 percent but also dude is like if you have those conversations and nothing changes then you can't let that bother you either you just have to say well it is what the fuck it is yeah you know I want to actually this final piece on this question two minutes because I think it's important to you know we've talked about accountability on the show we talked about you know how do you you can't hold somebody else accountable if you're not holding yourself accountable is this does that same kind of mindset apply to this right like it's hard to take care of other people if you're not taking care of yourself you know I'm saying and I think I mean look to themselves out like that because it's like bro bro you're not even caring about your fucking self I have something that I say all the time dude you have to be selfish to be selfless okay if you're not where you need to be if you don't have the proper energy that you need if you're not in shape the way you should be in if you're not living the standard that you know you should live you don't have as much to give to other people it's just reality so for you to be able to truly serve other people you have to get to a point where you were taking care of yourself and your own shit is in order otherwise whatever you give them is going to be less than what you could give them anyway and quite honestly you're doing both yourself and them a disservice by not holding these boundaries that we're talking about yeah I love it man I love guys any question number two Andy I appreciate the work you have done to elevate everyone around you my question is more of a general question about success I'm 19 and I think that even the idea of just pursuing greatness excites the show out of me being able to write your own path build something crazy I know it's something that I want to do my question for you is though on the journey you've mentioned this like hockey stick thing uh-huh being the visual to what success looks like but are there times on the journey where you have to intentionally take one step back to take two steps forward I feel like people would call sacrifices I guess but what were some that you had to take to stay on the path and keep moving forward and how do you make sure that once step back doesn't become too well first of all it's only a step back if there's no step forward later and it's only a sacrifice if there's no payoff later so really the only way you lose in those situations if you're doing it strategically is by not following through on the other part of the deal right it's easy to take the step back and then just say oh well I don't want that anymore because I changed my mind right because it got hard so this is a normal this is normal and there's been a number of times in my career where I've had to take steps back quote unquote but we're actually investments in my future um you know and I'll talk about a couple of those in just a second but let's talk about the hockey stick thing because not everybody fucking understands that so when you start out to do something imagine you lay a hockey stick to handle the long part on the ground and then you let the blade point up to the sky that represents what has been the pretty standard curve of success for me now I know there's other people out there who maybe they had investors or they had big things happen quickly or right but for me it's grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind way past the point where it's any fun or it's it's it's you know yeah and then eventually some things start to happen you know you you make mistakes you learn lessons you make mistakes you learn lessons you make mistakes you learn lessons and eventually you accumulate enough lessons quote unquote skills that allow you to make the right decisions and when that starts to happen the curve goes up dramatically and it's not that the curve just grows like that dramatically it's that now you've built the skill set inside yourself that you didn't have before right if you had those skills in the beginning the long part would be much shorter but most of us don't I started off complete rookie all right like a lot of you guys so it just takes time for us to you know get our asses kicked and then learn the lesson and that's the reality of how it goes and that's the reality of how it goes for any self-made entrepreneur now there's been times where you know uh you know for example like there's been times of business where we were working on something and we had a lot of money invested in it and then we had to cut that because it wasn't working out so then we had to cut loose you know big investments and time investments energy investments because it wasn't going to work so you take a step back you learn the lesson you keep moving forward right that's happened I mean I that's happened a lot like to keep happening yes a lot times of business in fact most of the things that we've tried didn't work most that's what people don't see you don't see all of these failures these micro failures that happen in someone's success because they're not getting on the internet and teaching you all that shit right because nobody wants to talk about it you get your balls kicked in but the reality is is like dude more things go wrong in business than go right and uh all those things that go wrong teach you lessons and they become very valuable you know um there's situations where you know uh you know I had to give up equity or partnerships in certain deals because we had to bring someone else in who was also skilled right so while that may seem you know to be a step backwards it's not because the people that have come in are highly skilled and allow us to grow to that that next level next level next level so you know and and there's all kinds of situations like that dude like there's all kinds of situations where you're gonna take a step back and you're gonna be like shit is this the right thing or should I have done that or you know but it's not it's always the right thing if you keep going because you you're gonna get a better result in the long term so I feel like for a lot of youngsters man you know this is something we talk about a lot like fear of missing out you know I'm saying like for a lot of them that step back might be you not going to go to that fucking party with your friends this weekend you know I'm saying like and like you know they're not looking at it like they're looking at it's truly something they're actually missing out on a stepping back away from but it's like the reality is what's the payoff for not miss for missing that yeah you know I'm saying like what was some what was some early times I mean like well I guess when did you start changing your mindset and your you know your path of success here when you know in the early days dude I didn't change I still went out and partied I still went out and did all the shit I drank all the time uh you know and our business didn't grow okay so when I when I stopped doing that when I started taking everything serious and I started getting serious it grew very fast that's when the luck kicked in right exactly exactly but I wouldn't I wouldn't trade it I mean like I wouldn't I had a lot of good memories I've I've got to experience a lot of things um I just would have been where I am now I think much faster yeah but I don't regret it because all those things made me who I am now yeah so I would the last thing you want to be as some fucking business nerd with no life experience you know what I mean a lot of those out there there is and I feel like I've got I feel like I got both yeah you know we got a long way to go in business and we're gonna take it there but uh you know I I think the more serious you take it the quicker things are gonna go and the less serious you take it the slower things are gonna go and um if you're in a hurry to really change your existence that's where you go all in bro and you don't play video games and you don't drink alcohol and you don't go out with your friends and you'd fucking there was a time five or six years from like 2009 to like 2016 that that time frame or fuck dude I didn't leave my office you know what I'm saying like I didn't fucking leave like I was in my office all day staring at computer all day I'm talking like 20 hours a day right up take a nap get back up work um you know and and but I I believe that those that's the time when the company was truly built you know and now we've brought in all these other smart people like you know my brother and Jason and you know we've got all these other guys here that are a little older than us that have experience and you know now it's just 19 hours a day right now I mean look man I mean I'm surrounded by people that are that are much smarter than me at this point and uh you know it's it's a different game at this point you know what I mean you should by the way you should always surround yourself with people smarter than you always only dumb people with big egos don't do that yeah so it's not about who gets the credit it's about did you win or not win that's real shit yeah that's real shit guys Andy let's do a third and final question question number 3 Andy uh I just started a life insurance agency and I'm working on hiring some people uh but I don't want to hire just anyone I want to build a team that is success driven and willing to continue to grow into amazing badass people that want to win at a high level like I do uh what are some questions I can be asking or points I can be making uh to make sure people will be a good fit any advice on this will be appreciated yeah I mean look dude here's the thing about building a team that people okay look dude let me explain it like this when when college college football uh Alabama Michigan Georgia they're all recruiting the same guy okay they're all coming in and they're all saying hey come see us so you go on three visits and one of the visits is gonna feel better than the other visits the reason that it's gonna feel better than the other visits is because that place has a culture that aligns with that individual does that make sense okay so when we think of an organization it's very important to understand that there is no employee tree there is no place where you just there's no secret website where you go out and hire these people and they show up and they're fucking amazing now eventually like sometimes you're gonna get lucky and you are gonna have someone but the reality is is you know most people think of it backwards it's not go out and find these people it's build what you want internally in terms of the culture that you want and then find people the people that align with it will find you okay so most businesses especially small medium businesses are the opposite they pick these employees from random places based on experience from all different areas they stick them in a fucking organization and then they wonder why they don't have a good uniform culture or good teamwork okay this is most companies the great companies the ones that are the greatest companies in the world that have ever existed they have a very defined culture all right apple it runs things a certain way amazon run at the office level run c-suite and management runs things a certain way fucking uh you know all of these companies all the biggest companies in the world and how's her bush fucking google fucking you know what i'm saying they all have a culture and that culture has either been established by the founder and passed down or it's been intentionally built where they said okay this is what we stand for and by the way the best companies are those companies that intentionally build it that means they have a set of core values that the management and the c-suite and everybody the owners live by they they make decisions they hire by these they fire by these they live by these they correct by these by these rules core values of the character traits that we're going to embody as individuals this is just like when i talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion and that culture will change once the individuals change this is the same thing in business okay so you set the culture as an organization and then people will will either fall in line with that and and some will and some won't okay and then you're going to find as the company expands and as you get more people that are in line with the culture more people begets more people okay so what will happen is your company will start to attract these people because they can see from the outside i want to be a part of that okay so but this all starts with an intentional construction of a culture that represents who you are as the decision-maker operator founder CEO of the company it's very important to listen what i just said who you are because if you try to go out and make a set of core values and cultural boundaries and by the way this is what this is a this is something i could teach you in a workshop for a week we can talk about some summarizing this down into like an answer right it's also something to make you a fucking bajillion dollars if you do 100 percent 100 percent dude but the point of this is is you have to be aligned with the core values that you set because if you don't live those core values your employees won't your team will never catch and the culture will never actually be created so it's very very important that the core values that you separate the business are authentically who you are or who you make a very strong effort to be all right genuinely not not you know making shit up and then you pretend like it's some sign that we see on the wall that's what shitty companies do shitty by the way how many companies you walk in you see these motivational posters right right like bro or you go to these teams and they got a fucking saying on the wall you know play like a champion today and everybody touches it but nobody actually lives it doesn't mean shit and by the way that's Notre Dame we know that they all live it so i'm just using as an example all right but we have to understand that as operators founder CEOs the culture stems from us we intentionally define it we live it we have the people that work with us live it and then we will attract the people who fit just like the guys who want to play a mission are gonna play a mission the guys want to play Alabama they're gonna play there the guys want to play Tennessee they're gonna play there and the reason they pick that 100 percent of the time is because the culture fits them all right so it's a very very powerful concept it's a high level concept not very many people know how to do it um but if you set that up and then build questions because now i'm going to answer the question and then build questions in your interview process that dig out and there is no standard questions you have to make them up but what questions could you ask to find out if this person will align with the culture that you set so what can you dig out of them how can you get them to tell you stories about their life or situations that reflect the cultural standard that you're looking to reflect inside your company okay and these are things that we teach in arte these are things that i'm gonna get into on the mfceo project um but i mean this is this is a like i said like this is a week long workshop that i can probably charge seven figures for for companies to come learn it so like this is a more this is more involved than a q&a but that's the gist okay who are you what do you want your company to stand for develop quite define that develop questions that reflect that interview people and try and do your best you're not going to hit a one you're not going to hit one thousand dude you're hollow fames three hundred yes right and if you hit three hundred in interview process you will be in a fucking hall of fame yeah real talk no shit let me i want to touch on this piece though that that you mentioned about building people right there is no that's a whole another i'm glad you brought that up yeah you have to become the coach the mentor the leader of these people okay both their skill set at work but also their character all right take home yes like how can you be better why do we do things certain things this way you know um how it most i mean dude it comes down to a very simple question do you want a decent organization that that does okay or do you want a great organization that you enjoy going to work at and that makes a lot of money and that makes your customers really fucking happy i want the second okay so i want to be around people that are like me i want to be around people that are you know cultural fit i want to be around people that work hard and do the right thing and and i want to that's what i want to do i don't want to be around a bunch of people i got to drag down the fucking road you know what i mean well i know but most people do yeah most people do the biggest question that i get when entrepreneurs come visit here is dude and that's what they say yeah where where we hire your employees i know these people yeah like and that's just the wrong understanding of of it's an oversimplified old thinking about how you could build an organization or a team it's just what it is like no one goes to Nick Saban and says where to fuck you find these people because everybody knows that Nick Saban builds these motherfuckers through a certain culture and standard at you know when he was the coach of Alabama you understand yeah so no one says hey they just say well fuck he's good at picking him and then he molds him all right and as an operator you have to take on the role of you know not just CEO or founder but also big brother sometimes uncle sometimes dad sometimes right mom sometimes right like best friend sometimes you know like it's a bit it's your you you have to become a true coach and that's something that i think you know the leadership here at first form does a really good job of not just me but everybody you know 100 percent man yeah well guys that's the hell we just try to Monday yeah yep all right guys well let's get out there let's kick some ass and don't forget to go get on that email list all right because that's coming in days it's not coming in weeks anymore the new msco project so go get on that email list at andy forsello.com and then we'll see tomorrow's cti.
