Yeah, we're having two way Lot of people had that yeah, you know, it was it was crazy But like I've saw this video the other day and like this guy had like had the generation one iPhone It was just comparing like side by side with the new shit It's like even the camera bro like and I get that time though. It was like The best fucking thing you could possibly think like the first gen iPhone versus like what's now, you know, I'm saying I still have it in the box You still have it with the first rating system. Those are worth like 40 grand right now Yeah, if you never opened it all the unopened by always we're probably making it appear that way. Yeah, I'm sure.

There's a certain piece of a peril I'm not gonna name because the minute I name it everybody's gonna want to do it But we're doing it and they're making fun of me because I want to do green and gold and they were like why green and gold? I'm like You'll see green for the money gold for the honey's So When it comes out you all better buy it so I don't look stupid Oh, yeah, man crazy crazy times, man crazy times That was before Israel could blow them up Oh shit It's gonna be a good show. Yeah, this is gonna be good. We've already got canceled 17 times We need a disclaimer for the show. Yeah, we need nope no pussies Dude, what is it with people man? We can't even joke you can't even joke people get so upset about jokes It's a fucking joke. What's the definition of a joke? What is the definite? It's like they don't understand the definition of a criminal Right like all right. Let's make laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals Yeah, right and the definition of a criminal is somebody breaks a fucking law Men and women is a joke is a thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter Especially a story with the funny punchline Well What's to say about what's the winner of the other alternative? Just says verb make jokes stock humorously. That's it Why do people not understand that? what I'm just thinking somebody bad things in my head right now I know but like I don't know bro, but you know what's funny You don't see these people really in real life. No everybody jokes in real life bro and everybody laughs It's like this. There's like this person it must be bots. Yeah, not real like or that's AI Yeah, like trying to make people because dude you know like people don't really understand this they think it's like They think it's crazy talk, but dude Political correctness is a cultural weapon. Yeah, like it's the in political meant to make society better No, it's meant to silence you. It's saying hey Don't say that because people will be offended and If people are offended that's a bad thing. Well, sometimes it's not a bad thing that people are offended Sometimes the greatest things in your life happened because somebody offended you like I don't know Like one time I was flying on an airplane when I was 350 fucking pounds and the guy offered me a seatbelt extender You know what happened? I lost 100 fucking pounds. I was offended. It was great. You know, I'm saying You didn't get mad. It's like no, I didn't get seats need to be big I got mad for about 30 seconds and I'm like fuck I am fat And then I started fucking handling it. You know, but my point is is that sometimes people do need to be offended sometimes bullying does work and Jokes are a way for people to connect humor is how people connect it is across cultural language People who don't even speak the same language understand humor, bro And the reason that cancel culture exists and political correctness exists when it comes to joking is because they don't want people to connect And they want people to censor their own language So tell all the fucking jokes because the world's better real talk man, and it is across fucking culture There's this this is real it was like three Arab guys on a zoom call with a black dude I think they like you know, they laughed at the He put the fucking ass of turban off. No, he put a cone on his face like the guys must say no, no, no bro I know what you're talking about. There's a video. They're all wearing a turban Yeah, yeah, is that what they call those things? What it's a headgear. I don't know. Okay, well, all the same to me. So this dude is like Yeah, I mean what the fuck do they call it then bro? I thought that's what it was called Which by the way, I think they're pretty fucking sweet. They are cool. Yeah, they do for real I think I might get one would it be offensive if I wore one? No, I think it might somebody would be a fan I'm sure somebody yeah, but you know what fuck you but somebody that don't wear turban's at all would get offended Yeah, that's right. That's what it was right. Have you ever tried one? Yeah Don't not continue to try it. Akuta. Kuta. What'd you call me? A poo poo? You say Kuta I thought you say Kuta. Yeah, I said right to you A Puta Good good good Anyway, I'm gonna get one, but yeah, that that video is hilarious. There's like three dudes and they're all Arab or Indian or something And what I Don't fucking know what they are. They're not white. They're all one of them. They're not white Listen motherfucker. They're not white and they're not black. I'm not sure what they are But the guy it was the fourth guy was Mexican for sure And he put a fuck he put the fucking head thing on and they all they all start dying laughing Like they laugh for like 10 minutes, dude. That's what it's supposed to be bro Like if we're all standing in the middle of fucking India. Tell me this isn't true, bro We're all standing in the middle India and like you you don't speak English. I don't speak Indian fucking A fucking dude eat shit in front of us on his bicycle. We're laughing at everybody's laughing And then we're gonna go be like yeah, you all right And then we're gonna laugh more But like everybody knows humor dude and they try to get us to not be funny And not tell jokes about each other or to each other because it reduces the bond In humanity bro, it's the only way To really bridge the gap between cultures like in a in a very fast way What are we gonna do sit down and fucking interview each other for seven have this serious deep talk for 17 hours about our cultural differences Shept the fuck up dude Yeah Anyway, I want one of those things a good to Good to drag good to rap. Oh Here it is. Oh, you got the video This is funny dude This is one of my favorite videos on the internet It's like all right. He's a fucking chic. That's the iron sheet down there on the left Here you go He's dead serious Yeah I'm a kind of a lot of Bro, it's so good see that's what that's funny shit man.

Mm-hmm have a laugh Or two yeah, that's just not funny. Okay. Well go away How do you not think that shit's funny? I don't know Imagine a miserable that would be where you're pointing out everything in life. That's that's like Funny, but not funny. That's not funny. Mm-hmm I would love to see what these people talk about I'm just I was about to I would love to hear that Like what they think is funny, you know What do you think it is? I'll do one if you do one No, no No, we can't go there We can't get away. Okay, so it was 26 minutes of bullshit. So it's great. It's great No, it's great guys. You guys are still with us. Everybody's fine. We're good Well, let's get into our headlines Let's get into these guys remember if you want to see any of our pictures headlines videos articles pictures links Any of that anything Go to any cellar.com you guys can find them all link there for you So let me say let's get to our first set of headlines. There is a lot going on I want to want to bring up this first story national headlines obviously The floods down in Texas. Wild Wild very very sad unfortunate stuff So I read massive search for survivors underway after deadly Texas floods with more rain to come So as of right now the flash floods in Texas They've killed at least 89 people over the fourth of July weekend Well, I left an unknown number of others still missing including girls attempting attending a summer camp The devastation along the Guadalupe River outside of San Antonio has drawn a massive search effort As officials face questions over their preparedness and the speed of their initial action. So What we know right now Greg Governor Greg Abbott said Sunday that 41 people were unaccounted for Across the state and more could be missing Um Again, there's a camp down there called camp mystic Says it's grieving the loss of 27 campers and counselors as search continue There's apparently more flooding that's possibly coming um This all occurred on Friday um and uh, they're saying there's more rain coming today as a time as a show is recording Um in that same central part of Texas Um now here like I have a couple of steals here here. Here's an image um of uh of the river down there um of uh down in central Texas. This was a um july 4th Um, and you can see within the span of about 40 minutes You can see where the level like where those vehicles are Now that's water right we're talking. I mean, I think they said in some places it was up to like 26 feet of water um And uh it's been minutes was that uh like 40 minutes. Holy shit. Yeah, but they're 40 minutes It's wild Absolutely wild um now of course like any other natural um disaster or any other type of you know national attention grabbing unfortunate situations. There's always people to try to hop on sides point fingers immediately um Let's go to George stepanopolisus um he immediately jumps on this bandwagon um With a massive lie smearing president trump Um about their response and um some of the doge cuts and federal workplace cuts that have happened So let's watch this video. Let's check this out Maria, we're also learning that there were significant staffing shortfalls of the national weather services offices in the region You know, George as of right now the local county officials really didn't want to address that just yet What they are telling us is they expected between four and six inches of rain That is what weather experts told them the national weather service as well They also knew that in remote locations they might get anywhere from eight to ten inches But this amount of rain in such a short amount of time it was very difficult to navigate and when the department of Homeland Security Secretary was here just yesterday She acknowledged this was an issue she was going to take these concerns to the White House as well And try and see if there was anything they could do to revamp the system She says the president is committed to it Maria, thanks very much Yeah, and so you know it makes this claim that like oh all those federal cuts we've had National weather service was affected and it's it's interesting because he immediately makes that claim those didn't even go to effect yet That's one yeah, but not in they were overstaffed they were overstaffed yeah Um, and that that came out Uh, weather service had extra staffers Um, usually they're typically stat with about two forecasters on duty Um, but this specific event they had up to five So well overstaffed more than doubled Um, and so you know get those lies. There's also some information coming out saying that they you know We're not uh sending out the alerts Uh, that's not true, which is also not true I know there's people who live in the era who have been posting the alerts the whole texture Right. Yeah, I mean, so it's like you know again like when these situations happens It's very unfortunate like how quick people try to you know point the finger I'm bullshit. I think it's disgusting. It is. I think it's disgusting to politicize an event where All kinds of people were killed I've seen videos I've seen some disgusting videos the last couple days. Oh dude. It's some nasty stuff going on And like I mean, let's talk about it um, this first one I found uh, she's a pediatrician fired for vial posts suggesting Texas flood victims were Trump supporters who got what they voted for Um, I mean, it's just bullshit like this like this lady Um, right here her name is dr. Christina be props this woman right here Uh, who uses the an online alias of Christina Uh, she posted this and may all visitors children non-maga voters and pets be safe and dry Kerr County MAGA voted to gut FEMA. They deny climate change. May they get what they voted for bless their hearts Um, when she's a fucking pediatrician. Yeah Now the crazy thing is so she did your care if she if she found out that you voted for Trump. Oh, you know It's funny. You know, it's funny. So she works for Her practice their national practice. That's an evil fucking shit dude. Dude. I'm sorry. Yeah, it's disgusting Yeah, um, but so she works for this national like conglomerate okay of pediatricians called bluefish pediatrics, right? They have an office here in St. Louis My daughters were at their office, right? We were actually fucking patients of theirs Um, they cut us loose because of the vaccine shit Refuse care. What's it called bluefish pediatrics Bluefish Pia they have an alpha-serious thing Lewis. They're also based. I mean they're all over Um, it's a whole chain network of them Um, and they're all super fucking liberal and she couldn't give me any actual like scientific reasoning or um, or any of that She just says she would feel bad if something Uh, happened to our kids and they were not vaccinated and I said well, I would feel bad if something happened to them and they were And she couldn't give me any answers to that but um, so it doesn't surprise me super super lip's right. That's fine But uh, yeah, you had this and then there was also this other lady Um, former Houston appointee claims flood ravage camp mystic is white only in viral video This shit is absolutely disgusting Um, there's uh, there's a viral clip going around. I'm sure many of you have seen it already if you do not let's watch this clip. Let's check this out I know I'm probably gonna get canceled for this but camp mystic is a white only girls Christian camp They don't even have a token agent. They don't have a token black person. It is a all white white only conservative Christian camp if you ain't white you ain't right you ain't getting any way going period And I think that context needs to be said In this matter It's not to say that we don't want the girls to be found with whatever girls that are missing or whatever right now But you best believe especially in today's political climate if this were a group of Hispanic girls Especially within being in east Texas it Should be most likely Hispanic Um, if this were a group of Hispanic girls out there This would not be getting this type of covers that they're getting no one would give a fuck and all these white people Parents of these little girls would be saying things like they need to be deported They shouldn't have been here in the first place in yadda yadda yadda so before y'all come at me Before y'all start leaving hate comments on my page about oh these are just kids and they don't know that The parents of these children who are choosing and it is a choice in 2025 It is definitely a freaking choice to go into east Got damn Texas and to make a all white enclave Excuse me Just for white people with all the black people in east Texas with all the Hispanic people in east Texas somehow some way you have carved out in all white Whites only enclave in east Texas for your white children There's a lot of brain cells being shown there um well, I mean Is it whites only no? That's illegal to have anything whites only these days Um, but it's not illegal to have black only no minority only that's fine say space completely how many uh How many places are black only? Hmm, you know, I'm saying I'd be interesting regardless aside from the point of what the fuck does it matter at this point in time? Well, here's a good thing though, Eddie. Here's a good thing and I like I'm happy to see it because I've been following this chain and like you know What I was immediately like looking for where I thought all they're gonna find was a bunch of black people You know so in support has been the complete opposite. Yeah, that's the reek listen. I'm gonna tell you right now That woman is the reason That racism exists. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, and they have not been that thinking it's saying this shit this dude listen man People are tired of that shit. Mm-hmm. I'm just being real and and it's not just white people white people have been tired about it for a long time But now people are starting to recognize that you know, it's played to fuck out It's bullshit. Yeah, it's not cool. It's not cool But um her pay she's now she's had to delete herself off the internet good um She's lost streaming access streaming rights live rights all of that stuff Um, and she's getting absolutely destroyed and I'm liking who it's coming from because I think it's about time right Like we have to be able to call out our own For saying and doing dumb shit, and I think we're way past that point Um, but it's good to see that when it's nice to see it is and and you know what It's funny because you know, we have a lot of black listeners. Yeah, they fucking they they talk shit just like we talk shit They laugh we laugh, you know, I'm saying like We have a lot of Latino listeners. Guess what they got sensitive humor too. Mm-hmm. It seems like most people Have come to the reality that like these types of people are outliers. Yep And they're ones that are perpetuating the division that we all fucking hate. Mm-hmm No, like I found this clip and I guess that there's countless of these Um, but I found this one. I thought it was really really good. Let's check this one out Listen, I just I'm about to get off an overnight shift and I got time today Little miss girl saday Sadie whatever her name is she went ahead and deleted her profile, but listen Hmm that doesn't save you from me. Nope the fact that you even try to compare literal missing children to Children whose parents decided to try to break the law enter our country and now they're in a detention center awaiting processing so they can go the fuck back to where they came from You've lost your mind and I think it's a real good idea for you to take a break from social media because there's no way How dare you Try to say or try to compare such a tragic truly tragic situation To some fucking illegal immigrants who chose to break the law and brought their kids here and now their kids are suffering the repercussions None of the children that are missing or any of the fatalities or any of the people That were hurt in this recent natural disaster None of them chose for this to happen. You're illegal immigrant friends that you're trying to sit here and protect They chose for this to happen. Go get your fucking green card Go get your paperwork and do what the fuck you're supposed to If anybody anybody tries to stand up for this shit Or stand up for this person Sadie side a whatever the fuck You need to scroll along. Don't be on my page now. Don't be on my page Yeah, love it. That's correct. Love it. This is This is what most people are like. Yeah, and I thought two man. It's like you know with all this because again Like it never fails right should happens. There's always there's a lot of negativity. There's a lot of bullshit There's political finger pointing all of that drama. What why how is this a political matter at all? It shouldn't be It's your brain is fucking warped. Yeah, if that's the first thing you think about when you see 80 something people get killed kids Yeah kids and again like Right is right wrong is wrong. There's no different than like when the fires are going on in fucking L.A. You had people on the right. You know, I'm saying oh well, that's what they voted for all of that like guys like We're talking about our fucking neighbors. Yeah, like I you know, I'm saying like like come on now, you know Um, and with that being said, I thought it was important to at least show some positive news if any we can find in these situations Um, let's talk about an American hero. I want to bring in um new Jersey native on first rescue mission with Coast Guard helps save 165 Texas flood victims Uh, an American hero this gentleman right here um New Jersey native his name is Scott Ruskin um, and uh, and he's been putting in the work man. He's been putting in the work. He uh, as a Coast Guard rescue swimmer Um, he's already been held as an American hero after his first mission up in the save the lives of 165 Texas flash flood victims Um, quote, this is what it's all about right like this is why we do the jobs at Scott Ruskin uh, Ruskin who's 26 and New Jersey native informer KP MG accountant uh, to the post after his work in central Texas quote This is why we take those risk all the time. This is why like Coast guardsman and women are risking their lives every day said petty officer Ruskin Who is in charge of triage at camp mystic uh, the Christian girl summer camp that saw some of the worst of the flash flooding um Kudos to this guy man. Yeah, I mean That's what he probably saved him just because they were white. That's what it was. Yeah, that's that's what it was I feel was if it was latino He would have said he would have just let him drown nobody would give a fuck. Yeah, man You want to talk about not giving a fuck? How come you ain't talking about the 60 fucking people that were killed this weekend in Fucking Chicago by your own mother fucking people. Mm-hmm. Okay. That happens every fucking weekend by the way. We'll talk about that like It's sick of him, man. Dude, it's gross. It's disgusting shit There was another video of this white woman saying the same type of shit that I posted on my page. I don't know if you saw that no She fucking said in the video get Get your fucking walk gets a floaties Like talking about how Trump's not gonna save You know you like mother fucker if fucking storm You know what I'm saying and then you got everybody saying Oh It's harp and it's this and it's that it's like fuck dude like not everything has to be some fucking conspiracy like sometimes Tragedies just happened like what tragedy has happened in the past Fucking five years that hasn't been made into some sort of thing You know what I mean like so it doesn't rain anymore. Yeah, right. It's global warming What about all the other floods that we've had in the history of this country where they all fucking manufacture too Like it just gets fucking old bro And I know people are like well the cloud-seating The cloud-seating contractor was cloud-seating next to the county Okay, maybe who fucking knows should they be doing that at all probably not but like fuck dude These are kids You know what I'm saying these are little fucking kids imagine sending your kid to summer camp bro And then never coming home imagine that now dude You know what I'm saying like dude and you got all these people like talking all this crazy shit And you know what I think when I see all this shit I think There's never gonna be a time where these people can be reasoned with and We as common sense critical thinking Americans have turned the other cheek for so long That people like this feel comfortable saying this in public You know what I'm saying? Yeah, and like dude and then you think you're gonna convince them These people will fucking kill you If given the opportunity and this is what I tried to explain and you tried to explain during the COVID shit Luckily, it didn't go through properly the way they wanted it to go through but these people have no fucking remorse They have no empathy. They don't care about anything but their own shit If you have a different opinion than them they fucking hate you And I think everybody should make a note about how some of these people are reacting and then think about them getting back into power Because what I this is what I think about When I see these people react this way And then I think like How would these people behave if they had real power You know what I'm saying? And and dude all you have to do is look back into history And you could see how they behave when they have real power They are the weakest people in the world. They are the least prepared for violence They are sickly they are mentally and physically weak They shame and silence and get all the people who have the physical abilities To resist them to stay quiet like we talked about earlier with cancel culture and shame And Then somehow they get into power because they guilt people into well fuck dude. Let them have a chance or let them listen man And I say I say this and I am being dead serious These people cannot be Negotiated with they cannot be convinced They will never change who they are and if you give them power over you as an individual or if we give them power over us as a country We deserve what the fuck we get because they they tell you exactly what they think and dude. There's a very small amount of them And it's time that people stop bending the knee and letting them fucking get loud and you know Deal with it real talk These people will fucking they wouldn't piss on you if you were on fucking fire. They're cheering for children They're cheering for children to be fucking dead because they think their parents voted a certain way It's crazy. It's fucking insane, bro And if this isn't an wake up call for the types of people that they are And and the lack of humanity that they possess and the evilness that they possess Then nothing's gonna wake you up dude like this has been out of all the things that have happened in the last four or five years The crazy shit that I think really started with coven This might be the craziest Because of the way that people are legitimately say what they're saying on the internet You know like it's fucking insane dude and expect people to fucking support it I dude listen these people have virtue signaled for the last 15 years and people have clapped and cheered and supported everything They say they think they're revolutionaries The earth does not fucking have a place for people that are gonna cheer for children to be killed Whether that's over in motherfucking Gaza or whether that's at camp mystic or whether that's in your fucking city And you pay no attention to it because it doesn't fit the narrative your political agenda It's it's disgusting. It's evil and it shouldn't it shouldn't be tolerated by anybody That's real man.

We gotta keep we gotta keep moving Let's let's get into some some you know, not everything is a government conspiracy. Well most things But this would definitely Hell I know for two let's get into it. So less than a week after the diddie the the diddie files Um and the diddie trials and he and allegedly he did not do it Um apparently neither did Epstein Uh Jeffrey Epstein didn't have a client list Any committed suicide DOJ and FBI saying findings that debunk conspiracy theories per report Oh, all right. Where did we start? Let's see So notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein didn't keep a supposed client list And he was not murdered during his short stay in a man hadn't lock up the justice department FBI reportedly concluded in a joint probe investigation now the results of which were to tailed in a memo obtained by axios also found no evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals Uh now the Trump administration plans to release Uh video to prove the agency's findings on Epstein's 2019 death Which bred mounds of conspiracy theories quote He's the only person in there and the only person coming out you can see it FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said in late May uh the video falls in line with the medical examiner's assessment post-mortem that X-pean uh Epstein committed suicide according to the memo Medical examiner's conclusions were contested by Epstein surviving family who turned to a forensic pathologist who determined that a homicide was far more probable based on the evidence Um, no one else involved in the Epstein case will face charges according to the memo beyond his associate Galein Maxwell who was serving 20 years For child sex trafficking another related crimes now I remember I recall when President Trump ran his second term the second term campaign On releasing the Jeffrey Epstein clientless if he'd become elected he would have asked it on national television Um Saying I'd have no problem with it. You know it's bad when even seeing in Is saying what the fuck's happened in here Uh after months of touting the impeding release of it new blockbuster information on Accused sex trafficking Jeffrey Epstein Justice Department of Sets announce Monday that there is no evidence he kept a clientless or was murdered Department officials said Um now Elon Musk is uh he's been in the news and some of the headlines here lately um he posted this on Twitter earlier um What's the time oh look? It's no one has been arrested o clock again uh with With the with the picture of the official Jeffrey Epstein pedophile arrest counter at uh at zero Um now the man the myth the legend Um who I hold in high regards Uh Alex Jones even jumped in on this Alex Jones sets Next the DOJ will say actually Jeffrey Epstein never even existed This is over the top sickening now Immediately people jumping on this everybody's talking about it everybody's putting their two cents in on it um You know, but I'm doing a lay out some facts Some some things you know that that and these aren't even things that happen You know like six years ago that like are you know completely contradicting what's happening right now Um these are things that happened very very recently um You know this is a gateway pun to go our article asking like Virginia go or that The Virginia go free. Yeah, she has died what a month ago. Yeah Um if Jeffrey Epstein had no clientless Now why did a g-pan bondy teleporters the list is sitting on my desk right now to review That's in the process of being reviewed. Why was she caught on hidden camera talking about how there were thousands upon thousands upon thousands of hours of video That they needed to review on hidden camera. Yeah, I believe that was James O'Keefe that put that together recorded it Yeah, yeah, I mean like why would why would she say things like this? Let's check this clip You know, I saw your appearance at CPAC with Ben and with Ted Cruz And one of the things that you alluded to and this is something Donald Trump has talked about the DOJ Maybe releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. Well that really happened It's sitting on my desk right now to review um that's been a directive um by president Trump I'm reviewing that I'm reviewing JFK files MLK files that's all in the process of being reviewed because that was done at the directive of the president from all of these agencies So so if you've seen anything there you said oh my gosh Not yet Okay, well we'll check back with you You know you had that and like so if there was no list them The what the fuck were these people celebrating Right when all these you know right ring You know influencers Well remember those magnites those people are paid propaganda They are paid propaganda those people are paid by Allegedly, allegedly by different packs different Countries yeah, or you know who knows To it's no different than influencers, bro. Yeah, it's no different than then like Companies paying an influencer to endorse their product. Yeah, right. Right. It's the same thing. You know Oh drink you know drink this this water. It's great when a hairy sissing got 200 grand in yeah, right? from the only difference is and And business if you don't disclose it. It's an FCC violation and politics you can just pretend like it's it's uh your genuine Speltings leaps right in speltings. Yeah, I mean, you know what the what about these so so so every abstain was arrested on you know allegedly trafficking Children he brought them to this massive island. We know the island exists And we know that Galein Maxwell was sentenced to prison for help setting it up. So these kids were trapped traffic To and there was there was no there was no list because it was just random It was just random. It was just random that you know all these people these famous people Had showed up at Epstein's island. Yeah, just random just super random. Yeah, it's also random to the fact that like you know He was on allegedly. He was on suicide watch However, this is a picture from the evidence files Why the fuck did he does he have so much in his room if he's on suicide watch that's literally goes against every single S.O.P. I mean whatever it goes against all of it. Yeah, aren't they uh isn't supposed to have nothing Yeah, that's right nothing that can be even attached or detached from this is Jeffrey Epstein's sale Yeah, the day his body was discovered Whatever those orange things sheets those are all sheets and jumpsuits. Yeah a shit ton of them. Yeah a shit ton of them You know what's even what's even crazier Andy Is is we gotta go back a couple of years. This is before damn bongino became the deputy director Of The FBI and again, I wouldn't remind folks okay with with this whole breakdown here Dan bongino, you know He said confidently. This was about a month ago. He says he's the only person in there and the only person coming out You can see it now you know what's interesting when you go back a couple of years. Let's go back to the march of 2023 Before damn bongino became the deputy director of the FBI. Let's see what he had to say then check this out About a year and a half will after that. I'm in a green room at Fox and I'm not gonna say who cuz they didn't give me permission to share But what the short story been out of there Says you know Epstein's a an intelligence asset for people in the Middle East right? I'm like no, I didn't know that I'm like you sure that The person let's say is like I'm absolutely sure that that he's either a winning or unwitting asset intelligence asset meaning His plane and that island the cameras there's a big assumption out there that these videotapes work exclusively in the custody of Epstein That's a huge mistake the reason they wanted this story to go away is because there's an assumption like oh yeah Epstein had him No, he wasn't the only one who had him according to this source these assets That's why this blackmail story makes so much sense which Middle Eastern countries they are I don't know but this person who's a very very good reporter. I mean aces right Swore Epstein was either a winning or unwitting intelligence asset And they may have had his plane wired up and they're the ones who have all this stuff So the point is to summon up that's a very different take man, and you know A lot of people point the finger you know they say he was a massage intelligence asset That's been heavily out there. Well, and when they say oh well Jeffery Epstein didn't have a client list Well, maybe fucking massage had it and it's interesting because you know what's funny any This comes out. This is Monday when we're recording this guess who's in town right now. I know Nanyahu It's funny because so so you're telling me that out of the blue There's no fucking Epstein list. No, there's no proof. There's no this and it happens to be when Nanyahu Is meeting with Trump and everybody else So you're telling me that's what it is and we're supposed to believe that just take it Just take it and you know what else I'm getting real tired of to Andy It's a movie just watch oh fuck enjoy your popcorn the military tribunals are coming That's the whole Reason any of this has happened is because Dude they already ran this play in the Bolshevik revolution with operation truth Okay, it's it's already been done They convinced all the people who were half interested or half invested in Being patriotic that all everything's worked out and it's a movie and everybody's in control And this and that to pacify them into zero action whatsoever. It's what allows countries to be conquered Okay That this is disgusting and if we're being real I honestly dude, I don't even know what the fuck it say It's clearly a lie and the only thing I can think is that These people didn't want to lose the ability to fucking blackmail everybody and control the world and There's a couple scenarios that could be a play here One is that Trump and his administration are caught up in it and he doesn't want it coming out Well, do you remember that that's one of the first things when Elyon and Trump got into that few Yeah, I have to remind people there was a tweet Elyon put out Time to drop the really big bomb. This was this was on June 5th Okay, look like literally just just 30 days ago a little bit over 30 days ago Time to drop the really big bomb at real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files That is the real reason they have not been made public have a nice day DJT Yeah, and then he says mark the post this the truth will come out well That's one option for sure. That's one option. I think you'd be like It'd be bad like I mean again I like Donald Trump. I have a lot a lot of great things. I can say for that man But like he's gonna lose his fucking head to lay the options on the tape not only that bro He's he's losing belief and trust that he has America's best interests in mind and It's just reality dude. It's it's he's losing he's losing people People are not gonna trust him dude and people aren't gonna trust the people around him I think he's gonna ruin his whole fucking legacy over this and I think that Whatever it is if it's embarrassing to him He should let it he should let it out Because do people aren't gonna trust the government and this distrust in the government will eventually do a revolution And it will be violent I'm not saying today. I'm not saying tomorrow. I'm not saying next year. I'm saying that this People know what's been going on they know what's too much. Yeah, it's too much is out bro You can't just tell us all this nothing happened. Yeah, right nothing happened. Yeah, and dude here's There's nothing the abruptness of this and the timing of this On a Sunday night on 4th of July weekend or a Sunday day How I can see this happening It feels like a directive it feels like You DOJ you FBI Tell the mother fucking press this is closed. It's over and we'll fucking deal with whatever the backlash is That's what it feels like and it feels like it comes from the top um Of somewhere up the top and the fact of net and Yahoo's in town does not feel like a coincidence at all and so it could be that first thing The second thing it could be is that Israel straight up has said If you don't stop this right now, we're gonna do this and whatever this is it better be it got to be pretty fucking Yeah, it could be real bad. Yeah, so we don't know that you know what I mean we don't know if You know, let's say let's just say let's just say Let's say Netanyahu goes to fucking Washington and says to Trump and fucking vance and everybody and says hey If you don't put a fucking end of this today right now We've got new we've got three nuclear weapons already placed in three or big cities that we're gonna fucking set off right now You see what I'm saying? Who living on the run? They're right. I believe it. Yeah, who knows who knows Okay, we don't know The third thing that it could be is that Like I said a gazillion times They have information on everyone These people have the data stream of every text every email every voice message every picture Every single thing that anyone has ever done including you The listener they have and they retrieve those things and research those things as needed So what could have happened also is that pambondi and cash pretel and by the way cash pretels girlfriend Is a fucking x i df soldier apparently? Hmm Which is strange If that's true. Yeah, I didn't hear that. I I read that but you know, you can't ever tell if it's if it's real or not, but that's What I read She was I believe the CEO or one of the high ranking officials that Prager you um But anyhow The point is is that these people could have figured out like oh man. They've got stuff on me Bonsino could have figured out oh man. They got stuff on me And now all of a sudden they're willing to like turn around and lie to protect their own embarrassments So there could be a lot of things going on But I certainly don't think it's that oh there's no list and uh by the way He killed himself. Yeah, I don't think anybody believes that and I think the fact that nobody believes that And that everybody's lying Is going to crumble the faith that people have in our government maybe that's intentional Maybe that's what's supposed to happen. I I don't know, but I know this They ran on it She talked about it being on her desk She's on video talking about the hours and hours the thousands of hours of video all the victims Yeah, we're just trying to we're just trying to protect the victim Yeah, like bro, these people are clearly fucking lying and for whatever reason we don't know Um, and I think it's one of those kind of wait and see type things But they did just put something out today like right as the show started Uh, and I didn't get to look into it, but I saw it come up on a couple different uh pages That they said that the case is officially closed. Yeah, then I release to you any other further no more documents like no more than anything It's over that has to be coming from fucking Netanyahu And if it is I mean, it's if it is it's confirmation of what a lot of people have been saying That bro, but it's like either one of those it does like either any one of those scenarios right those options we laid out They all end in the same thing That's the problem like they're all gonna end in a very bad outcome for America Well, yeah, because you know, I'm saying like no because here's what it means Here's what it fucking means People aren't gonna like when I say this, but what here's what it means it means we're not even in real country It means what we are is we are the iron fist That is controlled by a little bit of country in the middle east and all of the things that we're told about being patriotic and Going to war and protecting our republic and all of these things Are not true and that's that's that's what the fuck if I I don't know man like It doesn't feel good and it doesn't feel good about what I Don't know I mean when you think about like what are Kids are brought up to believe what we were brought up to believe in like You know, we have all of these rights and freedoms and and We have a duty to protect it and we have a duty to protect this or that and they've raised us to be like masculine aggressive America so bad As type people Nobody else is like that in the world none of the other why is that why is America like that? Well, it's because we've been taught that and we've been taught that for what reason and And and when you think about like who goes around the world and and fucking gets involved in all these different wars and conflicts um Well, there's a reason that most countries don't have a favorable opinion about American military Okay, and then you think well whose propagating our youth? Who's who's controlling that message? Who's trying to get people to go fight these wars and for what reason? And then we look back like let's just say on the Middle East, you know, we talk about the Middle East um, you know, what we've been doing there since the fuck since the 70s We go in we quote unquote restore democracy But in reality none of those countries ever operate better than what they were before yeah, okay? So really what we do From everybody else's point of view in the world is we go in we destabilize these countries and we make them Vulnerable for the countries next to them. Well, who's the country this next to them? It's Israel and have you looked into the greater Israel project which is basically the expansion of borders into all these other countries It's not a mistake that Israel tries to get us into all these wars in the fucking Middle East and that's not anti-Semitic to say so Like they're fucking fucks over there in their government, okay, so it's It's dude the whole thing's fucked up dude and And Trump's not doing what he said he was gonna do Like very clearly and he's not explained to either he hasn't said anything. Oh no Yeah, I don't know and so so what what do you think about that the fact that he hasn't said silent on it? Yeah, dude I don't know I don't know I don't I mean is he part of it? That's what I'm saying. I don't is he is he part of it? Is he is he being threatened right now and leverage right now is is he In there is he part is he like when I say part of it. I mean like is he blackmailed Then when I say when he's being leveraged is he being threatened like for the bet like our With the COVID The same thing to him with COVID there you go You know, I'm saying like they did it to him with COVID. Hey listen You're either gonna push this fucking vaccine or 100 million Americans are gonna die right pick one right And and maybe that maybe that's happening. I don't know dude. I don't know, but what I do know Is that They're all lying mm-hmm all of them and We as Americans can never ever ever trust our government again ever If if they don't disclose the truth about what's going on dude and that's the thing man like he paid magic influencers for the last Two months have been saying shit like this Everybody wants there to be all of these things with the child trafficking, but it's not true and it's all just not there They're not gonna be happy and without the read this and that They've been they've been profasing this announcement through their little influencer network. Mm-hmm If that was the case shouldn't came out with the fucking minders Well, why did they do that you know what I'm saying like like No here here's what leads me to believe that there is some type of leveraging situation happening I agree, you know like trump had full intentions on running with that play And there's some cards on the table that I can't see. I don't know. Yeah. I that's how I feel that's what my gut says When it comes to his personal life. I mean he's he's a fucking yeah, you know, he's Trump and people You know look past that and If he were to be embarrassed in some situation like that I mean people would look past that too because they've already accepted that he he is Uh someone who likes beautiful women. Yeah, you know what I mean. So like I don't think that that is the reason that is being held up. I think the reason it's being held up It just feels more sinister. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's I think it's hey Because like dude, I don't think that Trump I Don't think Trump's gonna allow innocent Americans to be killed Like that. So like if you were to say like if somebody came to use like hey Andy listen if you release this fucking shit You we got we got all all the Iranians and all those illegal illegal migrants that came into this country by the You know tens of millions of them. Yeah, they're strategically across. Yeah, they're ready. Yeah, I would I would do the same thing here I would pretend like it didn't exist. Yeah, but then I would come back later and fucking I would kill all those people. Yeah You know I'm saying. Yeah, meaning all of all of it's a tough list if that is that that would be a very tough spot to be Well, that's what I'm saying. I think there's more to it. Ethically morally like I think there's more to it than what people want to say bro Like people want to say just so easily they want to say fucking Trump's part of it Little dole dole dole. It's like okay. Well then why did they put out the binders? And why would he say that it was gonna come out? I don't know man like maybe I have more faith in the dude than like and by the way I've been very critical of Trump plenty of times so this isn't like I just I don't know it doesn't feel For it to come close like the way they just closed it out Yeah, it doesn't feel right especially when not Nyaahu being in fucking Washington Did you do it my little doge? I think it's I think it's I think this is a wait and see thing I really do because I think there's gonna be so much fucking heat and backlash from this gonna have to And bro, I just don't I have good friends that are really fucking tight with with with Trump and they all love him dude Like they love him. They say he's a good these are dudes. These are dudes that I know Very fucking well that I would trust With anything And and dude they don't they they trust him. Yeah, so like there's something for me There's credit there. Yeah, you know what I'm saying and um I don't know I remember that fucking you remember that interview. I know fucking junior Yeah, I'm telling you this dude juniors are real dude. I mean, I don't care what anybody says about him He's a normal motherfucker like me and you and everybody else. Yeah, I don't see I don't know. I just don't see them being a fucking part of this shit Even going back do you remember the interview that cash would tell them and Dan did we cover it on the show bro when they like You could see it in their eyes. Yeah, they were lying that they knew they were lying But they knew that if it looked like they had to say That exact like that was scripted. Yeah, here's your fucking response. That's stuck to the script That's how I feel about it too and I think everybody has a right to be upset, but I think it's very important that we That we think about what it could be and what it could be In my mind Is those three options, okay? One Trump's in on it and he is Zion Don and he's here to like fucking enhance Israel's influence over the country and help sink the country into a Technocratic fucking surveillance state That's option one. Yeah, okay, and I'm not saying it is. I'm just saying that's an option option two He's being we're being threatened meaning us the people and he's Doing what he has to do to make sure that people don't get killed I don't think Trump wants to see people who he killed. I think Trump hates needless death that his action speak to that Not just Americans fucking anywhere. Yeah, you man. Yeah, and he's a he do everybody I know that knows him and I know this isn't gonna be good enough for people Everybody I know that knows him says he's a great great man Okay, and my My belief If I have to say what I believe is happening, which are good. That's what I think is happening. Oh, so option two That's what I think is happening option three Is that all of these people figured out that they have everything on them and they've all agreed that like hey We're just gonna fucking bury this and move on which and keep using it. Huh and keep using it I just don't see that working on Trump dude like that's what I'm saying like Trump was used it to their advantage You know, I'm saying because it is a control mechanism for sure. Yes, you know, I'm saying so like what once you and you're on the inside Yeah, so if you're already compromised and you're on the inside then why the fuck would you want to end it? We'll use it for everybody else right? I personally which that doesn't he doesn't strike me as that type of guy either I truly believe We are being threatened meaning our people are being threatened over this right now. Hmm. That's what I think's happening Yeah, man. That's that's if I had to bet And I mean fuck dude Not again, well man. I know, but I'm pretty My average is pretty fucking high I'm betting on option two and I bet we're gonna find out Soon, yeah, well guys tell us what your bets are. Yeah, let's go down to the comments option one two or three Let us know what you guys yeah, and if you think it's something else, man, and we're not thinking of I would like to hear Please like but like bro. Let's let's get away from the oh you're just sucking Trump's nuts or are you that don't like Trump? Don't just fuck like dude. What do you think it is? Well the truth is none of us knew no first of all All of us no matter what political Preferences we may have should all be united on this that we need to know what the fucking truth is it's going on You know, okay? This propaganda that's been happening in the media for a number of years the lies Dude you just saw step in apple is make up a fucking lie on the spot on the spot Oh, we could you could tell he made it up. Oh, we've been getting all kinds of reports that say this We're let's see the proof of those reports. I want to see the text messages. I want to see the sources I want to see the messages. I want to see the emails because you don't have them You just lie on national TV to push an agenda and then you're in field reporter fucking called you on it non directly This all has to stop these people that lie and lie and lie we don't live in a real country dude We live in a fucking fake freedom fake patriotism Fake everything countries is fake it's fucking fake bro and we the citizens are used at the fucking Once and needs and desires of these elite people Okay, we are the fucking ponds on the chessboard We are the ants they are the grasshoppers and until we figure out What is actually going on which is that we're all being manipulated against each other so that we don't notice what they're doing We're gonna continue to lose so every single person of every single political affiliation Should be united on this and not be saying oh you voted for this or you did that or this this this no What is the truth because if we were told the truth We would find out that none of these things that we all argue over are actually real things a lot of this shit is propaganda A lot of it is bots a lot of its fake news a lot of it is shit That's just made up to create division intentionally so that we don't notice that We are actual tax slaves in this country which is facts it's fucking facts You can argue at all you want you could say alright. That's not true. No, it is true Most of the people in this country when you add up all the fucking tax they pay the ones that pay tax Pay more to the government then they get to keep Over the course of a year that's not just income tax. That's all your tax If you add it all up You will figure out that you in fact are a slave of our government Okay, so what is free about that? What's free about working more for the government than for yourself? That is anti-American It's against the ideals this country was founded upon it is the exact opposite of what this country was founded upon So don't feed me this shit about how free we are we're not fucking free We exist as a mechanism of the government and that is not what we are supposed to have We are supposed to have a government that takes care of our national security that that takes care of our fucking Infrastructure which by the way infrastructure should be privatized anyway We could go on and on and on and on really the truth is They should fucking exist to keep a safe and that's it okay, and they should After that after military fucking police You know protective services Out state of fuck out of it and that's how it should be, but it's not that it's become We operate and live under the largest government system in the history of mankind Every other government system that has gotten to the size that this one has gotten has been overthrown Because of the oppressive nature of the government So now we're just gonna sit here and pretend like that's not the case because they tell us we're fucking free Get the fuck out of here, okay? Do the math. It's fucking math We are not free. We are sold the idea of freedom so that we will shut the fuck up and pretend that we are and not notice that these Motherfucker steal all our money and then take the money and propagate us against each other making our lives fucking miserable Yeah, man, guys, let's know fucking hate it dude.

Oh, yeah Um, you still you still on your your pro Donald Trump stand see This is what I'm saying. What did you get pro Donald? What did you get pro what you have was respect for office? Okay, and Is is great how people spend narratives to things that I think best fit Whatever they're against you know what I'm saying is that a given the brother the exact Fundamental of what he did what he said nobody's doing that anymore everybody's oh If you did this you're for him and it's amazing how You could do something but if you don't agree with everything that somebody does which I plainly said that I don't agree with everything my wife does so To where no, I have respect for the office this person does some things good this person does something to it I never endorsed any person that you know them said I've never did that a day in my life What I did say is that I'm a military brat. I love our men and women that service this country I've done things all around this country. I've entertained the troops nobody bring that up. I've Stayed you know, people are gonna commit me to my community You know what I'm saying and I have a beautiful black family Now got it been good some heat right well guess he replied to one of the posts. I think it was on the showroom or something He said quote some of y'all have a problem with the situation because the prosecutor who is probably locked up more black men Then we've helped women of color with the white husband and white kids did not win the election Just let it out I mean show me to lie. I need a Where's he lying I mean look dude, you know, this is how it goes they they you know you get out in public you become a public figure The guy's been a pillar of the St. Louis community for fucking 25 20 30 years. Yeah, whatever it is He's done to all kinds of good shit nobody talks about any of that Nobody talks about the the decades of good things. He's done for his community You know, they bring up the one or two things where he might have gotten trouble, you know Um With some weed or whatever right which is fucking bullshit stupid and you know they they they they make things out of nothing like Like any of these other motherfuckers if they got invited to perform at the White House are gonna say fucking no The fuck out of here dude and if you did You know 10 20 years from now whenever your life you're an irrelevant rapper You're gonna regret not doing it and you know, it's cool about nellie is nellie was so fucking big And then like he kind of went to the to the back, you know, I'm saying like which is normal with hip hop and shit And then he came out again and he's like he's he's fucking killing it So when you talk to a guy like that He has perspective of what it's like to kind of you know be hot and then be not as hot and then be real hot again And so you can't blame the guy for having a perspective of what is You know how he wants to live his life now, you know It's almost like getting a second chance at fucking being famous um Because I don't know, you know People probably don't realize but like he's one of the hottest dudes out right now like he's fucking everywhere.
