here today with an amazing 75 heart story from my buddy Jeffrey Jensen what's happening bro what's up man how are you pumped to be here yeah it's great to have you here yeah was uh experiencing the entire first form tour and now I know why you walk through and film the back warehouse because that was some crazy stuff yeah literally watching the boxes come down yeah and people packing stuff was like super super dope you guys have done such an incredible job and this place is like flawless even down to like there's no cleaning crew yeah mind boggling we have a we have an amazing team no doubt we have an amazing team of very high standard individuals and I'm very very proud of what they do here so it's really really cool the warehouse is cool though it's it's my favorite thing to go see and it's air condition yeah who does that it be because we got all the bars I know I know I'm not sure all right so let's get into this man all right you used to be pretty fat right no doubt all right what was your high weight highest on the scale was 352 but let's be honest that was probably over 360 I just stopped weighing myself because after you hit 352 you're kind of like what's the point in laying yourself so bro I know what that's like man you don't even want to get on the scale I got on the scale when I was big at 318 and then I was like I'm about the same size and I waited like six months to get back on fucking 350 and I thought I was 318 so it sneaks up on you because you stopped looking at it it definitely does yeah so tell us you know where you from what you're about what do you do and how'd you get into the 75 hard and and let's talk about how we got there and then we'll talk about what it was about yeah so from Myrtle Beach South Carolina born and raised there and struggle being overweight my entire life always thought I was like big bone we all know that's not true I was just fat and it's crazy in 2016 my wife Lauren and I had our first son and that's kind of when I really hit that point of like man this is bad like she pushed not labor she actually pushed our son Levi for three hours and when she was done I was soaking wet sweat and I was like that's a problem like like she just pushed for three hours and I'm over here just like comforting her and I have like man boob sweat all over my shirt yeah and so that was kind of my first wake up call and in 2017 my brother Jason and I who are business partners launched a meal prep company called 212 meal prep and that kind of started my journey of like hey I've got to get my shit together I've got to get on track and I started losing weight I started eating our food going to the gym but I never made the change on my mental side right I never focused on doing any mental work changing my mindset and so when COVID hit our business got absolutely wrecked we were losing like 12 to 15 grand a month and I literally had lost probably like 80 pounds in the first few years of owning the business and then I just like ate my feelings I was super stressed out we had so many conversations like so many other businesses that got hosed during that time of like hey we're gonna have to lay people off we're gonna have to close we might have to file bankruptcy all the things and it was in March of 2021 right after my 33rd birthday I ended up in the hospital I was blacking out randomly and my blood pressure was 180 every 120 and they're like man you're lucky you didn't stroke out and die and ran all the tests did all the things and basically like you're fat like you just need to get in shape and so I hired a trainer started working out started eating our food again now this is when in March of 2021 okay and but I still lied to myself right so I would do good Monday through Thursday and then do bad on the weekend and rinse and repeat and October of 2021 I was at an event promoting our company and first-born showed up and so started having some interaction with your guys and literally life-changing moment we were setting up our tent and Sam Funderberg came over and he said hey man I really like your RST and he was talking about my truck and we hit it off we started talking about cars and the next thing you know the next 12 hours we spent between our booth and Yalls booth and I had some of the most amazing interactions with some really cool guys and him and Chaz really left an impact on me that day and I did I'm surprised you could see him he's so little I know um but you know but it's it's crazy because I I'd heard of you before I'd listen to MFCO project um but I had never listened to real AF and um so we're having a conversation I'm back to being like 350 now I'm promoting our meal prep companies like I'm a fat dude trying to sell healthy meals like I could help you get in shape and uh he's like he's like you should hear Andy's story and I'm like what's his story so he starts sharing with me your story and talking about 75 hard and so on the drive home we had a three and a half hour drive home we started listening to real AF and in 2020 went down the rabbit hole of some conspiracy theories and so listening to real AF I was like yeah yeah yeah they turned out to I'm just saying yeah if you know Andy Domus that's right you got it right listening you know what's going on but I started listening to your show and I was like dude this guy gets it like this is it and so fell in love obviously with the podcast and um a couple days later I was sitting in my office and I had had a conversation with my personal trainer I was like I think I want to do 75 hard and he was like and I love him he was a great guy but he's like oh that might be a little much like maybe let's just focus on doing what we're kind of doing now and like you know getting more consistent and I was listening to an episode of 75 hard verses and um I started doing the math right and I started saying all right if I started today man that's gonna put me going through Thanksgiving that's gonna put me my dad was turning 60 that year so we had a big surprise party we had a 10 day vacation planned and I was like oh man that is gonna like that's gonna ruin like the rest of the year and by myself in my office with knowing around I literally set out out I said you fat fuck you will die if you don't change your life and I remember texting my wife and I said hey I'm doing this thing called 75 hard would love your support you don't have to do it with me I just need your support because it's gonna be the hardest thing I've ever done and I literally got up we had a gym in our office and I put on the episode that explains 75 hard and I did my first workout and that literally changed everything that's awesome dude so you did it how you're supposed to do it which is once you decide you're supposed to go right then a lot of people said oh do it after this I'll do it after that and what they're doing is they're conditioning themselves and building their bitch voice up even further and bringing their self confidence down they're just repeating the same behavior that they've been repeating which you know very well right which is like this I'll start Monday I'll start after the birthday I'll start after the vacation I'll start after that wedding I'll start after Christmas no you won't you've been telling yourself that forever that's why you're still fucking fat let me ask you this what was the difference between all those times that you tried to lose weight and then 75 hard I think well one I don't think you could I think you have to get to a point where you're like I've got to change right like you can't make anybody change and I think I was finally at that point where I was like I've got to do this my personality boasts really well to 75 hard I like to have structure and like something to work towards and that's why I hate when people call it a challenge or they're like it's unsustainable or whatever like no it's a program it's literally like you rinse and repeat and once you go through 75 hard you realize like it's pretty simple like the tasks are pretty manageable and doable but I think this time it was um I did I did a couple things so I'd never been shirtless in public um mind like probably from the age of 13 um and the only person that had ever seen me shirtless was my wife and so I made a commitment to myself that I was going to document the entire journey on social media and that when I was done I was gonna post my before and after picture and that scared the shit out of me um because like I wouldn't take my brother and I our business partners were best friends we've traveled the world together like when we was saying the hotel together like I'd change in the bathroom yeah so like me posting a photo on social media was like I did not want anything to do with that and I remember listening to an episode where Sal talked about it about when he finally got like vulnerable and like started sharing more about his journey and that really resonated with me so I think one having that like almost like created that external pressure of like hey you you're now accountable to all these people and I hate losing more than I like winning so I definitely did not want to fail um and so like every day it was like such such intention of like I do not want to wake up to your face of like you were just disgusted yeah you were at a point where I'm so disgusted with where I'm at I got to do something yeah and then I also knew like once I like said I was gonna do it I was gonna go 110% like if it killed me I was gonna go as hard as I possibly could so that at the end of it no matter what I could be proud of the results you know what I my stories very similar to that um I struggled my weight my whole life I went up and down up and down I went for being in great shape to be in extremely overweight five or six times up until the point of 2015 the end of 15 the beginning of 16 where I was like fuck I'm fucking down with this bro and I knew our company wouldn't grow any further if I continue to operate like that and I was letting my team down and what really changed for me I was able to pull off um a hundred pounds before 75 hard ever became a thing and then I started putting it back on you know I went from back up from 250 to 270 and then it got to like 278 and I'm like bro I'm not getting over 280 again and uh because I knew that would be 300 and then it would be the same thing and you know one of the things and I'm curious to hear what you think but one of the things that really made a big difference for me struggling like that was when I realized what the fundamental issue was the fundamental issue wasn't I didn't know what to do it wasn't that I was necessarily too lazy to do it but my ability to stick to things to adhere to things was the problem and I recognize that that was a problem in all areas of my life um I couldn't finish I could just start and I would get five six ten two weeks three weeks in and then I'm like oh it's I'm doing good and then I would reward myself with the same behavior that I was trying to get away from and I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the difference between thinking of it as I got to lose weight rather than thinking of it as I've got to look at this as a mental transformation that I need to make so that I can adhere to the things that I want to do in my life what do you think about that a foul like that is like a thousand percent because it switched it for me dude it made it real easy like when I started fucking telling myself bro you're mentally weak like is this not about being fat bro this is about you can't control this beer that sits in front of you yes you can't control this pizza how the fuck are you gonna build a company how are you gonna be successful how and at that time I had built a company but I hadn't it's not like it now you know what I'm saying and that pissed me off like that fucking bothered me like bro I can't fucking I'm losing to a fucking pizza yeah you know saying what do you think on that no it's the inability to keep promises to yourself it's like I mean that sums it up right there and that was always my thing like I had lost like 80 or 90 pounds and we did it we had a family cruise so like we did a weight loss challenge and like oh we're gonna get in great shape for this cruise and then I went on the cruise and I ate like a shithead like I literally just went back to my old habits drinking eating put on the weight again and then like couldn't get it off so this 75 hard to me it's it's people say it takes 21 days for me to have it that's terrible like it's not true yeah I think 75 to 120 days you actually can start to make real change and that's what you learn with 75 hard is it's long enough that it causes you to have to have inconvenience right like we had weddings we had vacations we had parties like we had so many different things that you go through while you're on 75 hard and you just learn like hey the only way to get progress is to do something long enough and stop quitting because like you said it would be this cyclical cycle of hey do you really really good for even let's call it three weeks and just be like oh like either I lost some weights and I reward myself with pizza or I'm not seeing progress so fuck it this is just too hard I might as well just eat what I want to eat because I'm not seeing progress and so that to me is what 75 hard teaches you it's like every single day it doesn't matter about what the end result is it matters about every day doing the task and just completing it to the best of your ability and to me I just kept telling myself like you only have to do this for one more day like all you got to do is do this today like just get your time yeah and then you wake up in the morning like I fucking did it right and then your conference is up a little bit right right ever have wake up with regret right and that's why like every day you wake up and you just build momentum and then once that momentum kicks in I love so I read 75 hard while I was doing 75 hard and it was crazy because like the way you described the different days like I remember getting to the end and being in that that God mode where you're just like dude I can do anything yeah like literally I'm on stop yeah and it's funny my journey ended on our 10 day vacation like my last 10 days we were on vacation and like I remember just like I packed a bench and dumbbells and like a vest and like we were we were snowboarding and people like oh did you count snowboarding as a workout I was like no that's not a workout like that's fun yeah a workout is 45 minutes of intentional working that's right like not something you would do for fun right now I'm on the grass yeah not playing golf right so fucking dedicated workout bro and that that was another thing I learned like I had and obviously like going through the journey and having the podcast as something I listen to like I literally would listen to real I have pretty much on all my outdoor workouts and having these other episodes of 75 hard versus really made a huge impact because I listened to Will's episode and I remember I had a day where I worked out and I was probably at like 42 minutes and someone showed up to my office and I had to help them and I went that it was like 15 minutes that I helped them and I went back and I finished my workout and then I was listening to that podcast my outdoor workout and I was like fuck I was like that workout in count yeah there was not 45 minutes of pure intention and I remember getting home that night and going in the garage and be like I gotta do another workout yeah but how'd you feel after that no I felt great but it's like those little things you learn of like this is what separates you this is what makes you have life change and not just continuously going back to your old habits and even weird things that I would pick up on like I would get something for my kids like let's say my son wanted a snack like my old habit like oh I'm grabbing you some Doritos like I'll just eat a couple like I found myself like in that motion you like oh you can't do that it's like you learn how programs you are to just do things without even thinking in this almost like unprogrammed yeah and it sure makes you kind of start over dude you're obviously I'm not gonna put words in your mouth but I was a food addict oh yeah okay I think so too yeah right there emotional like everything had to be an event so one of the problems I always had with dieting was the cheat meal mentality right like when I would go six days five days and then say oh I get a cheat meal almost always that cheat meal would undo all the progress because it would be fucking massive yeah and then on top of it it's it was a trigger it sent me down the path of all the old shit that was causing all my old problems and I'm not against you know when you're when you're fit and you've got your shit together and things are good and you're mentally in control of your external circumstances meaning your food you can control it throwing in some nice meals once in a while but at the end of the day if we're gonna fix this problem in ourselves of the overeating part we have to fucking do that for an extended period of time it would be no different than if I said you were addicted to heroin and I said hey you know you got a fucking stop using heroin bro but yeah but you got yeah every seven days you can be high and you know what also you can do a little bit every day just a little bit but you can't do more than that yeah and otherwise if you don't do a little bit you're gonna die I mean bro think about how hard that would be to change that habit and people that don't suffer with the food problem the food addiction problem even if it's a little bit of an addiction um you know they they can't really understand that you know they'll say things like oh and I'm gonna cheat meals fuck yeah maybe for you it is but for these people that have no control and no ability to adhere like both of us and millions of other people it's we have to go an extended period of time to recalibrate our mindset around that food no 100% and food addiction in my opinion is the hardest thing to break because you have to eat no doubt yeah and that's what you learn like I really had to start separating like food from emotion and pleasure into like hey I eat to to live in a few of my body and now it's like I'll even have in my plan to have like a refeed or a free meal I don't or a cheat meal whatever you want to call it but it's like most of the time I don't even enjoy it because like I would rather just eat clean because I just feel so much better yeah me too bro it's out of me now for real um well probably not for real like I bet if I went like a week yeah I would probably get back into it it's easy to slip back into yeah for sure now dude we talk a lot about 75 hard when we you know we talk about not just the physical transformation right it is a mental recalibration program and for guys like us that were big and fat as fuck let's be real we we tend people tend to notice the physical but we talk a lot about the confidence the self belief the grit the fortitude the self esteem the ability to endure let's talk about that for a minute how were you before 75 hard in those areas it sounds like you struggle with your confidence especially when it came to your body you were ashamed of it things like that yeah I definitely had a confidence issue a hundred percent in my body I feel like as someone who's kind of always been an entrepreneur and and always like I've had confidence in other areas yeah um but physically that was something that like 1000 percent I lacked like I did the fat guy like you you pull on your shirt all the time trying to get it off of your man boobs like that kind of stuff but I'll say um for in my like early 20s I did network marketing so I was exposed to a ton of personal development and I think that personal development is phenomenal but I think there's this culture of like you just constantly are either reading listening or going to these events and then you're never like applying what you're learning you're never actually taking action and people get sucked into this absolutely just wheel of like oh I'm I'm doing personal development but you're not doing anything yeah and so I had finally gotten to a point where like I was just executing all the time and so doing 75 hard brought back in personal development and I remembered like wow like you can be an executor but like having positive stuff being poured into you too while you're executing is like the cheat code because it's one thing just to like listen and read and do all the things and never execute and then it's another thing just to execute and not have good stuff right so like starting to read again and like listening to podcasts and like all that stuff was massive for me because I used to do it all the time and then I just got so sick of like why don't need to listen that I just need to go out and work and like execute on it and so having that like having to read the 10 pages a day and like stuff like that and even going into like phase one and like visualization and and the different parts of the live hard those were all like massive game changers that's awesome dude I firmly believe that most people know exactly what they want out of their life they say they don't but they do know and I think a lot of people do exactly what you said they become what I call success zombies they will read they will listen they will go to seminars they will hire some sort of mentor they will do all these things and they will continue to do those because they're afraid of actually taking action and I think one of the great things about 75 hard is that it forces you into action and by the time you're done with it you're ready for more action and so I've heard from a lot of people that it's been a big catalyst in other areas of their life not just their fitness and not just their business but also their relationships their friendships their ability to be more effective with their time um what's your thoughts on that kind of stuff I mean no doubt it I mean I don't know how deep into the story you want to get but I want to hear it literally changed the trajectory of our life yeah I want to hear bro that's why you're here yeah so I mean it's like I finished 75 hard which was amazing and I and I had a good transformation and I honestly you had you had an amazing transformation yeah but but I I finished it I literally remember waking up day 76 just being extremely afraid like I'm going to fucking lose it and I remember like Lauren was like hey what do you want like do you want to have like a meal or anything I was like no I don't want anything like I want to go do my first workout that's how you know you did it and I went out and I did I remember filming like surprise motherfuckers like workout number one like here we go and um I ended up it was like Christmas time I think I took like two weeks off and like still did my stuff but before I jumped into phase one and then I jumped into phase one and honestly phase one was like another just like whole new level because where we live it doesn't get extremely cold but January and February which is kind of like where I split phase one the water was 10 pound at like 43 degrees from the shower and I remember waking up every morning with just such anxiety of like I've got to go get in the shower and I didn't do like turn it hot and take a shower like I was just more like let's just make it cold and just just go ahead first and I remember the first time I was like it feels like I'm getting hit with an aluminum baseball bat yeah and I would make like all these crazy noises and she'd be like are you all right um and I would do my visualization like I would start that process in the shower oh bro you didn't do it then you failed huh there's no way you could fucking visualize when you're feeling like that you just visually get the fuck out of the shower I would do that and then I would do like stretching and stuff and do more visualization but I remember like being in the shower no I know I remember being like in the cold showers and like honestly visualizing this moment being like hey like one day I'll get to share this story with you and be on the podcast but it's crazy because I did live hard and through that process um I was probably in the middle of phase one so I'd already completed 75 hard I was in the middle of phase one it's like I had my my stuff together like I was pretty rocking rolling and I remember Lauren who's my wife came home one day and at the time she was an area director for a home health care company and so she would travel all over the state and uh you know you're going into people's houses um she had her concealed weapons permit so she would carry with her because I wanted her to be safe and she came home one day and she sat me down she said hey I got to tell you something but I don't want you to like freak out like I don't want you to check me into a mental hospital or whatever she's like I love you I love our kids I love our life she's like but I'm suicidal and she's like I'm really struggling with like intrusive thoughts and like all this stuff and like if I hadn't had my shit together like I don't know what that conversation would have looked like but it was I won't say it was easy for me but like I was like look I was like you need to go to the gym you need to work out you need to clean up your diet like first of all give me your gun like we're gonna put that away and then we we're gonna do things together to help you get through this and so like just that alone was like a whole life changing moment for us and that really like helped her get out of a season of like just craziness and darkness and so we worked through that and then um you know went into phase two and uh I know you talk about phase two is always hard because you have that break and it is it's like phase two feels like it's a hundred days long yeah even though it's only 30 and you're a man I'm like I just finished phase one and there's so many extra tasks but yeah get into phase two and you're just like why does this feel like it's just taking for even though it's the regular 75 hard work days yeah yeah you've already done and you lose through yeah it is is wild and um obviously losing a hundred and sixty pounds like I had a lot of loose skin and so it's crazy I had a consultation for skin removal and when we plan the surgery out the date that they had available was July 25th and I did the math for the recovery time and the clearance day was day one of phase three oh and I told my surgeon I said look dude I need to know like is this a hundred percent like this is enough time to recover because I cannot miss this day and uh it's crazy I had the skin removal surgery and I can remember like day one of phase three like I got the clearance to work out and I was just like all right let's go and so we did phase three and um and that was a wild experience because it was still like COVID was kind of over but it wasn't like some people were still wearing masks and so like I love talking to people like never met a stranger I don't have a problem carrying a conversation but having a conversation with a stranger when no one wants to talk to you but when everybody's terrified dude it is and like I was so I don't want to be like I was so next level on everything but I feel like I was like I just like if we had started a conversation and it didn't turn into a conversation I was like that doesn't count but like I had to like go the extra mile so like having conversations with people was she'd be like what was the hardest for your day I was like the fucking the conversation like it would give me anxiety so I would try and like knock it out but all of the things in the entire program just there's it's such a genius program like it literally just changes everything um and the amount of discipline that you you receive from it is just it's something like I've never experienced and like I tell people now we coach people and I'm like do 75 hard like it'll absolutely change everything that you do and that kind of led me into bodybuilding and going into bodybuilding prep and if I would have never done 75 hard there's no way I would have made it through yeah and you actually had some really cool accomplishments with that too tell us about that yeah so I I started prepping in 2023 for summer shredding which is kind of like a new league from now that's that's a Christian Christian Goosemont yeah so yeah got that owns athlete so he created summer shredding and the one thing I love about summer shredding is there's a massive focus on transformation and that's another thing I love I like what they're doing with that yeah because it's given regular people a chance to go down I think it's great and that's what I love about first form and 75 hard is it's not this focus on like the elite athletes right it's like the every day becoming elite athlete but for sure but we all start somewhere right and so that's what I love about it is there's a massive focus on transformation of like hey not everyone might aspire to be a body builder but everyone wants to be the best version of themselves that's right and so they announced that they were doing like a full season so they're going to be multiple shows in multiple cities and I decided I was going to prep for a show and then they announced the cities and so there was one in Tampa which is like a probably eight hour drive for us and I was like you know what I was already doing a show the week after so I was like let's let's just go to Tampa and see what happens and so we went to Tampa and I did my first prep and it was like one of the hardest things I've ever done and if I hadn't had done 75 hard there's no shot I would have made it because 75 hard while it is very very difficult especially for someone who starts out at 360 you can choose your diet right so like you don't have to be in this extreme calorie deficit like you could eat it maintenance or you could you know eat in a slight deficit bodybuilding is just a whole different world like you're basically starving yourself at some point and so getting through that if I hadn't developed mental toughness there's no shot that it would have happened but on the way down Lauren made a joke or a bet she's like hey if you win I'll compete the day before the championship because if you win you qualify for their championship and she's like I'll do be keening and so I'm one I like I hate losing so we go down to Tampa and I win and I walk off the stage and I just hand her the trophy I said you're up and so we got to prep as a couple which is a very unique experience with two kids and a business and all that but that like that made us closer than we've ever been really like heightened our relationship even more we've been together for 18 years been married from us 12 and going through that together and like the dark times of like just pushing yourself to do things like like you say it just do something hard every day and like doing that together was so cool and then to go to Houston like we told our kids every single day like hey mommy daddy got to go do cardio like we have to go do these things but it's okay because like I'm gonna win like I'm gonna bring home the trophy and like you're good you're gonna stand on stage with me and so like painting that picture for them was such a cool thing and when we were leaving for Texas I had this moment of like shit like what if I what if I don't win like I've literally like painted this whole picture of like hey we're gonna go and bring the trophy home and like you're gonna get to stand on stage and I can remember competing in the championship and I won transformation which was crazy in itself because it was a lot of really good competition there was you know thousands of people who competed all year and so that was like a really cool moment but then you go into the finals and they're gonna crown the overall champion and so it's it's me the guy who won men's physique the guy who won classic the guy who won open bodybuilding and the four of us have to go against each other and I'm like the transformation guys I'm like you know I'm you know not the craziest physique but it's not necessarily all based on physique you know it's based on your story how you can impact the fitness community and all that stuff and long story short ended up winning and my kids were in bodybuilding suits and they like bum rush the stage so awesome we have these photos of them flexing with me with the trophy and mourns on stage and it's just such a full circle moment of like that we remember that forever no doubt but it's like man three years ago I was fat as fuck yeah like I was literally 360 pounds and now I'm like yeah you want to even look yourself in the mirror bro yeah now you're winning contest no doubt and so it's it's just been such a wild thing but it literally started with the decision to do 75 part yeah and and that changed everything yeah man that's fucking awesome dude yeah that is awesome so let's talk a little bit about your experience through the program because like you said I think it's pretty accurately described in the book the phases when I first did it the first time bro it was it was fuck like the first 25 days were fucking brutal what was it like for you well I know this it was pure force the first 25 days yeah so I made the mistake of like when I first started my outdoor workouts I was like all right I got a sprint I got to do like all these crazy things yeah and it's funny because day one on my outdoor workout it started raining and it's it's funny how as you progress you start to hope for bad weather yeah because you're just like no one's out no one's gonna be out here doing yes and it empowers you bro you look around you feel who the fuck else is doing this yeah nobody yeah but I remember on like day six we were camping and we're at a campground and so you know when you have two kids in a business and a wife like Lauren was super supportive but there's also like a lot of sacrifice that goes into that of like hey I got to get to workouts in and now it's the weekend and we're camping so I remember waking up like extra early because I wanted to knock out my outdoor workout before they woke up and I remember I was wearing a weighted vest it was raining and I was like jogging and I remember just crying and just be like why am I doing like this is miserable like my feet had blisters like I wasn't so much pain because that I mean I was still like 300 and something pounds like yeah trying to run with a 40 pound vest on is not you were just trying to take a little too much yeah go out yeah I went real hard out the gate but yeah I just remember like the first the first 20 days are definitely like brutal yeah well my feet were the worst part and then and then because they got so fucked up the first 20 days they didn't heal so like for my first 75 hard and then I skipped one day and I went straight into phase one so for that whole 106 days bro my feet were fucked no I believe it yeah they were fucked that was hardest part but then what happened after that after you got used to it then you just get better yeah yeah no so I mean then it's like you start scaling stuff you start I remember was there a point in time where you were like oh fuck I can actually do this yeah I think I can't remember what day it was but I was probably like in the 40s and I remember you guys were doing the Chad 1000 and HQ and I hadn't done my outdoor workout yet and I was like I'm gonna do it and so I pulled we had a box at the office I pulled it out back I put on my weighted vest and it took me like two hours and 15 minutes to complete a thousand weighted step-ups and it was probably the worst thing I've ever done but I remember finishing it and just be like holy fuck like I did that like yeah like I did it and I didn't die yeah um and so yeah and now you have the confidence that bro if you had to do anything really you could do it yeah that's what Goggins talks about a lot you know put you read Goggins books yeah yeah bro he said I can't hurt me was book number two yeah that was that wreck me yeah like his childhood yeah that reading that and I read iron cowboy yeah both of those in 75 hard and it's just like it makes 75 hard laughable yeah you're like yeah I'm complaining about store feet and you got James Lawrence running 50 iron man yeah but bro remember like went before that like dude it would be look I would look for any excuse to justify me not doing what I was supposed to do whether it be the food whether it be the workouts bro if it were raining I was like it's raining I'm not I look I get I you know I'll do tomorrow nobody deal every time now both of us are at the point where like all right it's fucking hailing let's do it yeah you know like that's quite the change you know what I'm saying and because like Goggins talks about you know we put that in our memory bank he calls it the cookie jar but we put that in the cookie jar for the things that we've already accomplished and then when things get tough again we get to say now this is this a shit I already did this in this this you know like it there's a lot of value to doing hard things because life never gets easier life never life never relents and never slows down and there's going to be times no matter how much work we put in no matter how much uh we accomplish that's difficult that things are going to feel hard again and we have to have those things that we can look back on and say damn no we did that we did this we did that we got this and that's a huge deal for people because due to a lot of people quite honestly they just haven't done anything hard you know their life has been soft they've been you know they've had hard situations like meaning like you know maybe with their finances or someone dying or things like that but but I'm talking about like intentionally sticking hard things out and beating that voice in our head that I call the bitch voice which is the voice that talks to us and tells us exactly what we want to hear that gets us to not do the thing that we know we're supposed to do and that voice especially when you're in sales like you have been and I have been is very very good at selling ourselves you know what I mean nobody could sell me on bullshit like me yeah and that goes for all of us if you're out there sitting you're probably not in your head nobody can justify you not doing what you're supposed to do like you you know exactly what to say you know exactly what works and this whole program is about silencing that and empowering the other voice that we all have which is the one that told you your hey bro you're fucking fat it's time to fucking do something and that voice when we're in a state where our bitch voice dominates the conversation only comes around very infrequently and when it does it's usually very quiet but once in a while it'll speak real loud and this this whole program is about raising the volume of that voice to the point where it's the only one we can hear and that's one of the things that's done for me you know living the live hard lifestyle we talked about this in the gym a little bit it's completely changed my entire life and you know people say it's not sustainable no it is sustainable it's designed to be sustainable because it's designed to be completed once per year you dedicate less than 50% of your year to going as hard as possible and the rest of the year you get to live your life comfortable with yourself confident with yourself productive fit feeling good having the ability to push through the hard things it's a good trade and just like taking a shower every day discipline is a skill that washes off if we don't exercise it it's a perishable skill it's like playing the guitar it's like shooting a pistol if we don't do that consistently we lose the ability to do it and uh you know the the living that lifestyle dude I mean it's been eight years now and I haven't I haven't put the weight back on you know in fact I've continued to get better and better and better and better and mentally better and better and sharper I'm curious to hear how this if at all affected the way you guys are doing business uh I mean it definitely changed business because one I think being in a health fitness industry like doing meal prep um everyone's watching you whether you think they are not especially when you're trying to help other people get in shape I think me being the ultimate billboard for what our company did because through 75 hard my diet was like hey I ate our food because I wanted to show that like it worked it was healthy food um and so having that but then also having the confidence and I like to tell this to people all the time confidence doesn't come from getting to the end result confidence comes from keeping the promises that you say you're gonna do and even when I was still on my journey which I'm still on a journey I'm still trying to get better every day but even as I was losing weight and I was still severely overweight my confidence went through the roof because guess what today I was perfect yeah I woke up tomorrow and I was gonna be perfect again so I could confidently go out there and tell you like hey I can help you because I know what to do and I might not have the results that I want yet but I know I'm gonna get there um and so like it I would say it changed a lot about our business I would say it helped grow tremendously um and it made me a lot better as a business partner um as a husband like I just became way more efficient because you realize how much time you waste how much you procrastinate things how much time you just spend on your phone like and then then all of a sudden you do 75 hard you do live hard and you're like how did I get all that done and I got my work done and I still have time to do what you were doing yeah yeah so it's it dude that's one of the things that's really like a uh a paradox for people they look at it and they're like I don't have the time for this you get 30 days in you're like whoa I didn't realize I had this much time and then the other thing that happened to me dude was I got very intolerant of people wasting my time yeah I fucking couldn't stay I still can't stand that you know dumb conversations small talk just things that were you know fucking useless in my life I cut them all out yeah I have a guy that I'm coaching right now and he's on day 58 he's in the dog days and uh and the other day he texted me he's like man I don't know what's going on but like I'm real irritable like everyone's pissing me off like this is all happened I was like I was like let me call your real fast I was like let me tell you what's happening you are leveling up and people around you are not and it is wrecking you yeah and and so we just like walk through and he's like that's exactly how I feel yeah it's annoying it's fun because every day you're getting better yeah and the people you're wondering why people around you aren't getting any better yeah so yeah I definitely yeah you start and this is gonna sound fucked up to people but it's the truth you start to look around and you're like dude you're a fuck you're a pathetic bro like you're not even fucking trying like you're you're and then and it's not because you despise them or anything it's because you fucking care about them you're like brother you are wasting your fucking life and it's like it's and once you start to get in that zone especially when you get in the rhythm you know 30 40 you know 50 you get in those 50s it gets a little tough but only because it's so monotonous yeah you know what I mean um but you start looking at people you're like fuck dude this isn't that hard and you could totally change your life but you're just choosing the coast and it's gets annoying dude yeah well it's hard for me to be around people that aren't trying to get better now like it's like like real talk I and it sounds elitist it sounds messed up but I don't care if you're 500 pounds bro I don't care if you're 800 pounds I don't give a fuck but if you got rubber bands and you're fucking doing the arms and you're making an effort I respect that yeah you know I don't I don't care what someone's physique is as long as they're fucking after it bro you know what I mean well it's like you have empathy yeah you've been there but then you also know like you have the ability to change and I think that's the biggest thing is like being overweight my whole life like it was just all excuses yeah yeah and and like you said with like wow I can't believe this beer has that much control to me it's like how dumb do you feel yeah that the food has that much control yeah like you're like a baby bro it's like a baby you can't control what goes in your mouth yeah that means you are a fucking baby like really think about that if you lack the control to not do something meaning this is how easy it is and also how hard it is all I have to do is not put that shit in my mouth that's all I have to do and I couldn't do that and because I couldn't do that it was wrecking my life I was 350 pounds I was fucking miserable I wouldn't look myself in the mirror I was embarrassed I wore the same outfit every day I wouldn't go to pool parties I wouldn't go to the beach I didn't like getting dressed up because my suits never fit all I wanted to do was stay home and wear workout clothes and fucking it basically avoid everything other than what I had to do at work and dude now I'm the complete opposite now I do stay home still but I I feel when I walk in a room now I feel proud when I when I what but the problem the problem for me that I struggle with brother is like and you might struggle with this with coaching but I definitely do is like the the fucking solution the reason Diet culture is so fucked up is because it does not address the core problem the core problem is that you do not have the discipline to adhere to the program meaning you know what you have to do but because you know and dude people will I did this and you probably did this too I tried keto I tried this I tried that I tried cycling my carbs I tried this I tried doing this thing I tried fucking all this over here I tried everything looking for the solution not realizing that the solution was the way that my mental was framed like bro this is not a physical thing this is a mental thing and when you fix the mental thing the physical thing automatically comes around and when I had that realization dude it fucking changed everything for me because I do have an ego about being weak I don't want to be weak you know even when I was fat I was strong as fuck and I always justified my identity I'm like yeah I'm fat but I can lift more than all five of those guys put together right so that was my way to justify it but dude that wasn't real shit that was fake shit you know what I'm saying and if I could I just wish like if I could like grab someone by the ears you know like when you really got to tell someone like we we played football you know your coach would grab you by the ear holes and fucking look you in the face and if I could just do that to people and be like bro the problem is that you cannot adhere let us fix that problem let us fix your discipline when we fix your discipline and it's going to be have to fix by grit and force and fortitude you are going to have to grind it out you are going to have to push through it and you're going to have to force yourself into this place of momentum but if we can fix this it will fix fucking everything in your life and if I could just like grab everybody listening to this and like grab them by the ears and like that's what I want to do you know what I'm saying like I know that like fuck this is so simple to fix bro yes it's hard yes it takes effort but it will change your fucking existence in every single area man and like I feel so proud for all the people that live that life it's so cool but dude this like legit like I'm not saying it's the cure for everything but fuck dude it fixes a lot of shit like we were talking the other day and I was like hey if everybody at 75th are the world be a better place that's what I'm saying bro no doubt that's what I'm saying and think about phase three think of people went through phase three and they got comfortable kindness yes doing the random act of kindness doing the talking to the strangers being more nice being more kind being more social like being confident in themselves not taking things so personally being empathetic pulling people up helping people out pushing people to be better what if we live in an entire world like that I mean that's dude that's my hope that's what I want to create and I know that's a huge undertaking but we got a pretty good start you know I'm saying everybody start yeah everybody's paddling it's nice and I think too many people are like one they're looking for the quick fix right they always want what's the cheat code you know how do you stay motivated and I think the other thing that I really learned through this process is that whatever it is whether it's relationship whether it's business whether it's fitness whether it's held like you have to stop living your life with this finite destination like there is no destination it's infinite the only way to win in any of those things is to continue playing the game that's right you want to be successful in business just stay in the game yeah want to have a great marriage just stay in the game yeah want to be physically fit just keep doing it every single day and that's what people winning those days yeah every day bro like dude if people would just like shrink down their life to today one day like okay your whole life today yeah can you win one day can you think what can you win a day oh yeah can can you guys win a day can you win a day everybody listening can you win a day every single one you motherfucker's capable of winning a single day if you can win a single day you can win your entire life 100 it dude everybody has the capability to do it because all you have to do is wake up tomorrow and win the day it's very simple and because people see it as this huge thing time sneaks up on them before they know they don't have any left yeah you know what I mean it's every day Ed my let talks about it with his dad you know like you used to ask a dad like hey are you gonna stay sober and he's like I don't know I'm gonna stay sober today yeah and it's like if you just live that life because a year's gonna go by so fast yeah and and yeah when you're 360 it's like eating an elephant right there's so much to that journey and even I look back on the last three years and I'm like holy shit like I can't believe like I've been through three skin removal surgeries like I've done 75 hard I've done live hard I've competed in three bodybuilding shows like but it's like the time went by no matter what that's right like it was gonna happen what I could have just stayed fat the last three years the time is going to go by no matter what yeah if you just focus on today who you will be 75 days from now a year from now three years from now will be the motherfucker you want to be you will be that and I've never met goes by quick doesn't it so like three years went by like yeah and I've never met anybody that did 75 hard the correct way yeah that didn't completely changed their life yeah I dude I haven't either I have it's because it's impossible it's impossible to do it the right way and then look at and sell it didn't work yeah it's fucking bullshit okay if you do it the right way it will change everything because it changes that one thing it changes your ability to say I'm in control of that beer fuck that beer I'm in control of that pizza fuck that pizza I'm getting up and working out because I'm a fucking killer so what it's raining I don't give a shit so what it's snowing I don't give a shit other people might give a shit but I don't and it raises our personal standard for ourselves and gives us the skills and the confidence and the ability to do anything think if you had the ability like think about this bro think you're 36 think when you were 20 years old okay now if I could take you at 20 years old and I could install inside of you and and for any of you listening this is you too at 20 years old I could install inside of you the ability to do everything that you've said you were going to do from the time you were 20 to now and you were able to actually do it you had the ability to follow through and do the thing what would your life look like today I'd probably have your garage that's what I'm saying no that's what I'm saying no you do it won't even take that long if that's how you live yeah fuck I didn't start living that way till I was like 36 dude till I was your age there's hope you see dude 100% there is you're gonna blow the fuck up dude but the point is is that if we're honest with ourselves and we're honest about why we aren't where we want to be it's because we lack that ability we lack the ability to follow through on what the fuck we say we're gonna do if we can fix that we fix anything yeah no I mean we see it with clients all the time it's just like and and now that we have several clients in 75 hard that are like past day 40 the mental change is like insanity dude it's crazy how much happier people get to they get happier like you you can just see the confidence level yeah like just they're not where they want to be yet but like they exude so much energy and confidence and then like they're just putting so much positivity into them and we talked about this too like I'm not hating on therapies I think therapies probably great for certain people but there's a certain point where like all you're doing is just stewing the negativity for sure if you would just put more positivity in your life and take action on it yeah and stop worrying about like oh my situation sucks you probably would have a different situation for sure dude listen therapy in certain situations 100% necessary the way that it is in today's culture it's way overblown and it's toxic and it's predatory because therapists keep people in this place of trying to focus on their problems 100% of the time to where it becomes people's identity their identity becomes healing and they never actually get to the place where they feel good they're constantly consumed with the anxiety they're constantly consumed with depression they're constantly consumed with I'm not good enough and guess what if you just sit at home all day trying to fix all these problems that you have mentally and talking to your therapist all day and that's all you spend your energy on bro you ain't getting any better you're gonna stay in this negative mindset forever and they never progress onto getting on with their lives because their identity becomes victim I have this I have that I have this I have that I have this problem and when you start telling yourselves you are these things and you have these things guess what happens you do have them yep and you can't get rid of them and so we have to at some point say I got to go I got to go do these things I got to rebuild my mindset I've got to not be a victim I've got to say you know what I dealt with these things they've been hard they've been difficult but you know what that's life and instead of me dwelling on them what did I learn oh I learned this and this and this I learned that and that and that and I could use that moving forward and dude I have I I have very strong opinions that aren't very positive about the therapy industry not just from my own experience but from hundreds and hundreds probably thousands of people sharing that experience with me and I think if if you are someone who's been doing this for years and years and years and you've made it your identity you need to really think about this because the more you focus on your problems the bigger they fucking get they don't get better they get bigger yeah should probably just do 75 hard yeah well I mean that's a good start I mean if you're if you're going to therapy and they don't talk to you about building up your mindset fixing problems through activity discipline and all these things and they just tell you to take it easy take a break bro listen the problem is you've been taking a fucking break your whole life yeah that's really the problem so if you're if you don't if you don't have someone that's instructing you on how to improve your own life in your own way and they're just telling you you need to get on these drugs or you need to you know get in this group and fucking share your feelings all day bro that's not making you better bro it's not you're gonna have to make you better it's all in our control yeah I remember two like even in 75 hard people would say like man is like don't you just like want to like have a cheat meal or do this or do that and I was like I literally did that for 33 years like literally every day never did anything hard so like no yeah I just want to do the hard stuff yeah and one thing I don't talk about enough and this was even before 75 hard but I went through like this a really like it wasn't a super long battle of anxiety but I had some like really crazy crippling anxiety and I used to always be the guy it's like oh anxiety's not really real like you can just get it together but I went through this spout when I was having all these health problems that like I couldn't get out of bed like Lauren would have to drive me to work and what fixed that was taking action and working out and like I would start the morning I would wake up I'd get on the spin bike and I would just like move my body yeah and once I started doing that it allowed me to calm myself down because I was like all right you're in control you can get in shape you can get healthy and then cat up you know putting that into 75 hard in the momentum that was where everything changed so I would say I'm not an expert but like if you're struggling with anxiety like take action move your body like action here's anxiety yeah 100% and I also think you know do I struggle with that too with anxiety and you know you know what made it really bad was that I got like this here's what started happening I you I never had a problem with it fucking ever I started reading all this shit on the internet you know like from all these fucking therapy victim shit this mental health shit it's way overblown bro you want to fix your mental health develop some fucking discipline develop some confidence some belief in yourself and the only way to do that is by doing some shit but I used to read all this stuff and I'm like fuck I've never had anxiety with the fuck and then I started like noticing when I did have it and I'm like fuck on there there's that that anxiety everybody's talking about and then I started like it started getting worse because I was noticing it and then all of a sudden it like became this all encompassing thing where it was like legit crippling like you're talking about where I was actually having like physical symptoms like my legs were shake I got and I'm like what the fuck dude like I'm a fucking killer what is fucking going on and what was going on and the way I fixed it dude was that I was focusing on the anxiety and then thinking that I could get to a point where I had zero so what what happened is I would start the day everything would be good and then something would happen my anxiety would go up and then I was I would get like super anxious because I'm like fuck I can't get even I can't even get through a single day without anxiety like this is crazy like what the fuck is going to get pissed and then it would like make it 10 times worse and dude I see this with a lot of people they think they can eliminate anxiety from their life completely and then anytime and this comes from what we were talking about a minute ago they're focused on it so hard that anytime they feel it it now it starts to become a real thing because they're expecting that they can get through without any of it and what you have to understand is these feelings of being down these feelings of being anxious those are natural part of the human experience and they are trying to tell you something they are not trying to you know this isn't here to cripple you this is here to signal you into some sort of action and when we refuse to take action guess what happens the signals get stronger and they get stronger and they get stronger and inherently you know what the action that you need to take is you're just denying the reality and it's no different than the people we talked about who go to the success seminars and who buy the programs and who listen to the podcasts and who read the books who never take action right so if we want to fix that problem we have to stop focusing on it first off and then change our focus from here on the anxiety that fresh in the negative feelings to hear what is my purpose what am I trying to accomplish where am I going and dude when I started to fix when I started to get back to that bro the shit went away you know what I'm saying so I think there's a lot to that we cannot focus on our problems the more we focus on our problems the bigger they get and there's just a lot of therapists out there that make people focus on their problems all fucking day long and people aren't mentally aware enough to escape that cycle and then they're making money on it right that's how they make their money so to me it's predatory but I know everybody has their own opinions and I know there's situations where it's necessary but that's something I've observed yeah well I think it comes down to like with 75 hard and what you talk about like winning every day yeah and I think Alex Hermosi talks about it's like anxiety typically comes from either focusing on the past or focusing on the future if you'll just stay in the present and win the day yeah typically you won't have any anxiety that's true Alex fucking smart motherfucker dude yeah one of my best friends fucking awesome dude so dude before we wrap this up I mean if you were you know we're talking to quite a few people here if you if you were one of these people I heard who's who's feeling lost who's feeling confused who's who's anxious who's not feeling good mentally who's not happy with who they are physically who's not confident in themselves I know you're gonna say do 75 hard but what else would you say to them well one if you're listening to this and you are that person I would say do 75 hard but I'd say start right now like like wrap this podcast up and like go to episode 208 and listen to the the requirements because it's good to know before you start or why you're starting but like take immediate action I think that's what I always did and we talked about it earlier in the show is like I'll do it Monday I'll do it you know like keep pushing things off and I think that the only way to take control is to do it now and stop making these use there's never a perfect time for anything like life is gonna be hard no matter what season you're in no matter if you're married if you have kids if you own a business if you have a job like I don't care what you're doing like everyone's got their own hard version of their life it's never gonna get better until you take action so I would say like take immediate action and then don't give yourself a plan B like yeah burn the boats like this is it like you have to do this or you die yeah and that's where I got to it was like you fat fuck you're going to die if you don't change your life and it's like you know burn the ship stop giving like I used to always give myself an out like stop giving yourself a plan B yeah it take it and with 75 hard you have to hit it that way like if you hit it like oh I'll just try it out you ain't making it bro no stop looking at it as a challenge yeah it's not a fucking challenge stop focusing on I want to get this result out of it and just let the program do what the program does and that is it rebuild your mind yeah and it it like yes if you do it correctly you will have a physical change but like I would challenge like I don't care if you're like the most ripped in shape person if you've never done 75 hard I think it will change your life if you do it properly because it has nothing to do with the physical outcome it has everything to do with mentality yeah I think that's the biggest that's the biggest thing that frustrates me about the program is that people call it a challenge and they think it's some tick-tock bullshit and then they believe it's a diet program it's not a fucking diet yeah you don't even talk like there is no requirement for that I get that from trainers a lot they're like oh it is a fucking no you didn't you didn't even look into it dude you just hate it because everybody's doing it and if you were fucking smart you'd program your fucking clients around the program they get 10 times better results your fucking testimonials will be 100 times better I'll tell you hey we've got 30 clients and three of them are on 75 hard and I promise you those three are yes guy rocket like bro I built the shit so that it could work with trainers and there's so many trainers with fucking you know they they don't even look into it and they don't realize like hey bro this could help your business a lot like and help your clients a lot so anyway that's a whole number I feel like to like you said the program takes like 50% of your year I feel like once you do it like you you kind of like I'm always on program it's not I'm always doing the diet and I'm always doing the two workouts and I'm always doing the reading and I'm always doing the water the only thing I don't do when I'm not doing it is the fucking progress pick and then maybe once in a while maybe once in a while I'll have a cheat meal like I'll go have like four or five beers you know Emily now go up to Billy G's and we'll fucking have four stela's and you know three bites of pizza and then the next morning you're like yeah yeah it's fucking hate that yeah bro what that's another thing dude once you get that shit out of your body it you realize how bad it is for you well you don't I think what you don't realize like being out of shape and overweight your whole life you just feel like living that way feels normal yeah you don't know what feeling good feels like and then you start to feel good and you're just like oh I don't want to feel bad and I think so many people in our society have just gotten into this cyclical cycle of feeling like shit they don't realize that they could feel really really good yeah and I think that was the biggest thing and people joke because like Lauren and I like we eat super basic even though we own a meal prep company and we make phenomenal delicious like tons of different options because I do know that people need variety but we're very like chicken rice avocado like steak rice avocado like we're pretty basic um I just I don't like to eat yeah any other way because I don't like how I feel when I yeah the other way me too bro I like I like I like the basics too man it's I don't know my whole I everything's changed yeah I'm no longer that guy you know I got now I gotta be aware of it you know kind of like when you're in alcoholic you gotta be aware of it you know I'm saying but it's cool what changes everything like even when we vacation we used to like plan our vacation and I'm like what restaurants are we going to for breakfast lunch and dinner and now like when we look at hotels we're like does it have a good gym right is there a place to get good healthy food by and it's not like some like gimmick or like we're just trying to look cool it's like no like we legitimately like we have to work out like we just feel so much better and then yeah you can go on vacation and you can enjoy one nice meal a night and not feel terrible like when you eat clean the rest of the day and you move your body and you drink drinking water is another thing it's like yeah such an underrated like simple task but it's like just hydrate you'll feel so much better yeah bro I can note when I don't drink my water if I don't get enough watering early in the day I can tell immediately it like noon because my energy is fucking gone I never you'd notice I just always I said I was just so used to I didn't notice it yeah no it's crazy it's crazy once you become aware of everything how different you feel and and you start to like you really learn your body and that's that's something that's really cool to experience well Jeff we're I appreciate you bro this is awesome and it was a awesome conversation tell everybody where they can find you you know on your socials and

can't think you know now you're changing other people's lives bro it's pretty cool yeah it is the ripple effect 350 pound do you be changing people's lives like this no not at all and that's the ripple effect is insane so I do want to leave with this if you are someone who has the ability to be around a lot of people like if you have the the gut like the feeling in your gut to have a conversation with somebody like have the conversation because you never know how that will change someone's life and I think about Sam coming up to me three years ago and just like starting a conversation with a stranger and how that led to 12 hours of us spending time together and building a relationship which led to me listening to the podcast which led to 75 hard which changed everything it's like if he doesn't have that conversation like where are you what is what is today look like and so I know sometimes it's inconvenient to talk to people or you might be busy but like man you just never know the impact that you can make on somebody just by like being kind talking to him asking how their day is going and seeing where it goes so that's awesome bro I love that it's true too I've had a number of key conversations in my life one in particular that changed my entire life and it's it's actually pretty incredible so brother I appreciate you man yeah man yeah I
