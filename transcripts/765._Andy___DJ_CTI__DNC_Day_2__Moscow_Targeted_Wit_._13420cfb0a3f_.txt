Golfport police department shared the text exchange between a random person and one of the department's offices who use a sense of humor when someone sent a message to the wrong person.

DNC day number two. Got some things happening there. Sweet. That's been an interesting little thing going on. He had the Obama's there. They spoke Doug M. Hoff. He got personal during his speech. But yeah. So day two wrapped up of the Democratic National Convention. And there was some highlights. I got some personal favorites. And we'll get to those in a minute. You had a little John was there. Low John. Low John. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I kind of grabbed my mom fucking love. So the sweat dropped down my balls. And I thought it was great. You know when they were talking about like and they go right into talking about Kamala and the balls and balls. I'm sure she. Michelle was singing along. To the sweat drop down my mom. That's clean. Did you see that fucking quote? She said which one when she said you know the money. Yeah. Oh yeah. Do you have that money? Yeah. But so here's Lil Jon. I thought you know when they get like I mean you know Megan style and Lil Jon. I mean we had Hulk Hogan. You know and like I mean what who else like code like black fucking like Trump. I mean like I'm not Jason Aldean was there. Not if you're gonna get there. You know it's fine. You know God that guy asking for the votes that guy legit that guy has negative testosterone like negative. He gets zero puts like if you fuck he's the black hole of testosterone and masculinity like if you walk next to him he's gonna suck it out. He probably literally do. Yeah. Yeah. I think they'll do that. Yeah. Fucking weirdo. Georgia. How do you cast your votes? Georgia. How do you cast your votes? Kamala Kamala Kamal Kamal Kamal. Look at all the old white people with their cell phones out. Who's that black? Who is that black color? Who's that black color? He's got a vote for us. He's black. Hands up. No shit. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. Going back to to I'm telling you that's what they think when they see her make it get make America great again. They think it's like go back to 1820 bro. Yeah but like y'all still there now. They fucking say that. We see people on the internet being like what when was it so great. I don't know like four years ago. Yeah. Like when we were the only country in the planet where you're not you know basically starving or fucking having more than half your money taken from you and you know all the other bullshit. It was a few good times. I just think it's funny how people think that they're like oh make America great. Yeah. Go back to slavery. It wrote slavery ended in the fucking 18 fucking 60s. Okay. You are a fucking moron. And if you're still using slavery from the 1860s as some sort of excuse for your life you're a pathetic loser. It's stupid. Yeah. It's stupid. Absolutely stupid. Matt Walsh. He was also at the DNC. Did you see him? Oh and by the way remember it's white people's fault. My fault. My family didn't come here until your personal fault. I know. My family didn't come here until like 1920s but it's my fault. It's definitely your fault. An eye or fucking white people. WT. WT. Matt Walsh was there. He was there. And he was there on the cover. He has a new film coming out called MIRACES. So the day the wires Matt Walsh he was spotted on the floor of the DNC in Chicago on Tuesday. I don't think nobody even recognized that it was him because he was in his disguise as a liberal. I mean that's a good disguise. That's a great disguise. Yeah. The buttons. You know the hair, the man bun, the glasses. I mean yeah. The thrifting you know goodwill blazer. I mean it's all the beard is too filled in. It is. He need a patchy. Yeah. Yeah. More patchy for sure. I mean even even tried to troll CNN. Did you see this? No. Yeah. Let's watch this interview. So this is Chuck Schumer doing an interview with CNN. Let's just watch you hops in the background. The more they see here, the more they're going to like her. I saw what she did in the Senate. We served together for four years. She cared about families. She could work with all kinds of people and she was effective in getting things done. Right. One thing she pushed which we succeeded in was $35 insulin for a senior citizens. Now we're going to get it for everybody. What's your response when Trump takes credit of that? Trump takes credit for so many things he doesn't do and gets the blame for a lot of things he does do. He's he's lost his bearings as we can see day by day. Yeah. Yeah. Clearly he's lost his bearings. He he actually is the person who made insulin $35 Biden switched it back and then they switched it back thinking you wouldn't know any better. Exactly. Yeah. But he takes on the credit for very similar to how they you know count the jobs based upon you know the COVID come back as like some sort of job growth or you know, I don't know like overestimate the jobs that are created and then only to have them corrected three months later and they were overestimated by 80 to 90% every single time. The only the same way that they say inflation is you know X and then in 90 days we find out that the report was wrong and it was actually X plus four or five points right just like that. Yeah. Just like that. Bro the problem is people are so fucking dumb they believe it. You know they like they do. Yeah. Trump Trump fucking did this Biden undid it and then a few fucking months later he did it to say he did it. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Barry was there. Of course like we said, Barry did a talk and you know allegedly he likes penises. He has to make a little penis joke. Did you see the joke? No. Wasn't that funny. I mean that's coming from me. So I mean you know that's real. Let's check this penis joke out from good old Barry Balmer. There's the childish nicknames. The crazy conspiracy theorist. This weird obsession with crowd sizes. I thought that was stupid. I mean it's made mid at best. Did you watch his speech? But not the whole thing. No. But him and Michelle are so full of fucking shit. Like I don't understand how anybody could watch that and be like oh my god. Like we've already heard this bro. You same shit. You fucking entire country up. It's the same talking point. Yeah. It's the same shit. And then you got Schumer saying oh Kamala cares about family. Well right outside they got the sector means in abortions. Like outside. Like right. 100 yards over there. Right outside. Yeah. Big Mike spoke. She had a speech. One interesting point that she's beginning hammered on is where she talked about her parents were suspicious of folks who took more than they needed. You know they were you know humble upbringing and modest. Yeah. That's why they got four fucking mansions exactly all over it's all over $10 million. Yeah. Here's here's the clip. You see my mom in her steady quiet way lived out that striving sense of hope every single day of her life. She believed that all children all all people have value that anyone can succeed have given the opportunity. She and my father didn't aspire to be wealthy. In fact they were suspicious of folks who took more than they needed. They understood that it wasn't enough for their kids to thrive. If everyone else around us was drowning. So my mother volunteered at the local school. She she. Yeah it's a big of a fucking piece of shit. Do you have to be to stand up there and say that when your policies impoverished people more than any other policies that have existed in American politics ever you have ruined more people economically than any other administration in the history of earth talking about the cabal here. Barack Hillary Biden etc. These people exist to make money for themselves while lecturing you about selfishness from people who want to make money for themselves. Like imagine how sociopathic you have to be to be able to stand on stage and say that when you went into the White House worth nothing and now you're worth what 100 million dollars. She's having 70 million dollars. 65 million dollars. Right a fucking book. Yeah bro. Okay the mansions. No she's got they got four fucking mansions building another one in Hawaii. They got Chicago. They got Washington DC. They got Hawaii and then they got the fucking Martha's Vineyard. Yeah. And bro these people fly around on private jets which by the way I do too. But you know what? I fucking earn my shit. You pay for yours. I pay for mine and I've earned it for 25 fucking years of my life. These people came in. They were community organizers. Barack got fucking voted the Senate because let's face it because he's black. Okay he got president because he's black. All right he's a great speaker. He's a great orator. I'm not going to take that away from him. He's like if you listen to him and you don't know he's full of shit he sounds real good. But he's already proven that he's full of shit. And if you look at the eight years that they put with Obama and then the fucking what is that another four with you know 12 of the last 16 years have been in control of the Democrats. And then they talk about how Trump. So you're telling me out of out of fucking 16 years man. They're in control 12 of the years. The country looks like shit and it's Trump's fault which was the best economy we've had of those 16 years. And they have the nerve to stand on stage and lecture you about taking more than you need. Now I don't give a fuck because I'm a capitalist bro. You should go out there and run up the fucking score. This is this is you do what is best for you and your family and your people. You should win. You should win big. You should show other people how to win big. That's what America's about. And you should take care of the people around you. But you are a fucking piece of shit to stand up on stage and act like everybody doesn't know who you are what you're about and that you are the epitome of the greedy selfish politician that is benefited from being in power. There is no reason that a politician at any level should benefit financially from serving at all. None. None. Oh she wasn't the only one on the high horse. You got JB Pritzker. Very very wealthy guy in politics. The richest governor in the United States. Yeah. He says take it from a actual billionaire. Trump is only rich in one thing stupidity. Well, you're a calorie billionaire bro. That's what Pritzker is. He's a fucking calorie billionaire. Which is also a barely top because you're fucking next so fat bro. It's surprising to me that dude is even still alive. It is. But even on that man, there's some rich with his stuff. I mean like just this past year, you know, by the way, that motherfucker comes from a fucking wealthy family. The ninth richest family in the country. That's right. 100%. The heir to the high empire of hotels and stuff. Yeah. And he's up there talking about you can build anything. Yeah. You are born into it. You fat fuck. Right. But I mean, there's some rich stuff with this. I fucking can't stand that guy. I hate him. Yeah. I hate him. But there's some interesting stuff. He's got some really good people in his family. Yeah. Like I know some extended family of his good people. That guy turns a shit. Yeah. Oh, complete pieces. You know, but like, and it's weird because like with him and you know, you look at the last four years of just his personal finances, which all have to be submitted because he's a public official. His yearly income, taxable income. He's been reporting less and less each year. But yet his net worth keeps rising, which is interesting each year and year and year. And not only that, he's raised, so he's reporting less taxable income to pay less taxes while raising the taxes of everybody that lives in the state of Illinois. That's interesting. But outside of all of this man, you know, you leave it to mainstream media and they want to focus on, you know, here's the best zingers from the DNC that day. And really ultimately, what they couldn't stop doing is obviously talking about Donald Trump. They don't have nothing else to talk about. There's nothing else to talk about. And again, here we are, not addressing any of the issues. Andy, like you said, you know, they've been in power for the last 12, 16. Yeah, here you go, bro. Democrats been in power for 1,300, nine days and 12 out of the last 16 years. How is it? How is the mess that Democrats made? Trump's fault. Yeah. And this is, I mean, this guy pressed this on CNN, watch this. And all these speeches as good as they were is that she's in the White House right now. Democrats have controlled the White House for 12 of the last 16 years. And for all of the talk about division and the problems in the country and people are hurting, Democrats have mostly controlled this country. Trump had it for four, the Obamas and Biden had it for the rest of the time. And somehow it's still all Trump's fault. And somehow she hasn't been at the center of it. So to me, that's still the glaring hole in this campaign that hasn't yet been solved at the convention. How do you explain all of the problems that will be solved by the person who is currently in there for the last three and a half years, who is supposed to already be working on solving it? Yeah, makes no sense. Do you notice how they all looked at him? Like they had nothing to say to him. Their faces are blank. They can't see anything. And the reason they can't get up there and say, and dude, listen, any of you motherfuckers out here that think Kamala, you're going to vote for Kamala. Look, I understand we have people that are going to vote both ways. Dude, listen, I would just like to hear an argument that is based in actual fact that does not involve Donald Trump. Like, let's hear that one time. We haven't heard that one time at all over the last eight years. There's never been a real policy or a real idea. It's always Trump is a threat to our democracy. Fear, fear, fear. Their democracy is communism. That's what they're working to install. They don't mean to you think they mean democracy. They don't mean what you think they mean. They mean communism. They mean total control. They mean when they say this is going to be a dictatorship, note, they want to dictatorship. Everything they do, they accuse the other side of doing, which isn't a communist manifesto anyway. But like, bro, yeah, here we go. Here you go. Right here. Cover that. US economy created 818,000 fewer jobs and previously reported US job growth during much of the past year was significantly weaker than previously reported, according to new data published Wednesday. It's not that it was a misrepresentation. It's not that it was a mistake, clerical error, they lied. They blatantly fucking lied. And more importantly, that is the biggest, the largest downward revision since 2009. They keep telling you that it's okay. They keep telling you everything's fine. It's best economy. Look at the amazing job Biden's done. Look, and then, and then one one one side of their mouth is look at the amazing side Biden's done. And then Kamala gets on stage. So we're going to fix all this. Fix what? Well, if you've done an amazing job with a fucker, you're going to fix everything's so good. It makes what? Why? And by the way, you're going to fix it on day one. You've been in office for four fucking years. Okay. Like, this does not fall, like they think people are legit low IQ morons. And if you want to know what they really think of you, pay attention to how they talk to you and treat you. Right? They get up there and they ran and rave and they talk about hope and change. And my family didn't like rich people while fucking this fucking lady or whatever she is has made $100 million from being in office. Okay. No, from being the fucking the wife of the president, the fucker of the fucking right. Right. Exactly. Like, dude, and so these people stand up there and blatantly lie to their voter base and their voter base gabbles it up. Like it's fucking. And then it's like, dude, you think these people don't know like that they can't fucking afford groceries or that they can't afford gas? Like you got Korean KGP up on stage every day. The accomplishments of Joe Biden will go down in history. This is the most impressive trans. Yeah, it is when you fucking lie about the data over and over again, when you face your economic growth off of the shutdowns that the media and everybody created during COVID and the rebound and say, oh, look at our historic growth. Oh, you just said people could go to work again. Right. And then on top of it, they do this exact thing with not just the job market. They do it with inflation. They do it with all the key economic indicators. They publish a report that is complete bullshit. And then they revise it quietly months later and say, oh, we made a mistake. It's actually 50% less of what we said it was going to be exactly. Exactly. Dude, let's discuss the last little thing. And then you argue with these Democrats out in the street and they fucking are like, bro, bugs, the best fucking economic president in history. They don't even know this. Bro, did you see the poll that they did with Democrats were 79% of Democrats could not identify the actual issues that were on the policy of Kamala Harris at all. They had no idea that she wants things like a 44% capital gains tax or a 25% unrealized capital gains tax. Okay. Like, bro, they want to tax you on unrealized gains in your house. Okay. So if you own a house and the houses went up $200,000, they want you to write a check ahead of time ahead of you selling the house for $50,000. Okay. So if you have $200,000 of equity in your house, like you, you bought your house, you got equity in your house because I know what you paid for it. And let's say you had 200 grand of equity in your house. They are going to come to you and they're going to say Mr. DJ, I need you to write it. The IRS is going to say, I need you to write a check for $50,000 in cash before I even sell it before you sell it. And if you don't, we're going to put you on a payment plan. And if you don't go on a payment plan, we're going to seize your assets. That they people don't even know that that's part of their fucking plan. I see these assets. Listen, dude, people have no idea. The people that vote for them have no idea of what the fuck these people are even about. It is a complete popularity contest. And dude, you know, yeah, there's some people that believe it. Here's another note that I know for sure. Did you see how Kamala Skyped in from Milwaukee and they pretended like they had a whole full stadium at Milwaukee last night? Yeah. So Kamala wasn't at Chicago. She was in Milwaukee, which is very close. And they pretended like they sold out a stadium in Milwaukee, but they didn't. They sectioned off the whole stadium to where it was just one little section behind her and one little section in front of her and then portrayed it as an entire stadium full of people. And while the stadium, like I said on yesterday show, it was fucking packed. The stadium in Milwaukee was not. And you know how I know? Because I got people on the inside to send me some fucking videos. Yeah, they had it all cordoned off. It was one section in front and one section behind. It was totally fucking fake, totally fake. So that she's standing there pretending like, oh, look, we got Obama's got two stadiums. You got Obama making up this joke about crowd sizes, right? And fucking they're pretending like she's way more popular than she is intentionally. And you have to ask why they're doing that. Why? Why would they go to Milwaukee, which is like what? An hour away from Chicago. Yeah, it's close. And fucking say, look, we sold out a stadium here, too. Why would you do that? To cheat. Okay, to keep to keep the perception that she's wildly popular so that they can cheat and say, bro, she got 97 million votes, right? Most popular of all time because they learned last time that nobody believed that fucking Biden 81 million votes. Okay, so that and I know for a fucking fact, okay, because I got people on the inside to send me fucking video. Let's send you the video right here. Can I post it? I don't know if we can post it, but I'll definitely send it to you. You get it? Mm-hmm. Wow. Yeah. Where I saw more tickets to that than fucking an RIT. Wow. Yeah. I mean, that is convincing. Yeah, I can't post that because that comes from a confidential source that I don't want to burn. That's I mean, yeah. But they're I promise you it'll get it'll get out some other way, but I promise you they're fucking lying. They're trying to create a perception. Yeah. Well, the other little piece on this thing, man, with the DNC that I thought was interesting was this guy named Steve Cortez. You know, now what what's the Democrat party stance on ID? Sandy. Oh, well, I mean, we don't need IDs to vote. Right. Black people are too dumb to use a computer or get an ID. And if we ask for IDs to vote, it's racist. Racists. Races. ID's are racist. Yes. Oh, this guy Steve Cortez. He actually brought an illegal alien with him to the DNC to get it. Guess what they asked him for? An ID. And they wouldn't let him in. The DNC was more secure than I fucking Southern border. I just thought that was interesting. Well, that doesn't show you that they're full of shit completely. But we have to get listen, we have to get to the bottom line. They are trying to repopulate the United States. I saw this fucking this page today. This this white dude was standing out on the corner and said, Hey, white people, you know that you're being replaced in your own country. Okay. And that's that's what he's saying. People were in the comments were full of black people saying, Oh, well, you didn't care about that when the Indians are you didn't you were fucking blah blah blah. They make a fun of the dude, you know. But like the funny thing is is like the black people haven't fuck figured out that they're being replaced too. They are being replaced. You know what I'm saying? Like it's not just a white people that are being replaced. Americans are being replaced. Black and white. Okay. So before you get all high and mighty and make fun of people who say that, realize it's not just white people. It's all Americans that are being replaced intentionally. 100% man guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said, let's go check out some of these comments. Okay. Let's go cruise them. This first comment comes from a first comment comes from Adur Roofian Historic says I literally cannot go a day without this show. Me neither. Me neither. He's black. Yeah, he's black. I appreciate it bro. Yeah, that's love, man. Yeah, we got listen man. What do you mean Andy's black? Huh? Well, you racist? No, we think black people on this in the show. I didn't know they could. Because they don't have that kind of music computer. I got it. That's fair. I'm saying. I you know what, bro? I love our audience. Oh, they're great. Yeah. Absolutely great. This next one comes from at J.V.Anna Donson. I mean, huh? There's an English accent. DJ sounds so hot. There's some wrong with you. What the fuck is that on my head though? No, no, I didn't say me, bro. That's not 100%. It is not me. That is not me. You can check this laptop. Yeah, name me. That's cultural appropriation. That's fucked up. Yeah. That's so fucked up. All right. Thanks. Thanks. This last one comes from at in Mueller 2430 and he got to address this. They say the only crowd size that matters is those that vote in November. Both sides are playing this game and it's going to cost us our future. It needs to be about how we are going to set this country on the right path. I agree. I agree. I don't know that both sides are playing the crowd game. I mean, Trump's getting 60, 70,000 people at his fucking rallies. Consisting. Yeah. I mean, that's a fact. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, I agree with the statement. You know, it doesn't matter about the crowd size. It matters how many people engage, how many people go to the polls. And if Trump is going to win and people who want to vote for Trump won him to win, there is going to be have to you're going to have to consider the fact that they're probably going to put 30 or 40 million extra votes in there, which means you're going to have to bring three or four or five of your friends to the fucking voting booth that wouldn't normally vote. So unless we do that, unless we go out and start recruiting our own people to go with us, you know, make a fucking thing out of it. Go vote. Get some lunch. Go vote. Fucking grab a beer. Go vote. Crush a workout. Make a day out of it. You know what I'm saying? Like, but dude, this has to happen and people have to show up and vote. Like, and, and, you know, you have to look at the media and what's being shoved in our face. You know, what's being shoved in our face is two different sets of propaganda. One, I don't know intentionally or unintentionally comes from the conservative side, which is this overconfidence that Trump has in the bag, which broke. Like, that's the wrong message to be putting out to people. I don't know if these people are being paid by the Democrats or if they're on, this is intentional, but there are a lot of pro Trump or conservative influencers that continue to propagate this shit that makes it seem like he's got it in the bag. And like, do those people are either getting paid to do that or they're really fucking stupid. Then on the other side, you got this demoralization technique that the left and the media are all combined in doing, which is to present a false image of someone's popularity to artificially close the gap of perception so that when they cheat, it's believable. So, yeah. And also, you know, if they make the perception strong enough, that's going to keep certain Republican voters at home because they're like, well, fuck, they got it. Never good. You know, so yeah, man, we got to vote for that. Yeah, I mean, both sides, both sides playing the game, you know, I don't know if I agree with that, but, you know, when he's to happen is correct on what this man is saying. 100%.

All 45 Ukrainian drones over Moscow, Bernas, Belgrade, Kaluga, and Kursk, Russian officials say. So Ukraine targeted Moscow on Wednesday and what a Russian officials called one of the largest drone strikes on the Capitol since the war began in 2022. All 11 drones heading toward the Capitol and the Moscow region were destroyed. Russia's Ministry of Defense said in total, Russia said it, it's air defenses down 45 Ukrainian drones, including 23 over the Bernas region, six over Belgrade, three over Kaluga, and two over Kursk. Quote, this was one of the biggest attempts of all time to attack Moscow using drones. Moscow mayor Sergei Siboynian said on his telegram channel adding that strong air defenses around the Capitol prevented the drones from striking their intended targets. Some Russian social media channels shared videos of drones apparently being destroyed by air defense systems which then set off car alarms. In Russia's Kursk region one person was killed and two were wounded after Ukrainian drone dropped an explosive device on their car, acting regional governor Alexei Smirnov said on telegram according to Reuters. Now you got this large offensive that Ukraine is pushing in. What do you think Ukraine's concerned about right now? I'm worried about one team. More money. Of course, more money, more weapons. Zelensky just calls out US, UK, France, over slow weapons, deliveries. This guy is such a bitch. Bro, he's such a fucking little twerp, oh it's our fucking responsibility to fucking fuck you. So as Ukraine gains territory inside Russia, he's got fucking yachts, houses, airplanes, mansion, all the shit. He's fucking what, 30 something years old. Fuck this guy. I agree. I agree. Well, you need your fucking so knows your weapons. That's an emphaster. How about you stop attacking the big bad fucking wolf right next to you? Yeah, they're like swatting at this point. I'm just hoping fucking Putin just says fuck you and fucking destroys these people. That's my thing. I'm so fucking beacuse I've become so anti-Ukraine in this situation that I can't even take it anymore. Well, I mean, that's my thing. And it sucks for the Ukrainian people because I'm not talking about the Ukrainian people. I'm talking about their government. The Ukrainian people should fucking revolt against these people. Well, the ones that are left, they've already killed all the men for nothing. And women and children have allegedly have been, you know, they left the country in 2022. So I mean, it's like that's kind of my hang up. I'm like, what is Putin holding back for? What's he? What's the restrain at this point in the game? I think he's, I think he is very aware that we have a very small amount of people that are causing lots and lots and lots of disruption. And I think he's a responsible leader in the fact of that he knows that the people of America don't represent the administration of America right now. And I think he probably understands that about Ukraine as well. And I think he understands like, man, you know, like we've got to show some restraint here because we end up killing all these people that don't even agree with fucking what's being done anyway. So like, you know, there's, there's a moral dilemma there if you're a responsible leader. But they are quickly closing that gap window because as a leader, when your people start to die and they start to bring the attack to you, you're going to have to step on somebody's fucking throat. Yeah, do something. Right. You got to do something, man. And it is my take is they're doing everything they can, meaning the United States, NATO, the Western countries to get this war going. They want this fucking war for sure. I mean, while and they want the war in Middle East too. Yeah, they want it to be chaos. It's funny how they're they're trying to push this monkey pox shit real hard. You got WHO declaring a worldwide pandemic on on monkey pox. And then you have fucking the war, you know, it's almost like somebody told you that that was what they were going to do. It's almost like, you know, they're pushing almost like me. Like I fucking told you for like last two or three years, exactly what the fuck they were going to do and now they're doing it. It's almost like, I don't know, I don't fucking miss, you know, but fuck dude, what do I know? Where a tinfoil hat over here. And on top of this offensive happened and you also got Russian ships. They're they're moving again. And they're moving right along NATO's maritime border. And they have been for the last nine days and nobody's really talking about that. They are literally surrounding NATO nations right now with massive fleets of warships. And so that's been going on. You got a Portuguese is actually kind of like guiding them and guard. I mean, trying to stay with them, make sure they're not doing anything crazy. But you got that happen. But with all this offensive stuff happening, you know, all these offensive pushes from Ukraine happening, there was something that happened about a week ago that nobody really covered that much. And you got to look at Wall Street Journal. They're the ones that broke this the story that apparently allegedly, Zelensky, the plan to blow up Nord Stream pipelines was culminated between Zelensky, some allegedly US sources and personnel to do this. And Zelensky denied this report, obviously. And then the very next day, they start pushing these massive offensive attacks onto Russia. A type of visor to Ukrainian president of Vladimir Zelensky has denied a report in the Wall Street Journal that is a government approved a plan to blow up the Nord Stream pipelines in September of 2022. According to the journal, a six-member crew of Ukrainian civilians and active duty soldiers used a small, rented yacht, salad, satellite navigation, sonar, and seabed maps to reach the Nord Stream pipelines on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, where the divers use an explosive known as HMX and timer-controlled detonators to rupture the pipelines, triggering a massive release of methane gas. The blasts severed three of the four pipelines that carried Russian gas to Europe. Now, allegedly, this plan that was put together by these sources was done at a bar while these men were drinking, brought to top officials in Ukrainian military, was pushed to Zelensky who then approved them, but then later allegedly re-nigged and these men continued on this plan by themselves. That was the story that came out from the Wall Street Journal, Zelensky denied. Then again, you turn right back around and now you got these massive drone pushes into Russia. They're definitely poking the bear, the swatting at the hornets' nest. They can't cry when they get stuck in a bit. Dude, everybody's sick of this guy. Everybody's sick of him. Like, bro, like Reel Talk, they should technically just fucking eliminate this guy. Just fucking eliminate him, bro. Figure out where the fuck he is and fucking eliminate him. I think he's here. I wouldn't doubt it, bro. We don't know where he is. He's a fucking coward, dude. He is. You got your conscribing and kidnapping grown men in their 50s to go fight a war that you know, you're not going to win, bro. I really do, I mean, I just... That's a many years ago, bro. He would come out and do his talks. There were some weird things with the videos that were being released. Yeah, I remember. My green screen background. I think he's fucking chilling here in Florida somewhere. I heard he's got a place down in Miami. That's what I heard of his houses. That's what I heard. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Guys, you jumping on this conversation, you let us know down in the comments what you guys think with our situation over in Russia and Ukraine. With that being said, it's promised. It's time for 10 full hats. They're headline number three. All right. Now, this is an interesting one. Stay with me. All right. We try to connect some of these dots. But I'm sure everybody's seen it. And I've seen this a couple of days ago. I didn't really know what to make of it. But as always with these things, you can't just jump in, you know, on emotions and the first thing that comes to mind. You got to let stuff kind of develop. Let the cake bake. Headline number three. This goes back to Monday headline. Tech magnate missing after luxury super yacht sinks off Sicily in violent storm. Okay. Now, this came out. This was Monday. Monday or Tuesday, I believe it came out. I'm like, okay, I mean, there. I mean, a billionaire dies in a yacht. It's not really mainstream news, but it was. I'm like, why? It didn't really make sense. So I didn't want to put on the last episode of CTI. The more information has come out, that is definitely interesting. Okay. So let's dive through this a little bit. So a British tech magnate and several other people are missing. This was the original report. After a luxury super yacht sank near Sicily's main city, Palermo, during a violent storm of Italian officials and sources familiar with the matter told CNBC. At least one person was killed. That was at the time of this reporting. Mike Lynch, who was regularly described in the UK media as Britain's Bill Gates, was not among those rescued, said the sources who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. They added that Angela Bacara's Lynch's wife have been plucked from the waters off the Italian island. Lynch was among six people who were unaccounted for associated press quoted Savo Casino of Sicily's civil protection agency as saying, quote, there were in the wrong place at the wrong time. He said, Katrina said, also confirmed that Bacara has survived. Italy's coast guard said in the statement that the 184 foot sailboat named the Bessan sank due to a violent storm of Palermo around 5 a.m. local time. That's 11 p.m. Eastern time with 22 people on board. 15 people were rescued. Six passengers were missing. That's what the report said. All right. Now there was plenty of witnesses that were talking about the storm. Carsten Borner, the captain of a ship that rescued the survivors to reporters, that there was a quote, strong hurricane gust. We had to start the engine to keep the ship in an angled position according to Rodors. All right. Now the ship, it's not that old, it was built in 2008. It was registered in the UK. It was built by the ship builder Perini. It has an aluminum hole that can carry 12 guests in the crew of up to 10 that makes 22 for full capacity. It's a luxury vessel. People spend about $215,000 a week to charter this boat out. It's a big boat. It's massive. It has a massive four cockpit and mains alarm. It's a nice boat. It's a very, very nice ship. It's baller. There's many people would say. Now as of today at the time of this recording, they have found five bodies that were found in the sunken super yacht, according to the officials. One of those bodies, they are saying belongs to Mr. Lynch. All right. Now again, this is not mainstream news. Like, okay, cool. But I mean, you got to dig into this guy just a little bit and you start seeing some very, very interesting things. And so Mike Lynch, he was 59 years old. He's the British founder of the Tech Venture Capital firm, Envote Capital, and co-founder of the Tech firm's autonomy and dark trace. In June, which was just two months ago, he was acquitted of all charges after a decade-long US fraud trial related to the 2011 sale of autonomy to Hewlett Packard, the voyage on the Bessayan owned by a company controlled by Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares, was intended to be a celebration of his legal victory. That's what Britain's telegraph reported. All right. So Lynch sold autonomy, which was one of once England's biggest software company, to Hewlett Packard in 2011 for more than $11 billion. All right. He, Mr. Lynch, was subsequently accused of overvaluing the company and was charged in the United States with fraud. He was acquitted in June. All right. Now there was other people on this boat, right? His buddies like, you know, hey, we're celebrating. I mean, fuck, we've been fighting this for over 10 years. Let's go on the yacht. Let's go celebrate. One of those people on the yacht was this missing New York City lawyer, who also posted a very weird text message, or I'm sorry, social media posts moments before this hurricane and, you know, strong gust of wind came out of nowhere. He's a top New York City lawyer. And he's been missing. They, they have not yet said if he was one of the bodies that was recovered. But on Monday morning, he eerily written about his family living, quote, happily ever after, and one of his final social media posts before vanishing with his wife in the shipwreck. Christopher Morvillo, he's a 59 year old lawyer who helped British tech tycoon Mike Lynch, the owner of the boat, with wind his frail trial. He thanked the legal team who helped their success in his penultimate LinkedIn post before the tragedy. At the end of the eerie post, he wrote, quote, and finally, a huge thank you to my patient and incredible wife, Anita Morvillo, my two strong brilliant and beautiful daughters Sabrina Morvillo and Sophia Morvillo. Now, this is where shit gets weird. Okay, this guy, all right? Christopher Morvillo, an attorney. Guess what other major case he worked on? Now, go back to September of 2001. Morvillo is a partner at a white collar firm, law firm Clifford Chants, which has an office on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. He is a former federal prosecutor who worked on the criminal investigation of the September 11 terror attacks, according to his own on bio. So this was the guy who was responsible for trying to figure out, you know, clear up this investigation on 9-11, and terrorist attacks, right? And he led that. He was a federal prosecutor that led those charges. Now, I remember a couple like not even a week ago, not even a week ago. There was some, a lot of noise being made about September 11th in the terrorist attack because it was one person who was allegedly the mastermind behind 9-11, Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, who the US reached a plea deal with and got him off of his death sentence. And then a week later, you have this boat happened. And not only that, another member of that team missing, or in that group with Michael Lynch and Mr. Morvillo, he also was, he also died literally days before the yacht sank and they hit and run while he was jogging. Now, wait, wait, wait. So Michael Lynch, the guy who is from England, the English Bill Gates, correct. His business, business partner on August 17th was hit by a car and killed. Correct. And then a few days later, he dies in the store. Okay. Yeah, nothing fishy about that. Nothing fishy. Now, I feel like there's two birds with one stone. I personally, I feel like giving me the obvious thing is okay. The US kind of pissed off. I'm not saying we can manipulate the weather or it's possible, but it is fucking weird that this massive fucking yacht sinks from a gust of wind. All right. I think it's weird. But you know, 10 years, a fucking big fuck you to the United States government for winning their case. Now you die. And then days before that, your partner who was also accused with you, who also got off, he died. And then the mix in with this 9-11 shit man. And the guy who was prosecuting this guy, who I'm sure was pissed and had some information on, he also dies in this, in this event. I think it's all a little just too messy for me, bro. And I don't know if that's too much tin foil. But where do you got on this? How do you make sense of any of this? I mean, look, bro, we don't live in a, we live, look, the laws and the rules and all the things that were told exist for us. Do not exist for the governments. They do not exist for other people. And when you take laws and rules and ethics and morality out of the equation, that opens you up to the simplest answers, all things being equal, which is you fuck with me. I fuck with you. And clearly, that's what happened. These guys fuck with the wrong people. And those wrong people who don't play by our rules and aren't bound by our laws, they made decisions to eliminate these people. That's what it seems like to me. That doesn't seem like anything other than that. There's no chance that this dude's business partner gets run over on August 17th. And then literally fucking two, three days later, the other business partner gets killed. And they just won this case. And they have all these connections like bro bullshit. They probably knew some real shit about what happened at 9.11. They probably had some situations where they had information that could be leveraged against certain people that don't play by these rules and those people killed them. And that's, you know, the average, the average human being lives by society's rules when the people who make the rules for society don't live by those rules at all. And sometimes the average human being forgets that. You know, we have this going on politically right now in our country. There's a lot of people that say things like, well, if that were true, it'd be on TV. No, it wouldn't be on TV. What would be on TV is what they want you to believe. It's called a television program. It's because it's meant to program you and thinking something that you wouldn't otherwise believe. And the programming is so heavy and so intense and has never been questioned by most people that they automatically believe what it is they see on TV. This is why when you see someone on TV that you know, it's a huge deal. Right? We've been taught that television is it. And if you're on television, you're making millions of dollars and you're a popular and you're right and you're telling the truth. And none of that is true. Okay. So, you know, we have people that that are ignorant to the idea that there is a whole bunch of people here that are not living by these rules and don't live by these rules and don't give a fuck. And they're called the governments. Those people are not held accountable. They're not held to any sort of standard. They can kill. They can jail. They can fuck with you. They can take your kids. They can kill your kids. They broke. Remember when that dude from that dude from Georgia, his son got blown up in that car bomb when he questioned the integrity of the fucking election in 2020. No one talks about that. Nobody talks about nobody talks about that. You know what I'm saying? Like, bro, we have a we have agencies who who solely exist to kill people who have information that will ruin their ability to maintain power and control over the population and they're willing to kill fight, do whatever they have to do to keep that going. And that's why I tell you guys over and over again, you know, they intend to do anything that they can to maintain their power and to avoid accountability. And that includes pandemics. That includes wars. That includes assassinations. That includes everything that they can do. And people think that they're just, you know, like these people who think like, oh, man, Trump's just going to walk away with it. Bro, you're insane. They're not giving up power to Trump. It's not happening, bro. It's going to have to be an undeniable show of force with the population in terms of how they vote. And then also an undeniable show of force with the population to not tolerate the bullshit that these people are willing to do. And until that happens, they're going to continue to do it because their asses are on the line. If they are held accountable, all of this dirt comes out and all of these nasty things come out that they've been doing. And Trump openly threatens to bring those things out. But the problem with Trump is he had a chance to do that. He didn't do it. Why didn't you do it? You know, it's a good question to ask, man. I think it's an important question to ask, super. Like I mean, people get so caught up on this side of this side. But it's like, I mean, ultimately, it comes down to just making the best decision for right now. Yes, Trump's it, obviously. But these people are not going to stop, bro. And then I'm going to stop. Even if Trump or to win, they're not going to go away. No, then they're going to say the election was stolen. Yeah, we're going to have to come from there for four years. That's right. Look, bro, this is going to end in violence. It's just it is the way it is. The good news is that one side is very weak and one side is very strong. One side is very unarmed. One side is very armed. And when the America people get tired tired of these people, these criminals doing all of these things, they will stay in their ground. But I'll say this, Trump is not the final answer for America, like a lot of people think. We have to completely revise and refresh and reestablish what it means to be an American, what it means to live by the Constitution, what it means to limit government involvement. When I look at our government, the changes that need to be made are extreme. They're not minor. And I just don't know that many people are willing to be as extreme as they need to be to make the changes. And you know, everybody wants to sit around and have unity and sinkoon by y'all. And I like that too. I like that. But we also have to face the reality of the situation is that there's a small minority of people who have grabbed a disproportionate amounts of power and control over society and their criminals. And you know, they are in every country globally, they coordinate and they abuse the fuck out of the population of the world. And until the population of the world, the real human beings don't stand up and say, hey, we're done with this shit. And they do so in unison in a world global, legit revolution of overthrowing fucking all of these toxic corrupt governments and starting fresh, which is a possibility. But until that happens, bro, you know, the changes are going to be minor. Yeah, guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, that thumbs up at dumbest fuck. I really should not even intro this. So let's just do it. Our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads 12 foot Python bites man and testicles as he set on toilet then he beat it to death with a brush. Okay, they call through crawl through the toilet. Oh, really? What country? TIE Thailand. That seems like something that would happen in Thailand. Hmm. That's amongst other things. Yeah, so this toilet attack was totally nuts. Well, at least he's got a future as a ladyboy. That's right. It's funny because it's true. Yeah. The time man was bitten on the testicles by a 12 foot Python while he set on the toilet. So he beat the serpent to death with a toilet brush, leaving his bathroom splattered in blood according to reports and stunning photos. Thai net, Tai Guan Nanan felt a sharp pain after he took a seat on Tuesday. So he reached down and grabbed the snake by the neck and tried to rip it off his private, it's according to Asia Pacific Press. Quote, I felt something biting my balls. It was very painful. So I put my hands in the toilet to see what was wrong. I was shocked that I grabbed a snake because he did not have a snake. That's not my. All right, we're canceling the show. This is the last episode. I know I promised you three this week, but when the snake didn't budge, he grabbed a toilet brush and began beating it, beating it in the head. Good job. Prompting the snake to release its fangs according to the outlet. Quote, I quickly stood up and plucked it out. I felt pain, really bad pain, and there was blood everywhere, but I was more shocked who I found a python in the toilet. Tai Guan Nanan said, jaw-dropping photos he posted on social media show the blood-thirsty serpent lying dead in his bathroom. Tai Guanan was immediately taken to a hospital to get a tetanus vaccine, but he thankfully didn't need stitches according to the UK Metro. Quote, my testicles are now are safe now. I'm lucky. It wasn't a venomous snake. A cobra would have killed me, he said, but I haven't used that toilet again since. It wasn't clear from the reports where in Thailand the attack took place here or some pictures of the scene. Damn. That's 12 feet. That looks like a little mini python. Yeah. I mean big enough to not fucking want it to bite your balls. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, for sure. I don't want nothing biting my balls. Yeah, that's gross dude. Yeah, man, fucking crawling off the toilet. I just sit on the toilet and the snake bites you. I check mine every time. You check your toilet for snakes. No, I mean for anything. I always check it. I just like, I look, oh, just a quick glance. Yeah, you gotta look. You know what I'm saying? Check before you sit. You know, or that's that's fucked up, man. That's like a that's like final destination like creepy shit. I've never taken shit again. I hate snakes, dude. So like that's not like I'm not scared to anything, but snakes. It's the only thing. It's the only thing. You see, I think going around Instagram, so all the shit that you're scared of is just snakes. Snakes. Yeah, I have no problem with snakes. Yeah, I have no problem. I mean, I don't want them in my toilet biting the balls, but I don't think I think snakes should be eliminated. What? Yeah, genocide. They're great for the ecosystems. Now they're some of them. These are invasive, but yeah, man, what I mean, testicles are safe. Almost snake, fighting balls. Dude, I mean, like imagine the snake, man, you're just chilling there and my fucker puts their stinky booty on you. I'd bite some balls too. No, no, no, okay. Now, I don't know how you beat a snake to death with a brush, though, too. Like that's that's I mean, actually, it doesn't take much to kill snake. Yeah, I don't take much. Really? Yeah. Because I mean, their heads are small. Anyway, the brains not that like the the skull itself, not that thick. A lot of it's just cartilage. They still have a lot of brains. They just beat it together. I mean, a couple of nice strikes. You're done. Really? I always went for the cut the head off with the shovel thing. I hate that, though, because then their eyes and their mouth like move for two minutes. I've already some moves. I know, and they like look at you. It's like, why'd you do that? Yeah, it makes me sad. I like animals, bro. I just don't like poisonous snakes. I'm like, gosh, no, for sure. Yeah, for sure. And I'm pretty sure that's piss on the floor, too. You have to just be water. I mean, look, bro, I mean, that's excusable. Well, wow. Yeah, bro, I had to kill that copperhead and my garage with the fucking shovel. I felt bad afterwards because that because like, bro, I cut his head off with the shovel and then like, he kept looking at me. Andy, yeah, he was like, looking at me and his tongue kept going out and I'm like, fuck, it took like two minutes to go for that. I go for a minute, but like, bro, that's a poisonous fucking snake. Very venomous snake. Yeah. Very, very venomous snake, for sure. Yeah, man. So what we got on this, uh, balls down, balls up. Yeah, ball deep, balls deep, balls deep. Yeah. All right, sweet, man. Well, guys, Andy, that is all I have. Yeah, don't be a hoe. Sure. The show. Slow. Got it on bank road. Can't fold. Just a note here. Shot case. Closed.
