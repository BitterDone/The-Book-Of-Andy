What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realist sake about the lies, the thickness and delusions of our society. Welcome to another fucking reality guys today. We have a special midweek episode of Andy and DJ cruise the motherfucking internet. That's what CTI stands for guys. It stands for cruise the internet. This is where we put up topics of the day on the screen. We speculate. That's what this shows about. It's about speculation. We speculate on what's true and what we think is not true. And then we talk about how we the people have to step up and solve some of these problems going on in the world. Now other times you tune in like on Mondays you're going to get Q and A F now Q and A F is pretty much a personal development show if you don't know personal development business entrepreneurship is the backbone of this podcast started out as the MSEO project almost 10 years ago became real AF and the end of 2019 because I recognize that there were some changes happening in culture that need to be addressed. And if we didn't address those and fix those we wouldn't have an opportunity to be successful or build businesses. We have to have fertile soil to plant our seeds in so that they grow crops. And so we have Q and A F. And this is where you get to ask questions about business winning how to kick ass entrepreneurship whatever you got going on you can throw some stuff in there really about anything guys life and we'll pick some to answer on the show now you can submit your questions a couple of different ways the first way is guys you can email your questions into ask Andy at Andy for seller dot com or you can go on YouTube on those Monday episodes and go in the comments section drop your question in the comments and we'll pick some from there as well. Other times you're going to get real talk real talk just five to 20 minutes and me giving you some real talks some stuff I think you need to hear usually based around personal development. And then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus is where people come on who have completed the 75 hard program talk about how their life was a shit show before and how they've got under control now and how they've used a 75 hard program to make that happen 75 hard is the initial phase of the live hard program that you can get for free at episode 208 on the audio feed only there is a book on my website Andy for seller dot com called the book on mental toughness it is consistently sold out we have a new shipment here arriving I think in a couple days. So if you want one of those that goes through the whole program it has a bunch of other chapters on mental toughness why it's important how you can apply it to your life and how it can make your life better you can grab that off the website you don't have to it's not necessary to get the program for free at episode 28 and audio feed and you're probably wondering what about the full length we've got a new format for full length that I'm going to announce very soon that I think you guys are really going to I think you're really going to like it actually so we're kind of revamping that that format but that's the show you're going to notice I don't do ads on the show I don't read ads I don't take money from companies I just come on here and talk about stuff and I don't want to be listening to some executive at some company tell me what I can and can't say so I just don't do that and in exchange I have this thing I call the fee the fee is very simple it means share the show all right if it makes you think if it makes you laugh it helps you with your skill set if it shines a light on what's going on in the world if it helps you be better please share the show we are constantly being throttled and traffic band and shadow band and whatever you want to call it especially on our video platforms so it's important to you guys share the show so don't be a ho share the show all right what's up it's going on man oh not much yeah I thought we know it's important people fight censorship like that you know what I mean like it's interesting how we can talk about what like we can talk all the person develop me want and it gets tons of traffic yeah but the minute we start talking about what's actually going on in the world no traffic the problems preventing you from being personally it's ridiculous yeah so we really need your guys to help to get this out you know you know do us a you guys do a great job of it but just a reminder you know do a solid share it out yeah anyway what's up man yeah man I wanted to get into you know I thought it'd be good to start off with a lot of the diamonds oh really and the crazy thing my favorite segments well the thing about this man is like it's it's not something that you said a year ago it's not something you said two years ago you literally just said this shit yesterday oh yeah and then here it is what is it let's bring it up let's talk about it guys have you guys see this headline how long reads Biden's AI plant a sensor you revealed researchers say Americans can't tell fact from fiction now we just discussed yesterday how this whole AI thing all the pito stuff how they're gonna start using AI as the defense mechanism and saying oh well that's just AI you know why don't we just plug in what I said yesterday right here yeah we do that it's interesting you know I was thinking about this I don't know if I mentioned this on the show but did you see the Taylor Swift AI thing yeah where they there was like a bunch of nudes and AI or something right bro and that became like a massive story okay and it got me thinking like are they pushing that story now this might be a little tin foil but dude I don't know man these people you know like I thought this through a little bit if you if you knew that there was all kinds of evidence of you and your friends doing fucked up shit with children that was gonna come out wouldn't it make sense to put out a story with the world's biggest celebrity with fake nudes and fake voices and things like this so that when the evidence actually came to the surface you could say well dude that's just AI that's fake that's not real I didn't see anybody say that and it's like that's what I that's my first thought when it came out with that story is like dude these people are all this is why they're hiding all this Epstein shit notice they haven't said shit about the Epstein shit since the beginning of January you know and they're all they're all implicated potentially all right and if they're all implicated but if they're all allegedly allegedly implicated wouldn't it make sense for them to push this story and then try so that they have like something to say whenever the stuff actually comes out and so we got that so that was yesterday you said that yesterday and then this comes out today into from where should let's dive into this so this is a New York Post article says it's all started so Twitter's censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story in 2020 could soon be possible on an industrial scale thanks to AI tools being built with funding from his father's administration a report from Republicans from the House Judiciary Committee claim Tuesday the report reveals how the Biden administration is spending millions on artificial intelligence research designed to make anti-quote misinformation and quote tools which could then be passed to social media giants and it discloses how researchers who got funding for the plan known as quote track f emailed each other to say that Americans could not tell fact from fiction online and that conservatives and veterans were even more susceptible than the public at large the report was published by the House Judiciary Committee subcommittee on the weaponization of government which chaired by Jim Jordan a cast new light on how funding from the National Sciences Foundation is being given to elite institutions including Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT the University of Madison Wisconsin and the University of Michigan for a program called quote trust and authenticity and communication system so track f it's saying was launched to identify misinformation create education and training materials for those with vulnerabilities to disinformation methods that's a larger it's part of a larger initiative the convergence accelerator program that aims to solve issues with significant national impact by finding high level research in which was quietly launched in 2021 now I got a couple of quotes here I want to share before we get into this all right so so an MIT one of the MIT researchers okay he told NSF officials quote broad swaths of the public cannot effectively sort truth from fiction online all right and he calls out military veterans older adults military families and those in rule and indigenous communities as particularly vulnerable to believing misinformation so the exact people who would be calling this stuff out as real would be susceptible to not know that it's real or that it's not not real continue um at the University of Michigan one researcher who received millions suggested one possible outcome of the research was outsourcing content moderation decisions from social media platforms to government officials which means if an image comes out this shows some interesting things it would be the government who would tell you whether or not it was true or not even if it was the government that is involved in the pictures so in theory if some pictures were to come out of a famous individual an actor sports figure a politician a CEO that showed them in a compromising position the government could just tell us all well that's AI that's not real correct because they would be the officiating authority on the matter yeah because we're too we're not able to so it's interesting how they talk about you know veterans conservatives military families people in rural communities you mean all the people who aren't buying the progressive agenda so everybody that doesn't agree with them is now misinformed without any evidence or case made or you know hey this is why you're misinformed here's the actual truth and here's why it is the actual truth they're just saying you're misinformed correct okay and it's funny because we shared a couple of AI pitches that were posted by people who are on the progressive left that tried to you know that thought this was completely real turns out the picture was fact checking was AI yeah generally but those were not conservatives or military veterans or so so dude I think people should really think about how dangerous this really is and what we're getting into we're getting into a situation where the government is trying to create a control mechanism around truth okay truth is truth truth is not decided based around someone else's agenda or what they're trying to accomplish or what they're trying to put through in society just because that's what they want to do doesn't make it true and when we think about like what this means for humanity especially here in America this means that anybody who disagrees with the government in any way shape or form is likely to be told well that's just bad information that's just not true and we see this every day with KGJP who goes up on the White House press secretary stage and gives us a line of shit clearly lying to our face clearly telling us things that aren't true she gets caught all the time the media gets caught all the time all these people are lying and we all know it and so now they're trying to make regulations around this legally so that they can be legally correct and we can be illegally spreading misinformation so if we even talk about what's actually going on we would be breaking their laws that's you have spreading this you understand how dangerous that is like do you guys understand that this is beyond censorship this is total control of a narrative because their narrative is falling apart this is a move of desperation this is a move of we don't know what else to do and hopefully some people wake up and stop this but you know what's the what's the temperature on that yeah I mean I mean if we go back I was about a year ago two years ago we had the I mean they're clearly going to be implicated in a bunch of stuff and they're just trying to prepare for yeah and they're going to say that's not us that's not true that's a fake you can't tell exactly I mean here's a thing too though I mean you know if you go back you know in the last two years we we had that you remember Nina Jankowitz this information right like we've had these type of things that came up this is just the first time that it's specific to AI yeah right and we talk about all the time guys like AI does need regulation 100% because again like you know that post that we shared a couple of weeks ago posting the picture of Trump with the young girls like that's AI generated photo yeah there needs to be regulation right we're even all the pictures that came out of like you know Trump arrests right and he's in you know orange jumpsuit and shit like there has to be regulation I don't disagree with that but who regulates it who gets to decide that those are the questions that I want to ask and I want to answer you know because if if the government is going to be responsible in the sole authority to tell what's truth and not truth like we have problems AI in my opinion is already out of the bag and the problem it's been here longer than we think too yeah of course they've been using it forever they I believe that the reason that they brought it to the light in the public is because they needed to cover their tracks with all this stuff that's been going on yeah in terms of you know their affiliations with Jeffrey Epstein and you know these crimes that they've been committing they need AI to be prevalent in society so that they can cover up any of the evidence that comes out so that's my take on it but I mean at a larger scale I mean AI is already out of the bag dude and the problem is is like I said back you know when it first started coming out like November 22 as I believe we start talking about it nobody's thinking of the ramifications of what this is going to mean to human beings and so they introduced this stuff and all the marketers and all the business people who are high greed individuals are adopting the technology because they can make more money not thinking what it could actually do to humanity and so now we've got all these companies and all these people and all these things built around AI and it's only getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse I mean we're having companies lay off and you know entire call centers entire staffs eliminate jobs because AI can do the job and that's a problem especially whenever we think about what AI is going to do when it's it's paired with robotics which Elon's talking about a billion robots in 2040 like what do you think's going to happen to humanity dude and people will say well everybody will be able to live their life and they won't have to work that's not true dude that's not true that's not what's going to happen you're not going to have any opportunity to actually build any sort of success or wealth in your life you're going to have to take what you get and everybody's going to be poor because the people that are making these rules are greedy as fuck so you're going to have two extreme classes you're going to have an extreme extreme wealth power class and then you're going to have extreme poverty class and most people are going to be in the in the extreme poverty class you know 99% of people yeah so it's very dangerous and they're using people's greed to implement the technology and have been and it's just disturbing dude it's you know it's the internet started this you know when the internet came around they didn't regulate the internet they didn't make rules around the internet that's had a ton of ramifications that have been negative on society you know you have companies like amazon that weren't required to collect sales tax for a number of years which gave them a massive advantage over brick and mortar retail so you have a company who employs far less people than the entire scope of brick and mortar retail getting a 10 and 8 to 10 percent advantage in price over brick and mortar retail because they don't have to collect that tax and so what they did was they lowered the price brick and mortar retail couldn't compete and people don't really remember this because it was a long time ago what happened so quick dude for the first 10 years of amazon amazon was a price platform not convenience right okay and so we have this situation where the this is just an example of how the internet has been damaging we have this situation where the internet has punished middle America and made it harder for them to compete in their brick and mortar retail environments and then rewarded a company like amazon that employs far less people as the collective whole of brick and mortar right and now you have bezos who's one of the richest dudes in the world who you know billsy state of the art centers in the slums of teoana right like there's not a lot of giving back happening here in proportion to the wealth accumulated so now we have a big problem it's almost like a big monopoly that's been formed that isn't being broken up or isn't being challenged in any way shape or form because he's donating money to the right people and yeah where's that redistribution yeah dude and then we talk about the internet on top of that and by the way like you can't fault bezos bro like he fucking took advantage of the opportunity and he was really fucking smart this is not a personal attack on bezos but this is the stating of the facts okay that was bad for small town mainstream America and then you have a situation where like the internet wasn't regulated in terms of the censorship right section 230 these these internet platforms social media platforms were allowed to capture the entire small uh the conversation of the entire country the the town square of the country so to speak yeah and they don't abide by the same rules that the country does so they're allowed a censor they're allowed to delete they're allowed to throttle your traffic they're allowed to de-platform you know and we've become even used to that now because they've been doing it for three or four years you know like we have to fucking which by the way we're not going to do anymore but we've had to fucking like like you guys have noticed like bleep out words so that we could try to get into the algorithm and shit like dude that's all right that's not how this should be and those rules should have never been established because nobody was thinking at the time what was actually going to happen and now we don't have a government that will change the rules because they're all in on the take because these companies have become so powerful and so rich that they are paying and lobbying for all of these people to vote on their side and by the way the democrats love it because all these tech companies are on their side with the way that they censor so if you're with them you can say whatever you want if you're not with them you can't say shit and that's been happening for years the fact that the the the pendulum is swinging back towards common sense and then conservatism is actually in my opinion a result of their censorship because people have gotten so tired of having these companies thumb on top of their necks that they're like fuck I'm not with this anymore we're seeing this with the black communities right we're seeing this with all the communities that have traditionally voted democrat are starting to recognize what's actually going on and you know this situation with AI is just another example of them utilizing technology to cover their tracks and gain leverage on the people yeah yeah 100% my guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think let me say let's get into our first headline remember guys if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to any facility that I comment you guys can find them linked there with that being said headline number one headline number one reads trump is not immune from prosecution and there's 2020 election interference case us appeals courts say now this was lighting up the internet everybody's talking about it um and a lot of people I see a few people bro just kind of freaking out a little bit it's not that it's not that serious not that deep it's okay everything's fine for right now just a few of the you know t-shirt sellers you know i'm saying you believe this like relax yeah that's all right yeah we'll be okay let's dive into this a little bit so a federal appeals panel unanimously rejected former president download trump's immunity claims Tuesday ruling he can stand trial on charges he's he illegally plotted to overturn the 2020 presidential election in a 57 page decision the three judges on the dc us circuit court of appeals concluded that trump who 77 years old does not enjoy complete immunity from prosecution quote we cannot accept former president trump's claim that a president has unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power the recognition and implementation of election results the court wrote trump's legal team pitched two main arguments to the court the first one uh that the former president was immune from prosecution because his 2020 election machinations pertain to his official duties the judges rejected that claim finding quote properly understood the separation of powers doctrine may immunize lawful discretionary acts but does not bar the federal criminal prosecution of a former president for every official act quote legislators and judges are absolutely immune from civil suits for any official conduct uh legislators have an explicit constitutional immunity from criminal prosecution arising from the constitutional speech or debate clause they added nevertheless legislators and judges can be criminally prosecuted under generally applicable laws for their official acts consistent with the separation of powers doctrine um so trump's alleged efforts to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election were if proven an unprecedented assault on the structure of our government the judges continued quote allegedly injected himself into a process in which the president has no role the second argument held that trump's impeachment by the house of representatives following the January 6 2021 capital riot meant that the current prosecution led by special counsel jack smith amounted to double jeopardy that was a second claim um the judges again rejected that argument finding that quote trump's stance would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the president beyond the reach of all three branches quote presidential immunity against federal indictment would mean that as to the president the congress could not legislate the executive could not prosecute and the judiciary could not review i've quote former president trump's reliance on the double jeopardy clause is misplaced impeachment is not a criminal process and cannot result in criminal punishment the panel file um and everybody's on it ap news is on it CNN is also on it their helen and reeds court rules trump does not have immunity from 2020 election subversion prosecution um but here's the thing what happens next what does this mean what's the bottom line here and uh really all this means is that this just fast tracks the case to the supreme court they will have the ultimate deciding factor that's all they basically did that's how i read it as like it's kind of like they didn't want like they had to make a ruling and had to be unanimous they didn't want to just go all in to be too quick or just say yeah now we're sitting on our hands not saying nothing they fast track this entire case of the supreme court um so the supreme court um trump's gonna ask them to to block the immunity ruling given him until Monday to file an emergency stay request with the court which i expect him to do um here shortly and then when we got on this i don't know you know it makes me i think people should be concerned about the legitimacy of the courts considering what just happened with uh gene carol and trump yeah you where they awarded this woman eighty three million dollars when she has fucking clearly said in court that he never even touched her right well that's one thing two people didn't understand like there's the civil law and there's there's criminal law trump was not found guilty of anything they're not guilty in civil law he was found liable right which means okay well you heard a film doesn't matter what you did you heard a film and she felt hurt all right you got to give her money right he never there was eighty three million dollars eighty three million dollars but again like when you start diving in like you said i mean can we really trust the court systems when you dive in and see who that judge is connected to and who she's connected to yeah who paid for that how it's got to prosecute him for this you know you know you know and then like that brings up all the other questions what about are we just gonna ignore all the footage from j6 are we just gonna pretend like that doesn't exist less a thing show me one person we have all of these j6 defendants right that have been convicted and charged and are in prison right now where is five me one person that has been charged and convicted within direction well not only that bro is not one how about this where's the rest of the video footage yeah okay where is the why are we not talking about how Nancy Pelosi denied 20,000 troops to maintain order there are trumps requests you know and i mean why are we we're like look bro there's so many lies about January 6 that have become accepted as truth and you can see it when you talk to people who have bought into it they're like dude j6 was in insurrection and that is it they won't even look at anything they won't listen anything they won't look at anything like they don't understand any of the like intricacies or nuances of what happened there where we had a number of FBI agents in the crowd which has been confirmed we had 12,000 hours of footage where they only released like two hours total okay and in that footage that they did release we see people who were arrested being unhand cuffed and then fist bumping the FBI we have all of this fake shit where we have great you know people walking through the ropes and the police letting them in and the police opening the doors and all of the shit you know and people won't look at that stuff because they want to believe that Trump did these things when in reality dude i watched it on tv and so did you i saw exactly what happened he fucking went on twitter during when the shit started getting out of hand and said everybody go home and they deleted the tweet yeah he's put out like two two tweets yeah yeah you know like dude this this is this what's happening here is scary dude like it's it should be concerning because if they can do this to Donald Trump the president of the United States what can they do to you well will they do to you that's what they're going to do to to every single person who stands out against their narrative who stands out against what they say they are going to punish they're going to put them in jail and dude in reality when we talk about what's going to happen to people who have resisted these people is eventually when they get full control they kill those people that's what they do this has happened over and over and over and over again this happening the Bolshevik revolution this has happened every single time communist have pulled a revolution they pull all the resistance they pull all the people who can think they pull all the people who have any sort of valuable skill said who are intelligent and they fucking kill them and they do that because they don't want any resistance to their plan because they know that their plan is completely off base and the only people that will ever believe it are just subservient slave class people you see what i'm saying it's movie man this is history this isn't like oh Andy's just making this up like if you go study anything that's happened in the last hundred years regarding communist and what they've done it always ends up with millions of people dead and the people that they kill are the people who don't believe what they're selling which goes into our first topic of the AI thing you know what i mean oh it who who doesn't who's susceptible to misinformation oh conservatives veterans people on the right like well ever so everybody disagrees with you is misinformed you see what i'm saying like bro this should worry people and if you're a democrat or you're someone who votes this way you need to wake up and realize that your party has been hijacked your party has been corrupted and they are going full communist with what they're doing and if you continue to let your ego stand with those people eventually you're going to be the one that's like damn this is fucked up but you won't have anybody to stand with because all the rest of the people will be have been eliminated yeah yeah i mean i think we're going to get to a point two man it's like you know what like true dose that like what do we do with these people right first it was about the there already the vaccinations right when this stuff starts rolling out and we start seeing these images get released they're implicating these type of people those misinformed people that'll be the next narrative what do we do with these people well it makes you wonder what are they plan on doing with those people and why are they letting in millions and millions of people what do they plan on doing with the people that are already here you see what i'm saying like dude if you study hate did this stuff make so much sense yeah but do you study history of any sort dude and just go back and look at what happened in every single communist revolution that's happened this is the exact same thing this is like people like last time i posted this clip from 60 minutes that talked about how this this guy down on the border has i guess a ranch and he was being interviewed by 60 minutes and there was a bunch of migrants who basically cut down his trees messed up his land littered everywhere left it completely like ruined she she used the word moon scape and that's what it looked like it was dust and rocks like all the trees were gone and this guy went to try to defend his property and get these people off his property and they arrested him and this goes back to what i would been trying to tell you guys like you're going to go on vacation and you're going to come home and there's going to be a migrant family living in your home and and if you try to kick him out they're going to rest you what are you going to do at that point and that that that's not a partisan issue like you guys who vote for democrats and stand with democrats so fiercely what are you going to do when these people are living in your house that's what they're going to do I got him thing that's right nothing that they're going to do they're going to lose all their shit and then still find some way to be to make it virtuous no they'll find some way to blame Donald Trump or blame conservatives or blame like these people are refusing to see reality you know they just want to say Trump bad conservative is bad veterans bad guns bad all that's just bad bigotry racist massage they're so caught up in the in the in the in the coolate yeah that they can't even recognize what's happening dude and they don't understand like you guys are going to get to a point where you will snap out of it you will wake up and when you wake up there's a good chance that everybody else who's been trying to wake you up that you've been attacking and hating and you know calling names for the last 10 years you're going to wish those people were around they're not going to be around this is very dangerous yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments we've actually got a little migrant stuff coming up a little bit later but uh yeah let's cruise some comments this comment comes from at David LW Kane says can I apply to be a woodchipper operator for the big show yeah yeah I thought about like like who who's who's gonna press the button like who turns like you know who works the I mean bro I think I think we should offer it to the victims they should get first yeah if they want to and if they don't if they don't want to then we got somebody you can do it all right you know I like the idea of getting that guy from the California prisons just killing all the pedophiles as like the main operat he seems like a character yeah bro did you see what a Kazaka standards did oh yeah were they're cutting off people's penises that molest kids because they said the chemical crash station wasn't harsh enough yeah so now they're surgically yeah they're cutting off pedophiles dicks I like it I like it too for that huh yeah I love for that bro look man you got to you got to figure out a way to stop it that's how it's got to be stopped that's what they that's exactly what they said yeah they said there's only where you stop it um yeah so David yeah I mean you know listen we'll probably put some applications out there yeah um yeah I appreciate the interest if you got any experience in working in machines and stuff benefits the series not where we host it where do we hope like we're gonna be in a white house right I like I like I got my house I picture this out in the front of the white house dude that's where I picture it bro and then turn this shit to compost and use it to like I'm just saying that I'm just saying like that that's how when I picture you know I picture this right out in front right out in the yard man yeah all right man guys we appreciate you guys coming in as always man thank you guys um let's keep this cruise move we got headline number two here let them two reads Johnson shuts door on swift consideration of senate border deal so it's dead in the water it's done um we don't know really really know what that means just yet so let's do this uh speaker Mike Johnson warned Saturday that the house won't rush to pass a senate border far and a deal and we'll instead take up a standalone bill for Israel aid next week the decision by House Republicans comes as a bipartisan group of senate negotiators are expected this weekend to release the text of their deal which would link more funding for Ukraine Israel and Taiwan to new border security measures um so it appears that the bit the deal's gonna be done right um but let's check in with our warmongers and see how they're doing uh we've got uh head on read Schumer warns us troops will be sent to fight Russians if border bill does not pass I saw him say that so if we don't secure our border yeah we gotta go fight Russia yeah he sat he sat on the I got the clip oh you do oh yeah I got to put this glasses on his nose like a discussed dude yeah let's dive into it yes let's have some respect by the way how about this how about take off your fucking readers when you're addressing the country I mean I like you're some turdball well I guess that's what he is a turdball yeah yeah so yeah so so so either it's either it's either give pass the bill which includes 60 billion to Ukraine or we go fight Russia here's the clip also like 15 million to Israel um million not million we're the turning point in America this bill is crucial and history will look back on it and say did America fail itself why is it crucial well if we don't aid uh Ukraine Putin will be walk all over Ukraine we will lose the war and we could be fighting in eastern Europe and a NATO ally in a few years Americans won't like that if we don't help Israel defend itself against Hamas that perpetual war we won't be doing it bro that's where you don't get when I fight in your wars anymore we're not doing this shit anymore we're not sending our kids over to fucking because that can stand Ukraine or whatever to fuck and for them to die for your money for you to steal our money these guys are out of touch bro they don't understand completely out of touch they get Hamas that perpetual war will go on and on and on if we don't help humanitarian aid to the starving Palestinians in Gaza hundreds of thousands could starve and the border everyone has said it's chaos a speaker you just so a speaker Johnson he said it's chaos we have to do something legislative a few months ago but what has happened to answer you to collect your question so this is crucial for America it's a turning point history is going to look over our shoulders and say did we rise to the occasion to his credit Mitch McConnell did but too many Republicans including speaker Johnson are just scared to death of Donald Trump Donald Trump has said he wants chaos Donald Trump has said well wait till I become president that'll take at least a year Ukraine could be gone the border will get much worse war in the Middle East will get worse maybe bring bringing bringing us into it he's doing it all for political reasons and let me just say will senators the crucial question the 64 thousand dollar question the majority of Republican senators know this bill is the right thing to do it's a compromise I don't like everything in it neither does McConnell but it's a compromise that's the only way you get things important done in the Senate we've proved that two years ago in our bipartisan legislation and will the senators drown out the political noise from Trump and his minions and do the right thing for America it's a crucial question history will is looking down on every one of us right now I got a question hold on history was that history has been looking down on you and it's been seeing you lie for the last number of years we saw you guys put fake can't-lite visual out for January 6th and pretend like it was 9-11 or it was World War II D-Day or Pearl Harbor and we saw you guys do that we saw we we saw it we understand what you're doing you're trying to paint the history books just like you're writing the textbooks now as if COVID was this ultra deadly crazy shit that was like the Spanish flu in 19th the problem with this is do we don't know what to believe and not to believe from history how long has this been going on how long if people just been doing whatever they want and then writing the history to be whatever they want how long has that been going on because we see you guys doing this we see what you're doing and this idea of oh we're on the right side of history were you on the right side of history when you censored Ivermectin out which was an actual therapeutic to COVID and then people died because of that were you on the right side of history when George Floyd died of a fucking fentanyl overdose and then we burnt the whole country down and you lied to an entire population of the Americans are you on the right side of history when 10,000 children have been murdered and since October 7th and fucking Palestine are you on the right side of history you see what I'm saying we go on and on and on okay these people always say this this is what they always say when we say we wouldn't wear the mask you're on the wrong side of history no you're on the wrong side of history and you've been on the wrong side of history with COVID with George Floyd with Ukraine with all these things that keep coming out you are always on the wrong side and they gaslight us to make us feel like we're on the wrong side these people are criminals they're tyrants they don't give a shit about us and I'm not talking about us conservatives or whatever you think I am I'm not even a conservative I'm a regular common sense human being they don't give a shit about us the peasants and the longer that we continue to argue and bicker and fight with each other they're going to continue to take advantage of it and steal everything from us our opportunity our money our happiness our peace they're taking everything we're never getting those years back from COVID they took two years of your life two years of your kids life we're not getting that back how we get in that back you see what I'm saying no so like dude I'm tired of these old miserable bags of shit telling us that we're on the wrong side of history when clearly all they're doing if you have any common sense at all is there creating money money laundering operation after money laundering operation after money laundering operation they're inflating the currency making shit hard on the American people making it so they can't pay their bills they can't survive and these people are flying off in their private jets bro not giving a single fuck about you or me I'm sick of this dude yeah you know my my quit and this how you know it's proof that this is nothing more but but but laundering fucking taxpayer dollars how much money are we giving Ukraine already over a hundred billion dollars almost two hundred billion dollars how how how good of a wall could that have built not only that Andy why haven't they won yet because it's over just not reporting it we gave my husband you notice how much they don't report on the actual status of the war do you notice how the people who report the truth about the war somehow end up missing or dead like that American reporter that was just quote unquote passed away in a Ukrainian prison and he's out here saying dude the war's over all the Ukrainians man are killed yeah Russia's doing whatever they want and now you have Tucker Carlson over in uh oh you got that okay I want to talk about that yeah we'll talk about that a minute yeah just just on this migrant so that so the bill looks like it's gonna be done um you know and but this migrant thing you still got these weird flames that are trying to get stoked like you got in New York governor Huckle um she's relaxing the job requirements for these illegal immigrants to get government jobs right just a lot of like just stuff that doesn't make sense but I do have some good news uh coming from a leading report down in Texas uh since Texas gained control of the park and eagle pass illegal crossings have decreased from thousands or tens of thousands a day to just three a day three people that's three too many that's still three too fucking mint yeah but since they've gained control that's what we've got out of all that money they sent over to Ukraine and all that money they're sending all over the world what could they have done at the board see they don't want to solve that problem that's what people don't understand they have no desire to solve this problem at the border at all they want it to continue because they want to naturalize those people because they understand they there's a bunch of reasons they want to do it but the main reason they want to do it is because they understand that a ton of their base has become disenfranchised with their lives and their manipulation and they recognize what's going on and they are going to vote differently than what they have historically voted and these people need those votes so they're trying to import as many people as they can and between now in the election they're gonna make a big push for these people to be able to vote all right if you're an American citizen you should be furious about what they're doing they gave $600 to the victims of the Maui fires they're giving these people crossing the border thousands of dollars they're giving them cell phones flights flights bro they're put how many Americans are on the street right now homeless millions and they don't care they don't care how many emergency shelters of Adam set up for that listen man every single one of these people their interest is not with us we have to understand this yeah yeah accept that as like that that's true they have zero interest in doing anything for the American people at all in fact every single thing they do is against the American people intentionally while and then they go up there and smile and act like they're not doing it and you want it and then these people want to control the narrative with the truth you see what I'm saying right right this is fucking dangerous bro yeah man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads sucker Carlston claims he's interviewing Vladimir Putin because Americans are not informed about the war in Ukraine despite paying for them ways they don't understand daily male article reading Tucker Carlson has confirmed he is in Moscow to interview Vladimir Putin because quote Americans are not informed about the war in Ukraine he said on Tuesday the former Fox host announced on X on Tuesday that he would be publishing an interview with the Russian despo following widespread speculation after he was pictured leaving the Kremlin in Moscow on Monday Carlson said the interview would air unedited on his website without a paywall and on X making him the first American to interview Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 quote two years into a war that's reshaping the entire world most Americans are not informed a podcaster said about the war in Ukraine quote they have no real idea what's happening in this region but they should know they're paying for much of it in ways they might not fully perceive it's not clear whether the interview has already happened or when it will air at all but here's some pictures that got leaked of him leaving the Kremlin him at some type of symphony or orchestra something like that and here's a clip of Tucker Carlson himself. We're in Moscow tonight we're here to interview the president of Russia of Vladimir Putin we'll be doing that soon there are risks to conducting an interview like this obviously so we thought about it carefully over many months here's what we're doing it first because it's our job we're in journalism our duty is to inform people two years into a war that's reshaping the entire world most Americans are not informed they have no real idea what's happening in this region here in Russia or 600 miles away in Ukraine but they should know they're paying for much of it in ways they might not fully yet perceive the war in Ukraine is a human disaster it's left hundreds of thousands of people dead an entire generation of young Ukrainians and is depopulated the largest country in Europe but the long-term effects are even more profound this war has utterly reshaped the global military and trade alliances and the sanctions that followed have as well and in total they have upended the world economy the post-war war two economic order the system that guaranteed prosperity in the west for more than 80 years is coming apart very fast and along with it the dominance of the US dollar these are not small changes they are history altering developments they will define the lives of our grandchildren most of the world understands this perfectly well they can see it ask anyone in Asia or the Middle East what the future looks like and yet the populations of the English-speaking countries seem mostly unaware they think that is nothing has really changed and they think that because no one has told them the truth their media outlets are corrupt they lie to their readers and viewers and they do that mostly by omission for example since the day the war in Ukraine began American media outlets have spoken to scores of people from Ukraine and they have done scores of interviews with Ukrainian President Zelensky we ourselves have put in a request for an interview with Zelensky we hope he accepts but the interview he's already done in the United States are not traditional interviews they are faunting pep sessions specifically designed to amplify Zelensky's demand that the US enter more deeply into a war in Eastern Europe and pay for it that is not journalism it is government propaganda propaganda of the ugliest kind the kind that kills people at the same time our politicians and media outlets have been doing this promoting a foreign leader like he's a new consumer brand not a single western journalist has bothered to interview the president of the other country involved in this conflict Vladimir Putin most Americans have no idea why Putin invaded Ukraine or what his goals are now they've never heard his voice that's wrong Americans have a right to know all they can about a war they're implicated in and we have the right to tell them about it because we are Americans too freedom of speech is our birthright we were born with the right to say what we believe that right cannot be taken away no matter who is in the White House but they're trying anyway almost three years ago the Biden administration illegally spied on our text messages and then leaked the contents to their servants in the news media they did this in order to stop a Putin interview that we were planning last month were pretty certain they did exactly the same thing once again but this time we came to Moscow anyway we are not here because we love Vladimir Putin we are here because we love the United States we want to remain prosperous and free we paid for the strip ourselves we took no money from any government or group nor are we charging people to see the interview it is not behind the paywall anyone can watch the entire thing shot live to tape and unedited on our website tuckercarlson.com Elon Musk his great credit has promised not to suppress or block this interview once we post it on his platform x and we're grateful for that western governments by contrast will certainly do their best to censor this video on other less principal platforms because that's what they do they are afraid of information they can control but you have no reason to be afraid of it we are not encouraging you to agree with what Putin may say in this interview but we are urging you to watch it you should know as much as you can and then like a free citizen and not a slave you can decide for yourself thanks how do you watch that and think that's unreasonable right well I mean people can kremlin cronies Putin tucker interview will blow up US elections like they're already on it they're already on it they're already blowing up the elections I understand that this is more Russian disinformation and it's going to be election interference listen they haven't even seen it yeah regardless of what anybody says how isn't it reasonable that we should be shown the messages of other leaders when they speak about what's going on in America so that we can see the perspective from the outside that's a reasonable thing well because what does it see in that perspective allow us to do hold on we have to we have to we have to recognize that this isn't like the perspective that most Americans have is that we are the greatest country in the world everybody else is poor everybody else is shit everybody else is corrupt and we're this pure amazing family that lives on the hill and we're unlike everybody else which is far from the truth the truth is there's many countries out here that are doing better than us there's many countries out here who have a better culture than us who have a better society to us who have less crime than us who pay less tax than us who get along better than us and people don't really understand what America's role has been for the last hundred years America's we do not we do not mount up with all of our military equipment to all these foreign places to protect democracy or fight for freedom we go over there for money all right when we were in the middle east that was about money when we were in Afghanistan that was about money all right this is not about justice this is not about freedom this is not about peace this is not about protection of the American way of life this is about corrupt politicians creating wars so that the companies that they're invested in their stock rises and they make a lot of money and then they get kickbacks from the the dollars that they send over there to fund these things that is what this is about and because most people fail to understand this they see things like Vladimir Putin as inherently evil well if he was inherently evil why is it that he's importing Christian families in Russia why is it that you know we don't get to see anything he says like shouldn't it be a red flag what what's the difference between North Korea yeah not allowing any information in and the United States not allowing any information in you know we we turn our noses at countries like North Korea and say look at all those guys they're fucking they're an idiot like they're look how they behave towards Kim Jong-un you know look how they're how they don't understand what's going on dude but the rest of the world looks at us like that and that's what people are not understanding the rest of the world looks at us and they say dude what are they doing with this trans stuff what is this what do you talk this is crazy like we we are looked at as the clown show of the entire world right now and historically we have been the iron fist the military enforcers of NATO and the global alliance to go kick people's asses when they don't fall in line that's what America's been about and all these wars and all this shit and all this propaganda they fed us about you know going over there and fighting for freedom that's all bullshit man WMD bro that's all bullshit and like if you ask dude this is this is why a lot of veterans struggle with their service because after they get out they realize holy shit dude I was lied to I was manipulated we did some really bad things and they killed friends I'm done yeah oh yeah you killed innocent people to hire waking up right exactly and like dude I'm not faulting any of those people because they didn't know what they were doing but the truth is is that we live in a country that's highly censored that is highly encapsulated in an information bubble where they do not allow us to learn the truth and them attacking Tucker Carlson for interviewing Putin is just more of that they're afraid of that and I'm I'm you know this is dangerous for him to do oh super dangerous super dangerous man I would mean dude how we you guys can't all sit down and watch him an interview and people say well yeah he's a liar okay well Biden's not a liar any of these people in a liar that's the thing man our most Americans right now their perception comes from what's being told to them to perceive like yeah you don't you don't know he's a liar says who what have you see like what are the facts what have you seen them saying that has been fundamentally a lie it's not there and for Putin there's fucking nothing to see because they don't allow you to see it they won't even allow it should be a red flag that they don't even allow what he has to say to be played on our television that should be a red flag in itself because if he was the tyrant that they claim him to be then it would be blatantly obvious when he talks to us who else would they do that too they do it's Trump it's dude let that sink in yeah it's figure we get back on the list you know oh look we're on the list I mean it's just it's I mean dude look at the way they fuck with us man you see what I'm saying yeah like this is absurd you can't you are not allowed to question anything otherwise you're a traitor you're a threat you're a domestic terrorist you're a you know you're a you're something yeah you're anist or a foe of some sort yeah like no dude we love freedom yeah right exactly freedom America's free yeah bullshit man guys tell us what you guys think on this oh I am I can't wait for it to come out when is it coming out they didn't say and so I mean that that was the I guess the ending part of that it was like uh the article finishes as the former Fox news star kept his cards close to his chest on Monday after Russian media showed pictures of him at several spots in our Moscow including at a box at the boy's show I'm sure I'm fucking it up oh sorry sorry Putin um theater and eating at a hotel um yes so so when asked if he was in Moscow to be Putin Carlson said we'll see and he smiled um so yeah there's no official date about when it's gonna be released I'd imagine it'd be you know probably with him next month I would assume um it's gonna blow up the election you mean it's gonna blow up your narrative about the election is that what you mean exactly because the narrative the the elections is gonna be Russian misinformation the Trump Russia collusion misinformation where Hillary Clinton uh directed Christopher Steel to make up a dossier that implicated Trump and Russia which was completely manufactured and then talked about for seven fucking years while you destroyed the cultural relationship between the left and the right and divided everybody is it that kind of misinformation is it the kind of misinformation where you talk about all this crazy shit that was just completely made out for political game and then she gets to ignore like she did it like this woman's still on TV talking mad shit market orders yeah like she didn't even do this like oh they don't care and do the problem is is the people that support her they don't care no they don't care she could do no wrong right these people don't care they don't care you know at least the people who like like for me for me I can look at Donald Trump be like I don't like that I don't like that I don't like that those are things I don't like but I do like this and I like this why can't we all critically examine the people that we you know look at why can't why do we have to have this cult mentality where everything that Donald Trump says has to be true everything that Biden and the media and Hillary Clinton and company all these people Obama everything they say is true like why can't we have honest assessments why can't we do that yeah and it's because they constantly play on our emotions and divide us around cultural and racial lines through identity politics which eliminates our ability to converse and come to any conclusion you know they stress us out they they make life hard dude when everybody's struggling and the economy's terrible it becomes much harder to identify why because you're so worried about trying to get by that you can't really put the pieces together and you got to make sure you're using the right pronouns yeah dude they got to promise shit out this is about this is about making life in America so difficult that you can't even resist because you're so busy trying to survive yeah and it's all intentional dude yeah it's all intentional like what what the American economy is feeling right now in the the American middle class is feeling they have to understand this was intentionally manufactured to produce the result that you're experiencing not that when they when they when they close the country during COVID but they left open all the mega corpse okay that are that are that donate billions of dollars a year to political causes and pay very little tax and but they closed all the mom and pop middle class middle-size small businesses they closed all those do you think that was an accident that was intentional do you think it's an do you think it's an accident that they move from Afghanistan to Ukraine to now the Middle East and they want to print trillions of dollars over and over and over again do you think that's an accident or do you think that they're trying to devalue your purchasing power to make life even harder on you so you can't call out what the fuck is actually happening you understand these people are manufacturing crisis so people can't resist what their agenda is and that's been going on for years and years and years and years and years they want it harder on you they want you to suffer more they do not intend to fix the border they intend to increase the border as much as possible this is the literal destruction of this country and nobody's fucking talking about it people are talking about bits and pieces of it but they're not talking about the big picture and we're living in it right now and everybody's just like oh it'll get better this is the normal ebbs and flows of politics no one isn't it is not the normal ebbs and flows we are not in a normal political cycle if you think that your head is in the sand or up your ass you can choose which one that this is not normal it's not normal for grown adults to be giving kids puberty blockers it's not normal for grown adults to allow a four year old to decide what the fuck they are gender wise or what they want to be it's not normal for men to be in women's sports and then you have all the feminists who claim to be feminists who won't even speak out about it bro we don't have a backbone in this country anymore and that's the biggest problem and until we find it the abuse is going to continue it's very frustrating and it's very dangerous it's going to get harder because they're not letting up no they're accelerating because they understand that we see what's happening there's enough people that see what's happening that they can't be slick about it anymore so now it's going to be by force now it's going to be full throttle they we don't care if they see us full throttle look at the press briefings from kjpe bro she goes up there every day and blatantly fucking lies blatantly lies blatantly like it doesn't it doesn't matter how much you hate Donald Trump you can look at that woman and tell that she is lying about shit you see what I'm saying and until people are honest with themselves about what's going on and stop like hating one side so bad that you can't identify the truth this is very dangerous for people individuals and not not just one side it's dangerous for all people it's dangerous for every regular American citizen that exists in this country yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think that being said man let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where bring a headline up we talk about it to get one of those two options so with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads you have see fighter or not oh boy kano calls on Americans to go to church respect the law something is wrong in America this I thought this was a great video let's dive into this so you have see fighter or not mccano was so jazzed up after winning his fight at UFC Vegas 85 on Saturday that he could not hide his enthusiasm for America the police and following the law in a post fight interview in the ring mccano grabbed the mic as it was still held by ring side reporter Daniel Kormier a former fighter himself and told the audience that he was soon to become a naturalized American citizen here's the clip to the church and one of people to respect the law otherwise this great country in the world is gonna be a third world country and I don't want to be a fuck yeah yeah i love it yeah i love it bro he's completely correct you know why because he probably comes from a country that's experienced this that's actually secretly my only hope about these about the migrants enough of is that they can come here and they can recognize holy because like dude we're seeing headlines like that right i saw a number of headlines over the last six months or so where migrants have come here and they're they want to go back because they're like bro this isn't what we were sold this is just like where we came from it's on the downfall in fact we're gonna go through the same thing we went through there so you know my only hope for a lot of these migrants is that they recognize because like dude but i don't know if it's gonna happen because we have people who are calling for mass deportation like me because these people shouldn't be here they really shouldn't regardless if they're good or bad or whatever they should come through the actual entrance you use the right entrance guys just go back out like a laugh that's it and apply go through the go through the process and dude i wish we had i do it if i'll be right hold on bro if this guy if he if if 10 million migrants came and they were that bro i'd be okay with that but that's not what's going on you see what i'm saying not the truth it's not the truth i do love him for i do i do too and i i i love that he loves this country a lot of the guys you know like my man right here mdot and z-shon and the guys who come from other places jo jo comes from fucking lee may bro that's not another country i thought's what well i mean depending on who you ask you kind of you know it ain't you just think it is because you're a white trash bro that's what it is that's why trash we fit right we got the whole constantly right we love it over here lee may as a fucking shit bro in a jo lee may and afton man you can't even say that with a straight face no it is bro do you rip and lee may they got great restaurants that's a good culture everybody's cool the beat your ass if you get our line no fuck with lee may that's a fact anyway my point is is that like this is not what we're getting we're getting people who are coming from other countries were anti-american who are criminal who are military age males looking very excuse to get in the country and cause havoc and crime and we're witness and people say well how do you know okay well let's look at europe what's going on in europe you see what i'm saying yeah so i love this i mean this is thumbs up for me i fucking yeah this guy's cool man it's cool i mean he wasn't looking too good after that fight but i got that got it got it right there he won he won right it was by decision so well but uh yeah man thumbs up to uh er notto yeah thumbs up man well guys and more american men should be saying that message like all you
