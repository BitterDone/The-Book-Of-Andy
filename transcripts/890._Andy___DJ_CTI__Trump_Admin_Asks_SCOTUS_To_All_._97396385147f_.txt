good stuff man let's let's do some cruising all right let's do some good sounds good to me start off with some eruptions okay let's do that usually we don't start with those we end with those yeah well that's a nice little eruption a volcano erupted did you see that shit in it in Italy no really holy shit holy huge eruption of Italy's mount etna leaves tourist fleeing volcano yeah I didn't see it today well yeah it happened like I think it started yesterday I believe I don't know the time zone difference so but where's Mount Etna yeah so so well first I think the first question is why the fuck are the tourists on the volcano well I mean tourists go to volcanoes all the time bro what kind what are you talking about Hawaii's a fucking volcano yeah but there's a whole documentary on Netflix about that volcano off the island or off New Zealand where them dudes got they were out there on a tour and they all got burned up yeah like why would you want to do that though like that I don't know I mean volcanoes look pretty cool to me no they're hot I know but they look cool you get it you're probably the worst joke person ever do like I'm gonna start taking applications all right if any of you guys are actually funny no man yeah please let me know oh man and I'm gonna talk like dude I get all you guys say who put me on the show and then I watch your shit on the internet and it's like oh steep oh no if you're fucking funny let me know because I'm looking for somebody else dude I can be funny I can I can be funny okay sometimes yeah you know sporadic it's there but yeah no dude I got videos of this shit it's actually pretty crazy yeah there was a there was a massive eruption at Mount Etna forced tourists to flee the volcano on Monday after a plume of high temperature gases ash and rock several kilometers high billowed into the air above the Italian authority says footage posted on social media shows lines long lines of people herring downhill away from the explosion while the owner of one tour company told CNN they had 40 people on the Silicon volcano no that's Sicilian what I say yeah silicon oh so that's the Silicon volcano oh yeah another requirement is you have to be able to fucking read no bullshit you don't say okay so you don't see how I could no I'm fucking Sicilian so I fucking know what that means yes I didn't see the sea silicon the Silicon Valley volcano eruption it was high-tech high-tech volcano it was a conspiracy by the elites to you know it was AI that's right it was AI that still looking valid still looking volcano Italy let's just start over no let's not no let's just keep it going anyways man let's check this clip out this is the volcano at the time of the oh shit eruption holy shit dude yeah I'd be running to oh man yep not one black person in sight look at that all the people they're like fuck I should've done 75 hard I was talking about doing it but I did now look at them bro look how close they okay they're taking pictures bro those those must be the Asians you know I'm saying oh you can't try to not make my jokes funny now just cuz yours aren't but that was laughing anyway yeah that fucking that's pretty scary I'd be I'd be pooping in my pants a little bit on that one I mean that looks like the whole mountains blown up bro that's what I'm saying they they've never seen that uh that video of the Mount St. Helens blown up and washed in holy shit dude no they're saying something's supposed to be a weapon off the erupting off the west coast or something like that in the US I've been seeing some headlines on that but yeah dude they said it was fucking 31 miles high I believe it 31 miles high bro that's in 25 miles almost in the fake outer space right yeah almost to the to the dome yeah almost the firmament yeah bro like I cannot imagine that I mean dude that looks pretty serious that would scare the shit out of me cuz like dude those those plumes you don't know how fast they're going to be hot too it's like super heated gas yeah you know which I I know a little bit about that sometimes but dude all I'm saying is no yeah no I it's enough for me yeah well think of your on it when was the last time interrupted when was the last time 2014 when was last time before that uh was I'll put Pompeo or some shit no that's Mike Pompeo you're thinking of Pompeo there we go yeah same guy he's from there yeah I'll write it what was it Z-shon looking at up yeah before 2014 like think of your on this fucking volcano bro what is it and and and it hasn't erupted for like a hundred years yeah we're fine yeah I'm so big deal man and all of a sudden this thing goes off and you're like you got to be kidding me bro today of all days like yeah man that's not did anybody get hurt no not to not not to the knowledge uh none of the reporting um said anybody was oh so it's pretty regular yeah that's pretty regular um yeah there's one person said just zippy pen follow said quote we were nearly grazed look at this cloud here we were steps away and think goodness we have a responsible guy with us it arrived all at once and I meant smoke immense immense roar yeah yeah it's crazy man yeah well let's get into some more of our eruptions yes you rub verbal eruptions there you go yeah yeah man guys remember if you want to see any of these pitches articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them all linked there with that being said let's get into our first set of headlines hell number one oh man we're going from eruptions to corruption yeah there we go oh shit from eruptions to correct look at that in the paint we got the secret weapon back there hey can you read okay all right we got a contender there I got it I got it you're kind of a black guy back there yeah you guys good you going who's blacker Joe or jeep DJ I say I say whip it out should ask the audience Joe Joe is definitely blacker the fucking I say whip it out we'll find out whip it out we'll find out look at that I came I came to see Joe on that wall bro he's blends right in all right all right let's say whip it out yeah I'm fine one way to be sure um let's get into some of these headlines man uh let's go to DC I like starting there um because I got a very interesting take on some of this judicial shit that's happening uh probably real I I'm not even paying attention really no I'm so focused on what I'm building right now that like when I come in here I'm hearing about the same amount as these guys everybody else for the first time yeah that's cool well that's how most people are hearing it yeah so that's cool um but it it is some weird stuff going on I think some important notes hopefully everybody can take away from this so the the biggest thing that I guess is happening right now with with Trump is all these executive orders are coming down you know he's trying to put all these things in play and then you know it came out originally as you know all these judges are stopping you know I'm saying these rogue judges right and I started thinking about this a little more like you know this headline reads Trump as a Trump admin as goddess to allow it to move forward with plans to slash federal workforce and so like you know these these rogue judges they're calling them right they're all over the place and like if you look up to date I mean even in Trump's first administration um it was anywhere from 64 to even some numbers are or citing it as 104 injunctions legal injunctions that have been put on the Trump administration in the first term now with this second term uh some what we're at like 79 right now when you compare that to other administrations well it's a 17 on there uh 17 nation wide but some sources issue the total it's been a total of 79 yeah okay overall um and so but when you compare that to other administrations um like the Biden administration for example they only had 28 total in the in the total of four years um you compare that to Obama he had 12 and that's including both terms um the Bush administration had six you know I'm saying to us like there's obviously some bullshit going on here right and they well I think that reflects from you know just from my experience I mean I think that those numbers reflect the polarization and separation of parties since that time you know in the year 2000 uh 2001 you know a lot of you guys don't remember but it wasn't like it is now you know you could be friends with a Democrat and a Republican and it wasn't a big deal like no one it's become so polarized now to where everybody thinks they're an activist and everybody thinks they have to stand on something that I mean it just seems like it's trickled down into the you know into the personal biases of the judges which is you know counter intuitive to what the entire judicial system is supposed to stand for so I mean when I look at this and I hear those numbers I mean it goes right in line with the polarization that's been intentionally cultivating in our society you know you've either got to be this or that you've either got to stand for this or that can't have your own opinions otherwise you're riding the fence no shit mother fucker that's what you're supposed to do you're supposed to call it as you see it balls and strikes it's not oh I'm all the way over here and I'm going to agree with everything that Trump says or I'm all the way over there and I'm going to hate him no matter what he does that's not productive for a civil society and people have to come to terms with thinking like that otherwise our republic cannot survive right so when you say those numbers that's all I hear all I hear is okay that that goes along with how this has progressed yeah and and I can see that very clearly somebody who's only been paying attention for the last three or four years you know they may not know that so that's why I wanted to know I mean I think the other piece of it too and what got me thinking on this is like you know most people again we're trying to live our lives man like you know people are working taking care of families right like we don't have time to really get to the nitty gritty of what's really happening behind the scenes but I think it's important to just even understand the legal process how it works you know because again how they're framing it all it's these rogue judges that's not necessarily the truth right and I like and I even like bought into it for a little bit my man fuck like all these fucking judges like they're activists judges right like you buy into that message and like you got to look into it a little bit more than just that right what's happening is one our legal systems completely fuck right it's it's over litigious uh it takes way too long to get shit moving all these court dockets like it's it's cases and cases and cases right so they're you what what's happening is people are using the system that's in play to basically like you know pro long yeah sandbag sandbag any sort of change any type of change right right because the reality also did remember this is how they get paid right longer these go the more lawyers get paid 100% and like and the thing is it's like eventually most of these cases are going to end up at the Supreme Court right because constitutionally legally Trump's not out of line or out of order or any of that shit right you can't just look at the judges you have to look at who's bringing the lawsuits who's actually bringing the lawsuits because the judges don't start the lawsuits by themselves who's bringing the cases to the judges right and most of these injunctions their most most of them are just temporary injunctions meaning the judge has to look at the stuff and like okay is there enough grounds here that I need to hear the full case stop whatever you're doing and let's review the facts that's what happened the problem is that shit takes months sometimes if not years and so it's not necessarily just these rogue judges who is bringing the lawsuits to them right and when you add in though it was an Obama appointed judge or Biden appointed judge yeah that's going to make it you know obviously they're going to side more but temporary injunctions aren't a bad thing necessarily no it's a wait and let's find out and when you overload the judicial system it automatically delays any of these changes taking place and do when you when you start looking into these things you know he had his first injunction literally the day he took office for a second term right on January 20th there's a website we'll link it here but they have all 104 total and even the 79 that just happened this year in this term and you can go on there and look at who's actually bringing these cases to these courts and I highly advise you guys take a second go look through it I mean this is just the first two here it's four pages of this stuff but that's who we really need to be diving into and I highly encourage our listeners to do the same look at who who who is it who who is it I don't know you're supposed to us no that's what I'm saying I mean when you look at like it's unions unions and who are the unions paid for by and they're getting funded by the NGOs the long story which you guys are going to find it's our tax dollars that are going to these lobbyist groups that are going to these unions going to these NGOs being cycled into these lawyers to all prolong the same stuff on our dime yeah so so basically our money is preventing anything from actually getting done for us yeah 100% that's what you guys are going to find look into it for yourself verify it check it out it's sickening man yeah I mean dude look man it's it's disturbing that there's people on either side that would try to stop something from happening that is good for the people of America because they want their interests served first and ultimately that's what we're talking about whether we talk about the left or the right we're talking about corruption in the government which is designed to serve us the people is funded by us the people and it's not that anymore it just doesn't work that way anymore now it's how can we use their money to make their lives harder and this happens on both sides and we have people that are in both of these quote unquote sides which really aren't sides at all it's just a mechanism of the of the same thing it's an illusion to make us believe there are sides we're encouraged not to think freely we're encouraged to buy into the you know this or that mentality we are lied to we are propagated to we are manipulated against each other for what purpose for the purpose of control for the purpose of them having control over us and being able to financially manipulate us oppress us and take away our freedoms without us really noticing that they are taking away our freedoms and we need some motherfuckers out there that are going to stand up and serve the people's interests not just their own interest and it's frustrating yeah it's just frustrating dude because I I can't imagine and it does seem to be on one side okay like when you really look at it it does seem to be the communist left not them not a standard Democrat I don't even think a standard Democrat exists anymore I think those people are now considered what what I would consider a Democrat 20 years ago is now considered a libertarian they're now considered a centrist yeah I don't think over there yeah I don't think there's Democrats the way that we use to think of them and I think a lot of people have fallen into that because in their mind they're saying I'm a Democrat and they fallen into this extreme shit right this extreme left communist shit and um you know those people don't want what's best for the country at all no dude it's obviously like I mean you look at like a state like California for example we cover this when they had the wildfires out there right they're asking federal month like federal the federal government for for more FEMA money and more assistance meanwhile you got government anusum signing 50 million dollars from taxpayer dollars to go to a legal fund to fight Trump you know I'm saying before they even knew what you know I'm saying like it's shit like that man it's like that's sick well look man it's to me it this isn't about Trump or not Trump this is about us in this country not getting what we deserve not having what we were promised not being able to live the life that we were guaranteed and that many of our ancestors and relatives fought and died for and that's very frustrating to me that we don't have more people up there in Washington that truly care about that I'll call him to shut out yeah and and dude you know this isn't this isn't a new thing this is what's happened in every government that's ever existed over the history of time what happens is people get in power they the first group they mean well the second group they mean well the third group they start to say oh well we could take this from them and they won't really notice and that starts the trend and then over a few hundred years we end up in a scenario where you know people are basically oppressed you know surfs or slaves however you want to say it feudal class and they revolt and kill all these people and that's you know that seems to be where we're headed if things don't actually get straight now I mean because dude I don't think people in America are really going to take this very much longer I really don't I think Trump's got a chance to correct some of it and like I've said on the show you know I personally think that he should be going way harder than he is on a lot of these things I can't really figure out why not a lot of people believe that he is quote-unquote part of it you know part of the cabal and he's playing a role I don't know if I buy that but I know this if I was doing what I thought was best for the country I would do whatever the fuck I had to do to fix it I would get all these corrupt people out of the way I wouldn't do it slowly I would do it quickly I would reset the system and I would say this is how it's supposed to be at the end of four years if you don't think it's better you put me on a rope you know I'm saying and that's what I would do yeah man it's it's just crazy man guys jumping on this conversation got to know what you guys think down in the comments and let us know man with that being said let's call crew some of these comments Andy cool you got some you got some interest in ones

weird yeah dude like come on Rambo yeah stop you creating a Rambo went to sneak island yeah stop it fucking liberated the snakes stop it like what do you do yeah yeah you created russia agreed to swap dead and wounded troops but report no progress toward ending the war so they had a talk today representatives of russia and ukraine they both met today this was their second round of direct peace talks in just over two weeks and they made some some agreements but I think they might have been halted because of what they're calling the pearl harbor attack on russia um operation spider web this is what's now circulating around the the interwebs was an attack on russian air bases and nuclear fleet by hiding explosives laden drones and wooden sheds according to officials kev's secret service stashed the attack drones inside the roofs of the sheds which are loaded onto the trucks that were driven to the perimeter of the air bases and then ukraine authorities revealed in a statement shared on social media the roof panels were then lifted off by a remotely activated device so that the one hundred and seventeen drones used in the strikes could fly out and make their devastating attack here is here's a clip allegedly of the attack i'm gonna check this out yeah i mean i don't know but that definitely would not make me want to have some talks i don't know man that's the weird thing it's like they want peace but it's like people keep they keep blowing up shit so it's like i don't know how much peace you're supposed to have like where's the good you know what dude i don't really care yeah like fucking do it kill each other man keep killing each other we should not be in it and you're showing nobody else don't want to pay for these world alliances that that have other people getting involved and all these things and all this shit dude just let them do what they're gonna do and none of my business none of your business i don't give a fuck i'm tired of hearing about it none of our money should be spent for it and that's how i feel i don't care same thing i feel about middle east i don't care i don't fucking care yes i i think it's wrong that people are being indiscriminately killed uh who are totally innocent that happens every day that happens in our own country all the fucking time nobody talks about it okay so it happens everywhere all over the globe so here's my take i care about fucking us that's why i care about i care about us and i'm tired of hearing about all that shit real talk i don't care that little zalinsky that dude has stolen so much money from us he's done so much other bullshit it's embarrassing that we even back them in any way shape or form uh you know putin you know you say you want you crane or whatever you said fucking do it then do it do it like i'm just tired of hearing about it do what you're gonna do fuck that's real man yeah i mean like bro you guys are a bunch of pussy bitches yeah real talk you two putin all your motherfuckers you're all bunch of fucking pussies all you do is talk shit in your act hard you walk run around your fucking motorcades and you send the poor people off to die you're all a bunch of pussies that's how i feel about it dude you don't with it no i'm no like dude if they want to fucking fight then you go fight let's see little fucking dumbass zalinsky out there yeah and you know big bad ass uh putin and z you know like you you would see a different side of them for that would be so sick no you would see a different side of them they would piss their fucking pants like dude i'm just tired of it i think putin putin's got him i would i would fuck well it would be nice to see like if we got to a place just globally we're like world leaders actually have to fight each other huh you know i'm saying yeah like that be sick that's how it should i would love to see that well they be a lot they they would have a totally different opinion about world peace if that were the case just like congress if they had to send their families to the front lines they would vote differently and they would think differently and they would speak differently if Lindsey Graham had against fat little ass over there on the front line he wouldn't be warm on green the way that he does or shan handy or uh live in or any of these guys it's real easy to talk about your shit behind a microphone it's really gotta do that's right it's really easy to say hey you guys go fight that and the name of our country we have to fight yeah and when i say we i mean you by me i mean you yeah you're good like well fuck these guys yeah i'll make sure they got all the tools and resources yeah dude it'd be a totally different thing for another way around and and like it's just it's irritating it's so stupid it's so stupid yeah well speaking of a tax though we did have something that did happen you know that's the that's the that's the paradox of like that level of leadership is that to get to that level of leadership you almost have to be like borderline psychopathic anyway so then they get to that point you know there's been very few leaders in the history of the world that were actually selfless leaders i'm talking on a global scale very few okay and we get these guys who are wired for achievement and who wire and they work their way up the ladder doing whatever they have to do except their intent is not the place that it should be their intent is not to serve it's to be great themselves not realizing that being the greatest would be to actually serve and we don't have leaders like that anymore we don't have global leaders like that we have a bunch of fucking fucks who send young people and poor people and you know they sell them on all this propaganda about how it's super honorable to go do these things and these people get killed for what so for their ego so they can argue back and forth put their asses on the front line are the whole world will calm down in about three fucking seconds magically yeah magic yeah it's crazy man but speaking on the text because they have something to happen here and on on our school just this shit that happened in Colorado uh i didn't see no i saw a little bit of it but i didn't see a whole thing yeah so i saw that at first at first it was being seen as some white dude burned up a bunch of Jews yeah right which ended up not being the case not being the case and then they stopped reporting it yeah yeah so that was what i saw when i first saw it that was what i saw and i was like what and then you know an hour later they're like oh by the way this guy's not supposed to be here right yeah Biden let him in yeah so let's hear the story yeah bolder terror attacks suspect said he wanted to kill all Zionist people use Molotov cocktails this is from the fed so federal officials have charged bolder Colorado terrorist attack suspect Mohammed Sabri Solomon with a hate crime involving actual or perceived race religion or national origin um Solomon was 45 was charged with first degree murder crimes against at risk adults elderly assault criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies and use of explosives or incendiary devices during a felony um so this uh i mean it was a crazy crazy attack that happened to left eight people ages 52 to 88 with injuries including one of critical conditions none of the evictims have died um quote when he threw the Molotov cocktail Solomon yelled free Palestine and the Molotov cocktails ignited in the crowd of people causing burn injuries to eight individuals the federal complaint states the clear liquid in the glass bottles and weed sprayer were determined to be 87 octane gasoline which was determined to contain xylene based on a field test the complaint states um inside a vehicle registered to Solomon thorities found a red material consistent with the red with the racks found in the plaque a black plastic container a red gas container and paperwork with the words Israel Palestine and USAID according to federal authorities um and he did tell the officers that that he wanted to kill all Zionist people in which they were all dead um so yeah so I mean this guy the Solomon guy this is him you guys have seen the video circulating online um he's an immigrant illegal immigrant um stay past his stay Biden let him in um he been trying to claim asylum since like 2005 from what I was able to see well then how to buy the Lenin man if he was 2000 because he was denied in 2005 left came back under Biden okay um when you know Biden was letting him in and right been here overstayed and yeah now he's committing acts of terrorism um yeah I mean I want to be tactfully careful with this but that it's just too weird to be man and the left is I don't think it's weird I think the left is having a really hard time battling this stuff right because you know what I don't think it's weird yeah man makes perfect sense uh here's what doesn't make sense why they try to blame it on white people right away immediately you know why they try to blame it on white supremacy and fucking and extreme alt-right bullshit okay they always do that but yeah um no it makes sense to me I mean look this is what happens to innocent and Jewish people when the leaders of their country indiscriminately target innocent people Arabs and Muslims whether you think it's okay or not there's three billion Muslims across the world there's 14 million Jews I've said this a number of times by doing things like Israel's government is doing not the Jews quote unquote they're putting innocent Jews in danger of retaliation and we have there is a big uprising amongst Jewish people against the Israeli government which they're not talking about at all so they're trying it does seem like they're trying to create a narrative where the anti that it's about you know anti-Semitic terrorism that is happening for no reason okay and when when you have the government of Israel not talking about the people of Israel the government of Israel and some of the people of Israel saying things like what would you do if they if somebody invaded your land and killed a couple of some of your people well I don't know I wouldn't wipe out the entire population I don't think that that's you know the proper way to handle those things I think when I see little babies you know and and and moms holding their heads and their arms and their legs I don't think that those little babies are the ones that did the things to you now you may think that they'll grow up and be that way but that's an assumption and if they do grow up and be that way it's probably because they're being slaughtered the way that they are so it becomes this repetitive cycle over and over and over yeah the exact same thing in fucking Afghanistan and I right yeah for sure bro creating the next generation yes fucking hatred right and the problem with that is I mean you say oh it doesn't make sense no it makes sense because the Muslim community is massive and the Jewish community is small and the Muslim community is pissed off at the Jewish community and they're not discriminating between the leaders of Israel and the Jewish people which is why I think that language of collectivizing all Jewish people together is very dangerous because I'm pretty sure that none of those people deserve to get set on fire you see what I'm saying like we need to start holding the people accountable that are making these decisions not just indiscriminately attacking people that are doing it those people didn't do anything and while I agree that you know maybe that guy has a real reason to be upset taking it out on people who did nothing to you is not the way to handle those things you know if we were really fucking about it we'd handle it by taking the people out that are making the decisions that's the truth if Muslims were really about what was going on they would handle the people at the very top of the food chain and they would have grace for the everyday regular person that may just not be the same skin tone or practice the same religion but then you go on the internet dude and you see like you know you see again you see these very extreme comments you see people saying well fuck all the Jews and this and that which is bullshit and then you see all these people saying that all the Muslims are monsters what the fuck would you do you know those little kids are scum like dude that's not palatable by the average person standards at all and and then you know you get a lot of people on the internet like who I mean dude really honestly just say crazy shit when it comes to this topic not realizing that dude all you're doing is causing more and more hate and division and there's going to be a lot of collateral damage to that and who knows it could be your family too you know like I don't think that it's in anybody's interest to perpetuate the hate the way that it has been perpetuated in my opinion because of things like this like dude you know like fuck I didn't I didn't hurt anybody I didn't do anything but there's all this anti white shit out there so what I get randomly attacked because I'm fucking white like or black or Jewish or this or Muslim like dude you feel in the blank that's not that's not fucking civilized behavior true true true truly civilized behavior is throwing a revolution and holding the people who made decisions accountable and making examples of them that's civilized like real talk yeah that's civilized what's not civilized is slaughtering a bunch of innocent people whether they be whether they be black white Jewish Muslim or anything yeah that's that's not civilized yeah dude it's a crazy situation man it is crazy one thing too that bothers me man is like I mean there's a big uprising in Israel happening right now there's a huge resistance of Jewish people who are fucking all about stopping their government from do they were what they're doing is realizing the danger that their government's putting them in their families in yeah yeah they're the real danger that's true dude it's sometimes I know you were getting at it makes you feel like they're doing it on purpose dude I know all right I know what I was he's like I mean it just it's it just it makes you feel like they're trying to agitate the Muslim community at such a level that there be these attacks become the norm and then they can say look what's happening more justification yeah but dude that's not the Jewish people doing that that's the fucking that's like imagine putting your own people at risk because you want to create a some sort of smoke screen to do whatever it is you want to do to justify your actions yeah bro like well they wouldn't do that well I mean I don't know bro like you look into the details of October 7th bro it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me well I mean there's people that were on the ground that said that that Israel's military was killing his razelies yeah you know I'm saying I do I mean those are there's there's people on the internet now granite could they could be full of shit sure but there's IDF agents that have come out and said undercover that the Hannibal directive was issued which if you want to google the Hannibal directive and read what it is the Hannibal director also directive also translated as Hannibal procedure or Hannibal protocol is the name of a controversial procedure used by Israel defense forces to prevent the capture of Israeli soldiers by enemy forces anyway so yeah dude there's a lot to this man and it all seems to I don't know it just seems like a big mess and and I think there's going to be more and more tax like this on innocent people and I think it's wrong for sure I think it's you know the other piece of it too bro it's like the the real consequences of like actual American rights being stripped here we talk about freedom of speech all the time like they're pushing that shit in there yeah which is the other part yeah but that's only gonna make it worse it's only gonna make it worse so why do they keep doing that that's where the intentional piece comes from me it's like if we can look at something very like in a very common sense very objective way I'm like okay well obviously this is going to lead to more of that then what other explanation can you have outside of it just being fucking intentional that's what they want you know I'm saying it's like it's hard for me to draw it man yeah that's because you know what it's fucking because you know what the truth is the truth absolutely is hey we don't want you to talk about these things because they're actually fucking true okay like the Epstein and the sex ring and the pedophilia and all this shit and you know criticizing Israel as a government is not anti-Semitic just like criticizing the administration that happens to be in charge of the United States at any given time it's not anti-American it's part of America okay so like I this whole idea that you can't criticize Israel's government otherwise your anti-Semite is total bullshit total bullshit okay so you have to be able to separate just like when for most of us when Joe Biden was in office we didn't agree with Joe Biden's actions you know now the Trump's in office there's actions that he we don't agree with okay and anti-American no that's that's actually very American pro-American yes so it's you know but but when it comes to Israel you know you criticize you're a fucking anti-Semitic you're you're you're against an entire racial group of people or religious no yeah not at all what we call shit out about free it doesn't make me anti-French fries that's right you know I'm saying it's like it's weird it's only one we can't talk about it well I know but the more that my point of saying this is is the more that they do this the more it hurts their own cause you know what I'm saying like oh well is you know these guys fund all these different causes about diversity except they don't allow any diversity where they're at none but down with or they're open with migration and you know you're up to tell the you know to you know all states everywhere else diversity is the greatest thing diversity is our strength that's the slogan that they've all coined but diversity is not the strength when we talk about their country right so why is that and that's a fair question that doesn't make you an anti-Semite and anybody who says it does is using it as a defense mechanism because they can't defend their own fucking arguments it's real man that's real man guys it's crazy man but let us stop down in the comments what you guys think man we still got some more to cover so let's let's keep the cruise cruising guys let's head to head line number three thingy yeah it's that time of year bro do you feel it in the air every year you know what happens in June everyone's game I mean everyone's game pro sports go all in for pride month man today yeah we're back here yeah but I thought I thought a lot of the companies didn't a lot of the companies have not okay yeah they they they learn usually everybody changes the logos and shit yeah no we're good but but a lot of the sports teams have most of them it is pride month once again in despite America's recent turn against all things so terribly whoa pro sports leagues teams and athletes have jumped at the chance to celebrate the LGBTQ plus flagship holiday unsurprisingly the WNBA was one of the first to show support for gay recognition with a post to Twitter early on June 1st as the month kicked off why does that say unsurprisingly the WNBA we're drawing some conclusions there yeah I mean you know I got some jokes but I believe in right now I hold them on they get to any secret yeah yeah man yeah they were they weren't they they did it with the they got the you know the WNBA logo of a woman missing a layup she that's a fucking fact yeah all right we'll write that one down for next time woman missing a lay all right yeah so they went I mean like a lot of MLB teams I'm sure they got smoked in the comments didn't they it's pretty bad yeah it's pretty bad it's pretty bad but what better timing you know what better timing because just as this month is kicking off and it does suck dude it's my birthday month man you know I'm saying like I'm mixed like this all right yeah all right anyways what better timing okay so this comes out we got pride month launching right respecting you know you know trans women and and all of that stuff okay and do the like I could not have predicted a better fucking headline for this we have to bring this this this person back remember this person yeah that's the one from the Olympics yeah the Olympic boxer you main Khalif okay well guess what just happened as soon as pride month got launched and he lab leaked lab results offer new evidence about her biological sex let me guess yes she is the father dude hold are we I called it we we called it I I said it no I fucking called it look man there's some I I don't know unless I seen the Wang okay well here's a proof okay newly leak text results suggest that Olympic boxer remain Khalif is a biological male on this more than a year after her why are they still calling her they how does that since it makes sense she's a biological male but then they're still calling her I yeah it doesn't his appearance the Paris 2024 Olympics sparked international backlash main Khalif 26 was found to have x-wide chromosomes according to results from a 2023 test carried out by an accredited Indian doctor three wire sports obtained and published the documents the results of that test led the Russian control boxing authority to expel Khalif from the 2023 women's boxing world championships in India Khalif then came under massive scrutiny during the 2024 Paris Olympics when the Olympic governing body denied claims as she was a biological male and allowed her to compete but now the test results could up in the official story about Khalif quote chromosome analysis reveals male carryotype test results read referring to male chromosomes so the test was conducted by doctor loud path labs a new deli lab with accreditation from the American College of pathologists and certification from international organization for standardization telegraph reported despite that accredited source leaders at Paris Olympics claim the results were quote not legitimately when allowing Khalif to compete suggestion that the Russians had planted misinformation about Khalif that got to get a leg up in the games but yeah that's not the case at all um sh third leg up but dude you really you like doubled down on it man you did that interview well I mean it's just it's this one of those it's just like a hermaphrodite person is this a I don't know all that deals so like this full Wang I'm being serious bro like with someone not having noticed that like in the wands or the swim pool or the I mean I don't know I fuck it I do I don't know what kind of equipment we're talking about yeah I mean but like even like what's the average weight of a penis wait depends on where you're from it's called a sweet low depends on where you're from what's the average weight of it I got my search history is gonna be fucked well I'm just saying I'm not about to search I'm just saying like no one knew this was a dude dude that's my thing I saw like this picture right here this is what this is what confirmed to me I'm like I mean that does look like a man bro bro and listen like he made my mom so so fine yeah so so a man beat a bunch chicks and the fucking Olympics unboxing yeah like that's where we're at 2020 fucking five bro you know I'm saying he knocked her ass out man like that's not okay dude it's not all right it's not no it's not dude and anybody who argues for it is literally insane literally insane bro all right come on man look at those traps come on I mean that's just a level of intensity you just don't see from from most women no you know I'm known a couple women are pretty intense but I mean messy Barbara is fucking Macy Barbara's bad ass bro she's intense but that looks like a fucking wild animal that looks like a dude who's happy I'm a Macy Barbara kick that disaster for sure for sure I don't even know what weight classes dude dude but dude it's a dude it's ass beep another man too well that's why that's why that's why that's always the case dude that they can't compete in their own league that's why they have to go you know I'm saying yeah and then they stand they're all proud and shit dude how yeah I don't know dude like like this is like like this is Paul's comment right here in a picture huh this is Paul's comment Paul runs comment Paul this is this this is this is this is common in the picture oh that's Paul there anyway so so what are they gonna do about it yeah I mean that that's the thing we don't know yet this this just came out this literally just came out and it could not be at worst timing because you know wow you know the worst timing for who for the pride for pride shit man because like they're losing funding left and right dude I I saw I don't remember what team it was but they made a post and I went in the comments and it was fucking slaughter yeah like it was there was I didn't see any comments in support so I don't remember which team it was but she was 145 pounds at the time of the Olympic event yeah cut down from 180 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah man yeah well I mean I you know what I try to give people the benefit of the doubt and I don't know if I don't know because like I that could be both that could be like a real ugly woman yeah or and also ugly dude or just a ugly dude yeah yeah dude I don't know man it's crazy I don't know how these people can stand there and celebrate beating people in sports that they know they're not supposed to compete with like that track athlete from that we covered last weekend nope like how the fuck do you stand next to or you know whatever that swimmer guy was um Michael Thomas or whatever Lee Thomas stand you're standing next to people who deserve to win and you're like standing there like proud like what what is wrong with your brain dude what's really cool to see though I know we covered this a few CTIs ago but like you're starting to see fight backs right like to the college the high school championships happened in California again um and this time uh the the ladies the young women who came in second and third place they refused to even stand on the podium like you know since I went up a second they shouldn't even compete they shouldn't you know but like they refuse to get on the podium with this dude every single person should boycott like the man and the women yeah they should they should be out there there here's a let them get out there and do their little triple jump and they're all by themselves yeah say one all the attention they can have fucking all of it get all of it yeah dude I got me here's this this one is in Washington now so we got a Washington state um this is Washington state high school championship um this uh boy who believes he's a girl he's 17 um Veronica Garcia is the stage name um he won the class two a 400 meter dash by nearly a second um which in that sprint I mean that's a shitson that's a lot um and uh it was his uh first competition as a trans athlete to win us when the state title Seattle Times wrote um here's a clip just a look at the difference between between the two and and Veronica Garcia look she's people in the audience shaking their heads and shit man yeah yeah because nobody agrees with it but nobody will say anything no do it a second but yeah they refuse to stand on the podium with the dude um this is a picture this is who came in second place really first place um she took this selfie posted a Riley Gaines reshare at this but uh she has a sign saying Washington state track and field real girls two a 400 meter champion you know it's stupid man it's not stupid it's disgusting and it's fucking selfish and it's wrong and we've been over backwards to cater our reality to this very small percentage of people who have no problem no remorse no guilt no shame about doing something that is very clearly wrong okay it's disgusting and in my opinion the men and the women should be boycotting sports where any of these people try to compete okay completely they want all the attention and they want to get slapped for and they want to act like they're doing something then let them go out there all by themselves and do their thing and then they can clap for themselves and everybody who wants to you know the crowds won't be there either because nobody wants to see this shit right the only people that want to see it are people that want to pretend to be virtuous and they pretend to be have this bleeding heart and oh it's okay it's no big deal you know a lot like the the last time we showed that mother confronting the other mother one of the uh other mothers the third party moms was like let the kids play let the kids play listen at high school level it's not play it's competition okay and that's part of the fucking problem a lot of these people understand that that is high level competition all right it's not play it's not T-ball it's not soccer when they're free no and men and women do not belong competing together there is very real scientific physical differences in size strength speed explosiveness the amount of muscle ones carry the frame all these things and that it is completely different hormones are completely different if LeBron James went in as an athlete he is and decided to play in the WNBA what would happen they're beginning to triple triple no no he would be hurting these girls right and the only reason they're not getting hurt is because the only athletes that are doing this are the weak male athletes not the strong ones the strong you don't ever see one of these championship quote-unquote trans athletes that dominated some other sport it doesn't happen okay it's only done by weak men because weak men that's their only path to actually being relevant am I wrong oh you're absolutely right do does anybody important this out where are the championship athletes playing with men all I would take is one of these blue chip NFL college athletes uh going to you know fucking Florida or Alabama to go play a women's sport and destroy them for everybody be like oh yeah this is wrong it's probably not good yeah like you know like so where's the line so weak male athletes get to compete with women but the strong ones don't yeah right like what are we talking about here because you imagine Floyd Mayweather didn't in the box that's what I'm saying bro that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying let's take let's take black lesnar and let's put him in the wheat women's class of MMA okay let's take you get it yeah right like let's take Ray Lewis and put him out there playing girl soccer let's take you know you know what I mean the only people that get to do this are the weak men why are we allowing that yeah and and why it's being allowed is because weak men don't want to rock the motherfucking boat they're a bunch of fucking bitches they won't say anything they're say off I say that I'll get canceled so you'd rather let society completely disintegrate because you're on the courage to stand up for what's right our whole entire problem in the in culture right now is the lack of courage amongst people how many people during COVID didn't want to wear the mask but did anyway how many people didn't want to follow the vaccine guy in the lion's and got it anyway and now they're they regret it how many people like dude it's all it takes is for people to have a little bit of courage nothing bad is going to happen to you oh some people are going to get pissed off so what who cares like we that fragile the society where men have lost the ability to stand up for what's right at all like is that one we're at for real is that is that the badass American you know tough guy like we got to rely on law for legislation yeah and then they say shit like oh well you know with shit really cracks off I'll be written or really because you won't even speak up against anything you don't have saying we got all these moms who were like oh well let the kids play let the kids play be quiet okay you don't know what you're advocating for you don't know why they're doing this you don't know any of the implications of what this is supposed to be because you never read a mother fucking history book the saying about women's sports this is about the erasure of culture this is about removing very real basic identities in humankind if you can confuse people and get them argue about what a man and what a woman is which is the most basic reality of human existence it's Adam and Eve if you can get people to argue about that and debate over that and question that what can't you get them to question that is the point of all of this trans shit all right and nobody fucking seems to understand that everybody thinks this is just about poor little Stevie who wants to be Susie who wants to run in with the girls because he wants to wear nail polish and dresses you know and like let's ask ourselves why is the average testosterone of these young men so much lower than it was 20 years ago this is intentional why do they tell grown men not to take testosterone but they'll gladly prescribe testosterone to a 14 year old girl that feels confused about her gender because every time she goes to school and every time she listens to her parents and every time she goes on the internet she's told that just because she's having a hard time well maybe she's a boy well here's the reality adolescents is hard it's confusing your body's changing your mind's changing and having a bunch of people indoctrinating these kids into whatever they think they should be because their fucked up is completely wrong okay and we are failing as a generation of men and women who are supposed to be leading by not standing up for what this actually is and why aren't we standing up because you don't want to get called names on the internet or you don't want your cousin to say something to you at Thanksgiving dude really that's the lack of courage that we're dealing with we can't even stand up for something as basic as that it's not just about these kids being in your sports or being in bathrooms this is about the the erasing of literal American culture which millions of people have sacrificed and died for this is about getting you to accept anything as true it's just it's so frustrating to have people not understand that this isn't just like oh we're being tolerant or we're that's not what this is about yeah this is a this is a legitimate cultural intentional demoralization destabilization of civilization you have to have basic rules of society there has to be men and women there has to be good and bad there has to be independent thought and it's funny because all of those things have been erased in our culture why is that because if we have a culture that stands for nothing and has no pride and doesn't know what right and wrong is it can't determine what a man or woman is that means they're ultimately malleable to anything that the people in charge decide they want to put out it's very fucking simple and it should be obvious to anybody with any common sense to what's going on this isn't about being tolerant this is about protecting civilization for the next hundred years it's common sense bro there's no dicks in the pool you see what I'm saying like fuck no third legs I'm trying bro it gets it gets to be it's frustrating and what's frustrating is as people say things like well what am I supposed to do what do you mean what are you supposed to do you can't get uncomfortable for one second bro you know I'm saying like if the pro sports are going to fucking do this shit you can't not watch them you can't change your buying habits I mean you you can't say I'm not supporting that you can't verbally say at a school board meeting hey that's fucking wrong here's why you can't you what what do we you can't stand up for your fucking family at Thanksgiving when they start talking crazy shit and be like bro you're 100% wrong see this idea of turning the other cheek not rocking the boat that's what's got this here man and the problem is is that every time we defer to not rocking the boat we bring closer to us actual violence all right so fuck dude use your voice because it's never going to get any easier than it is today rock the fucking boat rock the boat man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the commentary and that being said man we got our final segment we have arrived final segment of the show guys thumbs up or dumbest fuckers we're bringing it top again a headline article something like that we rate it give it one of those two options and so with that being said today's thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads shocking moment tourist jumps into terracotta army clay warriors and damages statues before being overpowered by security guards little Chinese little little china action yeah this actually is pretty crazy I'd be scared shitless that I'd like you know fucked up a fucking cursor something I

only by a certain name son launched himself over the guard rails and a protective netting at the museum housing the clay warriors in the city of jane on friday but the man did not stop there once inside the protected enclosure he reportedly began pushing and pulling the priceless statutes resulting in visible damage on to two of the figures museum security quickly intervene and subdued the intruder authorities say son suffers from a mental illness and confirmed that an investigation is currently underway following the incident the pit he leapt into is an eye-watering 18 feet deep raising serious concerns about how he managed to breach safety measures here's the clip it's a piece fucking hurt know that holy shit I'll jump down there you jump down there yeah holy man that's a big jump yeah dude the terracotta army is a breathtaking collection of more than 8,000 life-sized soldiers created 2000 years ago to guard the tomb of china's first emperor kinching hang and as regarded as one of the country's greatest archaeological treasures so yeah so they were found in like 1987 is when they first were discovered life-size statutes and the crazed thing each one has like an individual like no no two are the same that's the craziest thing about I'd be scared chit-lass personally because I feel like I'd break a fucking curse or something man yeah I mean so this guy's got some sort of mental illness they said oh look there's Dave so oh shit that's bad ass dude it's crazy look at those horses yeah the horses are all life-size I mean dude it's crazy what's that just more of a different man yeah it's 8,000 of them and telling that's cool so he he broke a couple of them yeah he broke he broke a few yeah well push them over probably gonna cut his head off he's done I know I got killed I got killed bro hey bro I don't play that shit over there bro I mean we shouldn't hear either we shouldn't but they definitely don't do that shit over yeah I mean all these little idiots glue in their hands to priceless works of art destroying things that people have enjoyed for hundreds if not thousands of years because they can't handle that the world doesn't bend over to their reality this what happens when you stop spanking kids holding them accountable giving them trophies for 70 70th fucking place bro bro what my kids ass I'm just saying man like dude you know there's no there's no repercussions I saw a video of one of these antifa people who was all dressed in black and it was this big fat woman and she ran up to this car where she had a flag and she like jam the flag pole into the window and like started acting all bad tough bro this this was like a very fucking fat woman who was like five five and then there she was five five by five yes 100% and then you know two minutes later they show her in handcuffs and she's crying yeah like dude these people have net like dude I hate to say it this way but it's just the truth these people have never dealt with any violence in their entire life these these kids and they so they go around wielding it with you know no discretion whatsoever and dude that has to stop that has to stop you know you don't see these trained highly trained you know military professionals or jujitsu experts or UFC guys going around starting fucking fights it's only these fat fucking people who have never been exposed any violence whatsoever who are who've been told they're great and been told they're beautiful and been told they're special and been told they get a trophy for waking up and breathing the air who who who are doing the violence and then cry when they get like dude it's insane bro it's insane and we the people have to be able to correct that without going to prison so I don't know when that's gonna happen but dude they don't hold they they don't hold the standard bro they don't hold the standard on both sides those people can do whatever they want they can break whatever they want and I'm not talking about black people I'm talking about these communist thugs these pool noodle wielding like larpers from the park who dress up in black and try to go around and start shit bro if
