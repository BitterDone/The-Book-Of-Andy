I don't want to listen to somebody tell me what I can't it can't say all right So we finance the show ourselves.

Don't be a hell show the show all right. What's that it's going on man? Oh, not much. What's up you yeah, not much man You know, I was just thinking so 20 It's about to be 25 years in business will you right? Because it's like 26 years like Yeah, yeah, right around this time. Yeah, so 26 years ago All right hot low handy. Yeah, running around you like I'm gonna start a business. Yeah, like what what what what what was the jump to like All right, let's do this like what well because I'm sure there was times where it's like okay Like we might have thought about it, but like what made you actually get serious and like all right. We're fucking doing this well First of all, I never was what you would consider a good student Yeah, I wasn't dude. I did I wasn't engaged in school. It wasn't for me The more challenging the class was the better I did Which was very weird because I went through school pretty much being considered not very smart and It wasn't that I wasn't very smart when I learned later was I was smarter than everybody else and the shit was boring and Run me in challenged. Yeah, at all and every time I was challenged I get an A But in everybody every other class I get a D because it was just so fucking boring so I knew that like the traditional life of go out get a job Uh, you know get the white pick offense, you know get married have 2.5 kids like that traditional life Has never really been an interest of mine, you know, and that's a hard thing for people to understand because I feel like most people have that dream That wasn't ever my dream my dream was I want to build something for myself. I want to be an entrepreneur And that was my main, you know Drive since I was a little kid. I mean when I was a little kid dude. I was doing I was selling baseball cards on the top of a fucking igloo cooler You know, I'm saying doing lemonade stands snow cone stands selling shit door to door I always had that entrepreneurial spirit Um, it's just something I always had and um When I got done with high school. I tried to go to college Uh, I went to St. Louis University here in St. Louis for a semester and it was horrible. I fucking hated it and I hated everything about it dude. I hated. I hated Uh, having to go there. I didn't like the way I felt when I walked in the building I felt like I didn't belong there. It just felt wrong and um, I did have one class that I liked which was a uh, higher level political science class that I took that did very well and But that was the only class that I enjoyed And the rest of it just seemed like bullshit. You know, I'm in there learning about things that uh, you know, are very basic that I felt like I already knew And I just didn't want to do it and so Chris and I started talking about you know starting a business together And at first we were starting uh, we wanted to start a tannings salon and We didn't have the money to start a tannings salon because one tanning bed was like 40 grand Okay, so like we don't have any money. We had $12,000 between the two of us and uh So we landed on a nutritional supplement store and that's that was something we had interest in It was something that we were both uh, uh, you know already Learning about and already using in our day-to-day Lives we both were athletes. We both loved to train And we came we came up with supplement superstores. Yeah, and and that's that's where it started dude Oh, actually because I mean do 26 years That's a quarter of a century like that's a long fucking time You know, I'm saying I just think it's cooler like always like just look back every now and then it's like yeah What was the like what was there a specific moment? I guys in that time where it's like okay, shit's getting real like we're actually doing this like what was that What was that moment for you for you and Chris? Was like I shit. We're actually doing this. It wasn't there. Well, I don't think it was like that like that wasn't There once we like said hey, we're gonna do this. We just did it. We just started. Yeah It wasn't like a thing where we overly questioned or we second-gast or you know, and I think that's a big problem for most people I think most people think themselves out of success I think they think themselves out of great relationships with people I think they overanalyze everything looking for the problems that are going to a court that they can't even They can't even fix until it shows up and so they they look down the lane And they're like oh this could happen and this could happen and this could happen and this could happen and this could happen And it paralyzes them into staying in the same spot. They're in and I see that in business I see that in life. I see that really everywhere and that's why I say You know The last few years of what we've been talking about on real AF especially what's been going on in the world I started to come to a conclusion that the reason that most people never build anything is because they lack the courage to go They lack the courage to stand out. They lack the courage to speak up. They lack the courage to go Do something because they're afraid of what might happen if they go and the thing that they don't realize is is that no matter How good you plan no matter how much you analyze no matter how perfect the road map may be to where you're trying to go There's gonna be obstacles and there's gonna be things that come up and so The magic is in the commitment and then the commitment to solve these problems as they come And I think most people just don't get that they want the perfect route They want the perfect plan They want it to be guaranteed and there is no guarantee on this. There's no guarantee on business There's no guarantee on life. There's no guarantee on friendships. There's no guarantee on relationships The only guarantee that you can make to yourself is that if you don't commit to working through the problems as they come You're going to not have anything Whatever the problem. Yeah, right. And that's going to be the guarantee that you're left with You know, you're guaranteed to have nothing yeah, and nothing of value and so you know, I never had that hesitation When I make up my mind that I'm going to do something I do it and and I've always been that way. Yeah, so I don't yeah I don't try to look too far down the road dude because we end up talking ourselves out of the best things You know like what if I had sat there Back in 1999. I said yeah, man. Nobody's going to take a serious somebody might break into the store Uh, we might get sued. What if what if what if yeah, guess what all those things happened Every single one of them you're what if our employees screw us over what if uh, what if somebody steals from us What if this happens? What if that happens? What if this happens and all the shit happens anyway? So like What are you going to do not go and and have all the shit happen anyway? Are you just going to go and deal with it as it comes and so you know success requires courage In any area of life and in the last few years when nobody would speak up because they were afraid It really gave me some insight as to where people are lacking in terms of creating their own You know best version of their life. It's a courage to go. Yeah for sure How do you balance though with the having a bigger vision? So you say you don't want to always think yourself into Being paralyzed But let's say somebody has a big vision and they don't want to over think so how do they balance with what you're saying Just breaking it down to daily tasks, dude You know what I'm saying like I don't Like when I think of what we're trying to do with our companies I don't have to know every detail of how we're going to get there I know that when I show up today I'm going to take the step today And I know when I show up tomorrow I'm going to take another step And I know that if I show up enough days in a row and take enough steps Even though I might not know the exact way to get there We'll figure it out amongst the the nuance of the path you sort of saying be like me and you in the jungle and we're fucking cutting down trees and we're like Well, I think it's this way, you know, and we go down that way and we're like I didn't this way So let's go back over here. It is trial and error. It's just a commitment to the progress You know, so I don't I don't think that overanalyzing is helpful I think it's paralyzing for most people, you know We're always going to find problems and we're always going to find what we're looking for You know, if you look for problems, you're going to find problems If you look for solutions and you look for ways to make it work and you look for ways to make it successful Your those things are going to pop out as well. So you know I think a big vision is the same as a small vision. It just takes more time You know, I love it man. I love it. Well guys, I know you love it. Yeah. I do, man Is it's cool you love it and everybody loves that you love it. Yeah. That's good. That's good Well, I'm glad you guys love it. So That uh, I got three good ones for you man Uh guys any question number one hey Andy What's your opinion on an entrepreneur who after achieving some success in the first five years believe that they have the mightest touch Uh, and and assumes they can easily replicate that success and other Do you think this could risk undermining the original business that brought them success Like you i view Entrepreneurship as a constant uphill battle filled with his challenges and setbacks along the way That require unshakable determinations overcome it just frustrates me when entrepreneurs and their own lookers buy into a false image of what it truly takes to run a profitable Successful business especially during the early stages When the reality is often far from what's betrayed on social media Have you ever questioned the success of your peers knowing the the struggles that you've had to personally endure um To build your own business and the longevity you need it in your marketplace to reach your goals and should entrepreneurs Revisit the myth of Icarus during periods of success to remind themselves of the importance of humility Please advise yeah 100 percent. I love that question. That's a fucking great question You guys want to ask questions on the show ask questions like that. That's a great philosophical question about the mental state that you have to have when you're pursuing your dream And it's very easy when you start to have some success to believe that it's you and I think that it's you and it's not you What it is actually is a past version of you that took all the steps necessary to create the present success So it's not even the present you that's created the success It's who you were the last 60 days the last six months the last year that's created the present success So the first thing that you have to realize is that you today didn't even create what the fuck you are living That's the past you so like when you do a little cheers that and you're out with your buddies Cheers your past self for being tough enough to fucking persevere to create where you are Secondly, you need to realize that if you don't continue to move in that direction You're going to lose all right, and this is where ego comes in and humble comes in Okay, humble is not about the car you drive or the house you live in humble is about recognizing when you're getting a little bit too much belief in yourself And you're not realizing that you are the product of the actions that you've taken and that's something that people struggle with especially when they first have success You mentioned the Icarus you know story you guys don't know the Icarus story He flew too high to the sun. He got too cocky the sun melted the wax to hold his wings together. He died All right So that's a metaphor for what happens to us in in life in relationships and success We start taking things for granted. We think that we are the reason for everything good around when in reality We are not the reason we are the product of actions. Okay, and so When you think about how to apply this concept You mentioned the Midas touch for those of you that don't understand what he was saying I use this analogy of the Midas touch with young entrepreneurs, okay, and there's this thing called the Dunning Kruger effect And basically what the Dunning Kruger effect says is that someone who starts out and has moderate success instantly They have an inflated sense of what they actually know they think that they are the shit They think that the reason they're winning is because they are the shit and nobody else is the shit It's them, okay, and what I don't think that's right and what happens is is they find out real soon that that's not actually the case Okay, the actual case is you did some basic things that produced a little bit of success and you have a Lifetime of learning to still go through and so what happens is and usually How this happens is someone has some success and then they lose it and then they come back down the Dunning Kruger curve and end up at the bottom And now you're in a position of humility now you're saying All right, what did I do to fuck up? How could I get back to going and it almost takes that desperation of losing to that level To create the Hummelness needed to recognize that you need to go back to the basics of what you did to get to the place in in the first place so These are all real things and yes people struggle with them the Midas touch is where people who have a little bit of success Start to believe that they can do anything. Let's say you are You know You're a contractor that does concrete and you're a fucking doing concrete your whole life And you've built this amazing concrete business and it's making you know seven figures a year personally you're doing really well with it um That person will then think well I can open a snow cone stand Okay, something that's completely unrelated to what they do and I can make it work because I made this work And that's not the case That's like saying because I play the oboe at professional level then I can go play the saxophone the exact same way And that's they're two different things and people don't understand that every business has its own knowledge base It's own skill set that you need to have now are there people that know the structure of companies and how to find people and put them in the right spots Yes, I can do that. I've been doing that for a long time But that's not me having the expertise That's me having the resources to hire the people with the expertise put them into play and get them to run Okay, so it's possible to do but it's not good for an inexperienced entrepreneur with little resources because it can like mention in the email And undermine the entire original business which then cuts off your cash flow which makes you broke all right So it's very important to understand you Are where you're at because of actions that your past self took and if you don't continue To improve that skill set and take those actions at a bigger and higher level you will not grow as an entrepreneur your business will not grow And if you don't do that and instead you'd say well I'm going to go open the snow cone stand when really I'm an expert and concrete Now you have a real problem because you're going to go fuck something up may not be the snow cone stand Maybe the thing after that like you're end up you're going to end up cutting off your initial You know income stream that's allowing you to have these options because you're Misunderstanding your own skill set and how to apply it So it's very important that we recognize that Just because we're good at one business doesn't mean we're going to be good at another business And if you get to a point where you can invest in other businesses and you're very successful You never want to sacrifice your main Horses for these other businesses you see what I'm saying right, I mean, I think there's I mean obviously this is a very in-depth topic That's covered in we could talk about this 50 fucking different hours. Yeah And our tastes are great resource for people who are sure but Just quit the new MSCO project bro. Yeah, that's gonna be fucking awesome. It'll be fine. I can't fucking wait I can't wait to get back to talking about how to win all the time like that what I've learned is that's what I love to talk about I love it was necessary man. Yeah, it's necessary But I do want to ask you this question because by the way, we're not quitting CTI a lot of people are like oh don't stop CTI No, it's two different things guys. We got what's going on in the world? Comedy fuck around have fun and then we got how to win so that we can fix the culture here in this country. Yeah Um now I'm not an entrepreneur right like I've always I would follow in the category of everybody else right and I think you know Outside looking in there's always been this idea of and you've heard I know you've heard it man like oh You got to diversify yourself have the seven different you know things You know, yeah right average out the average millionaire has seven different income streams right right okay? 2020-22 was 2020 this is what we're gonna see for the next month 2022 was the rebuild 2023 was the uh the reconstruction 2024 was the trial at 2025 is game time That's what we're gonna see for the next fucking 30 days Uh Post-nut shit every fucking year too. Yeah, how many fucking practice years do you need mother fucker? You need another one trial three point yeah, yeah, right out of here Uh, but I do want to ask you this I mean because we started off this show talking about you know 26 years in business and started making feel old bro. It's a good thing. I don't look old. Yeah, you don't you look 26 Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I got you bro. I got you see that See that but I do want to add you just got some value around I I want to ask you because we started about talking about you know that first business of yours right like and you started at a 99 At what point did the second I guess the second opening come where you were like okay? Well like we did we're doing this really really well Now we're gonna advance and there was it like a straight. This is a great question or this is great. So There is exceptions to what I just said about starting businesses And one of them is verticals within your business okay, so like let's say you're making motorcycles And you're working on motorcycles all day long and you got this and then all of a sudden you make some exhaust Right because it goes together yeah, right and so that's that's what we did we had retail supplements Retail nutrition vitamins all those things and then we worked you know we sat there for 10 years being like Well, these guys are doing this wrong these guys are doing that wrong But we didn't have the money to do it, you know, and so we Chris and I sat there for years being like well If we ever get the opportunity to do it here's what we would do And then when the opportunity presented itself because we had talked about it for so long We had a really good idea of how we were gonna do it and we just fucking went for it You know and and I'd be honest That was a very difficult situation to get off the ground it but it was a big It was a vertical in our system that we felt comfortable that we knew and understood because of our experience and retail And when we first started everybody was like oh, that's never gonna fucking work well here we are mother fuckers so If you know what you know and you know how to You know these vertical aspects that fit into your core competency Those are businesses that you would really want to look at trying to open right instead of being a concrete guy Want to open a fucking snow cone stand you might want to open your own concrete tool line you see what i'm saying right or or something accessory mix yeah something That's in line with what you already know right so and then you're fucking leveraging your own customer base You know what i'm saying? Yeah, so like you don't have to go out and find a hole The customers that want snow cones and the customers that want to concrete fucking walkways two different things right But if you could figure out a way to vertical those in you don't have to go out and replicate a whole new customer base Okay, yeah, I mean that was the question because I feel like that comes up a lot. Yeah, it's just vertical integration of your business like dude That's that's Virk you know people argue against it and they'll say well it doesn't make sense just use this drop shipper and this and do this and contract this out Yeah, I mean you could do it that way, but I could tell you this your company makes a lot more fucking money when you do it The right way the slow way and the vertical way yeah, it's just way more profitable. Yeah, I mean it makes sense to me man I love it man guys Andy question number two. Let's keep this cruise. Oh Let's keep this show moving. Well, I almost say keep the cruise moving. That's all right guys Andy question number two. I have a question I'm a business owner in the automotive performance world I've been doing it for myself since 2015. I do a lot of restomod GM vehicles as well as late model performance stock to 2000 horsepower. I am the only employee Through though every once in a while I have put some part time help in it seems hard to find good help in South Florida Employees are good for a few months didn't get lazy and forget things And I feel I treat them good with bonuses. I really pay competitive all that I get stuff um, I have only ever drenched of working on these cars um like 69 Camaro, Chevelle, Smoking in the Bandit Trans Am Even as far as celebrities like Marquis and Mike Pounsy Rick Ross I currently have one of his cars in my shop I'm a very wealthy people. I am six months shy of 40 years old And feel as I get more recognition from my line of work. I get more stress Customers wanting work to their cars. They want them quick people showing up for quotes etc Question is how do I manage to handle all this recognition and the workload flooding in? I would appreciate any insight to this question I mean real talk bro. It sounds like you're Kind of bitching about something that could be a lot worse You know, why don't you remember all the times when nobody gave a fuck who you were and nobody knew who you were And nobody wanted to do the fucking work or have you do any work on it? Okay, you're in a good spot and you're kind of spitting the gift horse mouth You know what I'm saying like fuck dude This bro, huh you wanted it. Yeah, so let's talk about instead of complaining and saying oh man I don't know what to do. Let's talk about how great this is for you Okay, you've built a brand you've built an in-demand personal brand people are starting to know who you are You're getting some celebrity clientele which I know enough about the car business, which is super helpful Okay, so how are you gonna leverage that and that's what you need to be thinking How am I gonna leverage that how am I gonna scale that you know, you said I'm the only employee Well, what if you had 20 employees could pop out a fucking car a week or car every two weeks How much money could you make right and by the way would you be happy doing it or would you be happy doing it yourself One of my I'm one of my buddies who's one of the most famous fucking Craftsman in the world he prefers to work by himself and so everything he makes is super expensive because he does it on his own All right, so there's multiple places you can go here You can raise your price and do all the work yourself. You can work to scale out a team Take on more work make more profit It depends on how you want to do it, but I want to go back to something that you said You know, you said most of these employees are lazy or don't you know, they forget shit after a week or whatever Dude that is you not leading them Like that's you not leading them like I guess It's not the fucking employees fault that they're fucking not productive, bro. It's your fault You hire them in that is your responsibility Of course they have to meet you halfway and they got to do their part And most people want to do their part and if they don't want to do their part you either hire the wrong people or And this is more likely you're not painting the proper vision Then makes them believe that they can have a future working for you who the fuck wants to show up and get paid 15 bucks an hour to get grease on their fucking hands or whatever you're paying them and go home and not have any fucking Future like imagine how hard that is imagine how hard it is to get up every single day And work for a company that We have no idea where it's going We have no idea if I'm going to have an opportunity here like all the people that you are bringing in They're coming in and they're like this is great for now But I got to find something else and the reason they're feeling that way is because you're not leading them You're not saying hey we're going to become the biggest custom car Builder in the world or whatever it is you want to do right? But these guys and their fucking lives and their dreams you're asking them to trade A major thing which is their life and their dream and their and so you have to figure out how to get that Inside of your dream and because you know you're you're a mechanic or you know built I don't want to you know you're a car builder You're not your leadership skills. That's a different skill set. That's like that's like saying You know like I said playing the saxophone or playing the oh it's different thing And so you need to learn leadership skills and understand how to paint your vision which should look like this Hey, bro come work for me. We're gonna fucking do this and this and this we're gonna get Rick Ross's out there We're gonna get my pound sees car out there. We're gonna you know We're gonna show all these people the cool shit that we do and we're gonna build this awesome brand change the car culture Like bro car culture is one of the easiest cultures to work with everybody's cool everybody's friendly it's just My point is you have to build a vision for these people that they see a part in or you're going to be You know running through employees forever and then by the way you have to mean it It can't be lip service because the only thing worse than not having a vision is lying to your people and saying the vision is this Because once they figure that out they fucking all gonna leave it in your fuck yeah So it's like you said in the beginning by like most people have that vision of like okay I want the family. I want the right defense and so you got a fucking having an environment. How can they do that? Yeah? How can you how can you have a family On a home Have the American dream inside of your system. How can your people do that? And if you can't tell them how to do that then you're gonna have a problem keeping people long term. Yeah I love that man. I want to ask you this though because you know we I know obviously we met I met a few people you know through you because of you right that And I don't know if this is the right term. I guess you would use but they've learned how to I guess finesse the supply and demand aspect Of the solar entrepreneur right like you got guys like your tattoo artist right like that's a one-man show And his demand is very fucking high because he it's only one guy you know I'm saying like he's tattooing you by himself So like I mean maybe leadership is not his best thing. He wants to keep it solo How do you I guess how do you leverage how do you finesse that supply and demand well? That's gonna be that's gonna be an aspect of you know if you only have so much time And it's gonna be a one-man show or two-man show then your price gonna have to go up. Yeah, you know And that's just reality but the work has to Fucking it's price. Oh, yeah, yeah, you're not gonna charge big price for mediocre work. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I love it, man I love it guys Andy. Let's get to our third and final question guys question number three Hey Andy, I am 23 years old. I've been watching your show for two months It has been helping me in so many ways. I want to ask you about the time management When we focus on our goals we have to put so many hours into it and it affects our social lives Sometimes who are family and the closest friends I feel regret about not giving enough time to them But I know if I don't put enough time into my work Then I would not be happy and achieve what I want where it would take more time to reach there I don't want a delay in that. How do I balance those things you can't You can't look at balance and think that it's appropriate for building a company. It's the hardest thing in the world Building a company Becoming an entrepreneur has been glorified to the point where people think they can do it and have everything else too It's fucking impossible because it's too competitive all right, so your idea of balance as Everybody else has balance is not appropriate to you being an entrepreneur and having balance, okay? It's two different things you're out here in the world and you're seeing all these memes and all these Instagram therapy fucking bullshit Things that are written and you're thinking they apply to you. They don't fucking apply to the entrepreneur That's a different life, okay? And you will not have balance at least for the first fucking five to ten years You're not gonna have balance you're gonna have to put it in but here's the good news In 10 15 years when you put in all that you're gonna be the guy that could take care of everybody You could solve everybody's problems you can make their life more comfortable And they're gonna be very thankful for you and yeah You might lose some friends and you might distance some relationship but the net positive out of it outweighs that All right, but you guys have to understand all this shit that you read online all these memes about balance all these things about you know That the average person is reading is like yeah, they're not written for entrepreneurs, okay? They're not it takes more it takes it's harder it takes Way longer and the reward is way bigger, okay? It takes a lot more risk Usually when things take more risk and they're harder and they take longer There's a bigger payoff and that's what the fuck entrepreneurs ships about so you are Investing your time today into an outcome that will produce results It's not a sacrifice people say oh, it's a sacrifice because I'm sacrificing my time with this With my friends no, you're making an investment in your future self that is going to be exponentially worth it As opposed to you being in the same financial position that you're in now 10 years from now All right, so you have to look at this the right way and you have to stop looking at all this touchy Thiele therapy fucking bullshit That's on the internet because it'll make you feel as an entrepreneur that you're totally fucking up And it's just the way it is as an entrepreneur. It's it's a it's you have to be selfish first to be selfless Later and that's the reality of being an entrepreneur. You're gonna carry the water You're gonna carry the weight you're gonna put the shit on your back and fucking drag it down the road But then later everybody's gonna be happy you did it because everybody's gonna benefit from it. So We can't look at all of this shit out there You know, we have this victim culture mentality still that has been propagated for the last decade all over social media and quite honestly You know 90 fucking five percent of the therapy industry is predatory towards this culture They want people to feel like victims so that they have to quote unquote heal for the rest of their lives Winter they healed when do they actually become a normal person again? They don't because they want to capture these people and get them in a mentality that there's always something Fucked up around them because that equals money to them. Okay, there's very few quote unquote therapists that actually cure people Why is that oh because it's counterintuitive to their income stream and that's the reality people don't like that but On top of all of that on top of you know victim culture and taking advantage of it Which by the way if you've convinced someone that there's something wrong with them and then you make them pay you to fucking fix it You're a piece of shit. Yeah, okay And I don't give a fuck class. I don't give a fuck how many fucking letters you have behind your name. Yeah, all right I say but the truth 100% yeah 100 imagine they could someone's telling someone they're fucked up So they could pay you and then trying to keep them in that zone that they're fucked up. All right, that'd be a hundred bucks That's what I'm saying. Yeah, like bro, it's fucking bullshit. That is okay And because we have that in society We have a lot of the entrepreneurs a lot of the achievers a lot of the people who are driven Which are some of the most important people in the world and in fact they're probably the most important Because they provide all of the goods and services that create civilized society. All right So when we shame them about going out and building things and we make them feel bad about becoming successful And we make them feel fucked up for being entrepreneurs the rest of society suffers Because some of the greatest fucking ideas and the greatest inventions and the greatest solutions and the greatest cures Die on the vine because of the shame culture puts on people to have ambitions and goals All right, and so this is a big problem because what we're actually doing is we're silencing and removing some of the best ideas for a civilized society Because we're telling motherfuckers. They're morally out of line for wanting to achieve it. All right So we have to get in line here and understand that when you read all this shit on the internet about you know Having zero anxiety and zero stress and all this fucking shit That is made for someone who is not trying to build something incredible They are not wanting more. They are not trying to become wealthy They are not trying to create jobs or solutions or cures the things These are just people going through life and the truth of the matter is is the reason they have so much fucking anxiety Is because they're not fucking doing anything with their life? All right So we have to understand and by the way, I'm going to say another thing that everybody needs to to understand about this When you look for an anxiety free day and you look for a stress free day And you constantly look for that What ends up happening is because you can't get through a single day without anxiety And you can't get through a single day without these feelings of stress It's impossible because it's called life. All right, what ends up happening is the little moments of anxiety that do pop up in your day Become hugely amplified and become a problem because you're expecting there to be none So if you're expecting there to be none and then some shows up What's your response? Fuck dude. I can't get through a single day without being stressed I can't get through a single day without feeling anxiety Well, no shit because that's called life and you read all this bullshit on the internet that isn't true Thinking that you can eliminate these things when in reality you can't so if you can't eliminate them And you're trying to focus on having a free day without this shit or a life without this shit You're going to constantly be irritated and disappointed and frustrated because it's impossible Okay, so we have to understand number one Most of the therapy shit is garbage Number two, you're not fucked up for wanting to achieve things number three It we need people like you we need people to go out and win We need people to go out and drive cool cars We need people to show people what it looks like to be successful We need cures. We need products. We need companies. We need jobs All of these things are needed So just because some fucking pussy on the internet is writing this shit that makes you feel touchy and feeling shit Doesn't mean it's for you Okay, so we have to discern what information is for entrepreneurs and success driven ambitious people And what information is for everybody else that's not going to do a fucking thing Okay, and we didn't know the difference is Michael Jordan going to read that and say oh, yeah, you know what I need to back off my competitiveness because it's unbalanced You know that's not It doesn't go together dude and because we're inundated with all of this shit and it's popular We end up in this scenario where we think there's something really wrong with us When in reality bro the world needs what the fuck we have the world needs what we have in our heart It needs that fucking drive it needs that ambition it needs that competitive attitude It needs someone to drive the mother fucking Bugatti's bro if you don't drive him who the fuck's gonna drive him You know what I'm saying like fuck dude Like nice. Yeah, I'm just saying like dude you Somebody's got to win it might as well be you I love that man dude. It's so crazy because I was thinking about this too while you were talking about that They label these things so easily and make it seem like it's the catch right like the thing that I think what happened in the last year or two years Maybe uh is the fucking Hashtag FOMO right like the fear of missing out shit, you know, I'm like I've never understood that like you're missing out on what though The same shit you seen a hundred times you know I'm saying like that that's never Man you gotta understand there there is multiple levels to this game. Okay. There's people who Who want to be an entrepreneur, but can't really like jump Those people usually end up being franchise owners and they end up being great ones Okay, they're not able to create the entire concept But they're able to run one if you give it to them, right? Okay, then you have people who Create their own shit, all right. These are like true builder creator entrepreneurs. They come up with an idea The idea comes to fruition in real life And then we have people who think completely outside the boundaries of reality Elon Musk I want to go to space, right? You know you know, you know, I'm saying right I want to transmit Electricity through the air Nikola Tesla, right like There's levels to the thinking and You have to understand and be self-aware enough as to what category you fit in Because if you Put yourself in the wrong category From an authentic aspect you're gonna be miserable All right, like I know which one I am. I'm the middle guy there I'm not the fucking guy who says let's go to space, right? Yeah, no, no, no I just I want to build businesses and companies and I want to do things that are innovative, but that's a different level of thinking, right? I I'm also not the guy that needs someone to lay it out for me I can fucking come up with an idea and make it work You see what I'm saying? So we got to know where we lie in all these things And maybe you're not even the fucking franchise entrepreneur. Maybe you're a very strong entrepreneur That doesn't want to wear the stress of the company 24 hours a day that doesn't want to be on their phone till a fucking midnight every night Like I still am 26 years in Okay, it's a different fucking life and it's not for everybody And if it's not for you and you try to do it. It's gonna crush your soul, bro So we got to be authentic with where we are what fits us What's gonna make us happy like that guy with the car shop that guy might be happy building one or two cars a year himself Yeah, right, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's right and that's okay, dude Like I'm not gonna be on here and say Everybody's the same and everybody has to go out and try be a fucking billionaire. That's that one I'm saying we got to find the The right area that we are fulfilled in that we can pay for our lives in and then after that It's it's gravy, right? Yeah, man. I fucking love it man guys. I need to have a way to start a Monday, man Yeah, all right guys. Let's go out. Let's kick some ass this week. We'll see them on the CTI
