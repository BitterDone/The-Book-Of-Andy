What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate of Out of the World. We have Andy and DJ crews the mother fucking in and that's what we're going to do. That's what CTI stands for. Crews the internet if you're a little slow. We're going to talk about current events news, the funny stuff going on in the world. We're going to speculate on what's true, what's not true. And then we're going to talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world. Now, if you're unfamiliar with the show, we have many different formats. We have Q and A F. That's where you submit the questions. We give you the answers. That's usually on Monday. Sometimes we throw them in the middle of a week because submit your questions a couple of different ways. The first way is guys email these questions into ask Andy at Andy for salad.com or you go on YouTube in the right underneath the video and click the link and you can actually be on the show and talk to us and answer your questions live. Sometimes we're going to have real talk, real talks five, twenty minutes and we give you some real talk and then we have 75 hard versus that is where people come on the show who have completed the 75 hard program who have taken their life from a dumpster fire to, you know, a non dumpster fire using the 75 hard program. You're unfamiliar with 75 hard. It is the initial phase of the live hard program, which is the world's most famous mental transformation program ever. And it's free. And you get it at episode two zero eight on the audio feed. Again, that's two zero eight on the audio feed. If you go to Andy for salad.com, there is a book called the book on mental toughness. You can get that book there. It has the entire live hard program in it plus a whole bunch of extra stuff that has to do with mental toughness. Why it's important how to use it to become the best version of you. Now I think that's it, right? Yeah. We do this little thing here on the show. We ask you guys to help us grow the show. So if the show makes you think, if it makes your laugh, it gives you a new perspective. Please do us a salad and help us grow the show. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. Yeah. Of course. What's up? What's going on, man? Nothing. I'm not a whole lot. You know, just want to remind the people out there listening and watching. We do have a new little feature of the show. We got a little chat going. If you guys want to get in that, check the description of this video right now or you guys can sign up on the link there and potentially get the opportunity to come behind the scenes. Yeah. With Andy and I. Yeah. In the dressing room. Under the sheets. That's right. Who keeps texting? Oh, they want to sell me a high lux. Oh, that's it. Yeah, man. What's going on with you, though? Nothing. I'm over here shabbing for Toyota high luxus. Now you get to put my missile system in the back. You know, is there like a particular year you're looking for? No, the more terrorists, the better. You know what I'm saying? I'm just saying. That's what I want. I want something that scares people. I want something that you see driving on rope. People like, oh, that's just a regular. Oh, shit. Yeah. Fuck. Oh, no, no, no, no. As if I don't have enough useless toys. Yeah, that's fine. It's fine. Man, those, yeah. I'm down. Where'd be drinking? You got, oh, man, freedom. We don't run ads on the show, but if we did, it would definitely be for this amazing form energy, especially the screaming freedom. That's what happens every time you drink on a bald eagle, it's hatched. That's a fact. You know what happens when you drink the grape wine? Just ask Gavin Newsom. What? Your bike gets stolen. Anyway, so I can see you're not in the mood to steal shit today. You're in a blue-rass mood. Nope, I am trying to raise credit scores. No. Blue-rass means you're going to sit in your basement and play video games. Oh, I don't want that one. I mean, that's not bad, but I don't want it. That's what I mean. Screaming freedom is, it's, what's the orange one? Orange one. I don't know. You have to ask Dana. That's Dana's drink. He likes the orange. Orange feels like holes in drywall. Oh, away. It's just got to be green, bro. Green. It's like the Hulk. OK, I see. Turns you green. You're not going to like me when I'm angry. That's right. You're going to like me when I drink Kyle's energy drink. We should just, listen, we should just fucking make one. It's like the green one. We should just call it Kyle. Kyle. That's good branding right there. Dude, that's good brand. I'll bring it that straight to the board, baby. So that's like, I made it. Oh, oh, yeah. Well, maybe that's why Dana likes it so much. Well, so, yeah. Buck, he just signed a seven billion dollar deal. One of the biggest media feels ever. Yeah. Now he's doing all right. I mean, he's doing better now. All right. He's the best modern entrepreneur ever. History. Anyway, but no, it's funny. So, so like, I mean, if you guys don't know, Andy does not get the topics ahead of time. And it's so interesting. We just, you know, people think I do. I think something, I don't think, I just don't think they know. Oh, yeah. Like they don't know. Like you literally come in, you sit down and we roll. And I have all the secrets behind this computer that I'm still figuring out. I wanted to just give a shout out. Somebody left me these or sent me these. And I'm not sure exactly who. Oh, no, we met him. We did? Yeah. In the gym, remember? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they throw over. Yeah. That's right. I didn't know he's a Louisiana guard. Yeah, he's from Louisiana. Oh, okay. Yeah, he's from and yeah, born of it. Yeah, F-15. All right, cool. Now I do remember. Yeah. All right, well, I'm gonna give a shout out. Appreciate you boys. Buy you a militia, but yeah. But no, just on this topic of branding, okay? Because this is important. And you're an entrepreneur, bro. You've started and ran multiple companies outside of your... No, dude, I just post on Instagram, pretend to be. That's right. That's right. So, of course, we've had in the show before a few times where you got, you know, you give your two cents on companies that do some rebranding with logos and direction. And a company has done that. And I'd like you to chime in with your thoughts. MSNBC, okay? MSNBC unveils clunky new name after splitting from NBC News. And it is dumping the iconic peacock logo as well. So the same people that brought you the super-rude driver, Rachel Maddo, or, you know, Jens Saki, you know, the Joy-Read, right? The white guy that looks like Dilbert a little bit. A little bit. Magic Johnson's gay son. That is. No, but they do look alike. No, no. Holy shit. Don't they look alike? They do look alike. Well, right, right. But I mean, you guys kind of, you know what I'm saying? Andy, two fucks. No, that's enough. All right. That's fucked up, man. Dude, they do look alike. Oh, man. Oh, man. Yeah. But I'm sorry for that, dude, bro. Magic Johnson. He got his wife. Oh, man. Oh, dude, magic must have some dark secrets, bro. Oh, fuck, dude. That's bad, man. Well, he's got a yacht. He got hit twice, you know what I'm saying? He's got a yacht. Would you rather have a 250 foot yacht and a transgender son in AIDS? Hold on. In AIDS? Or no yacht? It'd be worth a billion fucking dollars. Oh, it's a listen, bro. Listen, you got to have AIDS and a gay son. God says this. But you want to have a gay? Here's the deal. I got a deal for you. You get to choose, OK? You get to be worth a billion dollars. You get to have a yacht. You get to own the dodgers. But your son is a seven foot tall transgender. And you get AIDS. What are you picking? All right. How long do I have to think about this right now? I already know what you're picking. I know what you're picking. Oh, man, I'm fine. You're picking the AIDS. Yeah, bro. Yeah. You live forever with AIDS. Give me the AIDS, man. Bill, you have to be a good age, man. Fuck. All right. I'll send them to a mirror. I think they do look a little creepy. They do look who is that? This lady? Yeah. That's something saying to us. I forget his name. She on their name. She a media person? Yeah, she's one of the hosts on the list. She must have said, I don't ever see her. Well, that's the funny thing. They're all gone for the most part just about damn near. I love how they try to portray these women as attractive. Oh, bro. They try to like, you know what I'm saying? Dude, come on, dude. These people are the same. This is like the Avengers of Ugly, you know what I'm saying? This is like the ugly, you heard a fucking tower. It's dangerous. The Fantastic Four. Yeah. Final Four. Yes. Oh, man. Well, come on, dude. Come on, man. Oh, come on, dude. Come on, dude. Come on, dude. Come on, dude. That's why they're so mad, bro. Nobody has sex with them. Hey, everybody. Oh, man. Come on, man. That dude's definitely not having sex. No. Mm-hmm. And his wife, like the host, the co-host, or some shit, that's... Yeah. They're in it. They're in it. You know that little chair? You know when you walk into a hotel room. You hear the cook chair? And there's that chair. That's his chair. Oh, no, no. You can sit on the bed. That's right. Why is there only one chair next to the bed? It's for him. That's right. That's right. Yeah. But yeah, so they've done some rebranding MSNBC has with the CEO Mark Lazarus. I can't imagine why they would have to do rebranding. I feel like, well, how that rebranded for Jaguar go whenever we talked about that a couple years ago. I remember I said, yeah, they were going to zero. They went down 97%. I was very close. They're paying people to talk. I was actually closer than I thought. I said zero being sarcastic. They went to 97%. Dude. It's pretty bad. Well, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. People are not with it. They were never with it. They were just too polite to say anything. Yeah. Well, so the CEO, Mark Lazarus, he said, quote, while the name will be different, the brand's commitment to its audience will not change, which means fear not. We're going to still be terrible. Exactly. Yeah. So this is an effective rebrand would say would be like this. Yo, we fucked up. We know we lie. Yeah. Anyway, we're not. Hey, we look new, but it's going to be the same. Same shit. That's very stupid. Anyway, let's go. Let's just turn it over. Let's see what they did here. You see this marketing genius. Yeah. So this is OG logo. Uh huh. Okay. Yeah, I hate that one. This is it. Oh, God. That's worse. Yeah. That looks like. That looks like some sort of Medicare insurance logo. You get a bill in the mail and it has that logo. You know, you throw that shit in the trash. I'll give a fuck with it. It does my credit. You know what I'm talking about. I knew you don't need it. Dude, that looks like some dental insurance. Shit. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. Look at that line up. How do you even assemble one like that? Hey. Hey, Jen Saki. We're going to need a referral. Find the fucking ten ugliest people that you know. Let's put them on TV. Okay. We got to go through superpowers here. Okay. This is like the, this is the superpower. All right. Yeah. Look at that cultural appropriation of joy. Read. Yeah. The same. All right. It's fine if they do it. All right. We're going to start. We're going to start off before I do it. I need you to tell me the superpowers. Hers is eating long john donuts. Okay. Before it's quietly in public. Yeah, but also sharks. Yeah. They're sharks. Yes. Okay. Her. She's the meanest. Mm. Yeah. They got to have, they got it. That's like a leader of the brunchers. Yeah. I. You symbols the brunch. I'll let you pick that. Yeah. That's the pervert of the group. Yeah. That's the dude that tries to hit on all the chicks. Even though they're ugly. Yep. Don't care. This guy here. I don't know. He's somebody's dad. I don't know who. Yeah. He's got, he's like 11 people's dad. Yeah. Clearly. This guy is just happy to be here. Yeah. That guy. Yeah. He's, I don't even know who that is. Yeah. I never seen him before. Me. He's the victoria secret for no reason. No, he sniffs it. He goes into Victoria's secret and sniffs the brand new panties. Yeah. That's right. He has a quite figure to out yet. You know what I'm saying? All right. Let's go. This is ridiculous. Yeah, dude, man. Fuck, man. Yeah. It's a new logo, man. Cool. Just quick. All right. Too much fun. What the fucking media now, motherfucker? That's right. Yeah. That's right. What we got? What we got? We got your butt plugs. Yeah. Takes a big whiff and takes for the possibilities. Oh, man. Good bra. Okay. Guy puts his head in his bra and the bra. Oh, who doesn't do that? Who doesn't put their bra on? He's so much that he sucks dicks with his ass. All right. Hey. Hey. That is crossing the line. There's no return now. Oh, fuck, man. Oh, dude, come on now. Yeah, you're gonna get us in trouble. Yes. We have a name. Matt has given the name for them Subaru Avengers. Yeah. That's what you guys are. Man. All right, man. Yes. Yeah, MSNBC, new rebrand. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that. Well, did you watch the fucking UFC? Are we? We were texting. What happened? He dominated. Dude. Yeah. Dude, did you think he was going to get that choke in at the end? I was, man, I was nervous. I stood up and I was like, oh, yeah, it was close. Yeah. So who were you rooting for? I was like, what's up? Yeah. I like him, dude. Yeah, he's cool. He's dominant. I like, he reminds me of you. Really? Yeah, he doesn't talk a lot of shit, but he fucking goes in and came in. Oh, shit. What? He talks sometimes. Dude, I can talk to the man. Oh, shit. His shit is very short. Like, Matt, that doesn't do these long monologues of shit talking. Mm-hmm. It's like three words and he owns you. One, two punches. Yeah. And that's how that dude is, too. Like, they were, if you watch his, what are you guys doing? Flirting? That was real. Oh, that's not. Bro, that was not DDP's fucking game, dude. He, he, he, he looked totally different. Yeah, it was definitely. Was, was that like fear? No, he, hums us just too good wrestling, why? Well, how come he doesn't fight more? Uh, he had, well, he had like a immune system problem or something? Yeah, but he also has ties to the Chetchen, uh, Warlord. Oh, really? So he had a problem in Ibiza. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, it looks fucking tough. It gets deeper than that, but yeah, there's some. I wouldn't want to fight that fucking guy. Yeah. All right. Nothing at all. You guys good, man? Well, he, I'm getting into it, bro. No. Yeah. I got to support. Anyway. Do your show. Yeah, no, I got to shut the fuck up. That's right. Yeah. That's fine, guys, but if you want to see any of these articles, pitchers. We should start live streaming the UFC fights. Oh, like our reaction of it. Yeah. Yeah. We just talk shit, smokes of cars. We'll get sued, will we? I mean, I know a guy, probably not. Yeah. Yeah. I always think that like on the NFL games when they make that announcement, like, you know, the use of this broadcast. Oh, yeah. I'm like, so I can't take a picture. Yeah. I'm like, when you fucking see. All right, man. Yeah, guys, remember if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to AndyFaceCellar.com and link all that stuff for you. You can also check that out on multiple platforms, guys. Come watch us, come listen, and let's get into it. Line number one. Let's go to DC. There's some updates happening there. Zelensky's in town. All right. So coming off the weekend, Trump met with Putin in Alaska. Now he is meeting Zelensky and DC along with other European allies. Allegedly. Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky heads into a high stakes White House meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday as Washington considers security guarantees for Kiev and debate intensifies over whether land concessions such Russia could end the war. Now over the weekend, Zelensky acknowledged that his last White House visit was cut short by a shouting match between Trump and the VP. But he told a reporter in Brussels that he hopes today's meeting will be productive rather than a repeat of February's encounter. Yeah, well, it probably would be if you didn't show up and start threatening people and shit demanding money and looking like a fucking slob. Yeah, and bullshit. Now that changed today. Oh, yeah. He arrived today. Yeah, he showed up. Yeah. And it ain't to me. I know. I don't want to say about it. Okay. So he showed up. This is a clip because he was actually going to give the young men a lesson today in fashion. Okay. All right. I pull up some picks. I mean, everybody knows what the fuck I look like in a suit. There ain't nobody looks better. I mean, that's a fucking fact. So maybe Conor McGregor, but it kind of looks good. Yeah. So, so let's get to it. Yeah. So I mean, here's the video because reporter called him out while they were in the Oval Office. I mean, I called out by a reporter. This was the exchange. So let's check this out. You have the most presidents of the list. You look fabulous in that suit. I said the same. Yeah. You look good. I said the same thing. Yeah. Let's get a sense of one that attacked you last time. I remember that. I apologize to you. You look wonderful. No, my first question for you, president of the list. And the same. You. I changed. Maybe yours is what's up. Oh, fucking pussy, right? Fucking. Okay. Young men. Mm-hmm. And older men. Okay. Do not wear a black shirt and a black tie and a black suit and think you look good. Yeah. Just being honest, there's so many young people that do this and they think it looks good. You look like you walked out of the fucking trailer park when you do that. You can you tell he's wearing a suit? No. Okay. I'm not sure if anybody else, it looks like shit. And I cannot stand when I see young men wear a black dress shirt with a black tie and they think it looks good. It looks low budget. It looks non-fascable. It looks like you have no idea what you're doing dressing. Just don't do it. Anything's better than that. Literally anything. Yeah. Wear a white shirt or any color shirt with any tie. It could clash. It could look like shit. Still go look better now. You know, just being real. Black shirt, black tie, black coat, makes you look broke. Just being real. Doesn't make you look like fucking John Wick or whatever, fucking thing. And the funny thing is like the people that try to like, you know, comment on this, like they had some, one of the suit designers of Zelensky, apparently he has a suit designer now. But yeah, it was supposed to be this like military style suit. Yeah. That's what these, that's what the kids think when they wear that shit. They don't look cool. I look like I'm in a fucking matrix. Yeah. And here's another thing. You don't wear plastic sunglasses with a fucking suit. You wear wireframe sunglasses. Okay. Okay. You don't ever wear Oakleys or spies or fucking thick black frame. Unless you're the fucking weekend. What you ain't. You wear metal frame nice dressy sunglasses. I like it. The fuck dude, it's always the same dudes. They drink the Kyle drink, black shirt, black tie, black fucking coat. Oakleys. Yeah. Yeah. Or white Oakleys. What the fuck are you doing? Yeah. They take you anywhere. That's not it. I wouldn't even let you in an event dress like that. I'm my place. We've done that before. I know. Yeah. Don't do it. Yeah, don't do it. Now the Trump, the Russia is Zelensky crane. Apparently it's almost to wrap it up to an end. Trump's consistently said that this was not his war. Meaning Trump's war that this was something that he's finishing up from Biden. It's expected to kind of come to an end within the next couple of weeks. We shall see. I'm not sure how much how many more dollars have been sent in that proxy war going on over there. But Trump's in some more headlines today because this headline comes out. This actually a MS now. If you wear a black suit, black tie and black shirt and you have pictures of yourself wearing it, fucking burn them. That's how strongly I feel about this. I don't give a fuck about Zelensky and Trump. I'm trying to keep all you from looking stupid. Hey. Dude, it's a terrible look even if you go to a funeral. Joe, don't do it. I know you're from South County. I know you. I do it. Mother fucker. Have you done it before? I know. I know. I know. I'm trying to save my homies here. That's right. That's right. That's right. I take care of my team. We going somewhere. We're looking good. Damn right. Yeah. Well, most of us. What? That's two. I didn't mean you. I didn't mean you. Two. Anyway, somebody said, some somebody said, somebody said, Lee May special. Joe, you're in a black. You're in a black. Black tie black shirt. Yeah. It does from both of you. Hey. Yeah, man. That's all it is. Yeah. All right. Let's go. But Trump's in some more more talks. You get to see when you came. When last time. Yeah, he wasn't on the team yet. All right. I got you next time. We get our team outfit it here. That's how we do it. We look like pimps. Yeah. They don't know. Yeah. Um. The Trumps in some more headlines. I thought this was the latest. This is from MS now. Formerly MSNBC. This is MSNBC article. Trump eyes yet another power grab. Takes aim at voting machines and mail in ballots. Yes. Okay. So this is reelected and redo. This article comes out. And they're referring to a truth that Trump had put out. I'm saying that he was going to quote lead a movement to get rid of mail in ballots and voting machines. And this article, you know, they're writing it as if it's such a bad thing. And it's completely unnecessary. Right. Why do we need to we don't need to get rid of mail in ballots and absentee ballots and, you know, our elections are completely safe and secure. Why is this even a discussion? He can't paint on this. Well, it's a discussion because just because we don't need to get rid of mail in ballots and absentee ballots and, you know, our elections are completely safe and secure. Why is this even a discussion? He can't paint on this. Well, it's a discussion because just a couple of days ago, a Michigan City Councilman was caught on camera stuffing election drop box with absentee ballots days before the primary. Dude, there was all of these things that happened. Do we not remember the things that came out in 2020? Do we not remember that lady in Georgia? Mm-hmm. The white verse and all of a sudden she's the only one there bringing in suitcases or ballots, pulling them from under the table. There was hundreds of stories that way. And if it's not clear, it should be clear now because look at all the judges trying to block all of the shit that he's doing. Dude, there's a fundamental misunderstanding of who we are actually working against here. Okay. This is the fundamental problem with everything going on is that the average American citizen believes that the people up here at the top are working in our interest in any way, shape or form. They are not you, the citizen, you are brought up to be morally good. And some of us are good and some of us aren't as good and we can argue about these things all day long. But like generally, we, the people take things at face value. These people at the top in the government have no interest in serving you anything that is true at face value. They are marketers. Here's what we'll say. Here's how we'll manipulate it. Here's our benefit and fuck those people. And this has this, this is this misunderstanding that these people actually give a shit about us is what's killing our country. So people have to get real and they have to understand it's not left versus right, black versus white, you know, gave versus straight. And this is us versus them and they are playing by an unethical set of rules and you are trying to hold them accountable to to a standard of operating that they are just not interested in and holding themselves too. And so there are no rules. That's what you've got to understand. The only rule they play by is how do we maintain power? How do we keep our power? Whatever lie they have to tell, whatever law they have to break, whoever they have to kill doesn't matter as long as they keep their power. This whole idea that these people for the most part hate each other in Washington is not true. They say that shit on camera and then go sit in the bar and restaurant and have dinner together. Why do we see Republicans and Democrats having dinner together or speaking highly of saying, oh, he's a good guy in real life because dude, that's what the fuck they tell me. Oh, you know, Schumer's all right. No, he's not. And what it tells me is that it's them versus us. And if we keep thinking that they're going to tell us the truth, we're going to keep losing. So this thing with the with the election drop boxes and the cheating in the election, if we remember this happened in so many counties across the country and these judges all fucking lied. They lied. They lied about it. Now they're all getting replaced. No. No, dude, we have to come to an understanding that the nothing that these people say to us is true. Nothing they say to us is true. They are saying whatever they are saying to produce a result with us. Okay, that's not the truth. The truth is the truth. We're being manipulated. And we have to stop thinking that these people operate on the same moral standard that we do as citizens because they do not. They have no problem taking everything you own, putting you in jail, killing you if you have if they have to. If you're big enough threat to keep their position in the power structure that they feel entitled to, by the way, they feel it's their God given right to rule over us. And that misunderstanding is what's killing this country. The thing is, even back then in 2020, we talked about it. We went in depth on all of this stuff years before anybody else even fucking questioned it. But it's like, and now we're at a point now where this stuff's on video, bro. It's not even a, oh, okay, they might be still there's video evidence. There's proof there has been. Now, from the looks of it, I don't know, there seems to be some type of accountability happen. I know the state, the state highway patrol up in Michigan is investigating this. But it's just like, dude, like nothing happened to that lady down in Georgia. Nothing happened to these people. They're constantly getting caught. You know, like this guy on video, I got the clip here. Let's check this out. It's him and two other dudes, he's in the back, see they pull up to a fucking drop box and check this out. New video obtained by local four shows a black pickup truck pulling up outside Hamtramx City Hall in the middle of the night. Just days before the primary election. All of a sudden, the lights turn on inside the truck. That's when you spot three minutes side, including what appears to be council member, a boom, moosa in the backseat. The same council member who is seeking reelection right now. The video then shows the driver getting out and stuffing absentee ballots into the drop box. The only problem, they don't all fit. He then starts pushing them in before reaching for two more stacks. The whole time, looking around to see if anyone is watching. After about two minutes, the group drives away. And get this local four found that it happened again only four days later. This time, a different car pulling up with what appears to be the same council member in the passenger seat. He then starts handing bundles of ballots to the driver, dropping off three large stacks. City election results show moosa received 1,129 votes during the primary, making him the top contender for city council in November. Michigan State Police confirmed the videos are part of an ongoing investigation. It all comes just days after two Hamtramx City council members were charged with election fraud and connection to the twenty... Prove the chat. Let me see the chat. I want to ask a real question. What should happen to people that steal the election, that cheat in the elections, that take away the rest of our right to choose who is part of our government? Whichever, whichever, whichever, whichever, crucifixion? Every single one is death. Okay. These people are taking our rights and deciding that they have the right to cheat the rest of us out of what this country is supposed to be about. These people should be hung. 100%. If you cheat in an election and you get caught, automatic hanging dude. Dude, that's going to be the only way to like... to send the message to everybody else and not everybody. That's not okay. That's what I would do. I would be hanging motherfuckers literally in the fucking capital lawn like they used to and letting everyone see it. Bro, people only obey civility when there's consequences to not obeying it. And there isn't any right now. And we, the people who work our fucking asses off to pay all these taxes and do all this shit are constantly getting fucked out of our own wants and rights by people like this. Yeah, if I boo knew. Yeah, this is a picture of oboe who's kind of hard to take them serious. First of all, I don't see the guy on the left. The motherfuckers not even a fucking premiere. And they're stealing like dude straight up, which I agree. I agree. I for real dude. Trees in, trees this behavior deserves treasonous punishment. That's real man. That's real. I love the chat agrees. Oh yeah. Now they were already going. They knew exactly where you were going with heads on stakes baby. Yeah. That's what they're saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's rather word. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think with that being said. Sorry. That's what Mike here. With that being said, shall we? We shall. Shall we go cruise? We shall. Yeah. Let's buckle up buttercups because we got some good ones. Juicing 1977. Second time bitching about AC. I'm so though I protect Andy Midgeneer for sealah. But when the air co goes out, I'm a little baby. And I'm Andy the hardest dude on the planet. I could do 75 hard back to back. Just don't cut off cut of my AC. This guy is definitely high on crack. No, this guy's related DJ. Yeah. He fucking reads and writes worse than DJ. Yeah. Fuck man. Macjillionaire. That's right. They're there baby. Can't do it. How rich? Yeah. Cool. All right. Let's keep going. We got another one. This is from Brock over on Spotify. The hardest dude on the planet. I made it bro. I made it. You should do a South Park voice for that. You know what's funny, dude? Is that never, never out of all the guys who talk about this shit. I'm the only guy that tells the truth about when they fuck up and when they fail and when they have to start over and that it's actually still hard for me. You know what I'm saying? The business is hard for me. Working out is hard for me. Everything is hard for me. None of it's easy. And out of all the people that try to teach things and pretend like, oh, you know, it's so it's, you know, like they're the man. I'm actually, I think the only one that says, no, actually I'm just like you. You know, which is interesting in comments like that. No. No. So my cousin needs. I know I'm not the hardest dude on the planet. Why do you think I fucking work so hard? Yeah. You know, it's it's interesting. Yeah, it's weird. We heard that works. Let's head over to Spotify. We got a comment from Brock. He says quote, winners don't eat mayonnaise. Is the quote of the year. That's correct. They don't. Somebody said ill take in the chat. Who likes mayonnaise? Let's see. You know, solid. Yeah. No. Mayo is whack. DJ. Gay. White people. There we go. Somebody said, uh, Andy, not like in Mayo is one is his one flaw. There you go. Listen, it's just this night. And me. Got one more for you though. This is from Aaron. Aaron says, uh, says, uh, the biggest flex is Andy having his AC set to 65 degrees. The other half of the world. So, uh, I mean, I'm just going to say, when you're selling a household has the same energy expenditure as an aircraft carrier out at sea. I'm really good thing. That is a flex though. I ain't got that. Why? Bro, there's not much of a cause of running that shit at 65 degrees. No, because I make enough money and I have to look at it. It's a flex, man. That's that's that's what happens with you 75 hard over and over. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, we appreciate you, man, for being real as fans guys. Keep liking, commenting. Make sure you guys are subscribed and hit that bell notification on the YouTube to stay up today with the latest drops from real air. Yeah, man, let's keep the cruise cruise and show the chat. Headline new. Headline two. Not sure what I just said there. Um, head line number two. Let's get Barrio Bama back in in the show. He's, uh, he's here. Um. Obama's obscene monument to his ego dramatically backfires. Um, let's dive into this little bit. So, so President Barack Obama's promise to build and revitalize, uh, the Blighted Neighborhoods was a centerpiece of his first term in, uh, in office. But now nearly nine years after he left the Oval Office, he might be destroying one critical area in the city he called home. This is a daily mail exclusive, okay? So this is the, uh, I got a clip here that this is the video that launched about this new project. Let's check this out real quick. From the beginning, Michelle and I knew there was only one place for the Obama Presidential Center, the South Side of Chicago. It's where I met Michelle, just a couple of miles from where she grew up, where Sasha and Maria were born, where I became a community organizer and won my first election. The past twelve months had been among the most challenging in our history. I know they've hit Chicago hard, particularly for residents on the South and West sides, whose shoulder devastating health consequences from COVID-19 faced higher unemployment rates and more. But hopefully 2021 offers a turning point for our nation and our city. And we also hope that the groundbreaking of the Obama Presidential Center can be an important part of that change. The center will create jobs and economic opportunity, especially for South Side residents. Because we believe the team that's building the center should look like the community at calls home and through the museum, the center will be a place to honor history while inspiring young people to write chapters of their own. Using them the tools, resources and connections they need to create change in their own communities. Today, with the conclusion of a careful federal view process that spans several years, we're ready to get to work. Through this process, we've shown that our plans for the Obama Presidential Center, including New Gardens, playgrounds, walking trails, and bike paths for all to enjoy, won't just preserve historic Jackson Park. They'll bring opportunity and breathe new life into the community we love. Get it? Alright. 850 million. For that ugly piece of shit. Oh yeah. Okay, and let's just not scoop over the fact that he's a fucking raging racist. Okay? Like, why do we always have to throw in shit like this? I believe, but our Presidential Center should be built by people who look like the people in the neighborhood. It's fucking different as a make, bro. There's not a place in the world that I go and I say, I'm just going to shop here because those people look like me. Oh, why do people build this build? The fuck? Like, these people are so fucking racist. It's unbelievable. You're on top of it. You're telling me for 850 million dollars, the best thing that you can build is like a giant Alexa. So I call it a tower of Babel. Dude, that's what it looks like. It looks like some sort of worship thing. Oh, it's bad. It's bad. Well, here's the worst. Oh, it gets worse. So here's the thing. 850 million dollars. Holy shit, bro. Why aren't we building a cathedral that looks nice that like has like, like this is straight up brutalist for sure, dude. Yeah. For sure. And as due to open in April of 26, all right. But the people in the community that he's talking about, they're pissed. Okay? Absolutely pissed. Yeah. So it's a 19, almost 20 acre fucking facility. Okay? It's massive. All the woman, Jeanette Taylor, who represents much of the area where the center is being built, told Delimel that she's a fan of Obama and believes that believes in the project. But has fought aspects of it to protect her constituents. Her efforts have had mixed results. Quote, we're going to see rents go higher. And we're going to see families displaced. They're already seeing that because the same dude is, their policies have filled the community's neighborhoods with illegal migrants. Yeah, right. That's right. Yeah. Somebody said, every time large developments come to communities, they displace the very people. They say they want to improve it for. She's, and she's a Democrat, by the way. She said this was no, no, no wrong. She's not. She said, this is no different. And we're living what is actually happening. The city of Chicago should have done a community benefits agreement before the first shovel went into the ground, but they didn't. Check this clip out from Delimel. I'm interviewing some of these people. It's almost like a washing away of the neighborhood and the coachy that you should be here. It looks like a big piece of rock, kind of right in the middle of what used to be Jackson Park. Full of like lush flowers, trees, and just beautiful. I can guarantee you, it's not what we really wanted. I think it's a disconnect from the community. Is it community is disconnected from the Obama Center and Obama as a former president. So the very fact and notion that you can take apart from the people and then don't have the people input as to what your building to me is rather disinzenuous. It's a critical and violates commentaries. Paul said here you got this big monstrosity. It's over budget. It took way too long to build and it's ugly. That's the least piece of shit I've ever seen in my life. It's pretty ugly. It's pretty. People like to make fun of Trump for his like gold is overuse of like gold. Maybe they can clap. He can put some fucking gold on the outside of it. It gets stolen. Yeah. That is seriously ugly. It looks like a giant butt plug. Yeah, it's ugly. Yeah. That is ugly. Well, and so like I was not. I wouldn't know what a giant butt plug looks like though. You know what I would normal size one looks like. Yeah. Just bigger. That thing is ugly, man. So this is where the windows. Yeah, well, so this is what it looked like before. This was the area before. This is it. No way. Oh, yeah. Hold on, go back. That was where the bears had a practice field. And they put that piece of shit there. And then that's all there now. This is what it's supposed to look like when it's done. That dude. That's horrible. Well, here's the other thing too. So the other reason it's so it's so much money is because it's completely bumper. It looks like this is one of the details of it that I was reading through the art. Like they don't want something like it's all reinforced. Like the fucking walls are like four feet thick. Yeah. Of steel reinforced, you know, I'm saying so that I think a flight can do it. That is your expertise. I can see how man. Yeah, how much is in the ground? Yeah. That thing is ugly, man. I can see why they're upset. I mean, look, those people don't represent any people that I know of any color. No, no, it's crazy, man. But like, I mean, here's my thing to like Obama. Come on, man. The dude wasn't even supposed to be president. He was illegal. I think he's an illegal migrant. That's my opinion. But speaking of illegal migrants, do you see that shit that happened before? Oh, God. I'm truck axing. We got to cover that dude. Dude, it is like bro, dude. I've seen some bad shit in my life. It's pretty bad. Yeah, it's pretty bad. A legal migrant suspect, um, and deadly Florida crash was nearly deported. The American was allowed to stay after claiming he was afraid to return to India. So this came out. This happened in a legal migrant who allegedly killed three people after making a rogue U-turn on the Florida highway. Is an Indian national who was previously processed for deportation, but was able to stay after claiming he was afraid of being sent back to his home country. Our genders sing across the southern border into California in September of 2018 and was processed for fast track deportation by the first Trump administration. Fox News reported. Um, if you guys happen to be in the clip, here's a clip. Check it out. Dude's on the fucking highway and the right is a two lane highway. He's in the far right lane and then makes a try to make a U-turn in one of those in front of a van or something. Yeah. And just completely cut the van off. Jesus, dude. Three people died, right? Three people. Yeah. Three people. Yeah. Two instantly. Yeah. Look at his reaction as here's the thing. Watch his reaction right now when the car hits. Watch his reaction. Yeah. Bro, and then watch it here. If you freeze that on his fucking fake, this guy does not give a single fuck about what he just did. Yeah. Look at that. It's good. Me here. It's good. It's good. Yeah. Dude, that's no different than that guy that killed that police officer here last year. Mm-hmm. Who was illegal and he was driving drunk and he shouldn't have been here and he killed one of our police officers here in St. Louis who had, I believe, two or three kids, you know, a family, a young family like dude, this is insane shit. How is this person still not in jail? No, he's in jail. Now, he's got charged with three counts of the hikular homicide. He's in Florida custody right now. Yeah. It was two people that were killed instantly and then the driver was pulled from the wreck and then was later declared dead at the nearby hospital. It's extremely sad. But like, you know, again, with all these things, it always tries to get politicized by either side. Gavin Newsom. He ended up getting known by his own, you know, admittance because the rapper response, they posted a tweet out saying that the individual is an illegal immigrant who was granted a commercial driver's license by the state of California. And so Gavin Newsom's office tried to put this out, sing into the US under the Trump presidency according to reports. And okay, what about, but here's the thing, but yeah, he got, he obtained a commercial driver's license from the state of California. Not only that. So you're going to use this argument of when he entered the country for this, whenever we have literally thousands upon thousands of people that are victims of crimes in the last fucking four years and you're going to act like that didn't happen. Like, this is a problem regardless of who and what and when. And the reality is that these people actually cared about us at all. They would say, Hey, this is a problem that we all need to solve, but they don't care. Because the only reason that people want these people here is so they can maintain their power structure and get votes because they disenfranchise the American people to a point where they don't want to vote for these people. The second last comment I was just thinking that how does an illegal immigrant get a commercial driver's license? Let alone the license. Yeah. Listen, man, I, I'm going to be real. This person shouldn't be deported. This person should be fucking dealt with heavily. What? I agree. And people will say that that's like harsh, but the truth is is we have to deter this type of behavior harsh actions like that. Dude, look, you look at that car and you tell me that that person doesn't deserve. You know what I'm saying? You took three lives, dude, because what? Did you're in a hurry? Because you don't care? Yeah. I mean, it was just like, when you hit the first ball, like who does that? Like who makes the fucking, like bro, you're in the far right lane. Dude, he tried to turn on one of those little dirt. Yeah. One of the other people uses it exactly to radar. Exactly. Dude, even you and here's the problem. A lot of these guys, they come, they don't even know the rules. They don't know how to read in the paperwork. They don't speak English. They fucking do shit like this because, dude, have you seen people in India drive? Yeah. The scooters don't go that fast. We'll talk. We'll talk. I know you're laughing, but we'll talk. You guys drive all over the fucking place. Do you not? Do you got rules on the road? Really? Really? No, dude, it's not funny. These motherfuckers, dude, these people are, this is not an isolated problem. These guys do not know the rules. They do not speak English. If they speak English, they don't speak enough to understand what the fuck is going on. They're dangerous. Yeah. There's like a bad case of the people, like the worst of the worst people and then they're, you know, defaming everybody else in the group. Mm-hmm. Well, I mean, nobody looks at this and says, oh, it's fucking Indians. I mean, that's not. I know. Dude, it's just, look, man, it's, people who don't belong here have to come the right way. That's right. Okay. It's not a race thing. It's not, oh, the fucking Indians are the fucking this or that. That's not what it is, dude. I mean, it was a legal person that should be dealt harshly. I agree. Regardless of his, well, if you're going to be a professional with something and you don't do something like that. Exactly. Exactly. I mean, accidents do happen. Oh, for sure, but this was intentional. That's, no, that's negligence. Yeah. That's gross negligence. Yeah. Let's get somebody from the chat and I'm going to get Brandon in here. We have to comment. Brandon, let's get you on, man. What you got to say about this conversation, dude. It is. Yeah. Brandon, what's up? What you got on this, man? What's up? I'll be honest with you. I appreciate you putting me on here, but I think it was a different brain and I think it was somebody that was, he had said the same thing, but I agree exactly what he said. I mean, how does a illegal immigrant or even like that actually get a license CDL, you know, or even a license period? It just doesn't make sense. Yeah. No, this is terrible, bro. What do you think the punishment should be for something like this? Something like that. It's one of those things that like one either deportation or a wood shiver. Like it really doesn't, it's none of the other. We don't need to sit there and put him in jail. We don't need to sit there and pay taxes for, you know, feeding him or anything like that. Like, does zero or more study had on that? Like, you look at this face, he almost looks like he's smiling in the second picture. Like, it's, it's honestly, excuse my lines, but this is fucked up. Like, it's just one of those things. Like it should be as a, as a first responder myself showing up to scenes like that and seeing the zero remorse that that guy has, it's, it's, it's honestly, I love this heartening. Yeah. I can't imagine being one of these dudes who's on the scene right there and that guy is just like chilling just standing there. Yeah. For sure. And it's zero remorse. It's just one of those things that like, bro, you see it a lot because it's one of those things that, you don't see it a lot, but it's one of those things that you see it. It's just, you, you have to sit there and deal with the families that are going through the loss of that gadget, took on that. And it's like, it's, it's unreal. Dude, one time I was, I was driving down the road and this guy wrecked his motorcycle near my car. He was in his 50s and he went into the median and fucking fell down. I didn't have, I didn't, I didn't even hit him. I didn't, dude, just the amount of fucking panic I had because I thought the guy was hurt. Like I'm getting like adrenaline now thinking about it. Like I don't know how you could stand there after you know, like I'd be fucking devastated. You know, like I think anybody would be good-hearted. Bro, how could you, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, absolutely. Well, it's crazy, man. Yeah. Guys, let's go down to the comments. What you guys think and I don't think it's a, it's not a race thing. I don't, I don't give a fuck if that got, he's not supposed to be here. Yeah. That's the problem. It doesn't matter where he came from. It doesn't matter if he came from, you know, Canada. He's not supposed to be here. Even though Canadians look like us and talk like us, you know, you can't really tell the difference most of the time. If you're not supposed to be here and you do some shit like that, like that's a fucking problem, dude. And there's tons of Americans over the last number of years, especially who have been assaulted, raped, robbed, victim of violence, corrects. Like, dude, you import the third world, you get the third world. And we as Americans have to stop being and we are because people have, it's like upwards of almost 90% people want these migrants gone. But we cannot allow this, dude. This cannot, this cannot continue. And they need these people got to go. And I'm sorry that certain people have an issue with it. But at the end of the day, I actually think it should be more aggressive and I think it should be more disruptive to prove a point. What I mean by that is people are upset right now because they're like, oh, this is not right. How they're doing this shit. Well, I actually think it should be a lot worse. You're right. No, I'm being serious because it should be understood by these people that if they come here, they might end up in like a fence-stuffed facility for a year. You know, like we might have guys hopping out of fucking U-Haul truck on you. Yeah. I'm saying, right. We have, like listen, bro, they know they we have rules in this country. Yeah. And I don't know. And I don't know. And I don't know. They've been enforced. And it's funny because the 90% of people that actually want these people gone, they find the 10% to tell these sob stories to make it feel like most of society doesn't want this. No, this is exactly what the fuck we want. We want them gone. And then if they want to come back, they'll do what Z-Shouted or they'll do what men dot did. And they'll come back to right way. Right. Is it so? Yeah. They did that dude. Sad. People who have, who have, who have, who have, who have, who have, who have, who have family here, are gone. They're not coming back. And I feel like we've gotten so disensitized to that fact. That's like we, we don't, like there's too many people out here that like show empathy for this. Yeah. You know, oh, well, you know, like if it's, if it's a guy who murdered someone, well, he grew up in a one parent household and it doesn't fucking matter, dude. It doesn't matter. I don't care what the story was that caused it. It either is or it isn't. Right. Well, that's the thing. It's like, you know, so, so what about these people? So we're not going to talk about the victims. Right. Well, that's what I'm saying. Like it's like, you know, because people, I feel like people would hear them like, oh, well, but like, would it make it any better if that was an American citizen that did that? It's like, no, of course not. It definitely doesn't make it better knowing that that person who did it was not supposed to be here at all. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, it's not, it's wrong. Yeah. Wrong. Get them out, man. Not with it. Guys, let us know what you guys think about the topic down in the commentary. With that being said, we've got another headline for you. Headline number three. Should let you guys know I do have something special for you a little bit later, though. So stay tuned. We got a brand new segment coming. Just thought I'd throw that in there. Okay. You're excited? I'm concerned. All right. It's fine. I got you. Okay. Headline number three. Let's get into it. This is actually a tough one for me. Might get a little emotional here. So if you're cutting him, you got injured. No. Yeah. She did. Yeah. Tramp. And this isn't the full topic, but this is, I got to bring this in. I'm girl, Sophie. The face of the WMBA. The white face of Great Basketball playing. Why does it got to be white? She ain't black. I'm just saying why we can't just say she's a great basketball player. Where is this? Yeah. See, you got to get that Obama out of you. It's a hair. Yeah, I know. It's a hair. I fucking know. Like, I know. I know that, you know, when you're of a certain race and you're allowed to call everybody whatever the fuck you want your whole life, it's hard to curtail the racism. It's hard. Yeah. But like for us, we're not allowed to be racist. So, you know, I don't say racist things. Thank you. Yeah. I'm just trying to make you better. Andy, I genuinely, I'm working on it. I know. And I know. I just know that I'm committed to being a better person. Yes. Now, but not right now. So let's talk about this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a major man. That's a, yeah. She, they were playing a battle for a playoff spot and another player like fell into her. Is that what happened? Let's see. I got the clue. I didn't see what happened. Yeah. Here's the, here's a clip. Let's check it out. Not someone can advocate wants to be going. She is so effective down low. She can get a lot of people out trouble. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Not someone can advocate wants to be going. She is so effective down low. She can get a lot of people out trouble without physical issues. So Nelson Adelaide. Yeah. Oh, I'm counting him. He's down. My goodness. Yeah. Um, yes. A little intentional with the fall a little bit. Yeah. Well, did you hear what the announcer said? No. Listen to the guy. Not someone can advocate wants to be going. Yeah. So effective down low. She's so effective down low. I mean, I think that's a commonality in the whole league. You don't understand? Come on. Why are you setting me up like that? I can't hate him for lagging it. Yeah. You got to leave the camera on me so I can get my hat. Where's a, we need, we need a mirror here. Where's that? Oh, to give us expertise on that. Tell us about how gross the taco is. The kitty, he likes to call the kitty. Oh, no. I don't do the cat. I did the kitty three times. It made me puke. Well, then why'd you go back? You're right. Right. Right. Lier. Mm-hmm. To my line. Somebody's lying. You don't go back when something made, you get food poisoning. You go back to the same restaurant? No. No. No. No. But that happened. So I mean, again, for real though, all jokes aside. Speedy recovery. I mean, I'm not going to talk to Sophie. Yeah. Um, they didn't, they didn't go into details like what exactly if it's like a torn, uh, hopefully she's, she's good. Um, but let's talk about sports a little bit because, you know, in another league of sports, uh, something's happening. Bro, have you seen this, uh, this thing they're doing in Australia, the run it league, the run it, the run it league. I don't, all right, dude, look. They line up two dudes with a, with a football. I think it's a rugby ball. Okay. And they're like 20, 30 yards apart. Oh, and they just fucking run each other. No pads. Yeah, I've seen that. It's awesome. Bro, it's awesome. That shit's crazy. It's awesome. That's great. That's almost as worse like I don't know what's worse like watching either that or the fucking power slap stuff. I do see that. Yeah, holy shit. Yeah, but like this is like what you did when you were a kid. Yeah, it's like, except like you're a grown man. And it's like 30 yards away. Oh, yeah. Like, and dude, you watch these dudes hit each other. It's like a trend. It's like two trains. Yeah. These are not little dudes. These are big boys that can move. Yeah, no, Oklahoma drill. Yes, but like, but not like five yards away, like 30 yards away. Yeah. I think it's, uh, hold on, I got to find the Instagram page because dude, I found it and I could not stop fucking watching it. Run it. Here's their Instagram page. Run it. Are you an IT dot league? L E A G U E. So I said, yes. Bro. Dude, I watched every single one. Yeah, I couldn't stop watching. Oh, no. See, ah, all right. Then they wrote me a message after I, oh, what they said, they said, uh, they wrote me a nice message. They said. Andy, love your work. I said, big supporters of you here in Australia, we hope to be in the USA over the next months or so. Be great to connect. I'm not doing it. It's fucking awesome. It'd be cool to see though. Yeah. Yeah, man. Well, let's talk about hitting people with pads. We got to go to the NFL. There's been some updates happening with the NFL. The NFL reveals new lineup of virtues signaling on field slogans. They're back, man. Yeah. They're back. The NFL is, again, covering its fields with social justice slogans this season. So if anybody was worried that it wouldn't be there, rest assured. It's back six years in. According to the ESPN, fans attending games will see phrases stensoiled into the end zones, such as end racism. Stop hate. Choose love. Inspire change. And it takes all of us. Now, we've been seeing this for six years. Anna Isaacson, the league senior vice president of social responsibility. First of all, how the fuck is that a position? But she said the effort is about elevating what players value. Quote, we're working hand in hand with players. And alongside our clubs who amplify player voices and underscore what they're doing. And they're going to score what is most important to them. She told the Associated Press for decades. The NFL and its players have been a unifying force in American culture and society that brings people of all cultures. And backgrounds together to enjoy America's most popular sport. So yeah, so I mean, we've seen these, right? Like, you know, these things in the end zone. Now, one team has decided to do something different. Okay. The Vikings. They have completely remarketed. This is what their in zone looks like. I have to zoom in here. Their in zone says we are gay. And they've they've been Minnesota, bro. They've done some on the field and off the field changes. They have male cheerleaders. There's always been male cheerleaders, though. Not like this, Andy. Let's check this clip out. Yeah. Are we done? Mm-hmm. Oh, you stopped looking. Yeah, I don't know what I said shit. Yeah. Yep. Are we done? Mm-hmm. Oh, you stopped looking. Yeah, I don't know what I said shit. Yeah. Um. Choose love, Andy. What? How? How? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Are we done? Mm-hmm. Now, you just stopped looking. Yeah, I don't know what I said shit. Yeah. Yep. Um. Choose love, Andy. Choose love, Andy. What's the percentage, do you think, of... Bonaragist lost? No. Well, if you had a bonaure to start with, it's probably a problem. I mean, they're deaf. Yeah. Look, here's the problem. Mm-hmm. The NFL is such a good product that people will not stop watching it no matter what the fuck they do with this. And so they don't get the feedback that maybe some other companies have gotten because of leaning into this shit. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So that's the problem with football. Like the average dude won't stop watching football or turn off football because of this. Mm-hmm. So they get away with it. They think it's you. And I was thinking about something the other day. Remember where this all started. That would have been Colin Kaepernick. That's right. Mm-hmm. And I was wondering... Is there a chance that he was paid to do that? Oh. Is there a chance? Well, I'm just saying, where have... has anybody like looked into that or tried to figure out where that came from? You know what, if it even happened? I was a betting man. Yeah. Which I am. Well, did you not see who is the new fucking chair of the World Economic Forum? Larry Fink, not CEO of Black... Yes, 100% look it up on your computer right now. For real? No. That's too easy, bro. Look it up. Larry Fink. W-E-F. So they cleared a mouse, right? Mm-hmm. And then they put him as the fucking chair. Now... Interim co-chairs. Yeah. Interim co-chair. Larry Fink and I know. Now this is the same Black Rock that is... Yeah. They're responsible for pushing all of it. Hold on. There are the ones buying up all the single family housing creating an artificial price increase. There are the ones pushing all of the DEI, pushing all of the ESG, all of the shit from the last decade. That comes from the World Economic Forum. And then remember when we were covering this every single day, people were saying there are no way that the World Economic Forum is telling Black Rock is then telling everybody else what they have to do to qualify for money. And now the guy who's the CEO of Black Rock is now the chairman of the fucking World Economic Forum. And by the way, they're in charge of all these banks that lend all these money to all these big corporations who in order to get the money, they have to abide by certain things like DEI, an ESG scores, and social justice initiatives. So they force them down through those big companies through the lending. You can't qualify for the money unless you have this. And that's how the shit... that's how they get this stuff in culture. And then you get all the small businesses who want to be big businesses thinking that this is just the way business is going and the copy them. Yeah. Anyway. Do you think they believe you put the shit in the workplace? Take it home. Take it home. Well, that is true. That's why the entrepreneur is the key to the cultural revolution that's needed. That is why we have to understand that the rules and the value systems and the structures that we hold at our small businesses are actually the counter punch to what these companies force down everybody's throat. So entrepreneurs are the solution to what's going on. The small, the medium-sized entrepreneurs that are not affiliated with these big institutions. And yeah, man, the NFL, unless people stop watching it, it's never going to change because the leadership in the NFL is tied to these guys. That's it. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Let's get somebody to ping in on this. And dude, like, it would, you know, what percentage of... It doesn't even matter what percentage of fans approve or don't approve of this because their goal isn't to appeal to the fans. It's to make it normalized in culture. Yeah. Yeah, she said it. Like, I mean, football is an iconic culture, like staple of American society. Yeah. How else would they put the shit in? Not doing it for money. Not doing it because they think people like it. That's not enough for that. It's forcing people into it. And dude, when we get in a situation where we are forced to accept certain things, we are no longer in a free society. Yeah, it's not free, man. Let's get somebody to ping on this Kyle Isom. Let's get them up here. See what they got to say. Talk to me. What's up, fellas? What's good, what's Gucci gang? What's up, bro? What's Gucci? Hey, Andy, you remember me, bro? We made outside first forum a few months ago. From Anna? Oh, yeah. Yeah. What's up, bro? I do remember you. I got nervous, therefore, man. No, I do remember. We friends with the same guy. Oh, okay. Jake Alley. Yeah. I remember. Yeah, dude, after I left that day, I was like, man, I want to reconnect with this dude. I was like, how am I fucking reconnect with the dude like Andy? So I was like, oh, fuck it. I'll just see if I can get on the show one day. And here we are. All right. So what do you think? What do you think of that new male cheerleader that Vikings got? Man, I tell you what, I was saying in the comments, we were talking about s***. It reminds me of one of those dudes that we always targeted in s***. It's exactly what my first fucking thought was. Oh, man. We just started news s***. Yep. I don't think that's going to make it to the episode, bro. All right. Well, okay. We do enjoy it. No, that's right. Holy s***, man. Okay. He was so calm. That's right. I didn't say it. This guy definitely drinks the green drink. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You know, okay, look, look. When I first saw that, that's what I thought. But, you know, I'm kind of like Andy though, man. Like, male cheerleaders have always been a thing. Like, oh, you backtracked now. No, no, no, no, no. No, but I got to see his tickets. When I first saw the s*** come out, I was like, all right. You know, whatever fucking, you know, male cheerleaders have been a thing. But then once you actually see him like, play on a round like that, man. Come the fuck on. I mean, my god. That's it. You know what, man? I could care less about the cheerleaders to be completely honest. Right. What I do care about is how it's being forced upon people. And otherwise you're this or that or this, right? Like people have a right to believe their own things. And, uh, yeah, I mean, look, I, I don't even know what to say. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of where I'm at. The bigger, the bigger problem is why it's happening, not that it's happening. And that's the problem. It's the bigger problem. Like if people were to say, yes, I want some dudes in the cheerleader lineup. Like, and everybody was like, yeah, man, that's great. I mean, like cool. Yeah. Like fine. I don't, I'm not into that shit. But like, you do you owe me. But, but it's why it's happening. It's not happening. It's, it's, to me, it's really no different than Leotamas jumping in the pool with a bunch of girls. So many females dedicated their whole life to dance, to be professional cheerleaders that don't get opportunities because of people like this that want attention. You know, it's not your role, bro. Like that's not your role. No. And it's not discriminatory. Like, I don't know. I just, I'm, I'm, oh, every, the woke shit is over, bro. And I think, you know, that's also how you know it's intentional to you, bro. Yeah. Cause they're like, fuck it. We'll do it anyway. You're fucking changing these people don't know culture. Where culture is like, it's a tiptoe. Ray says right there, it's a tiptoe. That's exactly what it is. It's a fucking, how far can we ride the line without getting backlash? But the NFL is not a good test for that because the people who watch football don't give a fuck about the cheerleaders. I'm sorry. They don't know or whatever you the fuck you want to stamp in the in zone. Yeah. You fucking touchdowns tackles and pancakes. Yeah. Yeah. Not necessarily in that order. Yeah. Pancakes first. That's right. You know what I'm saying? But you can't start football day without pancakes. That's right. But here's what I will say. They, they're going to try. This is what they always try to do. If you backlash against this, you're a big it. You're a homophobic. I don't have anything against people being gay. I don't have anything against people being gay having the same rights as everybody else. I don't have any. What I don't like is how it's being forced and where it's coming from and how the money flows and how the culture flows. And that's the bigger lesson as to what's going on here. 100% man. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. Bro, but here's the real talk, dude. Like this is the problem with that, right? Like, that creates anti gay sediment. That creates it. And like, dude, yeah, okay, well, that's not right that it does. Well, we're not here to discuss what's right and wrong. We're here to discuss what is. And it's no different than when people say it's all the Jews. And then innocent Jewish people that don't know shit about what's actually going on because they're just trying to get by, end up getting punched in the back of the head because they got a certain last name. Like, that's what this kind of shit creates. And so like when they force this into areas where it doesn't belong, like, bro, how many fucking anti trans people did, did Leotamas create? Oh, more than there was before. No, tell you that. Times a thousand about it. The entire reason that anti trans movement became so big had a lot to do with that person. And it's going to be no different here. And by forcing this into spaces where, you know, we have culture and tradition, like, bro, there's nothing more American real talk than fucking hot female cheerleaders doing shit at the football game. That's like in our DNA as Americans, like you date the cheerleader. She's the proud queen. It's all like that's part of American culture, whether you like it or not, all right? And not all American culture needs to be fucked with because a certain minority of the population thinks it should be. That's real, man. Yeah. Let's change the name back to the red skins and let's change the name back to the Indians. And all this woke shit, it has to fucking go. And real talk, I, this won't happen, but what should happen is nobody watched a shit. But it won't happen. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, people, people will do that to a beer company because there's other options right there. Yeah. Right? Like I can easily order something else. They will do that to a consumer goods company because there's other options. But when it comes to the NFL, that's correct. And they know it. So they use that to force the shit in. Bro, I'm, I'm, I'm, this is speculative. I don't know this. But it seems to me that Kaepernick was part of that problem to start with because that's where all this woke shit started in the NFL. And then you got Roger Gidell, fucking who all the players and all the players, and the fucking management secretly hates all the fans hate him. And he's jamming this shit down our throws for money. You know what I'm saying? It's all about money, dude. And Chad's going off on me. They want, they want to hear this dude blackbird speak like blackbird. Yeah, blackbird. Come on. What about blackbird? Hey, Andy, how you doing? Are you blackbird? Yeah, my name is Tyler. It's just like the S R S anyone blackbird. Okay. Yeah, one of the coolest planes ever made. The biggest problem I've seen is a lot of these immigrants that are coming in are trying to change our culture from American culture to theirs. Correct. Like, for instance, they get the Muggles out east or northeast where they're trying to install a Shriallon. It's a fucking deer born Michigan, bro. Yeah. It's fucking wild. And it's sick of him to see this happen. Well, I mean, why do you I'm okay with him being here, but you simulate the art culture at that tour culture. Correct. I agree, brother. Look, we as Americans have to understand that we have American culture and we have a right to preserve that and stand up for that. And that does not make us bigots. That does not make us racist. That doesn't make us anything other than people who enjoy our own culture. And yeah. I totally agree with you, bro. Totally. Guys, let us know down in the comments what you guys think about this topic. I don't I think he's right. I don't think it has anything to do with racism at all. I think it's we have our culture. We want our culture. We are entitled to have a culture as Americans. It's for the people who are born in America. And that's that. And the culture of America is cool because it does have some, you know, it has flavor from everywhere, bro. It has, you know, here in St. Louis, dude, we got a gumbo. A big pot of gumbo. Yeah. Got everything in it. Yeah, but the problem is, you know, people want to throw out shit in there, you know, fucking up, bro. They wanted to be curry. Yeah. I mean, I agree. I agree. But if I want to curry, I'll go, I want to listen. Listen, listen. Our culture deserves to exist just like everybody else's culture. That's right. America's don't move to India and decide it's going to be America. We don't move to fucking go there, make some hamburgers. We don't do that. We don't do that. We don't go to France and say French culture sucks. We're going to make it this. Thanks for the fries, but we're doing this way. But fuck you. That's how we do. And why is it okay for our culture to be diluted and to be shamed and to be told is wrong morally when literally there's other cultures in the world that kill gay people on site. There's nobody says anything about them. They actually what they say is, let's bring those guys here. Right, right, right, right. You know what I'm saying? That's my advice. But then you're a bigot because you don't want fucking male cheerleaders. But all the people who hate gay people, who hate gay people are allowed to come in across the fucking border free and they're welcome. You understand? It's a complete fucking total hypocrisy. To me, it's like, it is. It's a mind fuck. You can't even explain it. And it comes from us Americans not being willing to stand up and be like, oh, fuck you. You think I'm a fucking bigot? Like you're the one that's importing all these people that want to kill gay people across the fucking border. And you're mad at me because I want some girls to look at. You know what I'm saying? No, no. Like, dude, it's bullshit. Don't work, man. And dude, why is it that all the organizations that push this diversity in the world to come from the leadership of Israel, but Israel doesn't agree with any diversity? Why is that? That's interesting. Why are they not importing these refugees there? It's only Western countries. Why is China not taking refugees? Why is Japan? You know why? Because they value their own country's culture. And there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with Hungary for Hungarians. There's nothing wrong with Italy for Italians. In fact, I think if you ask most people, when they go to Ireland, they want to be around Irish people. When they come to America, we're Americans. And now they're trying to ruin that. And the reason they're trying to ruin that has nothing to do with anything other than we are not needed as Americans the way that we were used to be needed. Right? And what I mean by that is this, Americans have been lied to for decades about what America really is. They have been told, grow up, be strong. Each of your vitamins become a badass soldier. And they put all this propaganda about the military and all these shows and all these movies. Most of the military movies they've ever made are funded by the CIA. And people don't realize that. Why is that? Well, it's because they want us to grow up and be strong American men so that we can be shifted off to wartime and fight for countries and people that can't fight on their own. That is the truth. Why the fuck is America fighting any other country's wars ever? Why are we anywhere other than here when we have the problems that we have here? Right? And so, dude, when we think about what America really is, we are sold and I do. The idea that is great, the idea of America is fucking amazing. And the heart and soul of America is fucking amazing. But the truth of America is something far different. When we are taxed the way we are taxed, when we are sent to war for other countries causes over and over and over again, it becomes clear what this is about. Those aren't our interests over there. Those are other people's interests. And we have been brought up to believe and fight for democracy, quote unquote. When in reality, we've been trained to grow up, be strong, and then go fight wars that have nothing to do with us on behalf of people that can't fight their own. And that's usually the leadership of Israel. And so what we are and have been in the past is the iron fist in the white glove that goes and fights all these other wars for all these other causes, except our fucking own. All right? And now they don't need us anymore in that regard because all these wars and all these things are fought with technology now. Okay? So now they have a problem. Yeah. All right. And the problem started, this, this, they were way ahead of us on this idea. This is why they attacked masculinity. This is why they came out with feminism. This is why they pushed all the woke shit. They needed to remove the national identity and the strength and the power and the masculinity of our men because we are too powerful to control physically. You understand what I'm saying? So then they say, all right, we're going to flood the country with all of these social initiatives that remove the need for men, quote unquote. And then after that, we're going to flood them with millions of illegal migrants to dilute the culture so that in 20 years, nobody even remembers what America actually was. And that's what the fuck is going on right now. We are being, we are being intentionally retired as the enforcer of the world because dude, they understand that if we continue to be the way that we've been historically, that we will eventually wake up and we will beat their ass. And that's what they're doing. They're ruining our society so that we are not a threat to them anymore because they don't need it. You know, man, guys jumping on the conversation, man, let us know what you guys think with that being said, our final segment, um, it's usually thumbs up or dumb as fuck. Got some for you, Andy. Yeah. Well, special segment brand new segment. Uh, get hit with Andy for sale. Okay. Okay. All right. So how this is going to work is I have, uh, curated, thanks show.
