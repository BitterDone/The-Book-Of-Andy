Do I what is that that's the least what they say what is who's they the internet white white people what is white I don't even know what white fragility means what does it mean I think it's like well I'm just trying to live my life bro I'm trying to work out and make money and fucking you know have a good time I get called all this share you know what it means what's it mean but I don't think they know what that means yeah because this is a different definition well you know I'm just a dumb redneck from Missouri I for sure clearly don't know things for sure but I think it's interesting because and I had to bring this up because it's fucking awesome look at look at this headline so this one of these women one of these like the ladies we talk about yeah she's a bruncher I'm sure yeah she has a signs in a yard mm-hmm don't do shit else yeah her husband supports her she votes fucking left so that her husband has a much harder time making any kind of money and then complaints about her husband doesn't make any money and refuses to understand that it's her fucking fault for sure yeah and even with all of that non-experience but you know we got a brag at the fucking brunch about how much I care about shit oh no she she cares about so much cares about shit so much she wrote books about it oh I'm about white fragility and she's white and seeing seeing your whiteness yeah yeah this lady right here Robin DiAngelo I see my whiteness every day bro it looks pretty fucking good I mean it's pretty to say man I never looked at it and thought it looked like shit I'm just saying I see it all time yeah that's right but this lady Robin DiAngelo just got in trouble because she all of her writings a lot of them she actually has been plagiarizing from black people white critical race theory darling rob and DiAngelo accused of plagiarizing minority authors and her doctoral thesis is this true there's real shit I mean hold on let me let me hear the whole thing okay all right before I start I have this habit of commenting on things before you tell me the truth I was up so the author of the New York Times bestseller white fragility Robin DiAngelo has been accused of plagiarizing works from minority authors in her doctoral thesis the complaint obtained by the Washington Freebeak and was filed with the University of Washington from which DiAngelo received her PhD in multicultural education the complaint regards her 2004 dissertation whiteness and racial dialogue a discourse analysis um DiAngelo is accused of pulling two paragraphs from northeastern universities Thomas Nakayama and Asian American professor and his co-author Robert Krizeck without proper attribution uh and emitting quotation marks and in-text citations large chunks of text from the author's work were used in DiAngelo's uh piece with words here and there splitting this sections up she is also accused of pulling from University of Wisconsin Madison Stacey Lee an Asian American professor of education in which Lee was summarizing the work of scholar David Theo Goldberg dozens of cases of passing off others work as her own were discovered um the University of Washington's Department of Sociology defines plagiarism as quote the use of ideas words or other work that is not your own without formal acknowledgement of the source in notes that plagiarism needs not uh be intentional and I didn't know is not a defense um the dissertation also includes the fame phrase white fragility which DiAngelo described as quote a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable triggering a range of defensive moves so that that's your definition whatever the fuck that means um I'm not racist yeah that's the whole thing bro if you fucking say you're not racist you're white fragility just fragile yeah fragile bro just admit that you're racist just say you fucking racist yeah everybody fucking 224 bro everyone's racist welcome to the pool cry with me dude this bitch but still I'm fucking shit you know what I feel this way about almost every single entrepreneur on the internet about my shit you know yeah you know I watch all these motherfuckers talk this shit and it's like how the fuck would you know that you never built anything oh you got that from my shit you listen to episode two that's right bro if you pay attention it is fucking very out oh for sure you know like how do you know shit if you never did the shit how do you know all this shit or I fucking was divine intervention yeah that's right well anyway this is a terrible human fucker yeah I just think it's fucking hilarious you like right all the shit I think these people I think it's so weird like I'm just gonna be real like I just think this white apologist shit is so weird like weird like look at her like these this kind of person like to me that is the racism right she by the way she's talking down to this fucking black way that guarantee well she's not that study about where they change their language of shit she's doing it right yeah coastwitching but for white people yeah they talk like they're fucking like special needs or something bro a hundred percent that's my point yeah like so dude this this white apologist shit where they're always like oh you know it's like it's so it's like you're not treating people as equals no you're treating people as inferior by the nature of the conversation you don't have saying one thousand like fuck bro like it's absurd and and why would you feel the need to go that overboard if you weren't guilty about your own racist thoughts right you see what I'm saying right dude it's just like you don't if you're not a racist person then what the fuck do you why do you talk to someone different that's a different race in you what the fuck does it matter it's like hey bro hey bro hey bro like it's all same you don't have an idea do you yeah I know I know it's hard because the computer confuses you see you yeah you I fuck

there yeah let's let's let's let's and that goes for black people to black people have whiteness so um that being said man let's let's connect some of these dots as always as we try to do on the show let's get into some of our headlines and we'll start with uh oh I haven't put my disclaimer in a minute guys if you want to see any of these pictures article with links videos go to anyfacela.com we linked that stuff there for you that being said that's number one now this was a I don't know how big of a deal this was you know because I initially thought like holy shit this is a big deal but then I'm like man like we knew this we knew this but we are finally getting unequivocal fact from uh from from from the mouth of the person that was involved in this we're finally getting some uneniable truth let's talk about it zucker bird admits facebook killed hunter Biden laptop story after FBI warned of Russian disinformation do you know what's funny senator smith just said this yesterday and show and then by the way like this was not out at that I know and then it came out like three hours later that's how you know he has that inside plug yeah he does have that he does that plug sometimes I'll say shit to him like bro this is what's going on he just looks at me the blank face yep now no but uh bm and this is uh this is a wild wild story um so let's talk about uh how we got here what causes to come out of this dive into this a little bit so metacio mark zucker bird revealed that facebook killed the hunter Biden laptop story after the FBI warned of a potential Russian disinformation operation and acknowledged that it shouldn't have demoted the story uh in a letter to representative gem jordan awesome guy real american patriot in my opinion uh the chairman of the house judiciary committee zucker bird wrote that after being warned by the FBI about a possible quote Russian disinformation operation regarding president joe biden's family facebook went on to kill an article from the new york post in response to the article about corruption allegations about the biden family facebook quote sent that story to fact checkers and had it temporarily demoted that was the policy that was in place um but it didn't it never existed until this situation i think that's a very important uh things like this we've never had anything like that happened nope and so they implemented this policy right then and there they said okay hey we're gonna take it down we won't allow people to talk about it we'll send it to our own independent fact checkers yeah and then they said they say that once it cleared fact checkers that they put it back on but they never did that they never did that yeah that's very very important things but um uh let's ask us how we know yeah you know i'm saying no shit um and uh and so the house judiciary uh GOP the twitter uh posted this out and i think i agree with them there are three very important things here to note the first thing about this letter is um that comes out of this is that the biden heros administration pressured facebook to a censor americans that's the first thing that's facts that's a very i mean it that is the fucking trip and i am one thousand percent certain that we were the first people to ever say that ever we knew it we like there's no i mean because we can be talking about the time like how do you get all of these people on the same page how do you like it's very fucking simple they have their people oh yeah what do you say and they're all colluding together they all have them they all have what do they have back room meetings yes that's exactly what the fuck they were doing um the second most important thing about this is that you know so you have the government pressuring a private company to censor americans the second thing is that that private company followed those orders and censored americans and then on top of that the throttling down of the biotin laptop story which i believe i feel like you know we talk about election interference right in ballots being counted and miscounted and pulled from other table that piece that is a part of the election interference because the biggest part biggest people wrote uh they did it they did a uh study post election of all the democrats and it was i can't remember the exact date i don't want to misquote it but it was a significant percentage of them enough to swing the vote right that would have not voted for Biden had they know that had they know that information about hunter Biden which is true information yes about hunter Biden there's so much true shit on that laptop so i need to come out yet they haven't even got started on the fuck on laptop dude um but this also confirms that the FBI knew about the laptop which we also said years ago they knew that that was happening right and it was strategically put in place i'm at a perfect fucking time during the election cycle to throttle this stuff down they use fucking social media companies to do it um now Zuckerberg's admission article continues comes after bright bar news political editor Emma Joe Morris uh had previously testified before the house select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government that the FBI had knowledge that the hunter Biden laptop was real prior to December 2019 long before she had even published a story about it in October of 2020 the FBI knew all along who was president in 2019 down drum so the FBI has this information that this next family that's running for they had this information they didn't tell them they withheld that information that's correct this is a fucking problem this is a fucking coup okay this was a coup in 2020 it was that's what the fuck it was and what we're dealing with now is legitimate like communist occupation we already had it everybody's like oh come on it's gonna be a no we're already occupied by these fucking people we're in it we're in it you know and now of course you know Zuckerberg and I mean I know you have your thoughts on Zuckerberg yeah a lot of stuff right but it's like you know is he doing the right thing here I mean I think he's trying to think he's trying to but let's be real bro um because he also touches on the fucking donations okay all right let's be let's be real all right I have two there's two sides to this in my opinion in my brain number one you're 22 years old and you're a billionaire and you got all these people coming at you for all this shit you have no I bro there's no way a 22 year old is capable of dealing with the amount of success that he had it's it's not it's it's unprecedented and I don't have one fraction of the financial success that he does a small fraction of it and uh you know it's hard to deal with so I can only imagine what it would be like for a 22 year old kid right yeah so he's got all these people coming to him all these powerful people that and they you know what I mean they've they've been grooming him and telling him this is the way and this is what we do here and you know he grows up he becomes a man and he's always been like this awkward weird kind of dude and you know this happens in 19 2021 and all this stuff they come at him and uh I imagine it was intimidating I imagine that they didn't come at him you know hey please do this it was more so like you better fucking do this or else and the reason I think that's how they went at him was because of the interview that he did with Joe Rogan where he was like hey look man they came to me and told me to do this right and I also think that in the recent years you know he's got around more men like jujitsu people and MMA people and just more men in general and he's starting to realize that like dude his little tech world that he comes from this gay yeah for real I mean for lack of a better term it's just it's it's not cool okay and I think he's I think he's realized like hey I kind of resonate more with this guys right and I bet those guys have kind of let him know like hey what the fuck bro well I think I think to that too Andy like I mean think about it like this you were talking about the federal bureau of investigation the federal law enforcement entity of this country that's what they do there is a reasonable expectation that when an FBI agent comes to him like hey guys listen I'm telling you we're tracking on some intel shit Russia's making this move they're about to try to it's bullshit it's all this information there's a reasonable expectation of trust there yeah that should be true okay I'm alright shit you know I'm saying so I'm not even saying Zuckerberg was was intention like oh yeah fuck we're gonna censor he was acting on the information he had yeah and give him that and also also bro the the four hundred million dollars he gave for the Zuckerberg boxes yeah you know in this letter the last part uh he here's what he says apart from content moderation I want to address the contributions I made during the last presidential cycle to support electoral infrastructure the idea here was to make sure that local election jurisdictions across the country had the resources they needed to help people vote safely during a global pandemic I made those contributions through the Chan Zuckerberg initiative they were designed to be non-partisan spread across urban rural and suburban communities still despite the analysis I've seen showing otherwise I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other my goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another or even to appear to be playing a role so I don't plan on making a similar contribution in this cycle I think like I was saying he's gotten around guys who are a little bit different than what he's been used to and he realizes they're not the devil that they've been made out to be they're actually it's cool pretty cool people and I feel like he's trying to change and reinvent himself and I'll say that I can respect that okay but that does not remove how much damage was done by what he did and that's a big problem dude because this literally changed the direction of the country and then we have taken a nose dive so I don't know how I feel about it you know because well I want my question is I mean obviously well dude let's see let's say this there's another part to this okay well are you going to fucking remove everybody's shadow bands right are you go like why is it that my traffic is ten times more when I'm not shadow brand than when I am right right and is obvious yeah bro are you going to remove all of these restrictions that you put on people's accounts that when they interact with political content their traffic it's throttle down are you going to fix that because that would be as simple as you walking into Facebook today and saying hey we're not doing this anymore if I can't you doing this yeah you're fired you know and dude you honestly bro like your platform would go crazy if you opened it up like that well dude I feel like you know like and granted like it's hard to be pissed like I said for me like how I look at it's very hard for me to be like yes you know I don't believe you did this intentionally but there is damage I thought you didn't intentionally for a long time I'm saying that but that's a fair assessment I've I've started to reconsider that and see it more like I've seen it but the thing is dude it's like at the same time though Mark you are controlling a a a a a massive empire of public thought that's right and I think there is a shit ton of responsibility that you should have there and at the end of the day if you're gonna like if you want this to be a free platform and you want this to promote the first amendment and you want this to be you know you want to play neutral then what neutral would it be is like being fucking neutral and I think if you really truly allowed that you would see the true numbers and all this manufacture bullshit that you're allowing Harris to do on your platforms because we know that's bullshit that would all go away and it'd be very very fucking clear who's really in the lead right now yeah you don't stand but by you not doing that you putting any type of censorship or anything that's not being neutral at all yeah you're still siding yeah whether you feel like you're truly like you okay you're not donating $400 million but like fuck man the the platform's are still not free yeah they're not you know and Elon chimed in on this as well he put a tweet out he just retweeted the the House Judiciary Committee's tweets saying sounds like a first amendment of violate it is a first amendment violation because it's the government dictating to Facebook to do this the the Facebook is free to do whatever they want right because they're a private company and they're protected by section 230 as we talked about on yesterday's show but because the government told them to do this then that becomes a real first amendment violation so what's the accountability for that and then what are the reparations for that because the reality of what this cause was it caused a literal communist to win the election and our entire population is suffering massively our entire country is suffering massively the shine of America has been heavily tarnished because of this one thing that happened and by the way it happened to Twitter too right remember when the Twitter files were coming out from we said hey this is only Twitter this there's one for YouTube there's one for meta you know they only went after Twitter that makes sense yeah like no get the fuck out of here I mean the other part of this too bro it's like you know who made this decision because again Trump wasn't office I know Christopher Ray the director of FBI he was in charge with the FBI right and it's like who made who's just who's call was this whose call was it to say hey we're gonna go to these social media's like that's who named that like I want that person by the way we're not gonna tell Trump that's what I'm saying like that is some that is like dude think about that that's true dude it is it really is it's fucking treason yeah and apparently I was talking to one of my buddies that's not the only thing that was happening there was also I mean I think we did maybe have covered this but there was also a lot of treasonous activity within on military because we didn't have any wars during during during during Trump and Trump's biggest goal when it came to the military was to get our troops back home correct there were leadership inside the DOD that were flat out saying yeah we're not doing that what do you mean like the whole your whole fucking oath that you took as a servicemand or woman it's literally obey the commands of whoever is the fucking commander in chief unless they're unconstitutional yeah please show me how which getting our kids home safe is not unconstitutional please show me yeah you know I'm saying so like you got to look at it in this light guys like not only did they spend eight years on bullshit fucking Russian collusion bullshit now only that they you know not obey fucking simple orders not in form the president about certain things that were going on they lots all of us how much better would our life have been doing just those four years bro if none of that shit was happening how much more would he've been able to accomplish bro do you not like let's take let's take a let's take a time machine back to 2016 to 2020 the yes the last four years 2021 22 23 you know those years have been the most chaotic the most divisive the most frustrating years that I've ever experienced as an adult in terms of what I've seen in the country the four years before that were easily the second most chaotic and the reason that they were the chaos the most the second most chaotic is because of a simple lie that Hillary Clinton decided that she was going to make to attack Donald Trump the Russia collusion story which went on for seven years before it ever came out and when you think about the division that that created the division amongst Democrats and Republicans or even friends and family people that were arguing real life about Donald Trump Hillary Clinton is the number one person that is most responsible for the divisive culture that we live in today along with Barack Obama he's tempted okay so when we think about this and we talk we start talking about treason and we start talking about acting in the the against the interest of the country and we start talking about you know people thinking they're literal emperors and empires is or royalty these people believe it and they think it and and do think how fucked up you'd have to be in the head about your own self importance to make up a document that pretty much destroys the country's cohesiveness because you didn't get elected president well I mean really I think they were I think their plan was to put this because it actually came out before the election you know what I'm saying like it was like it started it was a real timing right around yeah you know I'm saying but her plan I believe was to use that to actually how confident were they dude that we're gonna win in 2016 well how confident were they were they were they were gonna win 2020 that's what I'm saying bro in 2016 you guys don't remember they were putting around the cover magazines before the fucking election was over calling her madden president bro that's what I'm saying so people don't remember that no man I think I think she was like she thought that you know that little operation that she did a sign stamped and approved by fucking Obama yes using our tax dollars to fucking do it she thought she was gonna be in office dude they had to continue that was her fucking vengeance fucking dagger that she was able to say a thousand percent and also when we talk about election integrity and the cheating that took place they were cheating then they just didn't count on Donald Trump outpacing the cheating which to my point now because in 2020 they learned oh we got to cheat this much right so what they're gonna do this time and dude uh I think they just issued a statement the other day I know they did uh about you know anybody who does who interferes with the peaceful transition of power is gonna is gonna be held just like January 6th or well that's interesting yeah that is an interesting thing to say I like to get guaranteed so would that apply also if Trump wins I well you know here yeah I do but what I think is that in 2020 they figured out that they had to cheat more and I think in this year the reason their pump and Kamala so hard and using the media machine to pump her up because look do she have 27% approval rating the the when Trump got shot okay 27% she does not lead in any fucking poll that is that is actually evenly surveyed okay if you sample a general population there's not a poll in the fucking world that she leads in or is even close but they go out and they're sampling Democrat polling and they're making her look like she's polling equal or even ahead of Trump why are they doing this because they understand that they have the mechanisms in place to cheat a much larger gap than they did in 16 then they did in 20 and this is why it's important to get everybody to vote because the only way that Trump will outpace that cheating is by every single person going out voting these people are fucking total criminals they're totally corrupt and honestly I think if they cheat the election again dude there's gonna be violence because dude there's too many people awake wait too many people man wait too many people guys jump it on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments show your thoughts with that being said let's go crew some of these comments now this could be I don't know I don't think this is I mean I don't know you tell me let's let's this is a dumbass we'll call it that this first comment comes from kev dog OC look in the mirror Trump is trying to take credit for the strong economy Obama created over his eight years the only things Trump did was create a culture of corruption undermine democracies around the world and help create a global disaster by crapping his pants with his pathetic response to COVID the insurrection and taking away women's rights weren't great either what movie are you watching bro I lost some brain cells listen to this yeah what movie are you fucking watching independent of the shit dude look I don't even argue with these people because everything they say is the opposite of what actually happened and they're impossible to convince otherwise now this is just a classic dumbass I mean bro look you look in the mirror I mean look at the bank account yeah no shit oh bomb let's bring Obama back again you know Obama has been present the last four years you dumb fuck you know shit you know I'm saying like all Trump did was create a culture of corruption how that will corruption what hold on how how did he undermine democracies around the world when there was no fucking wars going on and we weren't involved in any wars around the world how did he do that you know I'm saying help create a global disaster by crapping his pants oh he crapped his pants during COVID I'm pretty sure every single media every single fucking reporter every single three letter agency every single person was putting a count on the screen every single fucking day about how many cases they were and not only were they putting this count up the cases weren't even true if you listen to yesterday show we talked about this they they turned up the psycho rate on PCRs they gave away free testing they pumped the testing numbers they tested people who were dead motorcycle racks and gunshot wounds for COVID and count them as COVID deaths and you're dumb fucking ass believed it okay so he crapped his pants during the COVID no everybody in the world the w e f the w h o the n i c fucking h uh fucking everybody what is n i h not n i c h uh fucking every global media source every single thing across the globe went with this this was a global fucking initiative orchestrated by Bill Gates and the world economic form they ran a fucking pandemic exercise in October the October before COVID even started called event 201 okay so kev dog you don't know what the fuck you're even talking about like at all at all at all and in fact you should come on the show and you could sit right there and I'll fucking annihilate you in front of the entire world how about that with facts yeah you fucking don't know shit you're a dumb ass fucking I'm gonna root for the team that I'm fucking like bro that's ego shit okay if you can't like stop and look at what's going on and actually know the information of what's happening you are a fucking sheep you are what they call useful idiots you are the kind of person that allows people to become communist country because you will buy into their propaganda no matter what they will tell you to hate that person you'll hate that person how the fuck can you be an independent thinker when you agree with the media the politicians the fucking big corporations and then you turn around and call people like us fascists you're a fucking moron bro very independent yeah like yeah good job kev yeah no shit parents are proud of it this next one the insurrection do you think we're gonna go to an insurrection without our fucking guns you fucking idiot holy shit bro I'm so tired of it you mean called that yeah like if this was an insurrection we'd all bring our shit well that makes sense sure he gets picked on all the time I'm sure his wife tells him what to eat for dinner I'm I'm sure he cries after sex I've been I guarantee you he jacks off with the column I thought we do a little tiffin yeah I mean I don't know what people like this I'm just it's like dude can we not like accurately remember what actually happened no had Trump come out and fucking march of 2020 and said we're not shutting the fuck down they would have fucking they would have they would have killed them they would have removed it from office he's in an election do you not remember how confident those people were that he wasn't getting re elected they were talking about it in fucking 2019 we had public figures on TV confidently saying he's not getting reelected not to worry about it yeah he's not getting reelected not to worry about it because they knew what the fuck they were gonna do the only thing I will agree that he shit his pants on was operation warp speed which was fucking a terrible move on his part yeah and I will criticize Trump for the things that he does that I don't agree with and that's one of them well like to sit here and say oh take a credit for a strong economy Obama created

genius I mean that's a billion dollar idea I'm we take that we had added this out of the show so nobody fucking steal it that's good trademark that shit hey call me guys we appreciate you for being a real ass fans keep liking keep commenting uh make sure you guys hit that bell notification on the youtube stamp to date with the latest episodes dropping from really off with that being said let's keep this cruise move we got hell on number two and now it looks like a free Mason outfit I'm wearing there look at the angle of the thumbs dude he says it's thumbs at a 45 degree angle you know what that means that means that the ancient pyramids and midnight on the fourth full moon of the year the the the resurrection will happen of the anti-christ and Andy knows about it and he knows and he knows because he's he's he's secret handshake friends with the devil fucking but uh yeah you're the Andy christ that's not stark that shit no I am not Andy christ I'm just a dumb mother fucker from Missouri who has some critical thinking skills I have the ability to anticipate chess moves that's all it is yeah you do a great job at it well head on number two now we've been in a free Mason we do talk about quite often now you know communism um it's here you know I'm saying like it is definitely here and we have people all over this country that are not afraid I think the mask has come off oh yeah it's off um and you know I think it's very important that we have to call these things out when they do it so people know what it looks like and it looks like this headline here Chicago wants to open a city run grocery store it could be the solution to urban food deserts this is communism a state run facility correct that that's communism yes okay they know okay food deserts that's the trigger word who's paying for that oh the people yeah hmm let's dive into this it's only here we're only attacked you three or four more percent it's only gonna cost up a jillion fucking dollars yeah yeah no shit and we're not always gonna be open it's any you know it's very you know the government does a great job but you know running shit now let's run let's run control the food markets great all the whole foods wall mart save a lot these grocery stores have become a sad commentary on the challenges facing historically disinvested communities in Chicago the past few years all these franchises have shut it locations citing financial challenges with six stores closing in the last two years alone residents have grown increasingly frustrated at efforts to bring better food to their neighborhoods let's put it all together for you let's put it all together for you do you not remember in cova when they emptied the prisons yeah okay oh and then and then do you remember how they said that you they couldn't have forced the fucking laws and then George sorrows put all these prosecuting attorneys in that let these criminals run free and then these same criminals went into the fucking stores and stole everything out of the stores okay and then the solution is to open up what kind of grocery stores oh Communist grocery stores so maybe this has been a plan the entire time is that how communism works yeah maybe we'll destroy the free market economy by letting criminals run wild and never prosecuting them for anything and then we'll come up with a magical solution that we will be the grocery stores make all the businesses leave because they keep getting fucking robbed and looted yeah by white people and then we'll just it's a perfect plan it's white supremacy it's a perfect plan you know and like to that point let's check this video out this is the liquor store look she just robbed some herself look look at dude she just robbed herself stole that microphone yeah this is the liquor store somebody drove a car into the building and there's people inside stealing items watches this red dodge derango backs up crashing into this west angle wood liquor store within seconds several people in hooded sweatshirts hop out and start stealing items inside as the burglary is taking place bystanders across the street appear to cease the opportunity streaming in to steal cases of alcohol struggling to carry the heavy packages away this happened at around 445 this morning at rainbow food and liquor on the corner of 71st in ashland the impact from the crash mangling the front door frames shattering glass even peeling bricks away from the facade police say several of the offenders got into a black four door vehicle and took off you know so like I think it's just important you know they they they they study what's happening but they don't want to address why it sounds exactly like what I just said they don't want to say why is it why our businesses leaving it's because a fucking black criminals no because of criminal no it's not even that it's not even that it's not even that we can make jokes all day all right about white supremacy and shit but it and it ain't even that no here's what it is they are not allowed to try and prosecute these people in these counties or in these areas at all that that George Soros filled all of these major cities prosecutors with soft on crime zero accountability prosecutors who are now allowed all the criminal element to run wild and fucking LA there's a $999 fucking limit until it becomes a felony or to even get stopped for for fucking stealing shit okay and you wonder why they all leave they're doing this on purpose so they all leave and then they can start to insert the communist food supply stores and grocery stores and all the shit in their place no man it's it's and then and then have the nerve to try to make it like those businesses those companies are the bad guys yeah it's abandoning black people yeah yeah that's right that's right yeah did exactly no the motherfuckers y'all vote for every fucking two and four years are abandoning black people yeah but that's not what mayor Brandon Johnson saying let's check in with him on the story he said quote my administration aims to tackle food inequity with a network of three city-owned grocery stores offering equitable access to fresh healthy food and underserved communities Chicago will lead the way with a new approach to fighting food insecurity what else has he been doing I thought that was important to check in on and just the state of Chicago and itself let's look at a one year recap of the Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson let's watch out let's see what what what he's been doing first of all his approval rating he's unfavorable by 62% of Chicago wins 62% of Chicago's don't fucking like him like 42% are strongly unfavorable rating against him let's see what he's done for finances all he's done is is basically stole a lot of fucking money from the people gave it a shit ton of money to the immigrants the illegal immigrants that are coming into this fucking country house crime crimes up 26 fucking percent in Chicago he ended his contract the city's contract with shot spotter which is a tool that law enforcement will use it can triangulate and pinpoint where gunshots are being fired from he ended that and he didn't reduce he said he wouldn't reduce the Chicago police department budget by one penny and he didn't he increased that budget but he eliminated 833 street cop vacancies so like there was 833 vacancies in the department yeah he just wiped off yeah we don't we're gonna operate for this is a number now that's right so right now we have zero vacancies that's some fucked up shit yeah fucked up shit even look at that education 83% 83% of kids in Chicago public schools cannot read at grade level cannot read at grade level so yeah communism has to be the end that is what that is like dude and what's it what's crazy is how these people always point and say it's corporate greed or its racism or the black communities are underserved when in reality they're the ones that serve no these people are intentionally destroying their own communities meaning the mayor who is a black man is intentionally making it harder on the black community in Chicago for political gain and pursuing a communist narrative it's insane it's insane bro it's insane well this is how it starts this is how it starts and it ends it ends with people starving and dying fucking starving yeah starving guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments let us know if you're gonna be going to do didn't that crazy breaking it all down like that letting out the prisoners during covid putting in all the prosecuting first yeah prosecutors did come first no accountability prosecutors right letting out the criminals during covid saying it's not safe for them covid yeah fucking and then they've running the businesses out of town because of the crime saying that it's white supremacy and corporate greed causing this shit right getting all the black community of those areas to vote for them again and again and again all the while they're intentionally sabotaging their own communities like do you think this motherfucker doesn't know exactly what he's doing he's that stupid bro because you got think as I can't just come in say hey we're opening up a city government ran fucking supermarket we're gonna open this no there has to be a massive need for like who the fuck wants that like that I don't know because the government doesn't do anything imagine going to the DMV right and that's where you got to get your groceries yeah right exactly holy shit yeah exactly think about it like that think about it like that imagine going to the corporate uh courthouse here down there in Clayton having you know to get your permits for whatever and imagine that's where you got to get your groceries you got to deal with that shit mo you got to deal with people that don't give a single listen dude all of these bureaucratic operations need all of the people need to be fucking fired and they need to be and need to be restructured and they need to rehire people no no like dude you ever dealt with someone in a government job they don't give a single fuck if you fucking if you if they help you or if they hurt you or if you're happy or if it's quick they do not care they do not sit right there they'll come back four hours later it's insane dude oh you better not show no frustration yeah because then you get shit you're gonna get fuck whoa remember that motherfucker we talked to on the phone last week yeah yeah that was fucking crazy it's fuck she was so bad she wouldn't even give us her name dude oh did him want to give me a name her name was like Gladys and we said Gladys what she's like that's all you need is Gladys okay bitch yeah that's exactly what she said that's exactly where yeah yeah man guys you jumping on this conversation we asked for her supervisor and she said you don't need it hung up the phone hung up the fucking phone man damn bro no and I'm black you know the old people probably heard you too much that was probably dude bullshit I didn't say anything I let you do all the talking I knew I didn't have a shot yeah right yeah man yeah man maybe yeah Gladys was on some bullshit guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think I was that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three we got to readdress this stuff's happened and I think it's important to start seeing you know we talked about yesterday these these like trials that they're putting in and there you know just to get the public's reaction see how stuff goes things important you know pay attention to those things and follow them as they happen so just a little follow up from yesterday's conversation um check this out voluntary lockdown imposed at four Massachusetts town to combat deadly and incurable mosquito-borne disease that escalated pretty quickly in 24 hours four Massachusetts towns Webster Oxford Sutton and Douglas have imposed a voluntary evening lockdown following the confirmation of a human case one case of Eastern equine and cephalitis or Tripoli in Warchester County making the first such case since 2020 Daily Mail reported Massachusetts health officials are on high alert as the state grapples with the re-emergence of this one case of Tripoli now Tripoli also known oh yeah as Eastern equine cephalitis it's a rare but serious viral illness transmits to humans through the bite have an affected mosquito so you have that it says that you know espresso the bite of mosquitoes the virus is most often identified and mosquitoes found in and around fresh water hardwood swamps more information about different types of mosquitoes they can you know all of that good stuff how common is it how common do you think this thing is to be doing voluntary lockdowns Andy I don't think it matters because these people are legitimately in love with this concept of lockdowns they fucking love it I mean but like a thousand cases a year no like 10,000 cases a year no less than that how about just since 1938 there's only been 115 cases yeah exactly enough to do voluntary lockdowns and how quickly did voluntary lockdowns grow to mandatory lockdowns in 2020? fucking instantly two weeks to stop the spread yeah right you know now here is the good news how how quick did we go from two weeks to stop the spread till you fucking walls sending police units down the street shooting citizens with paintballs get back in their house right how far do we go from that right right right right bro this is insane shit these people are insane like dude people it was a cultist mentality like I was saying yesterday on the show the people who bought in the mask they bought into it hook line and sink brother's people still wearing masks still wearing mask I saw this lady on Twitter the other day someone forwarded to me saying uh she was bitching about how she was in a cab this was a recent thing like she just posted it how she was in a cab and she was wearing a literal fucking respirator mask like one that you would go and do like a spestus work with and she wrote this big long thing about how i'm in a car with with another person who takes zero COVID precautions I don't know how i'm gonna be able to do like bro they really fuck these people mentally like they are totally messed up now you know like think of a hypochondriac person who automatically thinks they already are sick all the time and then hit them with this shit like the air is going to kill you you know what i mean and then there's still there dude it's psychological fucking abuse sad bro dude what happened during 2019 2021 all the way into 22 was the biggest instant of psychological abuse in the history of mankind warfare yeah who was the same and people like oh fucking COVID killed out no it didn't it didn't kill all those people you you don't understand the fucking what actually happened they over reported the deaths intentionally so that they could get what they wanted done which was to produce a vaccine and force people to take and it make trillions of dollars off of it yeah all right despite there being known proven safe and effective therapeutics that already exist they completely ignored safe and known therapeutics nor so the doctors were talking about yeah no shit it wasn't ignored wasn't fucking ignored yeah that's right you know like it dude it's fucked up and so here we are you know a couple of months out from the election you have this happened and i think what the important part about all of this is that we have to see what are the people doing and saying about this right like what what's the public's reaction to this right because i'm of the belief that you know most people would not you know run the same play again right like most people wouldn't fall for the same shit again right this is where it gets interested and obviously i still believe there is plenty of censorship that's being done whether that's through google they've already shown that with Kamala searches versus Donald Trump right they still control what is allowed to you can't even type out the word go go into your fucking iPhone and try to text the word assassination and see if it will actually autocorrect to assassination it won't it's crazy okay go into fucking anywhere into google or youtube and try to google this shit it will not you have to type it all the way out we'll let about later why is that it's it's it's extremely fresh right yeah it did didn't mind but the thing is it's like you know we have to be we have to be be very are you sure spelled it right or they just give you another word is on apple or are you just in oh try it on your fucking try texting the word like pull up your text message and then try to say assassination to me a signation that's right see that they won't even let you type it in they also won't let you type in pedophilia oh yeah you can never do that feel yeah they're not gonna work that they've eliminated that word from the fucking search language yeah yeah see that for assassination isn't that weird yeah in that weird I won't do it um you know but I think my point is like it's important to see how the people react to this shit right like are they gonna fall for this again these four towns needs to have a microscope on them and more importantly I think whatever support that they need from the rest of the fucking country they need to be getting I mean from the people not the government yeah um you know and I think it is refreshing to see now when I talk about censorship and I'm changing all of that shit the reason I brought that up is because you won't find any articles on the people standing up they are you won't find them the only one I was able to pull was this one from CNN shockingly and they write it what with pandemic memories fresh towns voluntary curfew to prevent spread of lethal mosquito-borne virus draws iron um the people are not fucking with it no shit they're not with it they're not going for it um and that's pretty much the basis they flooded this town hall meeting where this decision was was uh what's happening these are small towns small trial populations that are testing this on um and it was flooded with over 300 fucking community members that showed up and said fucking no mm-hmm they had a sign petition that almost reached a thousand it's a small town again thousand fucking people saying no um which I believe is the only reason they kind of do I think this was supposed to be a mandatory lockdown and they scaled it back it's a test because of the pushback man it was a test the fucking test was a fucking test dude people listen young people don't realize this if you are under the age of 30 you have to understand there's never been lockdowns in a history of this fucking country this is a new fucking concept and we should never lockdown lockdown for anything anything anything it's insane they look pissed well they should be pissed they look for glad they showed up finally this time well you guys would have showed up like this for COVID we being a different fucking spot right now be all right be all right yeah man so we're gonna keep our eyes on this uh situation because I think it is like I said it's very pivotal it's important how that community reacts and more importantly how we as the rest of the country citizens do they just don't comply with it and support it just fucking say I'm not doing it no and all your neighbors say I'm not doing it and when they can't do anything they can't do anything if everybody says no they can only do something if like I select few people say no which during COVID was people like me and you in Smith fucking a Tommy Vax but a bunch of other people said no okay and there was a whole there was other people too uh fucking there's a few in front of between yeah because they're like else why they may have said there was a few like hundred public figures huh that stood up and said no and everybody else attacked those people right had everybody else just jumped in with those people we wouldn't even be here no or the worst one is like you know I do agree with yeah that's right that's right all you fucking pussies that war the mask when you didn't agree with it you're fucking and then you fucking came you came to people like me and DJ and all these guys I just mentioned and you said man I wish I could fucking say what you say I believe in that but like fuck I can't do it and you're telling us through the fucking mask you go yeah cuz you're cuz you're a fucking pussy bitch oh it's insane man you have no backbone hopefully you learned your lesson hopefully you know what it was a true tell tell sound of that two bro even when we went to Arizona and I think it was like on the flight there they had lifted the fucking mask mandate or whatever out there yeah on the way there and we land it and we get to the fucking resort and shit and I think out of maybe legitimately out of a hundred fucking people there was one person yeah that's right that's what the real numbers it was it was a hundred to one and those 99 fucking people who so quickly the moment big uncle Sam said you could take the shit off yeah you should have been had it off should never put a fucking on dude not only that bro these people I mean like look man it's very obvious to me why people don't succeed in life after watching what happened or in COVID you know why cuz success takes courage and you have to be willing to stand up and what you believe over and over and over again when everybody else believes the opposite and if I had to sit here and say what is the number one thing that causes people to never be successful it is a lack of courage and we saw the lack of courage amongst people in this country during that time based upon the amount of people who were wearing the mask coming up to me and you and saying bro keep up the good work I'm behind you what do you mean you're behind us bro you're you're fucking doing exactly what they tell you to do I don't need you behind me I need you to fucking to the left and right and that's right that's and that's what we're gonna be moving forward as a country yeah dude and we need to one other thing I want to mention before we get on to thumbs up we are in a very dangerous position and I am pretty confident that we're gonna see a major black swan attack event happen between now and the election all right because Kamala is not winning the media hype's not taking all these people are joining Trump we just had 200 former George Bush slash Republican aides sign open letters support Kamala Harris the establishment that has been led by you know the establishment politicians here in this country the the world economic forum the bill gates is the sorrows is all of these people they're falling apart and they're getting their ass kicked and they are very very dangerous people as I've been saying for years when you corner these people you have to understand that they understand that their ass and their accountability is on the line and right now they are falling apart and so it's my prediction that between now and the election time there is going to be a major major society altering big negative event and I don't know what it is and I don't know what they're gonna do but I think it's very important for everybody to understand what these people are capable of doing my personal opinion is I think they're going to frame some sort of bomb or explosion or or mass attack they'd either kill Trump and RFK and then they blame Iran and then they get their war okay and they think that all the mega people are gonna support the war then which they aren't I don't know what's gonna happen but I could tell you this it's very very important that everybody pay attention it's very very important that everybody get engaged and it's very very important that everybody gets everybody they possibly know to vote in this election um what I got a little break in news for you what's that they just uh jack Smith he just just released another round of indictments the Donald Trump oh now check this out oh right now huh four more additional counts oh came out today filed 87 literally two seconds ago okay so so everything's not working so now we have the United States district court for the district of Columbia filing a lawsuit against Donald Trump no these are criminal charges oh it's criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding conspiracy against rights so what are they gonna arrest them they're under whatever they can oh these mother fuckers are insane they won't stop they're not gonna stop dude he better not fucking comply with that no I don't think he came I don't think you should play ball I don't think I should have played ball I think you should tell him to fucking each shit that's what I would do come and get it bitch yeah check it in blood yeah man guys you jumping on this conversation you let us know down in the comments man what you guys think of all of this then that last thing is gonna be interesting being very interesting bro look at look at how they wait to do this right like these people after he's already been told by a fucking supreme court that he has fucking immunity dude no shit no shit dude not only that think about this respect the democracy yeah who's the real threat to the democracy oh Trump is the threat even though they just appointed a candidate with zero fucking votes and they ignored the supreme court on Trump's immunity and just filed this criminal charges anyway dude you know what I think for real man I really think what I said yesterday to Eric is the truth I think that enough people are sort of awake that the harder these people push the more they're waking them up like I think of there's so many Democrats now that are like holy shit this is not the Democrat party that I ever wanted to support or ever aligned with and now they're seeing it and so like the harder these people push the more they're exposing themselves to people that would otherwise go along with them right on one hand they're talking about we want unity we want to we want to come together we want joy by the way go google strength through joy I'm just saying for your homework okay like okay Kamala Harris is up there saying strength through joy everybody go google that just google it I'm not saying the same thing about it just go Google strength through joy and see what comes up besides Kamala that's right yeah man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck did you google that you know what I know where come right yeah I know go look guys as well as that besides Kamala what comes up but uh this one we're here later we talk about it it'll get one of these two options um and so with that being said let's get into our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reading patriotic parade outside school after student was banned from flying American flag on this truck stupid fucking shit beautiful to fucking see bro these people are out of line like if it was a private flag of beflissin grow they're stirring the hornet's nest these liberal fucking fucks have put they've gotten their way so long they still think they're in control of the cancel culture you're not you're outnumbered fucking thousand to one and you always have been you just thought that you weren't because of the bot networks on meta and Twitter and all these shit and what the conservative side the pro-american side the actual pro-freedom side all of these people combined no matter what level they're in and have have all figured out that it's all fake and you guys are fucked you guys continue to do this shit where you're taking people's American flags and you're fucking trying to do all this woke shit and dude it's gonna get dangerous for those people for real it's gonna get dangerous you're fucking with people's shit and they have figured out it's like it's like the guy behind the curtain and wizard of eyes right like the he's this scary guy and you know everybody's scared of them and and then all of a sudden they pull the curtain back and it's like this little twerk yeah and these people are out here dude they don't have any clothes anymore no one's afraid of them and you fucking fucks they continue to fuck with people for being pro-america you're gonna fucking fuck with the wrong pro-american person i'm gonna tell you that right now how do you try to ban an American flag they would do they been trying to do that for years in America they've been trying to do that for years dude this is bullshit man let's check into this topic man uh Oklahoma oh no Oklahoma yeah in Oklahoma moved to California and Oklahoma man and they're like our cousin state i don't think like our cousins from Missouri they got big bugs in Oklahoma man bugs bro the bugs are like three times a size oh my books they're huge they're huge like if you drive through Oklahoma at night bro your your car is covered in these like i don't know what they got they're like dinosaur bugs they're fucking huge but Oklahoma's cool man yeah good people down there uh our Oklahoma community expressed outrage after a high school student was banned from flying the American flag on his truck the decision sparked a patriotic protest from students and parents outside Edmund North high school uh who responded by flying a number of American flags on campus in support of the student Caleb Horst a senior at the school said he was left confused by the school telling him to stop flying the stars and stripes on his pickup particularly as he had already been flying it for quite a while well i've never really had problems with it before and it's our first amendment so it's kind of hard for them to infringe upon our rights fuck man that's how much that's fuck beautiful hey hey that just gave me chills um since Horst spoke out about the order from his school he has received an outpouring of support from other students parents and local lawmakers demanding it is reversed Edmund public schools said that the district prohibits the flying of any flags on vehicles this is designed to prevent disruptions and distractions during the school day the school district told koc oh it is also done in an effort to provide a safe school environment is flying flags on vehicles create safety issues in the parking lot as well as can cause damage to other vehicles uh the explanation appeared to do little to calm backlash from the community with Oklahoma state superintendent Ryan Walters Walters uh so he plans to launch an investigation into the school district um quote it sounds like they're making a bunch of excuses to me he said here's the reality you told the kid he couldn't bring a flag onto campus that is a ridiculous position and it needs to be fixed um now i think there is something here that we have to be very careful about you know because all these legal lease you know they it's all about okay so when you back and then they get flooded with fucking prior flags and fucking trans flags and shit we don't need that american flags should be flown and allowed to be flown anywhere in this fucking country not only that they're at a fucking school that's receiving tax funding from the mother fucking country fly it bro i'm gonna tell you this these people are gonna start getting their fucking asses beat that's one of the masters off and they they don't care about hiding them they don't know they don't realize they don't realize they're outnumbered by like ten one hundred and one bro they don't get it no man so uh Walters vow to protect students right to fly the flag until the rules are changed a group of local long uh makers announced that they are requesting that the district superintendent updates its policies the protest in Edmund uh even drew support from dukes of hazards star john Schneider who released a video to Facebook saying he was applauding the students
