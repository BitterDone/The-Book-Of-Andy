What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to mother fucking reality. Guys today we have a real talking I'm gonna get right into it. Okay I was talking to a buddy of mine who's going through some hard times and it got me thinking about a lot of people out there. A lot of you guys might be going through a hard time and I want to remind you of something. I want to remind you that where you are in life right now is not who you are. Okay who you were has created the life that you're living right now but who you are is a different version of yourself. You have felt pain. You have learned lessons. Hopefully you have gone through things that that previous self didn't know or had an experience and now you are equipped with a different perspective with different skills and a better understanding of what decisions need to be made to change the outcome that you are currently living in. So you have to understand that if you look at it as if what you are experiencing right now as who you are you are closing off the ability to make any changes to the current circumstances. If you look around and your whole life is a shit show. You can't look at yourself in the mirror and say well I'm just a piece of shit. That's not how it works. Hopefully what happened was the person that you were a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, five years ago made some uneducated and probably instant gratification minded decisions that have created this outcome that you are unsatisfied with and that is not who you are. Now who you are is someone who has learned that creating things comes from the decisions that you made many, many months and years ago. So when you have the perspective that you know what I'm not a piece of shit. I just made some bad decisions that opens us up to make better decisions which creates a better outcome. And this is the mystery of life. This is why many of you repeat the same cycles over and over and over and over again because you look at the environment you are currently in and you say well I'm just not good enough or I'm just not that kind of person or you know what I'm just a loser. You are not a loser. You are just losing and you are losing because the person that you were before lacked the perspective or the understanding that the decisions that that person was making were going to create an outcome that was not desirable. But now you've learned that lesson. Haven't you? You figured out that maybe that person that you were before is not who the person you are today. And if you had the same opportunity to make the same decisions today, you would make different decisions. So why don't you? Because that's what's going to change things. Nothing is going to be changed by you sitting in front of the TV eating more shit, consuming more mindless information, being more of a loser than you already are, that's not going to fix the situation. That's going to produce more of what you don't want and probably a more intense harder version of what you don't want. So you really only have two choices here. You have the choice to accept your reality as who you are and live your life as that person from now until you die, which I'm pretty sure you don't want to do. You have the ability to acknowledge that, hey, the life I'm currently living is the result of the decisions of that person back then. I am no longer that person. And now I'm equipped to make better decisions that will produce a different outcome when time does its thing. It's not going to happen today. It's not going to happen tomorrow. It's not going to happen in 30 days. But if you make better decisions about your life now, two, three, five years from now, you're going to be a completely different person in a completely different environment. And when you become that person who is aware and skilled and understands that their actions create a reaction and you're also living in the life that you want to live in, that's a powerful thing because you can continue down that path of prosperity and winning, which is what you're ultimately after. And a lot of you guys say, well, I don't really care about winning the fuck you don't. If you didn't care about winning, you wouldn't feel so shitty about where the fuck you are right now. Okay? So acknowledge this. Do this for me. You're not a loser. You've just made decisions that have created an environment that feels like it. Acknowledge that. Take responsibility for that. Start making better decisions right fucking now. And before you know it, you'll be living a different life. Things will look better. You will feel better. You will have better friendships. You will have better relationships. You will have higher income. You will have a much better quality of existence. But you cannot do that if you identify your current living situation as your identity. It is simply not true. The decisions that you made back then produce this environment and the decisions you make today will produce the environment later. And whether that environment turns out to be something that you want or more of the same of what you have right now has to do with you taking responsibility and understanding that life is inputs and outputs. It is math. It is one plus one equals motherfucking two. And if you want a better outcome, you got to make better decisions. There is no blaming your life on anybody else. Contrary to what victim culture says, contrary to what's popular on the internet, contrary to what everybody cries about and blames everything on. It's just not true. You control most, not a little bit, most of the things that are going to make the difference in your life. You control what you eat. You control what you consume. You control what information you put in your brain. You control how much you move. You control who you associate with. You control what decisions you make. And all of those things create a much more real reality than anything else that you could blame on anybody else. So when you wonder why it is, you are where you are, you have to take responsibility for that and say, it was me so that you can now take responsibility for changing it. And a lot of you guys talk about freedom. But until you free yourself from the understanding that your current environment is somehow somebody else's fault, you cannot be free. The only way for you to be free is to take responsibility and say, man, you know what? This is my fault. I did create this. And you want to talk about what real freedom is? That's real freedom because now you can make any decision you want to produce the outcome that you're seeking to have. So stop thinking this is someone else's fucking fault and stop talking about freedom and stop talking about someone else coming to save the day or somebody has to do something. That somebody is and always has been and always will be you. We're from sleeping on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck a boat, fuck a stove. Counting millions in a coke. Bad each booted slow. Got a own bank row. Can't fold. Dusset note. Here's shot case, cloth, cloth.
