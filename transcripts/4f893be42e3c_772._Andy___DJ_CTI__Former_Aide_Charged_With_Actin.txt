what's up dude what's up dude nothing I was just looking on this picture that's a nice dog that's a good looking dog there yeah what is that you think look a pit bull yeah I one of those like shelter puppies yeah I like bully breeds bro like one of those nevermind I was like yeah I can't say it I can't fuck to say that's like well I'm saying is this my dog yeah it's I like bully breeds I had American bulldogs now I got English bulldogs had all the different working breeds growing up but I got to say to the bully breeds in my favorite they're great dogs but they're not for inexperienced owners man people don't understand how to how to work with working dogs if you don't give them a mission if you don't give them a job if you don't like exercise them daily they will be destructive it's just part of the deal so part of these you know part of this situation with the dogs that really irritates me is that when people get these dogs because they think they look cool for Instagram and then like keep them locked up in an apartment or don't work them and bro that's not you know what bothers me dude is if people to get pets in general that just don't fucking do shit with them you know what I mean get them just to get them like brother like I know this sounds weird but I get anxiety about these fucking ducks being in their fucking little house like about like I'm like fuck I got to get home because like they've been in their little thing all day and I know that sounds stupid but dude that I can't do that man no that's a little thing not not in me man I don't know how people do that shit like I don't know how people have animals and just leave them fucking and they'll spend time with them or don't make an effort it's it's I don't know it's weird to me shouldn't have fucking animals that's how you're gonna be no that's real yeah that's real shit bro yeah yeah um yeah man how was your weekend labor day weekend it was good I uh I did labor yeah I lifted some weights it was laborious now man it was good you know uh I wish people would stop and think about you know why we have that day off a little bit more you know I grew up around a labor type family um all my aunts and uncles and cousins and you know pretty much everybody I grew up with around they were all in some sort of construction trade whether it be selling materials or building things and you know I think especially the younger generation who is all engulfed in social media and technology you know I really believe that a lot of these I think the world would be better if everybody had a mandatory work two weeks labor job every year if you had to work one paycheck as a laborer for every year the rest of your year you'd be so fucking thankful for what you get to do you know what I'm saying it's real like it'd be the world be a better place and there'd be more respect for people that work for a living I was about to say there would be a whole different level of respect yeah bro it's it's it's these young kids don't get it dude like you think your fucking job is hard because you come in and sit at a fucking desk you're a fucking bitch that's not hard you know what hard is carrying fucking concrete forms out of a 30 foot fucking hole in the mud when it's a hundred and fucking 10 degrees outside and then doing that the next day and the next day and the next day you know what's hard bro getting up on a roof and being up there every single day your life for 40 fucking years you know a lot of young people they don't get that shit you know I don't know I'm frustrated like in China brothers like mandatory like military service we just do like mandatory fucking hard work service when they're like turn I think it will be good team do that for a year and then you can go do whatever I think it would be good for everybody yeah that would happen plus you would learn skills you would learn how things are built you would learn how to operate amongst men you know like if we've really lost a lot by not having the youth super involved in that and you know it's crazy man I'm a little irritated with society I know you're shocked but the you know this this these peak like I was I just couldn't help this bro I was looking on social media today and it's like all social media has become is a total bitch fest about how hard everybody has it and their sad story and what bro you fucking think that everybody else don't have hard shit going on just because they don't bitch it's called being a stoic it's called fucking being a man it's called you know oh men can't talk to anyone you know what motherfucker a lot of you talk way too much that's the that's the problem you complain way too much you bitch way too much you fucking wine way too much and that creates an identity that you can't escape from how can you feel good if all you're doing is bitch complaining wine all the time about how bad you have it you don't have a fucking bad you don't have a hard you get to come into AC and fucking type some words on a goddamn computer screen it's called your job these other motherfuckers are out here in the fucking elements climbing towers in the heat in the fucking bad weather not making what they should be making quite honestly and doing things so that the rest of us can fucking live a comfortable life and there's no respect for that anymore and and dude I just I don't know I feel like I've become that old man that's like fuck all these kids it off my lawn yeah bro like for real because it's just so insane the amount of pussy shit that I see people complain about I'm just over it dude yeah well I'm sure it's like it's a hard thing like I mean is the world changing like you know the fuck like I mean your youth was not that long ago you know I'm saying when I was yeah when that was the way it was supposed to be you know saying and it's like I don't know it's just a whole different perspective I guess when you get up there I don't I think I I think the world has changed bro there wasn't when I was 20 years old there wasn't all these opportunities with like social media and not everybody's trying to be a YouTube star not everybody's trying to you know do this and that with technology I'm not blaming people for trying to do that but like you didn't have the option so if you need money guess what you had to do you know fucking work and I'm thankful enough that I was forced to do some of these really hard jobs growing up by my dad I fucking hated him for it dude but now I'm like super thankful yeah like he used to make us work on a concrete crew in the summertime and then and bro we didn't get treated like we didn't get treated special we got treated like fucking I need to get your fucking ass over and let's go yeah and dude and then you know painting the stripes on those parking lots and the fucking heat moving those bumper blocks all over like bro I'm that shit builds character and a lot of these kishes don't have it dude like yeah you know I just can't stand people to show up and complain about like basic shit you know I'm saying life's hard bro and winning is even harder like it's rare it's not something that everybody just gets to have it's not you don't get to win just because you were fucking born you don't get to win just because other people are winning you don't get to win just because you think it's not fair that they win and you don't it's not fucking fair it's never gonna be fair and winning is exceptional it takes exceptional effort it takes exceptional uh perseverance and termination and grit and fortitude and dude that I'm just sorry like you young mother fuckers don't fucking get it yet you just don't all I see like I made a post today after I workout I said you know I think the world needs more winding I think the world needs more analyzing of thoughts and the world needs more you know uh granola hippie in your fields type bullshit let's work more complaining

all they gotta do is throw us the fucking cheeseburgers bro we're gonna fucking lose it's dude it's I'm fucking over it dude I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna fuck create my own little group we're gonna all be jacked and tan and juiciest fuck and we're kick people's asses if needed you could be in my group but you can't be a fucking tired like groups sound like it existed before I know comment if you know history it does repeat itself yeah no man let's get into this cruise man I want it really new history they would think quite differently oh for sure yeah oh for sure I mean it's I mean once you like know the actual truth which is just the opposite of everything they told us it's a whole different light out here man yeah you see the world differently bro um but let's let's hop into this cruise man I want it I wanted to start this off by reminding the American people of something and I think this is important we talk about all the time we can't forget the shit they've done I think it's very very important and I found this this this little quick clip here and I just think it's important I'm in the video is titled never forget that this video exists let's check this out first of all I didn't recommend locking anything down and the record will show Neil that we didn't recommend shutting everything down I recommended to the president that we shut the country down um and that was very difficult decision because I knew it would have serious economic consequences which it did very quick video very quick video yeah well that could go for all of that I mean remember that video of the collage I think we played it on the show where it was like five minutes long of all these people talking about the how the unvaccinated people needed to be fucking ex-communicated from society and they lose their rights to function they shouldn't be allowed to have jobs and now all these people say they didn't say that shit bro fuck these people all of them they made you watch your family die on fucking zoom that's enough okay they made you guys do that bro these people deserve death all of them and that's just reality dude this needs to be there needs to be an example that is so fucking strong to the people who I'm talking about the motherfuckers who coordinated the fucking whole thing I'm not talking about the average Joe fell for it I'm not talking about your neighbor who was a shitbag and yelled at you I'm talking about the people who organized the largest psychological manipulation propaganda that's ever existed in humankind we did not ever have the internet before we didn't have the ability to blast people 24 hours a day with propaganda most of the people are victims us the people who disagree with us but this motherfucker and all his little fucking buddies deserve to be at the end of a fucking rope and that's reality and until Americans get to a fucking point where they realize that these examples need to be set for people so that nobody fucks with them ever again we're too soft to survive as a culture dude now I have this video because there was another very interesting thing that came out today or over the weekend I should say but the thing is and I want to start start with saying this first I'm an American I pledge allegiance to this country I give two fucks what happens in any other country anywhere else in the fucking world I don't until until we get our shit we are perfectly fucking kicking ass for sure yeah right but like I don't my tax dollars going anywhere I don't want my fuck I don't want nothing I give two fucks what they decide to do in any of these other countries I care about this country first okay I agree now with that being said it is very important that we watch just expose the bullshit here okay obviously Israel and Palestine they're having a conflict they've been having a conflict for over almost a year now and I saw this man I just thought this was a very interesting take I want to get your opinion on it but obviously politics aside you look at the in picture of it I think the goal for Israel is to take over that area claiming as their own create the Jewish state keep it moving I agree I think I think like again no matter what side you use your sway on there's a lot of fucking people in that area and guys are specifically how do you do that well the only reason that the rest of the Muslim community hasn't fucking blown Israel off the face of the earth is because of the United States you know and then and then you got people saying we need them more than they need us I think now motherfucker I think not yeah but like I mean how do you get like you would have to remove or or move a lot of fucking people in order to do that yeah obviously there's been bombings and things going on which have definitely you know put some dents in those numbers but then I see this thing and there's some some some supporting arguments here articles here which is interesting I saw this headline pop up this headline reads middle east crisis polio vaccinations and Gaza are beating goals WHO says right and I saw this I'm like damn listen this is weird right wait wait yeah okay okay all right yeah all right and it talks about you know this vaccine drive has been more successful than expected a WHO official says the world health organization said on Tuesday that the campaign to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza against polio had so far been more successful than expected as families flocked to receive the treatment teams of health workers delivered the two drop oral vaccine to 161,000 children in the first two days of the roughly 10-day operation surpassing the organization's goal of 150,000 for the first phase of the campaign essential Gaza quote it's going well reek peeper corn the organization's representative for the Palestinian territories told reporters by video link from Gaza on Tuesday describing and quote almost festive atmosphere as families went to designated sites to get their children vaccinated so I see that right no okay over half a million kids is their goal to get vaccinated for this polio vaccine right now let's hop in a little time machine because we have to go back to November 25th of 2019 okay and this is an article by AP okay and they put the headline reads more polio cases now caused by vaccine than by wild virus four African countries have reported new cases of polio linked to the oil vaccine as global health numbers show there are now more children being paralyzed by viruses originating in vaccines than in the wild in a report late last week the world health organization and partners noted nine new polio cases caused by the vaccine the Nigeria Congo central African Republic and Angola seven countries elsewhere in Africa have similar outbreaks in cases have been reported in Asia of the two countries where polio remains endemic Afghanistan Pakistan vaccine linked cases have been identified in Pakistan now we know that polio is a very very dangerous virus it's most of the time pretty fucking fatal but this vaccine right now this was in 2019 that this article came out again okay and then you know go a little bit further back in 2023 this article unethical to continue using polio causing oral polio vaccines where everybody said that it's unethical to use so why the fuck are they still using it today well I think it's pretty obvious why I mean fuck they're trying to eliminate the fucking population and they start with the kids oh why do you think they were fucking pushing all these young kids to get this fucking vaccine for COVID why do you think they were pushing fucking all the pregnant women to get it dude oh listen I'm not surprised at all this is how these people think this is what they do and this is what I'm talking about this is crimes against humanity over and over and over again and nobody holds them into account so they keep doing it we do we got pathetic leadership and that goes for anybody up there that's not calling for this like where where the fuck is Rand Paul who was grilling I'm grilling Dr. Fauci or Ted Cruz I'm grilling Dr. Fauci it's what I told you guys a couple weeks ago these people don't give a shit they go out there in person they put on a show and then they go back and they take their fucking farm of money and they let it go and shut the fuck up and they let people all across the world get victimized by the WHO by the world economic forum by the fucking Communist Party that is a globalist Communist Party and they're using poison and bro I mean dude look they put in a water that's real shit they put in our air that's real shit oh that's not real shit then why are they making laws the ban chemtrails in the air why did they just make laws to remove fluoride from the water why if that if that's if that's conspiracy theory then why make the law to correct it right bro these people poison the fuck out of us I wouldn't be surprised if the real human age is like 150 years old and they're just trying to fucking cycle us through you know what I'm saying yeah man who knows dude we don't even know we don't know we don't even know what the true length of a human life should be because we don't know the history all that we know of history is what they've told us so how do we know how do we know that people aren't supposed to live to 200 years old and we're getting to cut in half by these people putting chemicals in all our shit how do we know man wouldn't it make more sense for people to have a 80 year life than a 200 year life because then they would forget history would be easier to create you see what I'm saying like I know that sounds way out there for people but the truth of the matter is you don't fucking know and you do I yeah that's real man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments about this I love to hear your thoughts these people are killing these fucking kids dude intentionally bro that's good you know the the bombing got too hot so now it's oh let's put this in them let's save them you know by the way they're gonna use these uh these hostages get executed for this past week for another string of bombings they're gonna bomb the fuck out of these people again bro it's genocide it just is and anybody who says different your full of shit stupid yeah stupid man guys let's get into our headlines remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to anyfacela.com you guys can check them all out there we link them on the the site for you there with that being said uh let's get into our first headline man this is uh probably the top headline of the day um China in their spies they have in our country uh you know it's been a talk for a minute obviously we know there's a lot of influence that China has in our country um from top down left right um then mad at local level state level they're all embedded um and uh that's what that's

puts interest of other countries ahead of ours and trying to subvert our country i don't give a fuck if it's Israel i don't care if it's China i don't care if it's a Ron i don't give a fuck if it's fucking Canada or Mexico i don't care i don't care i'm so sick of our country tolerating these people who come in here subvert our processes figure out how to fuck the american people steal the tax dollars go send our kids to their wars and then we get we're fucking everybody's bitch and then we're told oh it's a free is country and it's so amazing and we're the baddest people on the earth bro we're we're the fucking iron fist covered in the white glove for the globalist that's what america is that's what it's been for over a hundred years we are the enforcers for the worst tyrants on the planet and and that's and that's the that's the result of everybody having empathy and sympathy for people like this we need to clean house they all need to go people should be fucking terrified to do anything that's even close to treasonous we how many cases of trees and have we covered us go as i'm saying this is like i mean this is not nothing new we've covered this on a few other people yeah was one in Los Angeles that just got fucking not a single dual citizen of any country should serve any position our government even at the DMV no no here's now here's my question all right because i always find it interesting we talk about this quite often where you know you're good until you're not good until the check stop until you know you don't want to go with this narrative you're you know you're you're good you will you will keep letting you play the game this bitch has been working under these offices for ten years why now why now is she being ousted did the check stop coming to hold you right like did you did you not get you was a cut start to get smaller and smaller yeah do you want more did you start getting you know i'm saying now you want to just out this lady yeah not saying she shouldn't be out it fucker but why now there's more here there's way more here that they're not fucking they all know this is going on they know it do they all know this is going on that for us to reclaim our country to belong to the america bro we are completely lied to okay we are told growing up that this is our country and it's we the people and american citizens and bro we are everybody's fucking bitch we're the only people in the world that work our asses off that work more time for our own government than we do for ourselves then the tax dollars that are taken off of our backs and put into the pockets of these you know government officials are misused misappropriate stolen used to send our people to war so they can make money bro this country doesn't belong to the people because the people have abdicated their responsibilities of being an active citizen they look at the other way when people do shit they give everybody the benefit of the doubt they take the high road they don't call for accountability they don't even pay attention to what's going on and then they look around and they're like what's going on why can't I make any money because all they're worried about is their NFL shit what they're watching on fucking Netflix who they're trying to fuck where they're trying to eat and they don't give a shit about any of this and then people say shit like this I don't really pay attention to politics well that's why it's happening because you're a fucking asshole and you won't do your city your citizen duty to pay attention what's actually going on and where your money's going and what we're actually being victimized as as an entire country full of people what are they and the danger is game is is that you know for a lot of people by the time they realize it'll be too late it's already too late it'll be too late man yeah guys I tell people this years ago do you know remember me telling people bro you got to get wealthy now or you're not going to be able to get wealthy anymore you're not going to you're not going to have a chance and people fucking laughed and now now look at them they can't afford to fucking pay their bills they're blaming everybody else bro what decisions did you make 20 years ago 10 years ago five years ago two years ago you made the easy decisions that's why you're fucking struggling right now that's the truth people were trying to warn you I was trying to warn you lots of people were trying to warn you but you chose the easy route you chose to stick your head in the sand and now you're looking around and blaming everybody but yourself it's your fucking fault it's our fault this people that this is happening and we need to change the way that we look at the people who do these things to our country and stop giving them passes and stop saying it's okay and stop saying it's okay for people that serve in our government to have dual citizenship of any country at all we need to stop saying it's okay for us to

comahera's proposes Trudeau style communist government housing plan look at all of these great things coming from whoever the fuck this lady is because we didn't know where two months ago democratic presidential candidate vice president comula heresys housing proposals are so similar to those of canadian prime minister just in trudeau that it's hard to believe she wasn't inspired by them heres appears to be as dedicated to government housing as trudeau and a fiscal policy that trump is called communist heres has promised big spending in her first 100 days in office through an investment in three million new homes trudeau's recent budget contained another 8.5 billion dollars in new spending on housing as part of a 52.9 billion and new spending that added 40 billion dollars to the national debt this was all a part of his government's plan to quote make life cost less according to trudeau finance minister christia freeland it hasn't why don't we give the tools to earn more yeah huh yeah that makes it's too hard I'm gonna educate it that makes me work yeah I don't get that one it hasn't worked however trudeau has advocated a government housing policy throughout his nine years in power while home prices and rent have skyrocketed after heres released her plans for price controls across economic sectors communism trended on x prosecuted me maker douglas mackey said that heresys housing plans sounds a lot like the central planning of ugly overcrowding that characterized soviet housing for decades now trudeau's plan commas are the same thing so let's just go check in with some canadians and see how they're doing with trudeau's communism check this clip out we got donuts over here if you want to thank you for your hard work I can bring something like this okay the 25% hair switches trot in on chinese skills yeah i'll help you out that's gonna keep my job that's yeah what about the four hundred and four hundred thousand dollars forty some taxes on thing and and i don't have the doctor the four hundred million dollars in the investment investing that uh yeah so i'm gonna have a job or i think you're only here for another year we won't see your own problem another year that's that's what elections are for that's right that's right and i i look forward to everyone exercising the right to vote yeah the basic choice we're gonna invest in you in your jobs i don't i don't believe you for a second okay dental care do you know anyone who got dental care yeah i pay for myself okay we're like three years behind the job and coverage yeah four people in my family every time we go for a dental visit mm-hmm it's cost me about fifty dollars in my pocket per person okay why i have a good job you're not really moving anything for us just actually we just invested so half a million people have been to the dentist got to go to the dentist so probably like my neighbor that doesn't go to work because she's lazy she doesn't go to work she looks the same way by the end of the end of the time to stick up to the trial and then we'll get people good luck and prepare you can also no i'm good i'm nice to have a good day sir all right the other guys got they got the donuts excellent what a piece of shit so this motherfucker brings donuts to the job site and thing that's gonna make up for completely fucking people out of their fucking shit i think saying probably say this Canadians have good self-control oh but it's so nice i know and it's a big problem for them it makes them easy to conquer mm-hmm right they've been conquered they just don't fucking admit it yeah right and then they have arguments like that like well have a good day sir well you too sir i'm not shaking your hand when you have a good day yeah like no fuck that you yeah bro that's the tower and some talking about that's ruining the entire fucking world yeah like why are we so tolerant of these people doing all of this shit why do we just sit and take it why do why do why do we do nothing you know what i'm saying there is not one person that can write along on their horse and fix everything you guys have to fix it in your own neighborhood you have to fix it in your own lives you have to fix it in your own communities and you think that someone anyone trump anybody is gonna come in and fix your shit in your community you are a fucking moron it's never gonna happen no it has to start at the bottom and work its way to the top not go from the top down to the bottom yeah man you know there's no different either than that you know we've covered this two a couple of weeks ago but that you know this other policies you should have implement that's like twenty five thousand dollars towards new home buyer purchases but again let's just gonna make everything continue to go up there is no plan to fix any of this in fact there's plans to make the shit worse just like her border and the border control with these illegal aliens that are coming through there's no plan to fix that they keep touting low numbers but that they're really just circumventing people and sending them through ports of entry and so they're not counted as illegal boarding cross I guess it's completely fucked up shit you mean how they're not reporting crime data right and you mean how they're you mean also how they're reporting crime data by illegals as white crime as white crime why would they do that because I can't have now listen to this is a crazy thing because you actually made a prediction a while ago about how there is going to be some issues between these illegal migrants and the American people I yeah right and and we are starting to see these trends push up and up and up and up last week we talked about that Venezuelan gang in Colorado right well they just made a massive push in Chicago I don't know if you saw this 32 armed Venezuelan gang members overtake apartment complex in sanctuary city of Chicago listen to this this is this is the dispatchers audio between the dispatcher and Chicago police just listen to this real quick man yeah listen to me I'm sitting right for some of the gun six one two four South King drive colors south 32 Venezuelans are trespassing the building showing guns in the courtyard and they have motorcycles in the courtyard as well also well they're filled nothing further don't clear pretty tough yeah I'm sorry you had to go with the shots better to the sixty one twenty four and King for the migrants okay go out there's another building in the drive of three ten we had multiple calls for the gun sixty one twenty four South King off of the moment to distribute large gathering the to be thirty two Venezuelans shots passing in the building property showing guns in the courtyard it motorcycles in the hallway all three are filled and nothing further they received a bunch of these calls about this one place in particular but to your to your prediction of this migrant American issue conflict that would be coming this video comes out of this man who goes by the ruler and this is his message I don't know if you've seen this video clip let's check this out to all Venezuelans in Chicago this is this is the water if you ain't on no bullshit stay neutral somebody please translate stay neutral if you know somebody that's in your building on bullshit don't let them run in that building and don't let nobody see them running that building because once we're gonna get out that that's the building that they in they're gonna chop that bitch down whatever building they're abandon building you y'all I keep pining all that shit yeah you better get your food and just stay in the house because they come out doing some bullshit they're all gonna regret that you're gonna really regret that so I don't speak Spanish so somebody need to translate I hope they got they got TikTok that translate I guess they can kind of make me seem like I'm speaking Spanish but anyway take it for take this like a grain of salt if you like but the same Colorado the same the same Utah this ain't none of them places this is just like where you from the only difference deals y'all use a lot of handgun old revolvers and machetes and shit we got switches we got switches if you not for me with what a switch is we will show you we don't really be it without a telling shit but we will definitely show you what a switch is so again somebody translate yeah make this known this ain't this ain't like this ain't like Colorado that sounds like fun bro we need we need the black Americans and the white Americans to become the patriotic Americans that we should be and we need to go fucking read the society of these fucking fucks okay I agree with this man dude I hope they follow through but I will say this I think there's a lot of people in the black community that aren't prepared for actual third world people who know how to fucking survive okay it's really easy to ride up and down the street and shoot your homie or some dude to fuck your chick it's a whole different thing to to combat against an entire gang that's used to operating together so and to definitely seem like this is like way more organized would just leads to the fact that I think that that's why is our police that we're paying taxes to and our our national guard that we pay taxes to fund or our military why have they not fucking gone in and made an example out of these people there's a real good reason why there's only one reason why am I what do you think it is because they want to allow it meaning it's intentional they want chaos they want more of it in in these fucking areas bro that's right they want more because there's no good reason that you can give me I'm gonna tell you this why this shit starts happening here in St. Louis we're gonna fucking handle it it's gonna get handled because I know for sure people I hear don't fuck around fuck no bro you can't go to the hill and step out of fucking line no we want to be I want we want to allow it bro they're gonna try that shouldn't leave me ain't gonna happen yeah yeah ain't gonna fucking happen yeah it doesn't matter if it's a white neighborhood or it don't matter but let's run real old school dude anything going to happen yeah anything will happen here guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being so let's get to our third and final headline here quickly headline number three when they talk about the Venice waylands all I think about is that fucking douchebag that we cover that was telling them all to come here and how to make mine then and then he was on there the next day crying yeah yeah we need to send them all home crying yeah fuck that dude I'm head line number three this is an interesting one that just came out not sure what it means yet but let's talk about it a little bit read this headline 11th circuit will reverse judge canons mara logo dismissal per attorney judge ilean canons decisions who dismiss the federal classified documents case against Donald Trump will be overturned in the courts a legal expert has said david lat a former federal prosecutor and legal commentator said in the blog post that the united states courts of appeal for the eleventh circuit will back special counsel jack smith and reverse the decision from canon canon ruled in july that the forty federal charges against trump over his alleged mishandling of classified materials and attempts to obstruct the federal government from retrieving them from its mara logo resorts should be thrown out trumply did not guilty to all of the charges canon who was nominated to the bench by trump back the former president's argument that smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel in the case by attorney general maric garland because it was not approved by the state smith has appealed the decision to the eleventh circuit accusing canons decision of being quote at odds with widespread and long standing appointment practices at the department of justice so and as an original jurisdiction blog lat predicted that the eleventh circuit would overturn canons decision noting that attorney can white to scrap smith brief as very strong and completely brutal quote although interestingly enough it does not seek removal of judge ilean canon from the case lat wrote i adhered to my prior prediction that the eleventh circuit will reverse judge canon he wrote uh quote but i remain uncertain about how the supreme court would rule if they decide to hear the case given the strong feelings that some conservative judges have about the separation of powers and executive authority reflected in of course their ruling in trump v us i'm also known as the immunity case the presidential immunity case that was uh been out now was what what what happened of this so i mean if trump wins in the twenty twenty four elections he could order the to do j to drop the federal investigation into him once he enters office in january of twenty twenty five there were frequent calls to canon to be removed from the case over her past rulings with smith appearing reluctant to take the necessary steps to do so and the doj of course resure reached out for comment to which they declined now with that being said there was this poll i thought was interesting because with all of the stuff so happening the new indictments that just came down to the billy there was four more indictments against trump just a week or two ago um mark cuban um who by any means i believe he's more left leaning i think i really hate trump he fucking hates trump yeah right um i think business wise he's definitely conservative but i don't i don't know i we don't know you don't know how many what i don't know yeah i don't know i who knows who knows what businesses he has who knows how much he works with china who knows how much he believes that you know a communist state would actually help him he's over the hump you gotta realize and communism the rich get richer he's already super rich he get a lot richer the middle class everybody else goes to progress suffers yeah so you know nobody knows it certainly isn't in the interest of anybody else but himself to have those views yeah i thought this was interesting so he put out a poll on his twitter um asking people whose persona and character would you like to see young children grow up to have with the options being comelag or nonal trump one almost 70 to 30 bro and that's with his audience which i thought was interesting i mean if that doesn't show you something i don't know well he's having a problem reading the room that's what he's destroying his own personal brand he thought that that poll was gonna be commonly fucking trump 10 to 1 that's right and then when it turned out this way he bitched about it being uh like extra centering yeah right yeah right they're set yeah so fun with my audience yeah bro look dude people have gone people have gone from loving mark cumin to thinking he's a fucking dirt back fucking idiot in the last three or four years that's you know and he doesn't care because he's like well fuck him because that's always been his attitude but like i mean brother you know go well go broke it's uh it's not it's not a good look now the government is going to make him some very very interesting pushes i believe as we talk about within the next two months what they can do we we talk about those options all the time but i do think it's interesting there certain things are trying to come out that just don't make sense in the headlines right like always get one to two of those and i wanted to get your thoughts on this one um because it's super weird that this comes out at this time this headline reads marketing firm admits using your own phone to listen in on your conversations no shit yeah of course no shit we've been on this but why are they finally trying to admit it and let's look at the responses of these phone companies and tech companies and see what they had to say about this article coming out your long held suspicions are confirmed according to a report your phone really is listening to you a marketing firm whose clients include facebook and google has privately admitted that it listens to users smart phone microphones and then places ads based on the information that is picked up according to 404 media Cox media group the television and radio news conglomerate admitted in a pitch deck to investors that it's quote active listening software uses AI to capture real time intent data by listening to our conversations according to the report quote advertisers compare this voice data with behavioral data to target and market consumers the company wrote in the pitch deck CMG noted in the deck that consumers quote leave a data trail based on their conversations and online behavior and that the AI powered software collects and analyze said behavioral and voice data from 470 plus sources the slideshow includes claims at facebook google and amazon are clients of CMG's active listening service google removes CMG from its partners program website after it was contacted by 404 media to comment on the matter quote all advertisers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations as well as our google ad policies and when we identify ads or advertisers that violate these policies we will take appropriate action a Google spokesperson told the post meta the parent company a facebook and instagram admitted it was reviewing CMG to see whether it violated any of its terms of service quote meta does not use your phones microphones for ads and we've been public about this for years a sp meta spokesperson told the post quote we are reaching out to CMG to get them to clarify that their program is not based on meta data and amazon spokesperson told 404 media that it's advertising arm quote has never worked with CMG on this program and has no plans to do so the company said that it would take action against any partner that violates its rules now last December mine sift a new hamster based company bragged that it used voice data to place targeted ads by listening to people's everyday conversations through microphones on their devices according to 404 media the report revealed the existence of CMG's active listening feature quote we know what you're thinking is this even legal the company wrote in a sense deleted Cox blog post from November 23 quote it is legal for phones and devices to listen to you when a new app download or update prompts consumers with a multi-page term of use agreements somewhere in the fine print active listening is often included that i don't know if this was a whistleblower what the only thing that that that enter like you know create some peak some some thought provoking action on my end is like you know they're trying to use this guys of AI we've been saying this shit for fucking years AI is relatively new no relatively new to us right right I knew it's been used for fucking decades dude look man I said this a thousand times you people think I'm insane every single thing you say every single website you look at every single thing you type on your computer every single conversation you have within the listening distance of a microphone on a device whether it be your laptop a cell phone a television whatever all of it every single photo you send every single text you send every single thing every all of it is fucking recorded and stored on what's called the stream and they have a backup of the entire internet that they have available to them for everything that you've ever done said text everything everything for every person and they use these things to blackmail people to get people in line to prosecute people when they choose to need to remove someone from society have you ever wondered why you know we watched these all these tv shows and then they just happen to have this recorded part of the conversation that you know why would someone record this conversation well that's because all of it's being recorded and it's all being compiled to use against you in case you become too much of a threat all right that's exactly what's going on and to think any different is completely naive at this point in time and if if you're thinking about this and you're listening to this and you're watching this right now you should think about all the conversations you've had about what's going on in the world okay and you should think about have organized people based upon the actual beliefs that they share with their friends and family and private on a certain list do you think they've done that because wouldn't they want to do that wouldn't they want to know what you actually believe versus what you say you believe in public and then if they already know what you actually believe and why the fuck are you hesitating to say so in public because all you're allowing them to do is to take more and more and more and more ground from us and use it against us so they already know what you think they already know what you believe they already know all your shit they know all the shit that you do that you don't want nobody knowing they know all of our shit and for that reason alone we should all look at each other and be like fuck them okay and stand up for what the fuck is right and what needs to happen these tech companies have fucking ruined the world they've taken reality from us we no longer have the quality of life that we had before it and the four or five or 20 of these people are mega fucking rich they make all the money and they take all of our attention our time our communication everything that makes humanity humanity our life experience our lived experience and they put it on this fucking phone and then they psychologically manipulate us to be fat to be weak to be sick to be controllable for their own benefit against our interests and dude I'm sick of this shit you all are sick of it too but my biggest point here is if they already have you and they already know what the fuck you think why are you hesitating to voice what you want when that only gives them more strength and more power it will never be easier to fight these people that it is today it will get harder tomorrow it will get harder the next day it will get harder the next day and when I say fight I mean resist I mean call it out I mean stand up it will only get harder this fight that we are all in for our own lives and our quality of lives and this country and the world to be free is only going to get more difficult the longer that we wait and the reason that we haven't won the battle yet is because a lot of people who have secret beliefs in private are not willing to voice them in public or live them in public so if they already know what the fuck you think why the fuck are you staying silent why are you continuing to be quiet why are you continuing to not voice what you know to be true they already know they know what you think you're not going to be safe you're not going to hide they know so if we all stood up and we all said fuck this they couldn't do anything and that's what's happening so when you say why is this happening this is happening because you won't stand up and call out what you know to be true and right and ethical and good for you good for your family and good for this fucking country you guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think man that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is what we bring in a headline we talk about it to get one of those two options Andy sir you are an entrepreneur you have hired plenty of people you have fired plenty of people so I thought this would be an interesting thumbs up or dumb as fuck for you get your thoughts on this thumbs of thumbs up or dumb as fuck hell on reads this company will quit your job for you colleagues aren't worth saying goodbye to what yeah wait wait wait wait so you're saying that these are the same people that bring their parents to the interview yeah bro so they can't they don't this is what I was talking about just a second ago they've handicapped people to be so dependent so weak so disgustingly fucking inept that now there's a company that will call and quit their job for them because they can't have a conversation but they can go online and say all the shit they want right or warriors bro so let's dive into this man while the great resignation may quitting seem easy exiting an unsatisfying job is proving to be harder for some overseas ushering in a new wave of businesses that help workers resign from their roles in Japan companies are caching in on employees hesitancy to call it quits and helping unhappy people leave the jobs once such service is exit which oversees the resignations of 10,000 people per year and even offers half off for returning clients quote Americans may be surprised but I was too shy or too scared to say what I think co-founder uh Toshiyoshi Nino 34 told the Wall Street Journal quote Japanese are not educated to debate and express opinions um similar services have cropped up across the country which has 2.7% unemployment and staffing shortages per the journal uh at quitting agencies like competitor albatross the staff calls clients places of employment and declares they are quitting and specifies other details uh such as when their last day will be how to return company issue tech or uniforms and more albatross staffer Ayume Sikini who's 24 came to work at the agency after experiencing her own difficulty quitting a previous role uh Sikini uh who now understands the stress of resignation uh faced opposition when attempting to resign from her former job at a gas company and was only able to leave for good after crying and begging her boss has that ever happened to you like what do you mean somebody like had to beg you to like to quit how do you keep someone that wants to quit we fucking gravel we put them in a closet like no that's never happened like first of all we get quality individuals here even if even the ones that leave are usually very quality individuals and I wish done the best and I wish that when they leave here they're gonna say dude you know what the best thing I ever did was spend my time over there because I learned this and this and this and this which allowed me to be successful here I take pride in that no no one's ever cried and begged I don't beg people to stay either like it's like we get normal people here yeah we don't get people bringing their parents to fucking jobs here like I imagine what I say on the internet and then imagine everybody that works here has heard it already so everybody that comes here or works in anything that I do already knows how the fuck it is and they come here because they want to win not because they want to be in some fucking week ass turd environment yeah okay so we got winners here so no I never deal with this I've never dealt with that it seems absurd and in fact I think the people who have to hire a company like this probably deserve you know every hardship that's coming their way like if you don't have enough yeah balls and you can't say oh what about the women because women got balls now too right yeah and if you said and if you say they know you're a big it careful all right so if you don't have enough fucking balls to resign from your job your life is gonna be very difficult yeah fuck it just is and you deserve it I wonder how much they're making off of this bro you know what I think needs to happen what's that like dude I think there needs to be a website where every hundred dollars hold on I think there needs to be a website where every employee of every company ever has a profile on it and the companies and the co-workers get to rate that employee oh that's like glass door reverse yeah yeah because dude there everybody that leaves this isn't true I'm not saying for my company but I see this online a lot people leave their jobs and they leave this job and then that job and then that job and it's always the jobs fault I would like to read what the fuck they were like I would like to read from their co-workers I would like to read from their management I would like to read from their company and if we had that you wouldn't see these motherfuckers running their mouths out in the world about this and that and this because everybody would know so here's a fucking idea for you entrepreneurs go create that get all the businesses subscribe to it and you'll make a fucking gazillion motherfucking dollars just cut me off a little slice bro that's actually I mean that's fucking geez yeah I come up with 400 good ideas a day that I can't do so there's a free there's a free one for you 200 dollars bro is it what they're paying 200 fucking dollars do they negotiate that to be in your last check like how does that work fuck man I you know what dude it's society bro like I saw this I saw this video the other day I mean look dude this is unrelated to this like this is obviously ridiculous dumb as fuck for sure yeah but and bro how world with how different would the world be if every fucking employee knew that their company and all their fucking co-workers were gonna rate them after they left somewhere hmm how different would their work actually that's right be a lot different so anyway because I quite honestly I don't think it's fair that companies get rated but people don't know that's right it's always one sided you know and 10 it's gotten better right 10 years ago if someone went on the internet and talked shit about where they worked everybody believe the person now if the person goes out and talk shit about where they work everybody's like yeah another one so what the fuck to do yeah what you do this time right so it's changed but because it's harder for companies that's fucking exist well no you you don't have any repercussions because then they play victim and they say oh you're fucking bullying me what the fuck are you talking about dude you you said this this was not true you were like this that was true and you're like tell a half of the story luckily for us you know in the world everybody knows those people are full of shit but the point of what I'm saying here which has nothing to do with this story is I saw this video of this woman who was wearing this like fish net top and like literally like a bikini top underneath it and you could see like the sides of her fucking very old this area was okay and there was a fucking pole on the picture and the pole said is this appropriate for a first date and bro this ain't appropriate for anywhere but like better maybe the bedroom right fucking half the women in the fucking pole were like dude we're women we can wear whatever they want half the dudes were like oh I like like bro society is so like it's fallen so far culturally it's just disgusting dude and for it to change you're gonna have to be the change you're gonna have to live the change and I'm just I'm super frustrated like today and the last couple days just with like the amount of and like dude I'm not like some prude like I'm not some dude that doesn't that hasn't lived any life or doesn't enjoy having fun or you know like that's not but like bro this is not okay it's not okay for women to go out on dates with their fucking nipple sticking out it's just not you know I'm saying like kids see that other people see that other people are like and then and then we see dude supporting it and like like dude I'm just disgusted with the way that the world is and like I said I'm not some fucking you know one of these people yeah like one of these ultra conservatives over here but like I side with them because the world needs a correction you know what I mean and it's just gross dude like where are we gonna be in 20 more years where it is walk around fucking naked with fucking dildos hanging out of her fucking shit like bro you know what I'm saying yeah well it's already you
