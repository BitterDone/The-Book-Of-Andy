What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realest cigarette of the lives to thickness and delusions about our society and welcome to motherfucking reality. Guys today we have Andy and DJ crews of the motherfucking in and that's what we're gonna do. And then we got a plus one to you. Mm-hmm. Mr. Tim Grover. No! What's up man? Everything is excellent. I'm at one of my favorite places where were my favorite human beings. That's mutual. Yeah. That's mutual. You guys don't know. No, Tim is one of the greatest performance coaches ever both mental and physical. He is coached a number of the legendary athletes that you guys know of. Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan. You've seen the last dance. You've seen Tim. He's in there. Dwayne Wade. I mean all kinds of guys. I think you've done some stuff with with our buddy Bryce up there in Philadelphia. Yeah. We've done we've added a couple you know we've added Max Crosby. Yeah. From the Las Vegas Raiders. Paul. Yes. Don't. Yes. Paul Schienz from the Pittsburgh Pirates. Also, Staten. Yeah. The best of the best. No. That's who goes to Tim. The best of the best. And I just so happen to be a very fortunate man to get to call Tim and have a good friendship with him and he helps me out as well. So we help each other out. Yeah. That's what that's what I'm about. You know what's awesome about our relationship and the relationship with first form and all the clients. It's never a one way street. It's never what it's never one way street. That might be a lie. He might be a liar. No, no, not not not not wrong. You know, I can call you for anything. You know, you can call me for anything. It's like I've always said, you know, if I needed a car and say Andy, he'd send me anything like that. Yeah, whatever whatever I want. I just say pick pick one and Lily. It would be at my door the next day. No questions asked. That's a fact. Yeah. But DJ would be driving it there. They wouldn't make it. I just said DJ was coming. Yeah. So what's been going on, man? Everything is excellent, man. Everything is excellent. Taking care of my health, getting into some new ventures and you know, I wanted to really expand this relationship that we have. I cannot really find too many. Everyone talks about being like-minded and there's very few individuals that are actually like-minded, you know, what I think about us is our minds are like beautifully haunted. Yeah. Well, they're like, yeah, that's a nice way to say that. There's a nice, yeah. You know, they're beautifully haunted, but we've gone through some stuff. Yeah. We've gone through some stuff, you know, and I tell everybody, everybody talks about their dreams, all the other stuff. It's just like how you get to this point is how you deal with your nightmares. And both you and I have dealt with some- dealt with some nightmares and continue to deal with them. Yeah. You know, everybody, before you can daydream, before you can daydream, you got to deal with what the nightmares have visaged you at night. Yep. Yep. Dude, I was thinking about this. You know, when I first met Tim, you guys don't know the backstory. We got a lot of new listeners. I don't think I know how you guys met. Yeah. So, dude, when my business, or when our business, around 2012, 2013, 2014, 2014, we started doing very well. And it became like overwhelming to go from how hard we were struggling to how well we were doing. And that sounds like a great thing, except when you don't know what the fuck you're doing, it's super hard. And I was having a really hard time relating to people, man. Like, my whole life, I've been so competitive and wanted to win so bad. And I just, and I still feel this way. Yeah, I'm not wanting to still, does. Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't go away. No, it's in your fucking blood, bro. It doesn't go, if you don't believe me, if you ever get a chance to come to headquarters, just ask for pops. Yeah. I mean, everything here is a competition. And it's like, when I was going through that time, I didn't have anybody fucking talk to, bro. Like, I didn't have anybody that really understood how hungry and how bad and how desperate I was to win. And when you talk to people and you're built like that, you feel fucking crazy, dude. And then what happens is, is over the course of time, when you spent years and years and years and years like that, you start to feel like you're the one that's totally fucked. And everybody else is normal. Because just like a lot of people I said on today's real talk, most people never really meet someone who is actually a top level performer or anything. They go their whole life and they never, ever, ever actually meet that person. And when you're, when you're wired that way, you feel the same way, but the other way, you go your whole life and you don't meet anybody that thinks like you that doesn't think you're crazy, that doesn't think you're fucked up, that doesn't think you're too intense. And dude, it's a super lonely thing. Super lonely. And I picked up this book, because you guys know I'm a big reader. I picked up this book called Relentless. I had, I did not know Tim. I had never met him. I didn't know much about him. I knew, I knew you coached Michael Jordan. That's what I knew. And I picked up the book. I read the book and it changed my fucking life, dude. I mean, the way the book categorizes achievement and achievers and their mentalities into basically, you know, four different categories. I mean, there's three, but the fourth one is you're fucking irrelevant, right? But, you know, I read all this and I was like, oh, this makes sense. Got it. The guys, the guys who are doing shit are doing shit because they have this different quality about them in this different way of living. And that kind of gave me permission to like be me. And it was super fucking important in my life. And I said this the first time I had Tim on, I always say this, dude, I was going through such a dark time at that time because, dude, when you feel like you're all alone like that, you start to think like, what the fuck is the point of this? Like, I'm all alone. I'm fucking crazy. Nobody sees what I'm going through. Nobody gets hit. Everybody tells me I'm too intense or insane or all these things and none of them are good. And when you start to like realize, oh, you're not the only one that makes you feel better. But when you do feel like you're the only one, you're like, what the fuck is the point of this? Like, what? What am I doing? And real talk, that book, that book, I say it, and I tell everybody this, I mean, that book saved my life. I wouldn't sell that book for a hundred fucking million dollars. That their original book that I myself are a hundred. I wouldn't sell it. I'd get you another one. Trust me. And I would bend it. And I would bend all the pages and sweat on them. Do whatever you need to do. We'll split it. We'll split it. Dude, it's just such a, it was such an important realization in my life. And then fast forward a year or two later, we both were speaking at the original 10X. Yes. And standing next to each other. Yeah. So I'm looking at, I'm like, oh, this is what happened. So when I'm posting the book, or when I read the book, I posted it. And he started getting all these tags and shit and the book started moving. And then, you know, a couple of years later, we went to, we both got, uh, higher to speak at 10X. Yes. And he's standing like one row in front of me. And I'm like, holy fuck. There's fucking Tim Grover. And he looks back at me. He's like, Andy, because he recognized me for social. Yeah. And then dude, that's always a weird thing too. Like when you meet those people in person, it wasn't weird when we met. It was like we knew each other a whole lot. Yes. Instantly. Yeah. Really. It was fucking cool, man. And we've been friends since. That was probably 2014 or 2015. Yeah. You know, and the thing that you say, the reason the, like-minded individuals attract like-minded individuals, you know, it's funny. People that never pay the price are the ones that scream the loudest. Yeah. And the ones that pay the price are the ones that live in silence. Yeah. You know, because when you scream, nobody hears you. Not literally nobody's around to hear you. Because they're not, they don't, they don't understand. I got this thing that I talk about. And everything that you've gone through, everything that you're going through at the highest level, people don't understand when you go from everything you've worked towards. And all of a sudden, it just happens. And there's a whole level that winning brings that people just don't understand because they've never been at that level. All they see- All the ins, insularity things that come in your life. Yes. They just see the balloons that confetti, the money, the cough. They have, they have Lily no idea. And I Lily call it the trauma of winning. Yeah. What's real shit? I can tell you that your life changes. Yes. I mean, the way people see you changes, the way people treat you changes. And usually, and meaningful way, it's not that great. You go from being a human being to being a solution of problems. To being a resource. Lily, everybody's pulling at you. They're lily pulling at you. You become a resource for everything. Need money, need product, need this, need that. Can you help me with this? Can you help me with that? Can you become the resource? And then you're still trying to find some peace among yourself while everybody else is taking pieces and your peace from you. Yeah. Dude, I still would, I would still rather be this way than be broke and irrelevant. I mean, you're trading boring shit. No pressure, no relevancy. Dude, that's it. That's it. You go through all these pressure situations of building a life, building a business, missing everything you want to become relevant. You don't want to be relevant. And there's a lot of people that choose not to be relevant. There's no pressure in anybody's life, critiquing and criticizing everybody else. You know what's interesting, as you say, that I'm thinking about like, that whether you choose whichever path you choose, because it is a choice. Whatever you end up getting, like for me, like for, okay, for someone who's never like acted on their ambitions or dreams, right? That first day, that second day, that third day, fucking kills them, dude. It's totally out of like their routine, right? They're used to like just cruising, no pressure, no big deal. But then you take someone who's acclimated to the pressure and you try to make them sit on the fucking couch for a day, and it's equally as difficult. People just don't believe that. And it's crazy to think about like, I've been thinking, you know, I knew you were coming on. I was kind of been thinking about different aspects of winning that nobody really talks about. And one of the things that nobody ever fucking talks about is, you know what I'm saying? Like it's one thing to get to the top, it's another thing to stay there, right? Like I started thinking about that, and I always thought, yeah, but you know, it's probably just, that's probably something people say when they want a lot. And I started like breaking it down. And what it really means, dude, and like what we really have to understand is that when you win, because we are all in a competition, whether it's business, whether it's personal, whether it's at your job, whether it's with yourself, but at the end of the day, the bar we set by winning is always going to be pursued by other people. Okay, let's take business, for example. We win, we do good, our company wins, we become the best in the industry. Now we've set a new bar, and that bar becomes the mark that everybody else is trying to surpass. All right, but here's the thing. Most companies will look around and they will say, oh, well, we're, we're, we're fucking this company. We deserve to win. No, you don't. And you don't deserve to, you don't deserve anything. Okay, because what happens is these companies come in and they win, you know, let's say, 20% more than that bar that you already set, which means that you have to exceed their target when they're trying to beat you. So like if they're coming in at 20%, you got to come in at 22%. And that 22% is 22% above the best fucking effort you could have ever given in your entire life where you bled, you sweat, you cried, you stressed, you fucking went crazy. And now you got to do more. First, I got to do more. Bro, and that's a game nobody talks about. They don't understand that. Like that's why so many people cannot, they only have so much. Now, there is people who perpetually win their whole lives, but they're so fucking rare because dude, it's exhausting. It is. It's fucking exhausted. Even if you're wired for it, even if you're built for it, it's, it's fucking exhausting, dude. Imagine setting the bar and then every year having to figure out how to fucking do better than that when that was your best. And then you're only a year down the road. It's not like you're 10 years down the road. There's a big difference between me now and me 10 years ago or me even four years ago. But me last year, that's a little difference. And you're expected to produce a big result. And it's fucking hard, dude. And that's something people don't understand. It's to be financially successful in life and to win. You have to win for a long time. One year is not going to cut it. No. So it has to become who the fuck you are. And a problem that I see, and I would like to hear your, your take on this, the problem I see in society is like society has become so mediocre and so soft and so fucking weak that they take people who are built to win and create and, and become and set the bar for society. And they make them think there's something fucking wrong with them. They tell them they're crazy. They tell them they work too hard. They tell them they're out of balance. Well, guess what, motherfuckers? These are the people that create the world for you to live in. You know what I'm saying? So why not just let them fucking do their thing instead of criticizing them and say thank you for making the world a better place for me to live in. Like these things nobody ever thinks about, bro. You know what I'm saying? Dude, when we think about like, like the cost to do that and live that way, it's, it's fucking substantial. It's a real thing. And it's interesting how everybody around thinks that they're going to live this big life, this crazy life. You know, we got all these knuckleheads out here telling everybody they're going to be rich in a week. And people just aren't prepared for the fucking journey, bro. They're not built for it. And I try to tell people that and they're like, you're discouraging me. If that discourages you, bro, you don't have what it takes. You got it. That's it. Because if you really had what it takes, nothing would discourage you. I'm just trying to prepare people who aren't built for it to not waste their lives in something that they're not like, bro, I'm not playing in the NBA. Like I would appreciate it if Tim, if I went out and fucking tried to be in the NBA, if Tim pulled me a size, I come here. I say for you, Andy, my boy, you know how many of my clients that had came through my facility when I was heavily involved in training, I would pull them aside and say, listen, you're not good enough. And they were not, they were not believing. I said, listen, I'm telling you the truth. You are not good enough. I said, you can make some money overseas. You can make some money in the developmentally. But I said, you are not. And then somebody else would pull that individual and say, oh, Grover doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. And they would take them. They'd go work out somewhere else. They'd go train somewhere. If somewhere else, 10 years later, I'd run into him and they'll become up to me and say, you're the only person that told me the truth. Yeah, bro. You're the only person that told me the truth. You know, it's going back to what you said, making it to the top is not the same as making it at the top. Yeah. Dude, all right. You've seen how many businesses, how many, how many athletes, how many individuals they get to the top. All right. And now what you just said, the improvement from there is so difficult. You know, look at, look at your company. Everybody, man, you guys got the best, you got the best products. You got the best products. You said, no, we're going to make them, we're going to make them even better. Well, how do you improve on the best? How do you improve on the best? Everybody, when you guys got into the energy space, what are you doing, man? You guys are crazy. You know, this is out of your wheelhouse. You need to stay with us. And you know what your answer is. Watch me. Yeah. Well, figure it the fuck out. Yeah. Watch because that's what people do. That's what winners do. They figure things out. What society wants now, they want an easy job. They want lots of free time and they want to make lots of money. Yeah. That puzzle doesn't fit. No, it doesn't. It just, none of those pieces fit, none of those pieces fit together. They just don't. Dude, I was sitting, I was sitting with my buddy, Zoltan. You might be familiar with him. He plays guitar for five finger deathbond. Yes. He, we were sitting in my house one night and I was going through, you know, a challenging time. And we were just talking, we were talking a little bit about this because like dude, even after you like realize that you're built for it, you start sometimes you're around enough people, you're like, fuck, this is, I am crazy. You know, you start believing that there's something wrong with you again. And I was going through one of those phases and he's like, bro, did you ever consider the fact that like we need people in the world of fucking that love the fucking war? Like we need people like you. Like there's nothing wrong with you, dude. And I'm like, you were sitting there. Yeah, I was there. I was like, I was there. Fuck, that's, that's accurate. Like what am I doing trying to fucking calm my shit down and like who you're supposed to be? Dude, that's what I'm saying. And that struggle that that struggle is very common with ambitious people. We have two kinds of people. We have at least people in you here this all the time. We got these people that haven't done shit. They're not wired to do shit. They think there's somebody that they aren't. These are all the guys who read your book and say, well, I'm a fucking cleaner. Right? And what do we say? A cleaner never calls himself a cleaner because that's the nature of success. Like we, you know, oh, how do you feel now that you've made it to fuck you talking about bro? Made what? Yes. That's what I'm talking about. Like the brownies. I mean, they were good. You know, like I just, we just don't think that way. You know, I think there's a very big problem with the world. I think a lot of, because we obviously have a lot of people who are high achievers on the, that listen to the show or want to be. And one of the biggest problems, man, is that like we're constantly inundated with this weak fucking victim bullshit. You know, you, you, you got to, you got to balance your day out or you have to do this. So you got to do this and, you know, you got to have peace and mother fucker. I got fucking darkness and war and destruction in my fucking heart. Yeah. And if this were the 1400s, I'd be riding around on a horse, cut mother fuckers heads off. Okay. But instead, lucky for society, I can do business. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, so we have to understand there are people that are built for this. And if you're one of these people that's built for this, when you consume all this fucking bullshit on the internet, it starts to fuck you up. And you have to realize that that is written for everybody else. That is not written for the people that changed the mother fucking world. That is written for your average dude who is stressed because fucking he didn't cut the grass yet this week or whatever, right? Like, it's, it's not for you. And I think that's a big deal that like a lot of you guys who have ambitions and goals and dreams, you have to realize. That shit will fuck you up. You need to stay the fuck away from it. Everybody that of every client that I've ever worked with from a business standpoint, from an athletic standpoint, when you talk about cutting the grass and all that. And see, this is how why we relate so well. Winners have this thing. They need to finish. They need to finish everything. That they started at the highest, highest level. There's a thing I must finish. I must finish this. No matter, somebody says, man, you can do, you can do this tomorrow. You can, we don't see tomorrow. We don't, we don't, we don't see tomorrow. All right. We see the moment now. We see the moment now and we know we have to finish and finish at the highest level because if we're fortunate enough to have tomorrow, there's more things that need to be finished. Yeah. There are more things that need to be finished. And that's why when people tell you you need to unwind, you need to relax, we are the most uncomfortable when we are unwound. It's just like, it's not, it's not, it's not a good, it's not a good, it's not a good feeling. We relax in ways that are special to us. We release for a moment in ways that are unique to us that the other society people just don't understand. They don't understand and a lot of times they don't approve either. Yeah. Well, we're not looking for, we're not looking for their approval because here's the thing. If we're looking for their approval, we're them. Yeah. I don't shit. We're them. All right. And what it is is when you talk about all the information that everybody's indicted out there with when I look at those things, that's entertainment for us. Yeah. It's lily, it's lily, it's lily, it's lily entertainment. It's just like, well, we just lack, anytime there's a negative post and I've never reacted to one. I just laugh. I just, I just, I just laugh because here's the thing. If you get emotional about something that's set about you or you say about something or something that you post on your podcast on your different platforms and people say, you're fucking crazy, you're this, you're right. You just struck a nerve. Yeah. You just, you just, you just, and what happens when you strike, strike a nerve? The first thing is for them to put up their, their, their defense shield because now what happens is they're so busy trying to expose you. They just got exposed. They just got the mirror does not lie. The mirror, there's a reason for me or in your 75, in your 75 heart, you say every single day, every single workout, take a picture of yourself. Because that mirror does not lie. You lie. But that mirror is not lying. No, never does. And how many times is it going back on that, you know, and I know that you've had millions of people do, do that program. How many fucking times have you started over? Quite a few. I've had a hard time this year to be honest. Yeah. And I've been doing it for, well, look, it's called 75 fucking heart. It's not, you don't get used to it because you have to push yourself to do it. But if you're doing it right, if you're doing it right, you are pushing yourself to do it. And it's not just easy, no matter who you are. But yeah, bro, lots of times. And you don't get used to winning. No. Because there's always more, there's always more, there's always more. You like, yeah, you won that. That's great. That's great. But what's next? What if this always has to be a next? You know, we talk about, you know, I use this analogy or not a lot, okay? Hell is definitely a place. It's a place, okay? But hell is a place where you either stay or you start. We've all started in hell. Winners decide not to stay. Most people love to stay. And everybody thinks, hell is this like this crazy place. And hell is one of the most comfortable environments out there because that's where all you excuses live. That's all the same people that, you know, you tell them, oh, everything's going to be great. Oh, you don't have to worry about, you don't have to, you don't have to worry about this. They point fingers at everybody, everybody else. It's, everybody says, come on, come on over here. This is where it's comfortable. This is where, where, you know, we, we under, we understand you. We shouldn't have to work so hard. You don't, you don't have to be successful. You don't have to want, you don't have to want it all in the back. Yeah, you know what? That's great. And it's constantly trying to pull you back. It's constantly trying to pull you back. But what we do is, and every CEO, because every company that's running a business and, you know, that's public out there, they got investors. They got, they got people that have bought stock into it. They bought the company and they're like, okay, yeah, we finished off this physical year and under stock prices X. Great. We can't be here the same place next year. So what do those individuals do? They're like, oh man, we made it. We made it. We made it. We made it as soon as they, as soon as that year, books close, what do they do? They take that trip back to hell. But they don't stay there. They don't stay there. The most people that run businesses into the ground or get to a certain level or athletes, whatever, whatever, whatever may be individuals or so forth. When they make that trip back to hell again and people say, hey, man, you don't have to do that again. You don't have to be, you don't have to work that hard. No worry about those people. Just relax. Unwind. Come on, enjoy, enjoy yourself and so forth. And there's more people. It's that tug of war. It's more of those people tugging at you. And then you look at yourself and you're like, no, I can't stay here. I can't stay here. I need to, this is a place where I'm going to start, but I'm not going to stay here. But then you look at your hands and you know, you look at how bloody they are. They got the calluses. They got the, they got the blisters. You look at yourself, you look at yourself in the, in the, in the, in the fate. You look yourself in the face and you're like, man, people are like, I'm worn out. I'm, I'm tired. But you, everybody looks at those things as being ugly and you look at those things as being fucking beautiful. Yeah, you're like, you look at them and being, there is nothing. There is nothing more powerful than an individual that can heal their own wounds. So when they see those wounds on themselves, they know they earn them. And they said, the only way I can heal these things again is I got a win again. I, I, I, I have to win again. And the winning is just not for me. When you win all the people that listen to you on a regular basis that like say, hey, this is, this is, this is the person I want to listen to. This is the person I want to follow because he's giving me the information straight, not only, not only does he talk the talk, but guess what? He's got how many square footage of results and how many products of proof this, there's that, there's, there's validation in that. So it's not only for us, it's for though, it's for those individuals. We want to touch as many individuals. We want to show them. We want to show them. It's possible. It's, it's real, but there's a huge price that comes with it and that price continues to go up. And at some point, people just don't want to pay that price anymore. Man, it's facts. Dude, one question before we get into the show show, from your experience of dealing with the best performers on the planet ever. Is it hate to lose or is it love to win? It's neither. What do you think it is? It's, it's, it's neither. You know what? They, they, they, they hate to lose and they love to win it, but it's a combination of both. See, what happens is when you think of hate to lose, you know, what they hate to lose or they love to win, you get, you let your emotions get in the way. You letting your emotions get in the way. You letting your moat, man, hate to fight. I fucking lose. All right. Or when you win, you're like, yes, I win. Most individuals being able to have control over that emotion, being able to have control of your thoughts, being able to have control of your actions, being able to have control of your emotions is what true winners are, true winners are about. People want to celebrate too early. They want to celebrate. They want to celebrate too soon. When you win, when you, when you win at the highest, when you win at the highest level, that's when you want to celebrate. I was watching, um, I think it was Wimbledon. I was watching, I was watching Wimbledon and there was a mat, there was a match, there was a match going on and the person had one, the person had won the match. And I just watched there, I watched everybody's reaction after the, after the match. And I just said, I said, the next match, that person plays, they're going to lose. They're going to lose because literally winning that match was their celebration. That was a confetti, that was a confetti, that was that confetti morning. That's where all their energy went. That's where all their emotions went. That's where all their thought, that's when all their thoughts went, not realizing, I'm not finished. I'm not finished. All right. So when people talk about man, whether it's, you know, hate to lose, hate to lose or, you know, I, I love to win. That means you're letting an emotional component get in and the only emotional component, the only thing that should ever affect your emotion is when you do win. Derek Gita had this unbelievable thing. I saw a post that come in and he, they asked him, what was, they asked him, what was his toughest years? And he mentioned every single year, he didn't win the World Series. Those were my, those were my, those were my toughest years. Not he didn't pick a moment. He didn't pick this. He didn't pick them. He goes, he goes, I played a win. And when you play the win, you have control over your behavior, you have control over your thoughts, you have control over your emotions, you have control over your, over your actions. People celebrate too soon, celebrate hard, but don't celebrate long, but you have to, with that celebration doesn't, every, people want to celebrate. If you win, let's take, let's go back to tennis. You have to win multiple matches in order to be considered the winner. You got individuals celebrating every single round one. Yeah. Yeah. There's a big difference between enjoying the moment and a celebration. Enjoy those wins, but save the celebration for the end. Save the celebration for the end. There's also like, there's almost like a, because I see like playing football, coaching football, you see people win, I remember one time there was a game, like our kids won. And they're like doing front flips and stuff and cart wheels and it's like, what, you know, the head coach, he's like, what do you guys, you guys are acting like you're surprised? Like, this was expected. Like, there's an expectation. You like, what is, what is this? Like, y'all like, like, I'll surprise that y'all won. Like, no, like, there was a game plan here. There was practices that we showed up to. You know what I'm saying? Like, there was all these pieces that went into this. What do you, what do y'all, like, got surprised that we won? I think that's a huge deal. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I, I think I know for me, I could win the world's biggest event today and not really even give a fuck. I mean, I'd be glad I won. Yeah. But you're not going to see me run around like a fucking weirdo. Like, it'd be some fist bumps. I expect to win. I expect it. That's my standard. I expect to win. You're not in this to lose. No, but like, it's an expectation. Yeah. It's not fucking, I'm having confidence in, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's an expectation. It's not confidence. It's not, it's, it's fucking, that is the minimal acceptable standard to me. Period. That's it. And when it comes to losing, I feel like a hate to lose mentality is almost required. Because it sets the bar for what's acceptable. You almost have to hate losing so much that you are not willing to accept anything other than the way I agree with you, Andy. But only if you wired, only if you wired a certain way. Yeah, I agree. Only a wire to a certain way because a lot of individuals cannot handle hate. They cannot handle hate. They just, they just, they just can't. This goes back to what you said about the sensitivity meter. All right. How can you hate to lose if your sensitivity, sensitivity meter is extremely volatile? It's extremely volatile. Everybody taught, you know, it's a great thing to say, it's a great thing to say, man, I hate to lose. But when you do lose, what do you do immediately next? Well, you've got to be disciplined in the method. Yeah. You know, I can hate to lose and still understand that me throwing some sort of fucking tantrum doesn't help. Yeah, right. Right. Right. Right. Like, I understand. I hate to lose. And that's the emotion. And it shows me back to work. That's the emotion part. I'm taught. That's the emotion part I was talking about when people hate, people say that they hate to lose and they go out and they, they, they release all these emotion. They release all these emotions. Just then, you know what? Hey, you should pour that into the reps. Exactly. Right. Exactly. I love it. I love it. That's a great, man. Yeah. Dude, lose it in winning is like my favorite thing to talk about. Yours too. Yeah. Because there's no in between. Yeah. There's a list. It's funny. There was a story on that right. That of a general manager of a bat of an NBA basketball team. He's really big into analytics. And I don't throw names out there. You know, I, that's not, that's not what I do. All right. He really went up. He was with another organization. He literally went up to the, the, the team had just lost a game. Lily, let's just lost a game in a playoffs. He went up to the owner of the team and he was a big analytics guy and he showed the numbers. He said, well, if you look at the numbers, we actually won. Yeah. Two story. True, true story. The score is the score. It's funny. Everybody wants, everybody wants the numbers, the numbers in your bank account are the numbers in your bank account. The numbers in your business are numbers in your business. The only place that people don't want to pay attention to the numbers is when it's the score or when you weigh yourself. Yeah. Dude, it's such, that's such a, because like data is such a huge part of business and winning. It just is. But there's nothing fucking worse than someone who uses data to justify lack of results. They say, yeah, but, yeah, motherfucker, you see the fucking score? That's the fucking number. It doesn't matter all this shit. Act, dude. Dangerous word, but dangerous word. It's the worst. It's like the moral victory. You know, like, oh, yeah, you know, well, the data says we should have. We got some first downs. Fuck season high first. Let me ask you something. Both of you guys, DJ, what the hell is the definition of a moral victory? There isn't one. It's bullshit. It's what losers tell themselves to feel better about losing. Yeah. That's the truth. And it's become accepted in reality as some sort of like consolation prize. There is no consolation prize. There is. And then there isn't. You either won or you lost. You did it or you didn't. You either are or you aren't. And that's the reality of life. And this fucking attitude that we've conditioned society to be like refuses to acknowledge the truth because they tell themselves these bridge stories, right? Well, you almost made it, but we didn't. But that doesn't fucking matter. You didn't make it. You lost. Like this misunderstanding, I think, cost people. It costs more people. They're dreams than anything else. Like no one gives a shit that you tried hard, bro. Like I'm sorry. That sounds mean. I understand you're sweating. You're working. You're trying. No one cares. No one fucking cares. They only care about that shit if you want. If you want people to care about the struggle you went through, win. That's it. Otherwise they don't give a fuck. That's real, man. That's real consolation prize. That's the hammer right there. Yeah, moral victory. Yeah, but you know, we tried. I feel good about myself trying hard. If fucking my head had fucking dick, she'd be my uncle. You know what I'm saying? Like I don't know what to tell you. It's the fucking anyway. Now that's real, man. You look at it. We got on. How often do I get like DJ? Hey man, where's your way to that? What are you doing? He's not responding. Yeah. Tim, Tim, it's me up personally by the way, dad. Yeah, personally, personally. I say, man, what the hell is going on? I know he's holding himself accountable, but here's the thing. Everybody who holds themselves accountable has somebody else who's also holding themselves accountable. All right. I have a direct line to Andrew. Andrew has a direct line to me. And I know if I'm fucking up, I'm getting a text from him. I know. Am I just saying, here's the thing. No. It won't be an explanation. You know what it's going to say? It's going to say, dude. That's all it's going to say. And I already know. I already know what that meant. There's no explanation needed. There's no long sentence. There isn't anything on. Dude, got it. Same thing with his brother, Sal. Yeah. Same thing with him. You know, he obviously, if you follow Sal, and if you're not, he should. All right. He was, I'm watching him raise his three beautiful kids. And the one thing I texted, I see, you know, Enzo's and he was in wrestling and he's all doing all these different things. And I told, I said, listen, Sal, whatever you do, I said, make sure he has something physical for the rest of his life, for the rest of his life. And the girls are doing gymnastics and all this, all this stuff. Because once you take care of the physical, you feel so much better about yourself, then you become, then you as a mental individual. You don't need long sentences to explain. Just a simple dude is going to be like, I got it. I got it. It's simple. It is simple. People want to make things so freaking complex. That's why I get so fucking annoyed talking about it sometimes, Tim. It's like, this ain't fucking hard, bro. And you said it so many times. You got to fucking do it. All these people listen to all this bullshit by all these average mother fuckers looking for this secret that doesn't fucking exist. And then the people who tell them the secret for a fucking decade, you know, it's like, dude, listen, I could promise you this. None of these other mother fuckers that you listen to are going to tell you anything that actually fucking gets you where you want to go, different than what I'm telling you. That works. That's it. There's like three things that work. You know what I'm saying? Like you have to do the shit. You got to have an idea that fucking will work. You got to be relentless about it for fucking ever. And everybody listens to all this garbage, like hoping it'll motivate them, bro. If your own life doesn't motivate you, then you ain't fucking making it. If you can't look around at your life and say, damn, dude, I need to make a change. You ain't got it. And ain't gonna work. If you need to pumped up, be pumped up all the time and told how great you could be. And this and that, you ain't got it. If you got to be fucking convinced to go and you got to have your handheld, you ain't got it. If you got to fucking have every question answered by somebody who's an expert and you wait to do anything until your quote unquote mentor gets back to you. You're having. You don't have it. Everybody wants to be told what to do when you already know what to do. Dude, it's so fruckus. It's fucking frustrating. Yeah. Hey, listen to Tony Vah. How many times do you say this over and over again? You could always tell. Now, Andy's already got a lot of bass in his voice. So does he. And when he brings up this point, it agitates and irritates him even more. You know, because it's disrespectful that people who have actually done things. Yes. It's saying to this, it's like sitting across from me and I know all the things I've had to go through. I know all the fucking challenges, all the trials, all the tribulations, all the suicidal thoughts, all the bad, all of it, the fucking strut, all of it, being misunderstood, being called names, being made fun of, being laughed at, all of it. I know exactly what I've gone through to get to this point. And when someone sits across from me and starts asking me questions about how to get around that and basically, you know, so and so said, this is the hack. Well, so and so's broke. They got a fucking podcast microphone and they make videos on the internet. They're a content creator, okay? We have to understand that when you sit across from someone who's paid that motherfucker price and you ask them what the shortcut is, they want to fucking choke you, okay? Real talk, like I want to reach across the table and rip your fucking Adam's apple out because you're disrespecting the work that and the struggle and the pain that I've had to go through. And then you're sort of insinuating, you didn't really have to go through all that, did you? That's kind of bullshit, isn't it? That's just you, I'm different. Let's see what I'm saying. Yeah, and then they think that there's some sort of entitlement because they get to skip the fucking fight. Bro, you're not even any good at what you do. You haven't even started learning this yet. What makes you think that you're, that's like going to the fucking NBA practice and standing on the sideline and like going out and shooting some fucking free throws and being a hey LeBron, give me the fucking secret bro. Like you didn't really do all that work. It can be that hard. MJ, you didn't do all that fucking at this bro. Come on, you didn't get up at three o'clock in the morning and do chest passes. What's the real secret? You know what I'm saying? And it's like dude, like I will fucking choke you. You know what I'm saying? How many times have both of you and everybody sitting in this room? Man, what's the one thing? I will stop right there. What's the one thing? Yeah. What's your morning routine? Yeah, what? There is no one thing. And the minutes you tell them that, they're like, whoa. Oh, no. What's the one thing? Why did in my books, relentless and winning, I listed everything as one. Yeah, it's all these things. And there was more. When you were saying the hell analogy, if you really want to break that down further, you start out in hell every motherfucking morning bro. And you got to do everything you can and dig out by the end of the day. And guess what? When you wake up in the morning, you're going to be there again. And that's the fucking, that's what success building is like. That's your one thing for you. Yeah, every fucking day. Here's the thing. Everybody. Here's the one thing. It's going to fucking suck. How about that? No. If you get, listen. If you blessed every single morning, or night whenever you get up, to open your eyes, every, I do this every single day. This is my morning routine for people that was, oh, Grover, what's your, I'm about to tell you right now. If I'm blessed enough to have another day, and I open my eyes, and I can put my feet on the ground, the first thing I say is thank you. And now the rest is up to me. The rest is up, the rest is up to you. That's it, because one day, one day, I'm not going to have the opportunity to do either. Yeah. And the thing that you talk to the biggest achievers, and if you can get them to tell you the truth, not the stuff that everybody wants to hear. And that's the one thing about this. You will always hear. You will get, you won't get what you want to hear. You'll get what you need to hear. All right. It's always on you. It's always going to be on you once you wake up in that morning. Every decision you make, every action you make, all those things is going to determine where everything is going to go. There's been people that have woken up one morning and just said, I don't like the way I look anymore. Total transformation. People that wake up in the morning says, I'm never drinking again. Well, I'm never going to do drugs. I'm never going to do this. They wake up and they say, I make that decision. And what he says, you think like Andrew just said, you think that's easy when they get up in the morning? That's how I was a very heavy individual. DJ was a very heavy individual. You don't think so, that heavy individual, every single morning when we get up, is standing right next to the bed and saying, hey, man, we want you back. Yeah, we want you back. Why you got to go work out? Go back and go back in the bed. I stayed in a very nice hotel while I'm out here. Man, that bed was comfortable. Them sheets were nice. All right. I could have easily rolled over. Gotta go work out. Gotta get my work out. I have to do it. I gotta prepare. I've got some things. I'm blessed. I'm blessed to be asked to do this tremendous podcast. I have to be prepared for it. Because if I'm not prepared for it, the person that's sitting in that chair across from me, he's going to have no issues exposing me. Because I put myself in that position to be exposed. You're not exposed. You're unexploded. I think you're unexploded. Fun. All right. Let's talk about these fucking idiots going on in the world. Let's get into it, guys. It is cruziant of that. We're going to do some cruising with Tim, man. This is going to be exciting. Let me excited. Let's get into it, guys. Before we get cruising, Eddie, what car are we cruising then right now? I, what are you driving to that? 350. 350R. I drove on Mustang 350R. Yeah. It's not the flashiest thing, but it's one of the most fun cars to drive ever. Yeah. So I love it. I drive a lot. Now, you've been ripping it. You've been fucking ripping it. I like things. I'm starting to like really like, you know, I've had the nice cars forever. So now I'm starting to like care way less about the whatever the prestige, you know, and starting to like really enjoy getting better as a driver. So I'm like getting more into like raw race type cars that are manual transmission, you know, that I could practice driving in. Nice. Yeah. That's you have that's evolution. That's growth. That's changed. I still like all the other shit, but like I drive, I try to drive manual transmission car as much as possible because it takes a lifetime to master. Yes, it does. Yeah. And it's interesting. Yeah, yes, yes, it does. People that drive a commute manual, they're like, oh, you know, like I'm talking about driving it like a race car. Yeah, I'm talking about road matches. Like these are things that are, they take coordination. It. Yeah. If by that statement, you didn't figure that out. Yeah, but yeah, you got quick commute too. Yeah. Yeah, man. Well, guys, remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find them all linked there for you. If you guys are listening on audio, come check us out. Multiple locations, find us on the tube, find us on the X and also find us on Spotify. If you can't find us, you ain't looking. You ain't looking hard. I'm sure. You're lily not. You're not looking. Well, let's get into it, man. Let's get into it. I had a little intro here. I thought this was interesting. There was a typhoon that blew through Taiwan. Did you guys see that? We heard about that at all? No. Yeah, pretty bad typhoon going on that blew through it. And there's a website, I guess you can go to, it's like an in-depth weather calculator thing. It's like it shows all the wind stuff. And it's called windy.com. And you can go there and check it out for yourself. This is, I'm not trying to pull a leg here. It's just real something else. This is the typhoon that's hitting Taiwan. Apparently. So typh, typhoon, typhoon, typhoons getting fucked. This is real, too. This is not bullshit. Rock verified it. Saying this windy.com map shows wind patterns from typhoon portal hitting southern Taiwan today, August 13, 2025. Purple areas indicate gusts exceeding 11 meters per second with swirls near Kiyasheng and Lanyu. The formation amusingly resembles mill genitalia with Taiwan as the shafts. They say from the storm. So is that looking out of the left side mirror or the right side where it says objects may seem closer than they appear? Yeah, I was wondering. I mean, it looks on par for the region. I mean, it looks. Yes. That's what I was going to say. And with that thing only one person is missing. This is right. That's right. Yeah, but I don't know. It's how it's actually not not a bad looking place though. But yeah, there's like 33 people. People have been injured so far. So I mean, let's have today. It's moving into China. So I'm sure they're going to get a little bit smaller. But no pun intended. You know what I'm saying? But yeah, let's get into the cruise, man. We got a check in on some stuff. We got some stuff that's happening. Want to do a headline number one, going into our first set of headlines here. Got to go back to DC. There's been some updates going on. The crime thing is a big conversation right now across the country. Crime rates happening everywhere. And Trump did something crazy in DC where he enacted the federal guard, National Guard. We talked about this last CTI. There's been some updates. Now you got DC residents, echo authorities at checkpoint amid ramped up federal presence. So federal law enforcement officers in Washington were heckled Wednesday. Ascension's rise in the nation's capital over president. Trump's moved to take over the local police force. A group of protesters near the 14th street Northwest corridor where the agents established a vehicle checkpoint shot about or held up signs with phrases such as go home and get off our streets. There is a clip here. Let's check this out. Here's a real talk. We have the badge. Yeah. They're like a city. I can't get a real talk. That's a real talk. Fuck no. Go home. This kid stands is not a real talk. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. So it's like 15 people. Yeah. Right. And now one of them looks like they do shit. A complaint. What's the same people, man? It's the same. It's the same people. And it's like, you know, they're upset because the police, because crime is so bad there. The police are coming in to help put a stop to the crime. It's like they're protesting to allow communities to continue to get that devastated. That's what it sounds like. It's interesting too because I was watching on TV. And it seems like both the left and the right are in favor of this in Washington DC. Yeah. But actual residents. Yeah. Well, even the liberal media was covering it saying that like they thought it was a good idea because they live in Washington. You see, they know how bad it is. Yeah. Or you can't go to CVS and get the only one because it's behind Plexiglass. It's like bullshit. It's bad. It's not just DC. Now, Tim, you're Chicago, right? Yes. How is Chicago right now? What would you say the temp is in Chicago? Well, the temperature outside temperature is very warm. But the way the city, it's, yeah, it's people already know. Yeah. People are people are people already know there's very few people are happy with the situation that that's going on. I've been a live for a first Chicago and for the first time I've actually thought about. Yeah, I might have had it. I might have had enough. I just might have had enough. Here's a thing. For some reason, I don't understand this. Why people just cannot work together. It's like count. It's like point, counterpoint, point, counterpoint. Everybody's just arguing. Nothing's nothing's getting, nothing's getting done. Everybody's pointing fingers at the other individuals instead of actually, instead of actually doing something that can make life better, the streets, everything for better for everyone. Not just in Chicago and DC where California, Florida, wherever, wherever it may be, whatever it may be. It's the first thing we're going to do is come together. Like, put you, this is like, I'm watching this video now. All right, so you got the people on the other side. If something was going, if something happened to them in their house, who's the first people they're going to throw? Bro, if something happened right there, if someone drove down the street right there, like they do every night in Chicago and started popping off gun rounds, they would look directly to the same people they're heckling and say, do something. That's terrible. That's not true. That's too hard. Yeah, exactly. It's crazy. Those people have never been affected by actual violent crime. They've never had, listen, you cannot behave that way without being ignorant to the effect that crime actually has on a family or an individual. Go tell that to somebody who's loved one with skill about gun violence. Correct. And on top of that, dude, for us to get together and be unified, we would have to fucking come to an understanding that crime is bad. Violence is bad. And we've got, literally, got to a point where we have to come to an understanding to say that crime is bad. Yeah, that's insane. That's insane. Yeah, dude. Like, it's a bad thing to commit crimes. Yeah. Yeah, dude, the reason these people act the way they do is because they have very, they have very sheltered upbringings. Most of them come from upper middle class upbringings. They don't come from the streets. They don't, they've never dealt with crime. They've never dealt with people that commit crime that don't give two fucks about you and say, you know, oh, I have, I care about you. They don't care about you, though. That's the problem, right? Like, these people are so sheltered. And that's what turns them into these idealists. You know, I, I understand that you want to see the good and everybody. I understand that, you know, you want everybody to kind of be able to survive. And I understand all that. But you don't understand that. Like you, the, the problem we have in this country is that there is a whole group of people who have had it too good for too long that don't understand what real world is like, like in the real world, there are bad people. And then there are good people. And that's like, just like there's winning. And that's like, just like there's winning and there's losing. Yeah. And those bad people, they're not exclusively black or white or Jewish or from, you know, third world cup. There's just bad. They're exclusively bad. That's correct. And we get played against each other for the benefit of other people to believe that, you know, this group is bad or that group is bad or this, it's not, it's just not true. It's not true. And the propaganda has been so strong for so long that it's very hard for people to come together. You know, it's, well, they intentionally make it too divisive. And they intentionally do that. Yeah, but dude, the thing is, there's no doubt that they intentionally stir it. But you have to have a willingness to compromise and have a conversation. And there's people on both sides, but I would primarily say the far left side that will, they will, they fucking hate you. Yeah. Well, I mean, that's why I was going to get to, I mean, to that point though, it's like, you know, they will intentionally do things to, to, to, to trick you into believing or, or knowing what's the actual truth. Like this came out to like, you know, with the DC thing, it's like, you know, all, you know, crime, violent crimes, even at all time low, it's going down. It's like, well, and then they get their face busted because, you know, the DC police commander just got suspended, accused of changing crime statistics. Who said that? Who said that? What was those guys doing? Yeah. Randy, Randy and E.J. Why are we B.J.? I was talking about B.J. It's because he likes to give blowjob. But yeah, it's like, you know, it's like this stuff like this comes out. You know, and it's like, yeah, like this dude was literally changing the statistics of the violent crime that was coming in. So they were, so it's not just that they were not reporting it. They were literally changing things in the counting. You know, and it's like, but this guy's out here saying he perchecks and turns the community. No, you don't. That's him. That's him. I did it. Yeah, this is him. This is his name. There's Michael Pulliam. He's been placed on administrative leave paid administrative leave, by the way. And this got caught out by the union, the police union. They claim that the supervisors in the department manipulate crime data to make it appear that violent crime has fallen considerably. And so it has not fallen at all. It's increased is what they came to discover. So it's getting up. It's like, what good is that doing? What would be the purpose of doing that? We reported that three years ago. Yeah, yeah, three mother fucking years ago. We reported that. And by the way, it's not just in DC. It's in New York. It's in fucking Chicago. It's in Houston. It's in St. Louis. It's in fucking LA. And we reported it. Now it's five three years ago. We talked about this, bro. Now it's a thing. People like, oh, you're just a conspiracy theorist racist. Do you hate black people? No, motherfucker. I know math. Yeah. Like this. This percentage does this amount of crime. This is where the violence is. It's very simple. It's very simple. And if we don't acknowledge the reality of data, then we cannot fix the problem, which is ultimately what the racism comes from. How the fuck do you fix a, like how do you, how can you say I care about the black communities. But the, but the crime rate is something that it isn't. Like that's not, that's not where you start to fix problems. Well, I mean, it's, it's no different. It's just like you said, waking up in the mirror, bro. The mirror, we're stepping on the scale. That's all you have to say. Like, I mean, yeah, you can call yourself skinny. All you want. Or you're, you're healthy. You're, you're, you're, you're stepping on this. I think, I think people are waking up to it, though. Yeah. I mean, I think people are realizing like, well, for sure. Because I saw the polling for this Trump shit. Yeah. And when it first started happening, I was like, dude, they're going to go crazy because they're going to say he's enacting martial law and he's, he's being tyrannical and this and that. And then, you know, what we saw in the media was, you know, both sides and media were like, hey, I think it's a good idea that we maybe clean the shit up. Well, that's the thing because you can't tell us that violent crimes at all time low when I can't walk down my street and go to dinner. Yeah. Like these two things, it can't be a square circle. Like they don't make sense. You know what I'm saying? It's like, I'm seeing this with my own eyes and you're telling me that it's this doesn't work. Doesn't work, man. Let's see what the chat got on this. Math is racist, brosive. That's real. I'm doing a mind. Yeah, you got to keep the chaos. So structure isn't allowed to form. Correct. That's real. That's real. Yeah, man. Like I said, this DC situation. Yeah, Julian Michaels did call them out on CNN saying that they were blaming everything on white people. Yeah. And then saying that fucking, you know, for years, they've been demonizing white people for everything. Yeah. Yeah, it is white people. I mean, it's a white devil. I think we all know that. Yeah. It's a real thing, man. So we'll keep you guys up to date with what's happening in DC. We'll stay on the stay on the temp gauge there. But yeah, let's let us know down the comments, what you guys think. With that being said, let's go crew some of these comments. We got a couple of them here. This first comment comes from funky moose chops. He says ironically enough, DJ did shot out the best mayonnaise brand. Dukes being given my family heart problems since the 50s. You like mayonnaise, bro? No. Yeah. See that winners don't fucking eat mayonnaise. Is that what it is? I'm the man. That's not even one of the questions. That's not even a question. Is that what I'm saying? I've never, I've never. Shit fast, isn't it? Yeah. Potato salad. You've had potato salad. You've heard a milk in a fucking Joe tin forms. It's disgusting. I don't understand it. I don't understand it. Man, somebody said, somebody said mayonnaise makes your butt leak. Yeah, well, I wouldn't know because I'm not a loser. I don't eat it. All right, that's cool. Next one is Ross Matten. He says, doing the show live is pretty sick. What if DJ shows up late? DJing on show up late. That's right. That's it. And well, Andy will probably show up. That's why I said, I didn't say A.F. On show up late. I said DJ was on the whole late. All right. That the class. We're asking his schedule. We're asking his schedule. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Yeah. We have that. We'll keep that. Yeah. We know that we're all to be seated. And when Andrew walks in, that's when it starts. That's right. Hey, listen, if you bet on trying it, man, this is a hobby. I got a job. I got a job. I know. That's all good. That's all good. We got another one. What do you guys say? I know you guys have some fucking shit you say. Who? Like when I say it's going to be three, what do you say? Is that what it is? It's 30, so it's 30 minutes grace. All right. That's fair. That's fair. Listen, if he says three, as long as the first number is three, if it's three, 59, it's it's a point. It's 59. It's three. It is. That's accurate. That's black people. That's three. No, that's what that is. It says fucking three. That's it. He didn't say three on the dot. Three that he said three. Three. Three. Three. And this is something. It's something. So I also had a fight line king. This was a Spotify comment two days ago. He says solid eight months of bugging The hell out of the local gas station. I'm pleased to say we now have every flavor of four minute drinks that Orange is the tits. Now orange is definitely good. Orange is pretty good. What's your favorite? We already know your what your second favorite. That's not fair. What's your favorite? That's not. What's the favorite DJ? Great. See? You're all for that. I mean, you know, I do what it was. What's second favorite of real? Second favorite, scream me for you. Bro, I don't know how people can't say scream is number one. Like to me, it's a lot better than the rest. I mean, it's good. What do they call it? What is this flavor anyway? Scream me for you. I know. It's cherry. Oh, fuck, can't read it. Oh, shit. I have to get some peepers, bro. Talk to him. Is that my face? Yeah. I can't talk to him because I take him off. I can't. He's even going to go. He's on the couch apparently. So she let him blueberry. Hey, man, with eagle blood extended out farther. Yeah. Dude, that just started for me. My cousin who's my optometrist, Dan, he's like, once you turn 40, you're going to have to get him. Like, I'm holding off. But now it's like getting to the point where you're like, I can really tell. Yeah, man, you'll get there. Fine line, baby. Yep. That's what it is. Last one I was about to bring, OG comment is. By the way, thank you for that, dude. Appreciate you guys that are demanding for these places to carry. They're going to be carrying this soon anyway because we're selling way more than we ever thought we would. Thanks to you guys. Great, great, great problems to have, man. And then with Tim on the show, I have a comment from the last time you were on the show. This is two years ago. From WB Willie. Thank you, Tim Grover. I read the entire book after learning about it on this podcast and it truly, it is truly amazing work after reading it all the way through. I'm going to read it again because this work is so far above my understanding of greatness that I feel like I couldn't completely comprehend everything. I know in order to do this right, I need to know everything or else I've got holes in my boat. I'm grateful for all this valuable stuff. That's one thing about your book Relentless, bro, is you have to read it multiple times and depending, dude, I think it's one of the most brilliant books ever written real talk. And the reason I believe that is because, dude, I read it by once a year, you know that? Yes, I do. And every time I'm in a different place, bro, it means something different. It's a fucking work of art. Yes, it means something different depending on where you are and your journey, where you are in your life. Well, what's going on? And you know what I would say? Relentless is about the mindset. Winning is about the journey that very few will take and how to use that mindset in it. Because it's you, people can get, I have the mindset. Okay, if you say you have the mindset, now let's see you put it to work and let's see, let's see you win. It's exactly what you said. Those words and those books mean different things to you in different stages of your life, different places in your journey, where you are as an individual. I know you do a lot of reading. You do a lot of reading. But what you do is you always go back. Like you said, you read that book once a year. You go back to your foundation. It's not about how much you read. It's about how much you retain and what you do with that information. You know, I used to tell Kobe and I always had this guy. He know everyone says knowledge is power. You know, knowledge, knowledge is power. But only if you act on it. If you put it to use, that's where the power, that's where the power is. That's what this podcast does. It gives you the knowledge to get on the domestic terrorism slits. That's right. That's right. I have fun with your flight back home too. Yeah. Hello. How are you doing in St. Louis? Andy. I'm pretty sure you're been over, sir. Oh, man, that's real man. Guys, we do appreciate you for being real ass fans as always. Keep liking, keep commenting, keep subscribing. Make sure you guys hit that bell notification and stay up to date with the latest drops from really. And also, check down in the description below if you guys want to be a part of this live chat, that secret society. There's handshake. There's a handshake. We got to do. We'll send our people and. Yeah, we'll check into it. That's cool, man. Yeah. It's a young dude. Yes, it is. Yeah, it's always good, man. And you know what? Listen, again, thank you to everybody here. It's always appreciated. And you know, Andrew and I've had discussions on doing more of this. So don't be surprised if we get invited, we get invited back and continue to expand everybody's. Idea of what it really takes. To define your definition of success. It's real. That's real. Let's keep crews and shall we? I thought for headline number two, you know, thought we'd do a little something different with you guys. Have a brand new segment for you guys. Let's lose some brain cells. Tim Crowley. Lose some brain cells. Mm-hmm. That's by the right. I don't think all that should belong on the screen at the same time, man. That's why I mean, like we're going to lose some, listen, there's no doubt we are we everybody in this room. You say it's really like kill you, man. You're about to lose some brain cells. I'm just putting it out there, right? We got, I got some clips. This is from the official DJs. You're going to lose your job. Yeah. No, this is from DJ. Well, you know, I'm a big, I'm a big person talking about you before you can add, you got to delete. That's right. Well, this, this is, I got some videos here that are straight from DJ's algorithm. Okay. So buckle up. All right. And let's just see how this goes. This should be called the next 20 minutes of racism. No, that comes from your algorithm. I can't tell you, I don't know what's, I think I got to get a new phone because my algorithm bro is wild. So yeah, let's just lose some brain cells together. Check this out. All right. How was filler? Did you work? I lose some. I did. I'm feeling like I'm about to get pissed. You know what? I got, I got a, I got a mid. I know him. All right. What the, oh, yeah. Come on. Everybody good? We good. I don't want to, listen, I think it worked. Oh, we're not doing, yeah, I got a lot more. The only thing I can relate to that picture is I might have had that jacket at some point. Yeah. I think it looks like you're old jacket. It's like your size. That guy in the hood. All right. Well, it gets way worse. Yeah. What is, what is going on? I don't know. You know, sometimes I choose not to ask questions, you know, and just let things be what they are. It is what it is. That guy moved into his first apartment ever. And beside it, he's like, you know what I'm going to do now that I'm here. I'm going to upload the baddest video ever made. I'm going to let people see the real me. That's right. All right. Let's keep, let's keep moving. We got another one. Here we go. Is that one of your clients? Right the agility. Actually, I think the gymnasium in first form. I think you can hold such an event. You can hold, you can hold some, you know what people actually pay for that. Oh, yeah. I would pay to see that shit. They think, I listen, I, you got nothing. I think the person next to that gentleman might be a lady. People have, you know what I mean? People are into things, man. If you have nothing to say, nice people, people, people are into people. Listen, if they're happy and they're not hurting anybody, that's the lesson. I don't understand it. It's not for me to understand. Mm-hmm. But that looks like a lady. Well, I got more, listen, we got, we got some good ones here. All right. Let's check this next one out. And DJ wants to know why his algorithms are far. All right, here we go. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She's in great shape. To be able to do all that. To be able to balance on a branch barefoot, go from, I feel like that's the final boss of like white liberal women. That's like, oh, yeah. You know what I'm saying? She's the captain. Yeah, that's like, she's about to let out a screen. That's the ultimate form. Bro, that's it. Z-Shot, what do you think? Be hard. Oh, man. That's not what I was asking. I got two more. Okay, we're almost done here with this segment. I promise. This is my algorithm here trying to explain to people, winning, how to win and that. But some people just on a different, a different thing there. But you know what? Here's what the crazy part to these people, that's their win. That is their win. How the fuck do you come up with something like this? I don't know. Oh, yeah. So you know, it's those people don't understand us. Well, it's like Kobe said, I don't want to understand that. We don't, yeah, we don't, you know, I just, but that's, that's their, that's their win. Like you said, the guy of the first one we saw, that might be his first apartment. That's a, that's a, that's a huge, that's a huge, that's a huge win. He celebrated with the costume party. Yeah. There you go. Right. And he had his friends. Yeah. Oh, it's. Oh, yeah. And the, okay. Okay. But hey, you know what, you know what the huge wins are? You know what the huge wins are? All right. They made it onto one of the world's top rated podcasts. They don't know it yet. No, they don't know. They don't find out tomorrow. So. They don't know yet. One was going to come back. DJ. Yes. I mean, that's for five years. Hey, you know, I got, I got here's some winning. I got, I got another one. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. POV. You're at your son's basketball game. He makes a free throw and he does this. I mean, you would do that. You're the one that comes in here and talks about how you can do the splits. I can do a split. But. Well, you can. Yeah. Right there. Let's go. No, I'm all right. My pants. Take them off. I'm going to take. Let's go. I don't think ever in my life, I would have ever imagined Tim Gover would tell him to take my pants off. Yeah. You said you can do this. Well, you. I can't. It's verified. But verified by who? No joke. No. Did he really do it? Huh? No. Sort of. It was half ass. It was exactly like. I was like, I'm like, I've been called something. I was diabetes gang initiation doing a half split with a high-screen cone. That's good. What will we do if I said that I thought that was pretty respectable celebration? It's a free throw. I would say. I would say, I would say, don't do that in public ever again. No. It's a free throw. And like, literally the coach and this is where I have a hard time with. Why are you cheering for that bullshit? I told you all the other three pointers. Who's a coach? Who's a coach? The parents. What do you think? It's a team sport. It's a team sport. All right. Winning requires a team effort. Why is people so, and this is why are people so, you know, I didn't even think about the word, but just like about making it their moment instead of making it about everybody else's moment. And you're included. You're included. You're included in that moment. You know where that starts? I know. Yeah. It starts with dudes running off the field, taking the shirts off and the shoulder pads and fucking, acting like assholes. And kids see it and they're like, oh, I'm going to do that. I had, um, go off track a little bit. I literally had somebody tell me about a, um, a professional football player and said that he's been in a league for a while and he said the only time that he's ever been confronted by the coach where the coach was his first year in the league. After that, he was everything just, and he wants to learn. Yeah. And he wants to be learned. He wants to be coach. He wants to be disciplined. He wants to be this thing because he wants to get better. He wants to be. Once. Well, I mean, there's another side of that. The other side is you're expected to be fucking great on your own. No. You know what I'm saying? Like, yeah, I'm here to coach you and make you better, but the onus is on you. That's always, I'm always wonder about that. Like, because obviously, like, literally going middle school, high school, right? Like, there's coaching. Like, you're really being coached. The best of the back you at you talked to Tom Brady. Talk to Michael. Obviously, you can't talk to Kobe anymore. But you look at these individuals and you look at their past coaches and they always ask you, what's the common denominator among the greats? And they all would say they were very coachable. They take the information. And you're putting out information here. Okay, you are lily. These for millions of people, you're there. You are their coach. You're lily giving them direction. Now, what they do with that direction. Now, that's not the only direction they get. But they're coming in here to be to be coach to become educated to become to become better. They've opened up their minds. They've opened up their hearts. They've opened up their souls to be like, hey, listen, I generally want to get better. I'm going to hold myself. I'm going to hold myself accountable. You know, and it's just like, well, how do you prove people wrong? How do you prove yourself right by improving? I am proving. And that's what these, that's what these individuals want to do. The one thing that best of the best, you're coachable. Yeah, because I realize I'm a fucking idiot. Yeah. You're honest. You can't, you can't build what you guys have built. You know, not I feel like an idiot. Like most of the time, I feel stupid. And I think. I think that's a common. Trade amongst high achievers when they're in the mode. When I walk out and got to do my thing. Do you think? Yeah, I'm not picking on an idiot. No, I'm thinking like, dude, I'm going to fucking crush you. Yeah. You know, but the rest of the time, I'm like, all right, how do I get better? What's the problem? Where am I weak? What do I got to do? What do I need to learn? How do I need to get better at this skill? You know what I mean? And you get that information. It's a, it's a dichotomy. Right. That most people can't really understand or see. Because all they see is the performance. Yep. Like they see somebody like, let's take Conor McGregor, for example. People would say Conor McGregor is not humble. And I would argue that you are wrong. And I'll tell you why. Because for him to get to the level that he is, he had to learn a whole bunch of shit. And to learn a bunch of shit and become great. You have to be coachable, which means you have to be humble. All right. So what you see as the product doesn't mean that that person is not humble. And I believe that this is a big disconnect between the average person and how they look at high achievement. They see someone who is passionate, excited and understands, by the way, how to be a character in a product, which is part of his job. Yes, it is. And they see it and they say. And nobody does it better. No, he's great at it. And by the way, that's why he's been paid so well. Because he understands I am a character. This is part of my job. And he couldn't have got, he couldn't have even got that good at talking shit without learning from someone. How to do it. So I would argue that most of the people that people say that person is not humble because they're successful. And they forgot where they can actually some of the most humble people. Because they're coachable behind closed doors. Now, I've met him. I know him personally. We've done some work together. One of the most giving individuals you'll ever meet. But he doesn't publicize it all the time. You know, you know, other individuals that every time they give, they, it's for them. Yeah. It's for their moment. It's not for those. I'm telling you, is he perfect? No, none of us are, none of us are, none of us are perfect. But one of the things he did tell me, he goes, I won. But nobody told me what was coming along with winning. We, what we started this podcast with. You know, that's real. He's got to figure it out, bro. No, he's only due to the world that can put his fucking dick on the internet for the whole world to see. And no one gives a fuck. It's still be okay. I actually had one of those videos. Yeah. I'm like, I really won't go with it. But yeah, yeah. We lost some brain cells. Again. That's why you have to go rhythm on your phone. I said, I said, I see the trick is I sent them to other people too. So I messed up their algorithms. Oh, my algorithms are certainly messed. Oh, don't give me that. No, you send me the motherfucker. That's because you sent him to me. Then I see them in the algorithm. And then I'm like, I'll give you my like this. I gave him him. I sent any stuff. He's like, I already seen this. That's true. I did get the weirdest suggestion in the world yesterday. And it was this post of this whale jumping out of the water with like a boner. And it said suggested for you. And I like, is this where I'm getting suggested whale boner? It's right. It was right. Like, okay. It could be a lot. I definitely did laugh when I saw it. And we all have to laugh. Yeah. Got to. I definitely laughed. I was curious. We all have to laugh. I'm going to ask Zuckerberg when I mean. Who suggested this? Why do you think that I want to see an Orca's penis? Probably well boner fetishes. So we wore. No. All right. But yeah, all right. Appreciate it. I hope you guys like that. Let's keep a cruise. Move. We've got one last headline here. We got a headline number three. Let's go to the sports arena. This is the topic we've we've covered a few times on the show. Because it's a new topic. By the way, just a bunch. If you've never seen Andrew in a suit. I was going to look at you. I'm done. I say we all look pretty good in suits. Yes. Yeah. Nobody doesn't like you, though, bro. Jim G's got to see. I have a part. I have an agent and a personal stylist. That person. They're the same. Yeah. Take care of this guy. All right. Oh, yeah. Let's get your third final headline. That's the final headline. Guys, headline number three. He'll let him three reads. Three W NBA players ejected after I just saw this today. Sun sky scrap. Yeah, let's talk about it. I just want to talk about the the fever. That's it. No, we only talk about the fever. That's the only team. The sun's all right. Sun's all right. Sky is okay. They're all right. It's Kaelin Clark and Sophie Cunningham. That's the fucking lead. That's the week. Yeah, sure. Yeah, because they've been getting this been getting heat and an ain't got Katelyn Clark or sunny. Sophie involved. But apparently ejections now come in threes. I think that was a pun they tried to be there. Very dirty one, in my opinion. A trio of W NBA players earned the boot Wednesday night following the altercation during the sun's 71 62 home win over the sky. Connecticut's Bria Harley and Chicago's Rebecca Allen each received ejections for starting the scuffle while the sky's aerial Atkins night ended early for being an escalator after shoving Hartley and touching a referee according to the crew chief Angelie Angelia suffering as reported by a ESPN. The situation unfolded early in the second quarter when the sun's senaya rivers and Hartley battled Allen for rebound, which the former Corral. Here's the clip. Let's check it out. But this action right here. There's a lot happening. Yeah, a lot happening. Grab my shirt. You want to grow. She didn't hit the court though. She out of bounds. Ariel Atkins says. Some words to Priya and she says she grabbed me first. Man number 10's a big and pretty big. And she's going to be a little bit more than the other. She's going to be a little bit more than the other. She's going to be a little bit more than the other. Yeah, what's your case? Ron. Man number 10 is a big and pretty big. Pretty big. That's like shack. Grab his neck. That's it. Fucking shack junior out there. Yeah. So we got some guts. That was it. That was it. That was it. They got ejected for that. And there was ejection. Come on. All right. Let the girls fight. Now I'm just saying, maybe this will go up. I've seen a lot worse happen with no ejections. Yeah. Like that other. the, because I mean, again, you've, you've, you've been around and, and, and got to see some of the greatest in basketball that we played, right? Like how, how much does emotions on the court? I guess, because I mean, tempers get hot, right? Like I get it, pushing shoving, but like all out brawls have been happening. It wasn't a brawl. They, I said they have been happening, right? Maybe not that game, for sure. But, I mean, what should take on that, Tim? Listen, you know, the individuals and the teams, like I said, that can control their emotions. I always say that, you know, coaches always say, man, play with emotion. Well, which emotion you want me to play with? You know, and emotion, your emotion that gets you going, maybe different than my emotion, maybe different than Andrews, everybody's got the different stuff. So when you say, you know, play, play with emotion, all right? Play with under, play with understanding, control, control, control your emotion, because here's the thing. As an opponent, my job, not only is to win the game, but also make you lose your emotion, take you out of your, take you out of your game. That's why a lot of athletes talk trash to each other to see who can, you know, if I, if they can take, if they can set up shot, if they can set up shot, shot in their head, all right? Things, things are going to happen on, on the court. MJ, you saw always say, MJ, you saw always say this. He's, say, he goes, I know the opponent is going to do anything that they can to get me thrown out of the game. There's videos of him, Lily pulling his fist back. And there's that last point in down because he knows if he throws that punch, they won. Yeah. And then it's six games without him. Right. They, they, they, how long is the, the directions? Yeah. Well, back and back and back and back in that day. No, but now, right now, yeah, you throw, you throw, you throw, you throw, you throw a punch. Listen, part of, part of winning, part of team is, it is understanding what your emotion, what your, what your, what your emotions are and figuring out how to control them. You know, listen, control your thoughts, you control your emotions, you control your, you can control your emotions. You're literally going to control the outcome of the game. I think you say it on something too. That's like a big, a big thing that I think people are probably shouldn't even say this because most people aren't equipped to do this effectively. But the best, the best guys, the best entrepreneurs, the best business leaders, the best fucking athletes, they understand the game of distraction very well. Very well. They understand that when they say certain things or when they post certain things or when they do certain things, they understand the, what it does to the opponent and they're doing it intentionally. And that's something, you know, like only like the top, top, top people understand that as part of their game. Yeah. You know what I mean? You know, attack them physically, attack them mentally. Yeah. That's what it looks like. When you find out like, dude, when I find out that something annoys somebody that I want to beat, I will annoy the fuck out. That's what you're supposed to do. Yeah. That, that, that, that's what you, that's what you're supposed to do. The only time someone can get into your head is when you're not there. Dude, one of the best ways in today's world to beat your competition is legitimately to make them fucking hate you so bad that they can't concentrate on what the fuck they did. They're doing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Should that have been an injection? Should that have been an injection? No. Bro, listen, if the WNBA wants to up, viewership, fucking fight. Oh, I'm being dead serious, dude. Like, y'all can't fucking make all the buckets. So, like, you know, you can't duck, you know, like, the sum of you can, but, you know, and you want to get paid more money, well, pay more money means more eyeballs watching the sport. Let them rip, throw some blows. The biggest thing to happen in the NBA, WNBA this year was Sophie Cunningham, fucking sticking up for. Okay, LeClaire. Katelyn Clark and dude, what was that? That was physicality. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Physicality works for eyeballs. I'd be watching more games if there was more fights. Would you? I'd watch a game. That's one more than zero. Yeah, man, I think I think I, what would that you know, it's fucking true? Listen, I will give the WNBA some from a skill standpoint. Yeah. They're amazing. Yeah. Like dribbling passing footwork. Yes. The footwork passing. It's absolutely. If you are a young basketball player and you want to learn footwork moving without the ball, being able to dribble coming off a screen, shooting all this other, all this other stuff. Watch the WNBA watch with a statement. They're technically better players. Unbut yes. Yeah. And there are some NBA players that will admit that say, listen, I watched them religiously to watch how they, you know, their footwork because, you know, obviously, they're not as, they're not as athletic as all NBA players. Some WNBA players are more athletic than some of the NBA NBA players. So their skills set has to be better. It just has to be better. We talk a lot of shit because it's funny games and jokes. Okay. But here's the truth. This is the truth. All right. It may not be as exciting to watch. And the reason it's not as exciting to watch is because we don't recognize the names. All right. They're not, they're, but the main reason is because the game of men's basketball has evolved to like people don't appreciate the fundamentals anymore. They want to see the amazing shit. They want to see a dude jump from the free, well, Michael started it from the free throw line to the fucking, you know, hoop. They want to see all that shit. And they want to see like dudes just dunk it right on top of each other and just, and you can't get that in the WNBA. And so people will say, well, it's not as exciting to watch. But if you, and it isn't because of that, that's the reality. But the framework of what's considered good basketball has changed over the last 30 years. So women aren't capable of doing that part of the game, which it's then considered to be inferior basketball. But I can tell you this, dude, I went to Southwest Missouri State before it was Missouri State. And there was a girl there, and you're going to know who it is, Jackie Styles, who was the greatest athlete that I've ever seen personally in my life. And I've never seen anybody work harder either. I've never seen somebody work harder or be better than her at her thing. And, you know, Caitlin Clark just passed her up on the sport. But like, dude, she would practice with the men. And we had a sweet 16 men's team then. She would practice with the men. The men could not fucking touch her, dude. So there's a lot of truth to that. But at the end of the day, eyeballs equal paychecks and they're not getting them and they got to figure out a way to get them. That's real, man. Guys jumping on this fight. It's a fight. It's going to go back to the thing that DJ had pulled up about the kid doing the splits. We don't know if they won the game, if they lost the game. But that's, you know, people watching it because of the, because of the, because of the because of the eyeball. And that's what social media social media does.
