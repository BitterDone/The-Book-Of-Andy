What's up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about it lies the thickness and delusions of modern society. Welcome to Motherfucking Reality guys. Today we have Andy and DJ cruise the mother fucking in it. That's what we're going to do. That's what CTI stands for cruise the internet. This is where we put topics on the screen. We talk about what's going on. We speculate on what's true on what's not true. And then we talk about how we the people have solved these problems going on in the world. Other times you tune in you're going to get Q and A F. That's where you submit the questions and we give you the answers. Now you can submit your questions a couple different ways. They can be about anything. The first way is guys email those questions and to ask Andy at Andy for solo.com. Or you go on YouTube on the Q and A F episodes and just type your question in the comments and we'll pick some from there as well. Other times we got real talk real talk is just five to twenty minutes of me giving you some real talk. That's kind of like what we did on Saturday with the audio exclusive. You go back and listen to that. And then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus is where people who didn't have their shit together use 75 hard program to get their shit together and they come on and talk about how they did that. If you're unfamiliar with 75 hard. It is the initial phase of the live hard program which can be found for free at episode two, eight on the audio feed. There is a book on my website Andy for solo.com that you could buy. It's called the book on mental toughness and includes the entire live hard program. It has 10 plus chapters on mental toughness. It's important how you cultivate it and then also case studies on people that you know and how they use mental toughness to become who they are today. Book is not required. Like I said, you get the whole program for free but the book is very popular and I think you'll love it. We have a fee for the show. You'll notice I don't run ads on the show and I asked something to exchange for that because I know you guys don't like listening to thirty minutes of ads. So I ask very simply that you pay the fee. When I say pay the fee that means share the show. We are constantly fighting shadow bands, censoring, traffic throttling because we talk about inconvenient, unpopular topics here and the internet lords do not like it. So if you want the word to get out, I need you to share it. So if the show makes you laugh, if it makes you think, if it gives you a new perspective, it teaches you a skill which will learn on the Q and A apps, please share the show. All right. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. Hey, how's it going? Have a Monday. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of interesting things happening today. Yeah. The plethora of bullshit on the internet. Is there? I've been busy. There's a lot of shit going on. I never know what's going on on the Monday shows because I'm so busy running my life. Yeah. So this is like your new show too. Yeah. The news doesn't. Yeah. I don't know what's going on. Yeah. It's an interesting shit, man. I know we just had the eclipse. Like we did a few minutes ago. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, that could be a good thing or a bad thing. Yeah. Is everybody still here? Yeah. I'm still here. Or is it just us? Right. Yeah. No, we got a little bit of that in here, man. We got a lot of interesting stuff to talk about. All right. Let's get into it. Okay. Before we do, though, we got some, we got just a lot of crazy people out there today. And we got a couple of videos. I've seen this being called a thing a while ago. They call it TDS. Oh, Trump derangements in Rome. Yeah. I thought I got two clips here. I thought it'd be interesting to pop up and watch. See, see, see, it takes on this. As far as it was interesting. So this is Jennifer Lewis. Do you know she's from St. Louis? Nope. Yeah, she's from here. Oh, you know who that is. Yeah. This lady right here on the top. All right. So here's her. She lives here. She's from here. Yeah, she's from. I don't know. I don't believe she's still a little serious. Is that the same woman? Both of them. Yeah. What? No? Yes? No. Oh, I thought that was like a younger and older version. No, no, no. No. No. Fuck, I could be. Okay. Could it not be? Could that not be the younger version? I thought the same thing. Yeah. Fuck you all think that when you look at us, man. The fuck? Yeah, because you said that to me before. Is your racist? Your racist against white people. Okay. Yeah. It's a music clip. Motherfucker, that looks like it. That looks like it. That looks like it could be a young version and an old version. Okay. Yeah. Doesn't let the community decide. I don't. I'm just saying. That's fine. It's a clip. Black people don't want to fight you. We all we want to do is feed our children and be equal. But why do people scare? They're becoming a minority. The world is brown. Yeah. And they're going to do everything they can to stay in those gated communities, not pay taxes, and put those niggas in their places. And get those wet backs out of this goddamn country. We own this bitch. Well, guess what? You will not win. Because love is the answer. Oh, that's how I love there. What's enlightening? Yeah. Here's the second one. As soon as he takes the oath, he will have generals walk down the steps of the Capitol. He will take a hammer and break the glass where the Constitution is, and he will tear it up in our faces. And say, now, I'm the king of the fucking world. You will bow down bitches. He will punish everybody that didn't vote for him. Let me tell you how I know this shit. I know it because I know what mental illness looks like. Shared you. Thanks for one of no one. That mania is unstoppable. See, this motherfucker's Hitler. He didn't come to play. Yeah. And this ain't just her. Did you see this just cover her first? You're a crazy fucking bitch. Let's just fucking get to the bottom line. You are a crazy lunatic, deranged bitch. You're going to talk about how white people are going to stay in their gated communities. And y'all don't want to fucking fight us. But then three seconds later, you're talking about how you're going to lose. You're going to get over and then it's out of love. Fuck you. You're an anti-American piece of shit. Get the fuck out of our country. Go fuck off. Eat a dick. You're a crazy bitch. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's from St. Louis, man. That's good. She'd come over here and I'll tell her that to her fucking face. Well, the funny thing is what I'm about to say is, bro, these people are the problem. This person here causes racism. Like, bro, see here and listen to that as a white person. Listen to that. You're talking about fucking, you're going to do what? You're going to take, you're going to take over. You're going to lose. What the fuck are you talking about? There's no fight here. We're Americans. You dumb bitch. Like you, you fucking should be worried about these 20 million illegals coming across the country. Fucking up your neighborhoods. Yeah. Fucking up your chance of voting. Yeah. You know, white people burning your shit down either whenever fucking George Floyd was happening. I see that. Fuck you. Yeah. Fucking idiots, man. Yeah. But I know what mental illness looks like. Yeah, bitch, because you see it every day in the mirror. Holy shit. These people are insane. She startled me a little bit when she did that fucking like she was nice and low and like, you know, monotone. Listen, she's trying to be dramatic. This is her fucking Martin Luther King. She's an actress. Okay. This is her Martin Luther King fucking delivery. It's no different than a dude in Tennessee. Yeah. Yeah. Here's a score and seven years ago. We were. Yeah. We were oppressed. Yeah, right. Shut the fuck up. That didn't even sound like that. Like you see the clip of him the next time. Like he was completely. I'm so sick of this shit. No, but TDS is a real thing. Here's another clip. Let's get off. Let's get off of my people. Let's let's see some of yours, Andy. Let's. These are not my people. Traffic. What's going on here? It's okay. You have to get out and register to vote. And you have to vote for Biden. Here. Because that other guy, the orange man, the orange man like this. He is going to take away your social security and allow you. Yeah. He's a fair. I need help. He's right. That's great. And he's going to take away your health care because of his right now until they're 26 because he's beyond their parents health care and the orange man wants to stop that. Woo. That way. Oh no. Okay. Everybody Pennsylvania. In the house. Hey, vote for Biden. Vote for Aaron. And if you don't, we cheat. Bro, what the fuck, bro? Hey, bro, what's up with the dance in there? The dudes in the background, bro. The guy in the background with the glasses looks like he's fucking an inch away from being in a coffin. Bro, they're just trying to, they're just trying to stay awake long enough for the, for the, for the seat out. It's not where all. Bro. Bro. Bro, they're, I love how they say, they do everybody that they don't like is Hitler. Mm hmm. They use literally Hitler to fucker you talking about. He's hoping to smash. That's the only reason these dudes are going along with this shit. The only reason these dudes are even playing along is because they're a bunch of simp bitch dudes who are trying to get some fucking booty. He's definitely hoping to smash. And they're like, yeah, whatever, whatever these chicks say. Come on, man. This, this is what these, this is what fucking weak man behave like. He's over in the smash. Yeah, let's let's let these crazy bitches do whatever they want. Yeah, maybe that's right. Bro, what are they all dancing for? I don't know. Bro. Bro, how do you put that on the internet? I don't know, man. I don't know. I don't know. You see the Asian, the two Asian women in there? I don't know. Those motherfuckers ain't here to play. Fucking Hitler. No, that's so bad. There's so much man-a-z in this video. Yeah. God, believe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to ask that. I'm going to ask that. And then, and then that lady from the previous clip. And then this, these fuckers, they're going to act like they like each other. Oh, they love you. And they fucking don't. Oh, they love each other. Yeah, we're absolutely. Yeah. Oh, it was fucking white people in that clip. They ain't even been around a black person. They fucking ain't even been around one. You could tell because they dance so poorly. Oh, fuck, bro. The diapers get a little soil. Yeah, it's a box in the room. Yeah. It's a whole shit. Yeah. And that black lady would come there. She'd be like, oh, you guys are my people. And she'd walk out the door and be like, fuck them mayonnaise. I'm a fucking 100% fuckdog, water and shit. What's your fucking liars, bro? That's insane. Yeah. That's insane. But guys, let's give it to some of these headlines. Because we got a lot of stuff to cover today. Yeah. Can't learn. That's social security. Listen, here's the real talk. These people are so, there's, these people are going to cheat however they can. Just so you guys know. They think they're morally right. They think they're in the morally right position. They think that whatever they do is justified. And it's interesting that she talks about the Constitution. When for the last fucking however many years, black culture is, you know, pretty much protested the American flag and fucking talked about, you know, how the Constitution wasn't for them. But now it's convenient to talk about the Constitution. You know what I'm saying? No, it's bullshit. No, that anybody has a lot of hypocrisy. Yeah. And now that anybody that's ever seen that movie national treasure knows that it's going to take more than a hammer to break that window. All right. That was so stupid. I never seen it. You never seen it. Oh, bro, it's a great movie. Nicholas Cage. Yeah, I know. That's why I didn't watch it. I know who's in it. That's why I didn't watch it. It's a great movie, bro. Rod and tomatoes has a pretty high. Yeah, that means it's horrible. Rod and tomatoes inverse scoring system. Oh, fuck. That is right. I forgot about that. If it's high, it's, if it's high, it sucks. If it's low, it's good. Oh. It's got a 46 on Rod and tomatoes. Oh, okay. Then yeah, that's pretty good. That's what, yeah. Oh, it's pretty good. So they're saying it's decent. It's decent. It's a decent movie. All right. Yeah. I'm going to say it's decent. Yeah. I'm going to say it's decent. I'm going to say it's decent. I'm going to say it's decent. Yeah. That's pretty good. Yeah. Oh, it's pretty good. So they're saying it's decent. It's decent. It's a decent, it's a good movie. All right. Yeah. National Treasure, bro. I fucking love that movie. Benjamin Gates. Like, yeah, come on, I don't know who that is. That's the, that's his father. That's his dad. I don't know. Yeah. Well, guys, it's good to these headlines. We get like a cheap Indiana Jones, bro. Isn't it? See, Indiana Jones was my shit when I was growing up. So I've never seen it. And that was when they made real movies. Like they took no CGI shit. Yeah. They took cameras out of location. They made real movies and they're awesome. So why do movies cost more to make now than they did back then? I don't know. You know what I'm saying? Like if they're using less real life shit, you know, who knows? Yeah. Probably somebody's figured out how to steal a bunch of money. That's what it is. Yeah. I know who it is. Who is it? Guys, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Guys, let's get through our headlines. Is it the day, them? It's plural. Let's get into some of these headlines, guys. If you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to AndyFaceCellar.com. You guys can find them like they let's get to our first one. Headline number one. You mentioned a little bit. We got the solar eclipse going on today. That was a big, big, big topic of the day. A lot of interesting things. This Fox News article is talking about the each-drange things that could happen to us. They mentioned a few different things. We talk about these Bailey's beads. It's an effect that happens around the moon. When the sun is covered up, animals start acting weird and shit. Strange shadows. Windy condensions. Temperature drops. There was a temperature drop. There was a temperature drop. Well, it makes sense though, but like there's no sun. Right? Windy conditions, all of this stuff. And of course, leave it to our current society. The eclipse is also a little bit of racist. Right? We've got to have that in there. Right? It makes perfect sense. This headline reads, Eclipse fever is gripping black texas. While the event will cast a brief shadow on life in texas, it sheds a light on scientific fields that have been mainly out of reach for black folks. Yeah. It's fucking Eclipse is racist. It's got to have it. Got to have it. But it's because black people have the inability to look at things. You're all saying? Like the last year was they can't use a computer. Right. Now this year, it's they can't look up at the sky. Because apparently it's racist. Yeah. You know the truth is like, you know what? You know what? You know what solves it though? Getting vaccinated. That's. That's. That they were vaccinated. Everything will be cool. Yeah. They could look at the sun without fucking glasses. If they were vaccinated. Yeah. I'll tell you this though. That's it. That's hard if you don't use those glam damn glasses though. That's because you're not vaccinated. That's what it is. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Harden your eyes like it hardens your heart. Hmm. Yeah. So you got to have a little racism on Eclipse. It just sounds right for America. America if it ain't racist. That's what I'm saying. You got to hurt a little bit of that. I don't even think that's their house back there. That's like a Airbnb if some share. Everybody knows why people can't help racist. Huh? That's racist. That's some real racist. Yeah. It's all funny games so DJ takes it's tep too far. Hey, you know that that chair right there stole one. I'm just saying. Bro, that's fucked up. The glasses too. Hey, listen. Hey. Hey. Hey. All right. But no, answer your shit. Dude, what the fuck's wrong with you? Let me use your backyard real quick to see the sick clips. But I'm some real shit though. I'm sorry. I'm also on a real serious note. Okay, there's a lot of interesting things happening around the country with all this racist racist clips outside of fucking Hitler's retirement. It's the fucking end of the world, man. You had the Niagara region. They declared a state of emergency. A lot of places around the country actually, uh, these places where I guess they would have seen 100% totality were declaring state of emergencies. Um, the Niagara region on an statement a couple of weeks ago. They released a statement saying that out of the abundance of caution. They were declaring a statement. Now what's the caution? And it's interesting because this past Friday, April 5th, uh, there was a couple of different announcements that were coming out, um, from our in-show communities like this one. The US Intel wants a potential terrorist threat at gatherings after Moscow attack trying to blame the Moscow attack using that as a example that there would be some, uh, quote unquote, loan wolves, um, responding, um, impossibly doing some, some, uh, terrorist attacks on public venues. They even released a joint intelligence bulletin that came out on Friday also. Now this one is also interesting too because there's some stuff going on in the middle east between Iran and Israel right now. That also implicates the United States with CNN releasing this headline that reads US preparing for significant Iran attack on US or Israeli assets in the region as soon as next week. Hmm, saying that the US is on high alert and actively preparing for a quote significant attack that could come as soon as within the next week by Iran targeting Israeli or American assets in the region in response to Mondays, Israeli strike in Damascus. Uh, the kill top Iranian commanders, a senior administration official tells CNN. Um, oh, by the way, yeah, sir got turned on today as well. So just a little plethora of interesting stuff going on here. Um, Andy, what do we got? What do we got on any of this? Well, I mean, we should all be shocked that Iran is going to retaliate after an attack that Israel did without any sort of consultation or warning on Iran with the United States or with NATO or with anybody. You know, Netanyahu is just doing whatever the fuck he wants. And in my opinion, he's trying to start a World War and instigator war because at the reality here is that Israel is very divided about what's going on in Palestine right now and Netanyahu is not very popular in Israel right now. And we have a divided nation here in the United States. So what better way to get people united into and bought into a war than to instigate an attack from Iran into Israel, which would unify the Israeli people. And also then do some sort of terrorist attack with all these military aged men here in the United States, which would unify the Americans to say, let's go fucking kill all these people in the Middle East again. And now these guys get their war, you know, and with a war they get a potential disruption in the election. I mean, this is what I've talked about for the last few years. I wasn't exactly sure how it would happen. But, you know, if you get Iran to attack Israel in a major way, now you're having a situation where you're uniting, it serves a lot of purposes is what I'm saying. A lot of people eat off this plate. Yeah, for sure, bro, you're going to unite Israeli people. You're going to unite Americans. You're going to get NATO involved. And we're going to have a war that is which is what they want. That's what they want. And they want the war to disrupt society and to be a legitimate Black Swan society changing event to cement the disruption of the world order that they're looking to create. So it's about money. It's about new arrangement of a new world order and power structure terms. It's about globalism. It's about communism. And yeah, I mean, this is what I've been talking about. And that's how I see this potentially working out. Yeah, it is interesting. I mean, one thing I could tell you too when I was putting all these together today. There's always look here and not over here with a lot of these things that happen, right? You go to any one of these mainstream media sites and they'll put this big flashly head line up front. And everybody's talking about the eclipse. But nobody's talking about these other things that were going on. Like I'm also saw something about Biden that the attorney general Merrick Garland had to submit the recordings from the interview with Biden and her didn't a special interrogation or he's going to get charged in the rest of today. Nobody's really talking about that Joe Biden. No, no, no, Merrick, Merrick Garland. Yeah, which Biden about interviewed president Biden. So Biden's going to get arrested. No, no, Merrick Garland will if he does not submit the recordings from their interview. Oh, yeah. So I mean, there's a lot of weird stuff just happened today, man. I don't know. It could be the gluel. I mean the black hole. I don't know. Yeah, guys, let us know what you guys think. Let us go down in the comments with that being said. Let's cruise to some. I don't personally do. I don't think that even if Iran attacks the United States and Israel, I don't think it's going to unite people. No, I think people are understanding what the fuck is going on. And none of this fucking shit is going to. I mean, I think a lot of the conservative talking heads will fucking bite it look line and seeker. Yeah, but I don't think it's going to unify people. I think people understand what the fuck is going on. And they're starting. Like bro, you hear Israeli citizen speaking out. You hear Jewish people speaking out. You know what I'm saying? Like, I just fuck up. Yeah, well, they also realize that it's putting them in danger. Their government is putting those citizens of danger. Yeah. And and dude, it, you know, it is increasing. You know, bias against Jewish people, which in my opinion is wrong. I don't think that you can generalize an entire category of people in any situation. I don't think that's the right thing. I think we have to look at who the individuals are that are doing it on an individual level and hold those individuals responsible as things happen. You know, this is no different than how black people are generalized as criminals or, you know, whatever man, like whatever like gay people are being generalized right now as pedophiles when it's not all gay people. It's fucking a little segment of the trans community that is infiltrating as pedophiles into the community and making the whole community look like a bunch of fucking pedophiles. And that's why we have people like gaze against groomers and Becky and these guys standing up and saying all this shit because they're realizing that if they don't, they're going to get lumped in. So like the Jewish population that doesn't really agree with what's happening and is recognizing what's happening. They're starting to speak up. And I think it's important for everybody to have logical conversations and realize that you cannot generalize an entire fucking group of people. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I think it's important to I think to your point about, you know, I don't think it's going to create the unit. I think it's going to create unity just not for the mission or purpose of what they know it's going to create the unity to get rid of our government and get rid of netting out. Yeah, he's cousin the whole the whole people are tired. This is more shit man being drummed up and all the warmongers and fucking people that are beating those fucking war drums. It's like listen. 2021 was a big eye-opener for a lot of people when it came to supporting military action. Yeah, right. And like the military industrial complex is real, right. And it needs to be fed. It's a giant machine that you have to feed it. Right. You have to feed it almost every every couple of decades, right. Or at least every decade just about. And I think people are over it. You know, so I think there will be some unity from it. If any of it. And again, nobody wants any of this shit to happen. But should a national traumatizing event happen is going to create unity just not for the purpose that they wanted to. That's nobody's. I think I agree with that. Yeah. So there's a lot of NPCs, bro. I'm saying. So they repeat and pair it with the fuck they hear on TV and what they hear from their political party. And that's a disturbing reality. You know, for you to agree with everything that your quote unquote political party says or does. That's not a noble thing. And that's not an intelligent thing. You should have criticisms on your own political party about how they can do things better. That doesn't mean you're less bought in. That doesn't mean you're. It means you're a critical thinker and that you think for yourself. And if you don't have criticisms of and you're a Democrat and you don't have criticisms of Joe Biden, you're a fucking sheep. You're a fucking moron. Okay. And you can say the same thing about the other side. People who do not criticize Trump at all for anything that he says or does. And I think a lot of his criticism is bullshit. I'll just say that. But you know, like there are things that he should be criticized about. And for people who follow him to act like those things don't exist. That's equally moronic as these fucking zombies on the left. And dude, for us to get to a society that is real and that is going to move our country forward that is going to create a situation where your children grow up in a fruitful society. Or even have a chance to live in a free society. We are going to have to reorganize our thought process into making decisions and judging things based on fact and reality. We can no longer judge things on our feelings. The question should never be from this point forward. Is this offensive? The question should be is it true? And if we continue to ask that question. If it's true, without all the emotional stimulation, without all the propagation, without all the division, then we can start to solve problems in society and move forward as a collective. But until we get to that point where we are answering the question. Is it true? And we are basing our government and our decision making and our cultural society around facts and reality. And we will change it. We'll continue to digress into chaos. Do you understand what I'm saying? We have to stop pretending. This play time pretends shit. You know, a man could be a woman. A woman could be a man. Fucking all I mean my feelings 24 seven. I'm depressed. I'm anxious. I'm fucking I don't want to work anymore. Blah blah blah. You get a trophy for 100th place. Like dude, all this shit has to end. Like we have to get back to reality. Okay. And if we can't get back there, we can't fucking solve any of the problems. Okay. We need to look at the exact individuals. You know, when people say, oh, well, you know, 6% of the population creates 53% or 63% of the violent crime. I can't remember the date off top of my head with the five. Yeah, that's not saying that black should never be said. Blacks create all the crap. That's not how it should be said. It should be said. There's a bunch of criminals that happen to live in this group of people. We need to find out their fucking names and put them in fucking jail. Like bro, these generalizations and this fake shit. Brewing society. Brewing culture in society. And people are too afraid to say the facts. They are too afraid to say the truth. And then when they do when they do get the courage, they say it in a generalizing way, which only continues to propagate the issue at hand. You see what I'm saying? Absolutely. Like when this fucking crazy bitch is on TV talking about, you know, fucking Hitler and white people and all this shit. Bro, you're creating the problems. You're creating your own pro. Bro, white people are not the problems in the black community. You know what? White people say to fuck out of the black community because there are so many problems. And people don't even want to admit that. They don't want to say that because it's a quote unquote racist. Well, is it true? That's the fucking question that we should answer if we want to solve what's going on. You see what I'm saying? Like bro, we have like when people say, oh, it's the Jews. No, it's specific people that are causing this that are planning this out that are doing these things. And these people need to be held accountable. It's not an entire group of people. And until we stop this identity shit, which is racist towards everybody. It's racist to generalize any group of people. That's what racism means black people white people Jewish people. Fucking Latino people, whatever bro, when you say that and that comes out of your fucking mouth, that's racist shit. Real talk. And I know we joke a lot and we have fun and we we talk shit on the show. But like bro real shit, like it ain't cool. It's not cool to be like that man. No, no. No. God, let us know down in the comments. What you guys thought about this? Let us know with that big sales go check some. I got three of them for you. Oh, three. Yeah, we got three. We got we got three. So this, this first comment comes from Hey, it's Denise. Denise. Denise. Or Denise. I'll get on Denise. I'll let you be the judge of that. Several things being trans is not a mental illness. Oh. Not every trans person medically transitions. If you're not trans, fantastic. Save your breath. Don't eat yourselves alive. Freaking out about trans people existing. I'll never understand why cis people waste so much energy on things that don't pertain to them. People aren't having gender reassignment surgery left and right. It's seriously not as big of a deal as people are making it saying you quote don't care if someone is trans. It's not very convincing when you never shut up about trans people either admit that you care or stop talking about it in a negative way. Look her. Denzel. Let me fucking tell you something. Well, first of all, you go line by line. It is a fucking mental illness. I think that you're going to cut off your dick because you fucking think you're someone else. That's that's a mental fucking illness. Okay. Not every trans person medically trained cool. Fucking cool. So that's not a fantastic save your breath. No, this is my show. I'll say whatever fuck I want. Don't eat yourselves a lot. I don't about train. I don't give a fuck if they exist. I'll never understand why cis people. I'm not a cis person. I'm just a person way so much energy on things that don't pertain to them. That's where you're wrong, lady. They do pertain to me because fucking trans people grown men put on fucking drag and they dress as women and they run around society trying to shove it down. Everybody's fucking throw out and dance in front of everybody's kids. So it does pertain to us and we're fucking tired of it. Okay. Now if they were to just go along their way like everybody else does in reality. And I realize that yes, there are a lot of trans people that just go live their lives. And I'm sure if we ask them, they're irritated by this shit too. Okay. So there's a few things back, lady. You don't get it. People don't you don't have a right and nobody has a right to run and shove this shit in children's faces. No one has a right to tell me or tell you or tell anyone else that we have to play by a different set of rules. It's not about them existing. It's about them imposing a false reality on everybody else. And if we don't want to play the make believe candy land game, then we're called a big and a racist and you try to get us fired from our fucking jobs. Okay. So that's where we're at here. It's not we, you know, fucking are obsessed with this. It's that that group of people. It's a group of people imposes their will on people and you help them. In fact, you look like one of the ladies who's the upper middle class pinkies up, bruncher who makes all this shit their identity. So whatever dude, I don't really give a shit. Denise, Denzel, one of those either admit that I care you right, I do care. I care a lot. I care that I don't have my rights imposed on and that my children are taught to suck dicks when they're three years old. That's what I care about. I care about that a lot outside of that. I care that I'm told I'm a big it whenever I don't fucking know what the fuck I'm talking to and I say the wrong name. Okay. And I also care that I'm being forced to play make believe otherwise I'm a big it racist piece of shit. And I'm not the only one that cares. There's a whole bunch of fucking people that care. I'm just one of the only ones with the fucking balls to say it. I just need a god. Okay. Yeah. So I do care because they care. Now if they would stop caring and leave everybody to fuck alone and go on their way, I wouldn't care. So I don't care if that convinces you or not. But this is my show and I say whatever the fuck I want. One for one. Baby, let's keep this movement. We got another one. This comes from Ray Gatard one. Ray Gatard one. Gatard. G-G-E-T-A-R-D-1. Okay. That's guitar. Right. I fucking I guess he says another black and white video sets a somber music of a bearded man presumably no hair into that hat. You don't get the camera with obvious life platitudes if I had a nickel. I got fucking it. Fuck you talking about that. I thought they were talking about me at first and then I got sensitive. Hey, maybe they are talking about you. I don't know. Yeah. Fuck you there. Well, cool man. Look away. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You know that's a fun place. Well, it's fun. Yeah. It's fun. Yeah. You know, you can just swipe. You know what I'm saying? Like something must have caught your eye, bro. Yeah. Must have been this handsome face. That's what it was. Yeah. And by the way, feel free to jerk off to my hair. Asshole. Yeah. Two for two. Yeah. Guys, give me a little bit of one this. This is a go. It comes from a KDP body 1089. She says last night my 10 year old daughter made the most Andy comment after her brother lost a soccer game. He was pissed about the loss. And she confidently states quote, I don't know what losing feels like I always win. It must suck to be a losing. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Fuck she is wrong. Oh, fuck me. That's funny. Changed the world. What's savagin' time? I'm gonna talk about kill kill kill baby. Yeah. I love it. I love it. Guys, we appreciate you guys. We really appreciate you guys being real last fans. Thanks for like, commenting and sharing. Continue to not be horse. Yeah. You know what I like, bro? You know my favorite thing about the internet is was like when I see because like dude, you know, a lot of the clips get a lot of traffic, right? And sometimes I'll check out the comments. And I'll see a bunch of people talk a shit like that guy who said if he had a nickel, he'd be rich or whatever. I love that would people fucking bash these people in the comments. I always hammered. I always is he. They get a lot of you get hammered. I all dude. I love it. I always follow those people dude. I always try to follow them because like bro, why wouldn't you? Right? Like these people are sticking up for you when you ain't even around. They don't know you're gonna see the shit. They're just so to all you guys that do that shit. Thank you. It's awesome. I try to follow you when I see it. Yeah. That's real shit. Yeah. Well, let's keep this cruise moving. Man, got some. Got some other man. I don't see it all the time. But when I do, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. I'm like, yeah, when you do though. Yeah, our people are savage. They don't take no shit. That's real shit. Yeah. All right. Headline up to head on two reads. Anti abortion groups rally behind Trump despite their disappointment. Now this was an interest to want to see today. Now, you know, I know a lot of your stance on the show that, you know, abortions, it isn't a below the line issue. I agree with the same thing. Right? Like I mean, we got other bigger, bigger fish to fry right now. But this was a very interesting move to see coming out of Donald Trump's campaign, addressing the abortion and his stance on abortion. I thought it was really, really interesting. You know, but there's been some people that come out that like, you know, they don't agree with his stance 100%. No shit. But they still understand that he's the best option we got right. Oh, well, they're thinking what they're fucking brains now. Yeah. So anti abortion groups are dismayed with Donald Trump for failing to endorse a national band, but they are not abandoning him after a more than year long pressure campaign, pushing the former president to call for federal restrictions on abortion. Top anti abortion groups on Monday were dealt a major blow. Trump announced he believes abortions should be regulated at the state level. Here's his video from his campaign. People have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights, especially since I was probably the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal scholars both sides wanted and, in fact, demanded be ended. Roe V. Wait. They wanted it ended. It must be remembered that the Democrats are the radical ones on this position because they support abortion up to and even beyond the ninth month. The concept of having an abortion in the later months and even execution after birth and that's exactly what it is. The baby is born, the baby is executed after birth is unacceptable and almost everyone agrees with that. My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state. Many states will be different. Many will have a different number of weeks or some will have more conservative than others and that's what they will be. At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people. You must follow your heart or in many cases your religion or your faith. Do what's right for your family and do what's right for yourself. Do what's right for your children. Do what's right for our country and vote. So important to vote. At the end of the day, it's all about will of the people. That's where we are right now and that's what we want. The will of the people. So I mean, it's very simple. What's I think of the very just practical application, if you're going to address it, right? Like let the state decide if your state has two week of laws move. That's a strong move, right? But like the idea that this was a pressing issue. It's not top five. It's not top 10. I don't even think no. And fucking conservatives lose every mother fucking election on this one issue because there's too stupid. You jam it down. People stroats. You tell all these women what they can do with their body. It's no different than whenever they were telling you guys to get fucking vaxed. It's the same shit presented a different way and do the reality is is that it should be what he said and what most people agree with. Because there's more to this than what you what I saw this is that there are exceptions for incest and rape and the mother's health and things like that. And when these super mega right people who are anti abortion and they're fanatical about it. When you guys jam the shit down everybody's throat. Those people think that you want them to have babies when they're raped or when their dad has sex with them and rape some or when fucking you know an illegal immigrant rape some on the street. Like you guys are telling those women that they need to have those baby and there's very few women that agree with that very, very few. So women feel like they have to vote. Democrat otherwise they don't have that option for their own body. Okay. So Republicans and conservatives and common sense people lose people on this issue every time the reason that Biden was even elected last time was over this issue because they were saying the same shit. Trump wants to ban abortions Republicans want to ban abortions there my body my choice and you get every mother fucking woman out there doesn't matter where they come from saying dude that's not cool like what if this happens to me what if that happens to me what if this happens to our daughter what about this in this and this and this and then you try to present that to these like totally you know anti abortion activists and they're like you're out of line with God and this and that will bro not everybody believes the same things you believe. Okay. And this country was founded on multicultural existence. Okay. It is not a one religion nation. It's and you might think that you're going to get that but you're never going to get that again it's over. Okay. So we have to we have to understand that if we are to have freedom. We have to be people that have different views than us and if they differ than us we are going to have to tolerate those views at some level right now that doesn't mean tolerating people going in schools and shaking their dicks or minor attracted people or any of this shit but what it does mean is in cases like this where there's a below the line issue that does not affect people but a few times in their life. We're not going to present that issue as the top issue because we lose elections on it and then we see what's happening in the world now the economy shit crime goes crazy drugs are everywhere. Shits fucked up you know I could go down the list of a million different ways you know we're in the most vulnerable place we've been in for in my lifetime and you know these these these anti abortion people that this is like all they care about this is all they care about and it's like bro you're no different than the pro-borsion people and it's like dude it should be at the state level and it should be the people that are deciding and if you don't like what your state decides that means that you maybe don't belong in that state real talk right. It's a below the line issue and to the to where I feel about it because you're all going to fucking talk shit because you can't please anybody on this topic is that we need a common sense solution to this okay you got to understand we're not going to fucking agree with every single decision dude and you're going to throw away your own bank account your own livelihood your own career your own ability to live in a civilized society because you don't abortion is not going to be a good thing. abortion is not banned completely or you know your anti your pro abortion and that's all you care about what do you what how fucking stupid are you. So you're going to vote this way and ruin your entire fucking life and your existence in this country because it's on the one topic. Yes bro it's low IQ shit we have to start looking at at situations as above the line and below the line abortion is a below the line issue because of the infrequency that it is even brought up in people's life and if you're one of these people that's had 17 abortions stop fucking people okay have some personal responsibility right go get on the pill or fucking don't take so many dicks all right. Like real talk so like my whole thing is is like bro I don't agree I used to be totally pro choice as I've gotten older I've started to realize I don't agree with that because some people do it 500 times and that's their birth control right. So I don't agree with that but I also don't agree that you could tell someone what they can't it can't do. So I'm going to have to come to a reality here of like hey it's probably not a good thing there's much better options but in certain situations there should be exceptions made and I think that's very reasonable I think that's a reasonable way to look at it. I'm taking that a step further saying that it can it's not something that should be decided federally leave it up to the states. It's very fair I mean I agree I think it's the most fair he can get but of course Biden does agree with that. Oh well Biden accuses Trump of simply lying with abortion statement his statements said while all his empty words on fertility treatments Trump doesn't tell you the the magher republicans he controls in congress have put forth bills that could ban fertility treatments and that the speaker of the house has empowered he empowered is one of the strongest supporters for national abortion ban in the nation by the road let there be no illusion of Donald Trump is elected in the magher republicans in congress put a national abortion ban on the Resolute desk Trump will sign them into law he had it that's bullshit complete bullshit that's total bullshit bro these people are fucking liars you know like like the other woman who said oh he's going to run down and break the glass of the constitution these people are afraid and what they're really doing is projecting who signed 17 executive orders outside of congress the first day he was in office who did that he did oh that was Joe Biden who's put our country in this fucking terribly vulnerable position oh that was Joe Biden you know that woman on the first screen she's talking about you know I know what they'll do you know why she knows what they'll do because that's what the fuck you do these people are expert gas sliders and projectors projectors they fucking project everything a gas like you also not really happening and then by the time it's so undeniable that's happening they say well it's your fault that's happening you know like or it's good that it's happening right you know saying good thing yeah like these people are fucking pieces of shit yeah and and dude they're the tyrants okay and they tell you the reason they're so afraid now is because that's what they're going to do Trump's not going to do that Trump smart enough to understand that that's cost and people elections and that's what's driven us to this progressive crap that we have in society right now it's this one issue this one issue this one issue being jammed down women's throat has allowed our country to go so far fucking left that it's unrecognizable now side note here you know Biden brings up the resolute desk and I thought that was interesting because I also saw this headline and uh it's conservative drop this issue all together just dropped it they'd never lose an election ever again yeah never it's fine how it is right now it's fine keep moving like just keep it moving we got more important things to worry about but beside no no so Biden bought up this resolute desk right you know the desk they're using the over office did you see the statement that Trump put out saying that Donald Trump suggests Joe Biden soil the coveted resolute desk as he blasts president of a border policy and comments he made at investor dinner where he raised 50.5 million dollars so apparently Biden pissed himself I sit at the resolute desk Trump has the proof that this is absolutely real to the point he actually said he said the resolute desk is beautiful Trump claimed Ronald Reagan used it others used it he then sounded disgusted according to the unnamed tini quote and he's using it I might not use it next time it's been soiled and I mean that literally which is sad listen and it doesn't surprise me I fucking can't stand this I can't stand it dude the guy comes in he signed 17 executive orders shuts down domestic oil production fucks our entire economy fucks our supply chain up with draws from Afghanistan drains our strategic oil reserves gets us in all this shit causes massive amounts of inflation intentionally allows fucking tens of millions of migrants to come across the border who are now fucking up everybody's lives and this guy has the balls to any of these people have the balls to point their finger at fucking Trump that is Trump to arrange mason row 100% and I'm no fucking mad a super fan like I got plenty of criticisms about Donald Trump and I've made them clear on the show many times it's I fucking can't stand these fucking liars though yeah and he's pissing at the desk now I always do and bro these people are fucking disgusting people man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let's know what you guys think with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline up three bring it all together now got a little Joe Biden and foreign nationals so this headline reads Joe Biden balloons temporary amnesty to include 1.2 million foreign nationals all right so Joe Biden just gave amnesty temporary amnesty to 1.2 million of these illegals that also happen to be national foreigners from other countries yeah they're going to try to get these people to vote dude so president Joe Biden is up balloon the number of foreign nationals living in the United States who are eligible or receiving temporary protected status for TPS making them ineligible for deportation now this is interesting because what's the talk of the town right now Trump has said that we've said on the show these people need to be deported and it's interesting that no he's going to try listen between now and November they're going to try to grant amnesty to all of these people and they're going to do it little chunks at a time like this and event and they're going to fucking say these people are American citizens and they're allowed to vote they cannot be deported every single one of those motherfuckers going to vote for Biden because they don't want to be deported like this is how they're going to try to steal the election you're going to lose your fucking country because you fucking felt bad because AOC stood at the border and fucking fake cried and you're going to lose your country because you felt bad when 65% of them people coming across are military age single males you're going to feel you're going to lose your country because of that because you're fucking I can't stand it dude yeah analysis from the Pew Research Center reveals that our fucking Republican lawmakers and congresspeople and senators better get their fucking heads out of their asses yeah analysis from the Pew Research Center reveals that as of late last month almost 1.2 million foreign nationals are eligible or receiving TPS so they can stay in the United States secure work primates and avoid deportations and taking office Biden's Department of Homeland Security has added Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ukraine, Venezuela to the list of countries where nationals residing in the United States but who not have any immigration status can qualify for TPS last September by an extended TPS who almost half a million Venezuelans in the United States that was after almost a quarter million Venezuelans were offered TPS in 2021 so this is not nothing new they've been working it over 2 million people he's already gotten we're working it yeah they're already starting to push it in and on top of that another report comes out that on Biden's watch the nation's foreign-born population has exploded so not only are these people coming here illegally not only is he given them temporary protected status these people are multiplying within the country the latest estimates from the Center for Immigration Studies show that more than 51 million foreign-born residents now reside in the United States 51 million that's the largest ever in American history quote the foreign-born share of the US population has more than tripled since 1970 nearly doubled since 1990 and is up 40% just since 2000 see I asked researchers right since President Biden took office in January 2021 the foreign-born population has grown by 6.4 million people so that's just in the last four years and with this you know there's been some you know I think not just here in this country there's starting to be a lot of upticks in society of people basically getting tired of this illegal situation that we have going on you're seeing a lot more serious Americans are being replaced okay Americans don't like the government so the government doesn't change their policy because they're supposed to serve Americans so they don't that you want evidence that these people are fucking not are people look what they're doing we don't like what they're doing so their solution is to bring in a new voter base that's their solution and you think these people give a fuck about you and me they're trying to replace you they're going to replace you with an entire group of people that aren't from here work born here come from other places don't share American culture for their own ability to steal our tax dollars and corrupt our system and to stay in power and to come out worth hundreds of millions of dollars so these people are selling you and me and everybody else down the fucking toilet so that they can get rich and they can stay in power and you think we don't need a massive change in the system well people don't realize how bad it really is no but some people are some people are realizing hey we got to take action to our own hands I got a clip here from Belgium of a migrant causing some problems and being dealt with and we're starting to see it all over the country there's another clip here coming out of New York City let's watch this first clip though real quick this is a in Belgium it's a migrant he started throwing stuff that people and it gets dealt
