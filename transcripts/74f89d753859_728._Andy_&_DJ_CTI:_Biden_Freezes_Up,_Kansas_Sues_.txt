seller.com you guys can find them linked that with that being said let's get to our first headline man um um I don't even know how to go like let's get into it fuck it uh white house defends Biden after video shows him freezing up at Hollywood fundraiser being led off stage by Barack Obama did you see that video yeah it's pretty bad um and everybody's seen it right and this is what we talk about they will lie straight to your fucking face right everybody has seen this video by now we have the clip of course if you guys have not yet um but everybody seen the video and and what's what's there uh the knee jerk reaction is to lie and defend it that it didn't happen um even though millions of people have bought now I've already seen this um so let's dive into this so yeah the white house uh is again defending Joe Biden from the appearance of dementia on the world stage after videos were posted late Saturday night showing Biden freezing up at a Hollywood fundraiser and then being led off stage by Barack Obama here's the clip let's clip clearly shows him freezing right but uh Andrew Bates uh whose ex-pokes person um decided to tweet this out uh he says uh quote fresh off being fact check by at least six mainstream outlets for lying about at podis with cheap fakes who per Murdoch sad little super pack the New York post is back to disrespecting its readers and itself once again their ethical standards could deal with a little unfreezing um and then follow that up by saying quote by pretending the president is taking in an applauding crowd for a few seconds is somehow wrong all they are really admitting is once again is they can't take on the leadership that's fueling the strongest economic growth in the world and bringing violent crime to a 50 year low um that that's their that's the defense so he was wait wait wait so this dude here is saying first of all first of all okay there's a lot here yeah how much more do you have yeah i mean just hold on some new data i know what you can pause here i don't know what you have you know why because i know what the fuck i'm talking about let me tell you what it is number one uh it's very clear that Barack Obama's run in the show first number two i bring bigger crowds than those two fuckers together that's a fact number three which i should number three the strongest economic growth all right mother fucker well let's talk about that for a second you got that you got that data oh you don't need it because i know it all right here it is uh you can't count closing the country eliminating jobs closing companies because of a vaccine and a lockdown that the media and the democrats colluded to create and then that coming back as record job growth all right that means that we could just wipe everything out today and then we could say oh the new stuff that's record growth no it's not record growth it is the result of the actions they took during 2020 and 2021 that they are now posturing to pretend like it's growth and what's weird is we have all these people on the internet who say oh look how great the economy is doing and you're these people are so misinformed i don't i don't know what to say but anyway the point is uh it's not the strongest economy ever otherwise we wouldn't have debt at an all-time high and savings at an all-time low okay uh we wouldn't have the inflation we have we wouldn't have interest rates where they are there's a whole bunch of things do you guys feel like it's the strongest economy that you've ever been in how's your paycheck doing how's that feel okay how's it feel to be told that we're in the strongest economy ever and uh your money's going 20 to 25 percent less as it was in 2020 how how's that feel so you're just a missbender you're just irresponsible with your money right because that's what they're telling people they're telling people hey you're uh not responsible with your money and so that's why you're poor no it's because they're making you poor and then they're trying to convince you that it's you secondly uh 25 percent less reporting a violent crime across the country by the uh crime statistics hmm that's interesting and by the way the crime that they do report when they report uh it being Hispanic they're chalking up to white people so crime is down but white crime is up right weird yeah yeah yeah that was that close yeah your spot fucking on um because the thing is guys you gotta understand how how actual crime reporting works right there's local police departments right you have this shit right a crime goes in yeah I can pull up the map for you um they are crime happens and that local agency tracks that crime they put it to their statistics their arrest records and things like that now there's typically always give or take about 5 percent um that do not actively engage in a formal electronic uh tracking program right and so the way it works is that local PD they report to the state how they patrol typically how they patrol reports that yeah so normally we have 95 percent reporting typically right and when we're then the ones that are not reporting we're talking about these are small little you know departments scattered around in these small little places as a county yeah exactly you don't say like nobody really let's not a lot going on there anyway right but pretty much for the most part everybody reports right everybody's reporting in um but that's has not been the case right and we got the baited to prove it um just just here recently um let me pull this map up for you guys this is not fucking stupid they think people are bro and that will be honest a lot of people are this stupid because you see them repeating the shit on the internet yeah here it is so just and and and just in 2022 right there was a total of a little bit over 6,000 agencies that submitted zero data zero data that's 32 percent of all police agencies did not report any data for 2022 hmm that's a shit ton yeah so 70 percent 68 percent reported versus 95 percent normally and crimes down now look at the the point you feel like crime is down right and where's those repeat all you might the fuckers that live in LA in San Francisco and New York you guys feel like crime is down hmm let us know right what's the thing and so like the crime is obviously not down it's not stopping nobody's stupid but because they're not reporting this and I want to know who made that decision to not report it because we're these are the same people who made the decision to tell people that the economy is the best it's ever been exactly so they're just not reporting it which makes it appear on paper as if crime is down but that's not the case everybody knows it's not the case um this is the actual truth more crimes about to be committed this is the truth man um you know so yes I mean and you base is a complete dumbass nobody's nobody's stupid um no people are stupid listen we're not stupid depending on who you ask you know right some of your motherfuckers watch the show just call stupid that's okay you're stupid too um but do we really see people on the internet like echoing these things like like what do like it's it's so weird man because like it feels like there's people that just want to be right like they don't want their life to improve they don't want things to get better they don't want more money in their bank account or less crime or more safety they just want to be right they just want to say my guys my team my party my candidate is right and that is not productive to any sort of solution for anyone and um it's weird dude because we see people parroting these points over and over and over again on the internet and I'm just like dude what do you like I know you know what just happened I know you can see it like I've had these little arguments with people I know and they're like oh the economy I'm like this this this I name off a couple things they're like yeah but nobody right no your life is shitting or than it was four fucking years ago and if it isn't it's because you were shit then and you're shit now and you're not doing anything and it's not my responsibility as a citizen of this country to fund your shitty lifestyle okay there was a time in this country where everybody was expected to contribute everybody was expected to have a job everybody was expected to pay their bills take care of their families and be a pillar of their community now what we're expect those people are expected to pay for the shitiest fucks in the entire society and then nobody wants to pay for and by the way when we go out in public those people harass us fuck with us break our cars steal our shit but let's give them our money like bro we got to get back to this shit dude there has to be a system put in place for people who do not contribute to not have a say in what we do in this country those people should not be allowed to vote like if you want contributing and you didn't have a job and you don't get a tax return what are you going to vote for you're going to vote for other people's money to make its way into your pocket yeah through program incentives through government and censoring and what incentive does the average american have to go out and work knowing that they're going to be tax-raped for these people who aren't doing shit right there is no incentive and that's the point the point is is to remove the incentive of the working class the people who take pride in being independent and contributing and have responsibilities to themselves their community their family the culture the country and remove that incentive so that everybody says fuck it and just depends on the government which creates a communist system that's what's happening and because people are afraid to speak up and because they've been bullied and because they've been harassed they're still afraid to speak up when in reality the people that they're speaking up against is like a less than a 1% of the entire population and if we all spoke up and we all said hey this is enough if you're not contributing to this fuck off you don't get a chance you don't get to vote like why does a felon doesn't a felon lose the right to vote so why does a felon lose the right to vote but people who don't pay taxes can vote both are not contributing to this yeah why is that right you see what I'm saying right it doesn't make sense no it makes zero sense and and people don't think about it man they don't talk about it enough no now so you got that gap that happens right he's freezing again and this is obviously I mean this is happening more and more all right it's almost daily now right we know we got the bit debates coming up here shortly in a couple of weeks now there's an interesting play that's being ran right now that they we are very familiar with this play because they ran it against a good buddy of large airgriptons this mass media campaign to try to we're talking about dumping tens of millions of dollars right into certain demographics to repeat these ads and so Biden's campaign they just came out they announced a 50 million dollar advertising blitz highlighting Trump's convention conviction now mind you this little fundraiser thing they just did here they allegedly raised like 24 million dollars here okay so two of these events or they're equivalent of two of these events they're putting all into a one campaign at that's targeting Trump President Joe Biden's reelection campaign is spending 50 million dollars in two weeks and a blitz that includes its first television at trumpeting Donald Trump's felony conviction and signals that the Democratic incumbent is seeking to make his Republican opponents legal woes a bigger issue heading into November I thought it was interesting to write about 50 million only one million is being geared and targeted towards reaching black Hispanic and Asian American voters so 49 million dollars to talk it why do you think that is it's weird no why do you think only one million geared towards black voters oh think about it I mean out of 50 million dollars you're only because they know they lost it no because it's not a point to the black voter because how many black voters know a felon it's pretty fucking regular thing okay they're cousin their family their friend their uncle and by the way what do most black people feel about those people they feel like the system has unjustly punished and made a felon out of those people so these people understand that if we push that message to the black community to blow up in our face because all it does is reinforce the idea that the the court system is fucking weaponized smart and then they say well fuck bro that's what they do to us and these people understand that so what they're going to add yeah right yeah you know you see that's what I do for a living here's another thing it's a truth yeah I fucking I'm probably I understand the marketing they don't know yeah here's the other thing these motherfuckers don't understand this is how fucking stupid they are like on one hand they're smart they're smart not to direct that to black voters on the other hand they're stupid because they just saw Trump raise over a hundred million dollars off of his conviction so if the data shows you that when you push this message out it makes his support go up now you're gonna spend fifty million dollars pushing that message out further like how fucking stupid are you guys but I'm glad they're stupid especially when especially when it's very high likely that this case could get over it's hurting the appeals court listen dude no it's it's it's highly unlikely did you uh did you look at the Supreme Court in New York would their stacked up against yeah I saw the picture yeah I saw the picture so huh let me tell you some it's all black it's a all black women Supreme Court it is in New York yeah they're gonna be getting their payback every single one of them is left yeah yeah yeah anyway yeah so good do it yeah go remind everybody what the fuck you did to Trump push it out there yeah because do the people that believe it they already believe it you're not gonna convince anybody else nobody's saying out here nobody's gonna say well fuck I guess he is guilty I'm not gonna vote for him like nobody's gonna say that ever all this can do all of all this can do is make people say fuck look how hard these motherfuckers are trying to get this dude yeah I'm not fucking voting for these people that's all that can have obvious listen that's all that can happen these people are dumb as fuck pretty smart to not market at the black people though and that's why they're doing it yeah no they make perfect fucking sense here's the ad I got I got an exclusive video here's the ad in the courtroom we see Donald Trump for who he is he's been convicted of 34 felonies found liable for sexual assault and he committed financial fraud meanwhile Joe Biden's been working lowering health care costs and making big corporations pay their fair share this election is between a convicted criminal who's only out for himself and a president who's fighting for your family I'm Joe Biden and I approve this I don't think he approved that message dude this is what you get when you get a bunch of fucking D.I. leftist interns and marketing consultants they're fucking more eyes bro they couldn't run a fucking snow cone stand they couldn't run a single retail store of mine not for a day think about that those people run the country yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments who are these people in this picture who's that behind him I'm pretty sure that's uh that's that's one of his granddaughters or grandays that's a that's a boy or girl sure yeah that's my figure yep it's one of them that's why people ship bro that's rich why people fucking close the and that those people and then you know here's their conversation bro we got to get in with the black people I got an idea we get a bucket of fried chicken like like dude we go to the dinner and we can tape it we put on TV dude listen people have no idea like dude you watch everyone I know you don't watch it but uh what's do's name uh Charlemagne yeah Charlemagne the God Reppers Club like bro that like like I I don't Joe Biden looked him in the fucking face and said if you don't vote for me you ain't black and Charlemagne stepped back and he's like whoa whoa whoa you know like that's a little outline right and that's still not enough to like open his eyes to what's going on right and like I if you guys really understood how racist these people actually are not a single black person in this country or a single mixed race or a single brown person whatever fucking vote for these people think of this and once you think of this now look at that kid go back look at what that kid's wearing that kid's wearing a sweater around his fucking neck jort and some fucking stupid ass shoes and like this guy came straight from fucking Delaware or Martha's Vineyard or Connecticut or some shit like that right like we don't even see people dressed like that around here it looks like he got just got off a sailboat okay now that's who these people are now I'm being serious listen to me that's who these people are these are ultra rich ultra quote unquote elite white people okay who do not connect with black people in any way and when they sit down and they say hey how are we gonna connect with black people they legitimately come up with shit like dude let's get fried chicken and go to a black family's house and let's shoot a commercial people I don't know like how the black community doesn't see how they think like lately yes like this is not a joke they're not this is not a lit they're kind of racist or they just don't know no that's what they think now if I sat around and I said hey DJ I got a PR problem bro black people don't like me yeah I got an idea I got an idea yeah tell me what you think about it we'll go to Kentucky fried chicken no think about this it'll work we'll go to Kentucky fried chicken I'll get a bucket of chicken bro and we'll go over to like one of your cousins houses and we'll shoot a commercial and we'll put it on YouTube dude and they'll love us we think we're doing original or we're doing crispy crispy man but dude this is what they think yeah like think how fucking racist that really is like when they say shit like I'm gonna chose it hold on when Kathy Hocal says shit like black people don't know how to use a computer or when they say shit like black people can't don't know how to get ideas to vote right bro these people fucking hate black people they fucking hate them dude they hate them and it's so bizarre because we see all these videos online of white white Democrats going up to black people I saw this video I don't know if did you see that video up the black couple in the airport a day right you sent it to me yeah yeah I got that clip this clip right here yeah yeah so we need to go walk into the Blacks and even right we're walking across the street and there's white women coming up behind us and first is she asks us who is it always carried down here because we're in Detroit never been in Detroit before but the first black black people saw a assuming that we're from here I'm assuming because you know we're Negro then she proceeds to tell us oh you guys know shrimp it's you better watch out I've seen a lot of white Mac is walking around with the American flag you know you guys be careful guys hey crime how'd you feel about the hate crime I'm offended I feel fried in eye I don't know how I'm going my life literally she know we're on our ways to convince you bro but this is what these these fuckers think okay Kathy Holtko Joe Biden all these people this is what they think and this is oh yeah Hillary Clinton look at her fucking outfit like she's a fucking Empress my auntie had that couch bro look what she's wearing and you tell me she doesn't think she's some sort of look dude who would wear that under what circumstance with anybody no anybody wear that would you fucking grandma wear that I'm telling my auntie you had a couch to look just like oh listen be serious that is some fucking fucked up shit to wear that's like that would be like me wearing like a royal outfit and a cape and shit to like a fucking event with suits it sounds like a good idea I'm sure you probably pulled off yeah but she thinks she's a fucking Empress or some shit anyway the point of the matter is these people Joe Biden fucking Kathy Holtko Hillary Clinton all these people and then all these upper middle class white women they this is this is how they think dude this is not an accident this is not an accident this is not oh it's just a slip of the tongue they think fuck dude you know fried chicken and fucking watermelon like that's what the fuck these people think it's fucked up man and it's weird that people vote for yeah it's super weird I wouldn't know who the fuck still donating to him you know I'm saying because like he's pulling in a lot of fucking money to have like we know he's not getting any actual fucking support like his donor numbers for people that are done in under 20 bucks under 40 bucks it's not existed where that's like a huge part of Trump's money massive amount right like that even right there just clearly shows who has the fucking people well I mean look dude it's all the people who are in danger of being lumped in with this far left progressive shit this communist shit which is what it is you know it's Hollywood it's these big corporations that are in bed with the world economic forum who are you know all about ESG and D.I. and they bought into this new globalization effort and quote unquote new world order of the world economic forum it's those people because there's so far into the process like imagine if you had spent tens of millions of dollars restructuring your company to be less competitive meaning you're making all these regulations around ESG you're making all these hires around D.I. meaning you're hiring people for the color of their skin not how good they are okay and you've made your company less competitive and you've spent hundreds of millions of dollars doing so and you're in danger of that entire dynamic being dismantled what's that worth for you to keep it whatever whatever it takes right because it'll crumble the the way a company is set up at that scale it takes too long for them to undo that if they're playing changes so what we're really seeing here is a lot of big companies and a lot of industries like Hollywood and big business big business like fortune 100 companies these people are in danger of crumbling if the democrats don't win because you can't read if you've already hired you can hire somebody for being black you can't fire for being black okay there's so how do you undo this right if you're a company who's done this how do you undo it not just black either I'm talking about anything I'm talking about I'm talking about anybody that was hired for any reason other than they were the best for the job how do you undo that well you can't and if the if the society changes and the market changes and the competitive landscape changes those companies can't undo what they've already done fast enough to survive so what you're seeing is as a ton of money go to Biden in the hopes that it will keep them from having to try and readjust which they don't think they won't be able to do they have to go always so what we're seeing is is either the complete crumbling of all of these people or and and the complete revitalization of America and capitalism and competitive environment free market economy or we're going to see the total grasp grasp of communism come in and the entire free market economy collapse you know it's one of those two things yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think uh with that being said in it let's go check some of these out I got two of them for you here today uh as we cruise the comments this first comment comes from at old man 9606 can't find first form grape energy drink anywhere in Jacksonville Florida I need one because I'm trying to leave my wife hey go in your stores and ask for the drink yeah I go into your local sea store go into your local grocery store go into your local nutrition store and say hey you guys got first four energy drinks fucking ask for it no because if you ask for it they'll pick it up and they'll carry it right there for you yeah I think they should have be careful because you know in like the the areas for high crime these uh huh what these are having well they're not reporting crime that's true that's right that's true go in and ask for the drink dude and tell them tell them if they don't have it they should have it because it's the shit yeah it's real shit it's real shit appreciate you old man um thank you uh this next one comes from at Dustin Johnson uh he says quote uh

know domestic terrorism conversation guys just keep this show moving got headline number two this is an interesting one coming from our border state um Kansas coming try out on the camp Kansas trying to drop some colonies oh really yeah that's interesting headline uh hella on reads Kansas sues Pfizer over misrepresentations and adverse events of COVID-19 vaccine this is interesting this is this is this is this is some heat who what like what is in Kansas besides Vaughan Vaughan I don't think I've ever been to Kansas it's long and flat and and that word Dorothy's from from Wizard of Oz and shit who oh yeah yeah Wizard of Oz okay all right that's it hey I mean I've driven through there are a number of times I can't tell you what's there I have you have a bunch of I live in Kansas my whole life it's great oh yeah sure all right um so let's dive into this a little bit so the state of Kansas has filed a lawsuit against pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc for alleged cut consumer protection violations related to the company's manufacturer of the COVID-19 vaccine saying the company marketed the shot as quote safe even though it quote new the vaccine was connected to serious adverse events quote Pfizer misled the public that it had a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine the 69 page lawsuit filed Monday in the district court of Thomas County alleges quote Pfizer said his COVID-19 vaccine was safe even though it knew its COVID vaccine COVID-19 vaccine was connected to serious adverse events including myocarditis and pericarditis uh failed pregnancies and deaths Pfizer concealed this critical safety information from the public the pseudologists uh continue to go on and say Pfizer said its COVID-19 vaccine was effective even though it knew its COVID-19 vaccine waned over time it did not protect against COVID-19 variants Pfizer concealed this critical effectiveness information from the public um the lawsuit alleges that the companies uh quote actions and statements relating to its COVID-19 vaccine violated the Kansas Consumer Protection Act regardless of whether any individual consumer ultimately received Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine um and it continues to say quote Pfizer must be held accountable for falsely representing the benefits of its COVID-19 vaccine while concealing and suppressing the truth about its vaccine safety risk waning effectiveness and inability to prevent transmission there are there are hitting it on all heads here coming straight out of Kansas uh so the suit uh it was filed by Republican Attorney General Chris Cobbich who alleges that through the company's misrepresentations of the vaccine it earned quote record company revenue of approximately 75 billion dollars in just two years don't don't don't forget that was about a billion of that that went to the media campaign just to push this stuff and then um about another billion dollars or so or three quarters of a billion that went into the pockets of Fauci and his uh numb nuts um yeah so the lawsuit alleges that millions of kanzians uh heard Pfizer's misrepresentations about its COVID-19 vaccine for example Pfizer administered 3.3 million Pfizer vaccine doses just in Kansas as of February 7th 2024 this accounted for more than 60% of all vaccine doses in Kansas uh the lawsuit alleges citing the uh states Department of Health data um and so they're bringing all of this in um it's a it this has a potential of being a big crime um or being a big a pretty healthy lawsuit i don't know what happens here though i don't know what happens here like what's gonna like is there where we talk in restitution is the money going back to the families that were affected by this right like i mean we know like they're starting to talk more and more and more about this COVID stuff we're seeing the other countries do it um i saw i saw another country do it they were talking about i don't remember who it was but they were talking about how um they had some other versions of the vaccine from other companies in europe and then they outlawed all those versions and made everybody take the Pfizer shot um it was like i can't remember who it was anyway yeah this is their AG that's him there mm-hmm yeah and anyway we got on this well first of all hmm shit um i'll say this i still can't believe people even fucking got that shit but when i think about it and i almost wonder if they i believe personally that a lot of people who took this are gonna die that's my personal belief i i believe we've all we're only two years out of this right what's gonna happen in five years what's gonna happen in seven years and remember when they when they tried to seal the data for 75 years mm-hmm i think their plan is that there's going to be so many people that die that there's not gonna they're it's not they're not gonna have to deal with it by the time nobody will even remember well i'm just saying like i don't i think this is much worse and a much bigger thing than what we think it is right now yeah it just hasn't been enough time yeah mm that's my personal opinion dude the the amount of people that are dying now and it's so bizarre that people aren't willing to like even admit it yeah like i still see this on the internet like you say things about this and people are like oh your fucking could wrote the the all-cause mortality rate across the globe is up 40 fucking percent and do you know where it's the lowest it's the lowest in the countries that had the least amount of vaccines administered okay and we could go through the list of things that are happened my carditis turbo cancers etc etc etc and people still want to deny that this is happening and i think a lot of it is probably from fear right a lot of people are probably terrified um but i don't think we've even started to see the damage of what these people actually did um i think it's gonna get much worse do they they're crazy thing is too man like like i said there was so much that happened in just those two beginning you're too man that like people like i don't know if they tend to tend to forget i know there's a lot of information they just try to keep throwing out so it kind of you know gets lost in the way so i mean but there was the the part that that always made me go like away this has to be bullshit is because there was this global push you had countries who were denying the vaccine from coming into their country get assassinated yeah leaders right like like leaders like the one in Haiti two two days after he he said that we're not doing the covid vaccine here he's assassinated that dude over there in africa who said who ran the PCR test against a piece of kiwi and it came back positive for co to show to show that the cycle rate and then they assassinated like this and he in a couple of days later he's gone yeah right like there was just it was just the whole thing about like i remember just initially the whole thing about it was just fucking weird it didn't make sense it did not make sense did you see this shit in Mexico bro all these political candidates that got assassinated yeah and then that woman one who nobody knows knows who she is she's not even mexican she's fucking Jewish is Jewish weird that's fucking crazy dude weird anyway weird man yeah so i mean good luck to this guy man i listen you're you're going to get part of me here look man part of me thinks part of me thinks the people who didn't take it weren't supposed to take it like dude if we're if we want to put on our doctor evil hats right and we say okay let's just take it from their position and we are you and me run the earth okay it's just me and you all right and do i have to wear the pantsuits huh that we both got emperor outfits but okay that's what you got to wear apparently all right claw shop schwa bwaism yeah fucking obama wears them fucking hilly wearism like bro these people are not they're not like us they are different they are fucking evil people but we let's just say we think like them and we say you know all right we got to take because according to the the Georgia guide stones which is apparently what these people all believe and follow we've got about seven billion extra people on the planet okay so we got to reduce it down to about a billion or less okay so how are we going to do that well well who do we want to get rid of first because that's obviously going to be part of the conversation well we got to get rid of the strong people patriotic people hold on hold on the first part of the conversation is who do we want to get rid of we have to make that decision right if we were doing this so if you were trying to create a successful society and reduce the population and you didn't have any give a fuck about people at all who goes didn't care wouldn't it make sense that we would say okay we're going to get rid of the weakest dumbest easiest to manipulate people because we don't want those people to be the people that are left because we're going to need to rebuild civilization with those people so wouldn't it make sense that we're going to try and eliminate all the people who are easily manipulated who are depending on the governments who are not very intelligent they can't critically think wouldn't it make sense to get rid of all those people and keep everybody else yeah take care of a lot of people whoever falls for it let's just go that's what i'm saying yeah because then who's left or the people who could critically think and they can help contribute to the rebuilding of society globally you can probably get rid of a few more to doing some wars and shit here and there yeah but i'm just saying if i work doctor evil and i said okay like just like running a company bro all right we got to downsize the company who the fuck we get rid of right we're gonna rid of everybody who doesn't produce we're getting rid of everybody who's not contributing we're getting rid of everybody who's a drag keep the good ones what you think these people are doing anything different right that's what makes me think because dude the people who didn't get it uh you know contrary to what the media says and by the way there's a lot of evidence that says that these people didn't even get it themselves right they were taking fucking saline shots on TV and jailing other nurses for doing the same thing to regular people correct so that's where my mind starts to go when we start to like break down you know who got it for what reason and why do we give this to certain people and we were just supposed to shut up and that's right that's right yeah or or you know just endure it and wait until all the fucking cards fall yeah i don't know man yeah guys tell us what you guys think that's not down in the comments that that's just that's just pure speculation on my part like it's hard for me to put my mind frame uh around what these people think yeah because i don't think like that yeah that's a meevil shit man yeah that's a meevil shit and uh good luck good luck AG coming out of Kansas man everybody else should be joining that yeah all the other AGs should be joining that yeah for sure uh guys let's keep this show moving we got head on number three a third and final headline head on number three uh we're gonna struck this one off with the clip man i Matt Kim who we've had on the show yep super awesome guy he just does some really really good breakdowns of things um and so this clip uh came up from Matt Kim um this is his analysis on the on the interesting uh thread that has gotten pulled um and he started going after and i've got some supporting stuff to even support his point um so let let's just watch this clip real quick here's Matt Kim do you wonder where all the Ukraine money is going well looks like we've scattered a threat to pull idol is trying to shut off water to 500,000 acres of farmland 781 miles but there's been plenty of rain this spring so that's not it they say it's due to water reserves underground that it's projected to the plate at a too fast for rate to preserve water supply they need to shut off the water to 500,000 acres of idol farmland but but the continued appropriations and Ukraine's supplemental appropriations act of 2023 proved 4.5 billion dollars for direct financial support to the government of Ukraine or so they said germany's global limited enters an agreement of 15 million dollars for information on drilling at its idol cobalt mine utilizing funds from the additional Ukraine supplemental appropriations act why is money for direct financial support for the government of Ukraine being rerouted by the department of fence to a cobalt mine in idol cobalt using batteries for your phones computers electric cars there are countless valuable usages for cobalt any side effects of cobalt we should be aware of considering we use it in everything cobalt exposed your triggers impairments and cognitive and anxiety like behaviors brain oxidative stress and inflammation and you know what's a necessary component of cobalt mining in mass guessed it water lots of water on May 31st 2024 Idaho Department of Water announced shutting off water to 500,000 acres of farmland June 21st 2024 Jurevoys cobalt mine can start drilling 24 hours day seven days a week idol is shutting off water due to a shortage at the same time the cobalt mine is set to start operating 24 a seven and as you create funding bill one of many that gave 15 million dollars to Jurevoys to restart operations after losing money cobalt things to look further into how many members of congress have a financial interest in this cobalt mine my initial research a lot also is it linked to the chips act where they gave micron a fistful money to start manufacturing in Idaho and are they trying to destroy crops so they can take the land and mine more cobalt or is it purely to control the water supply I was just in Idaho absolutely beautiful state filled with great people and the government shows up with the government gun and forces their will again maybe it's just a coincidence and I'm just a conspiracy perhaps but one fact remains absolutely true money that we were told was going to crane is not there is no coincidence and so I looked into this man and I backed it up here's the article that he references they are absolutely shutting off the water to the local farmers and even the local farmers are pissed off saying that this water curtailment will dry up their land and more importantly this order came after they had already paid for fertilizer at the cost of about $400 per acre so they're already in a back low they need this water so the crops can actually grow and they can get the yield of the harvest they put this in after they've already fertilized they've already dumped a shit ton of money into their crops and now they have no water to actually do anything with it they still have the water they didn't shut it off what do you mean it's not been shut off yet there's been a stay put on it yeah and my that's what I heard the the should there it says unless there's emergency stay to curtailment order young said the water will be shut off from what I understand there was a stay oh a stake dig it put it that's what I heard that's what that's what I heard I could be wrong on that yeah yeah but here's the point uh the government shouldn't be sticking their fucking nose and anything like this dude keep going it's so irritating no um but yeah I've I've checked all of these uh these articles that were referenced and they're they're all there um the drilling is about to start they stopped it back in June of last year um and now it's about to start it back up so it is interesting that you know there's this threat of of of curtailing the water to all of these farmers 500,000 acres of farmlands by the way Idaho is one of our biggest states that produce a lot of necessary food for us the number three producer for dairy um number third you know number three state in the country that produces dairy for us um obviously potatoes a lot of things um they come out of Idaho and not not to mention there I mean here's another twist and this could be me reaching um but Idaho has seen a lot of people moving there um fleeing from liberal policies and progressive policies all over the country from California to New York um people are are flocking to Idaho in droves um where they have had a significant surge um of just even 12% you just look at the Idaho it's not a big I mean it's a big state but it's not a lot of people there to begin with 12% increase in the population just in a couple of years is a lot um and they're going there for their conservative policies for their conservative mindsets their values their morals um and so I think that's interesting too um what do you think is interesting about that well I mean it's a flock it's just it's no different than what they're doing to the people that are moving down in Texas right like there's a drove there for conservative policies and there's waters water's water's being impacted there like Trinity Grids being impacted there the rights of drill is being impacted there so you get what you're saying is you think punishing you think that the government is intentionally making life harder for these places that these people who are traditionally progressive and liberal who vote for these people have been escaping to correct got it at least that's I mean that's just how I see it right because it's not just Idaho it's a lot of these places that are being affected by some level of government overreach right um you know and and even just the fact that you know there's taxpayers money that is going to supposedly supposed to be going to Ukraine that again then gets funneled back uh this gervose company is not an American company it's an australian subsidiary right um with no ties to here drilling on an actual uh reservation um of uh state certified land for um what do they call it like protected forces and shit is what it is um here's the picture of the mind it's a massive fucking cobalt mind um yeah where where's all these save the world people here right you know all right green energy yeah okay right so I mean that's a that's a lot going on here man anyway what do you got on this I think the time to speak up was many years ago and I think people are panicking now and I think the government is in very nefarious and the things that they do and I think this serves a bunch of purposes one that allows them to uh reallocate the water to the mind operation which they have an interest in uh and many members of congress according to Matt Kim which I'm sure he's probably correct have a financial interest in two I think it lends itself to the limit of the food supply you know whoever controls the food supply controls the people again another salalinsky rules for radicals call mark strategy which is to control and affect the food supply so that people can't get um you know what they need to do and so you know if they don't have water for the farm operation and they're making money with the cobalt operation that makes sense that you know it accomplishes two things with one action you know they're able to limit the food supply and they're also able to control the people and you know they're making some money doing it yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always uh thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is what we're bringing headline in we talk about it and I get one of those two options I'm gonna test it I'm I'm I'm I might be pushing boundaries on this one okay California woman harassed by aggressive black bear she named big bastard before fatal mauling in home holy shit bro that way so this was uh wait wait yeah this was California woman was harassed let's dive into it uh Patrice Miller who 71 years old had been harassed by an aggressive black bear in her small northern California town for months before it broke into her home and killed her last year just saying you don't see the polar bears doing this shit it's all I'm saying I mean it can't argue with facts it's only the brown and black bears are doing this just saying pregnant home do you think they have rallies and shit who the bears it's a shit ton of them in California apparently you think they all get together and talk about how they're getting discriminated against uh they would have to break in people shit you know so when officials found first found Miller's body mauled and partially eaten last November her uh downyville home they first believed she may have died of natural causes and the bear broke in attracted by the scent but neighbors have reported seeing the bear with she had dubbed big bastard repeatedly returning to her house according to the sacramental beat Miller even installed steel bars across her windows to try to keep the bear out before it broke her door down the newspaper reported uh quote it appeared that the bear had probably been there several days and have been feeding on the remains Sierra County Sheriff Mike Fisher said Sierra County Sheriff's the about deputies found Miller's door broken um which appeared to be how the bear got inside inside her living room there was bear scat along with blood streaks and paw prints the bear had likely pulled Miller from her bed into the her living room the coroner's report said according to the B he wanted to watch TV yeah you know watch TV while you watch some really helpful that's right uh so the small mountain town is quote right in the middle of where bears like to be right in hood katlyn uh ridey of California fish and wildlife's north central region to the newspaper uh Miller's friend Casey Koch uh is that how you guys pronounce that the coke you know um Casey Coke who initially asked for a welfare check on her it's old to be quote when I was a kid you never saw my phone I can't help it I can't fucking help it you can't fucking read motherfucker wait listen to this part though it's great okay redo it listen to this this is what's redo it Casey Casey Koch uh Miller's friend Casey Koch who initially asked for a welfare check on her uh told to be quote when I was a kid you never saw bear in town now they're all over making their rounds yeah is this a fucking joke that's real back of my day we have these type of problems now we're all moving here take it over causing all this wreck is oh shit hmm that's polar bear flight right there buddy oh man now around 40% of California's estimated 65,000 black bears live in the Sierra Nevada's where down he villas located according to the paper the bear let's get the crime data yeah the bear was eventually trapped and euthanized um recording uh to the sources hey bro hold on wait I gotta read that again hold on man dude there's no way that's a real quote this has to be when I was a kid you never saw bear in town now they're all over making their rounds it's easy pickings for them I think Casey's talking about something else here the size bear but uh man this sucks man this sucks what do you got what do you got on this bro she has a bear fucking address plaque on her fucking wall right there bro you thought it was a hotel no look at it her door's missing and she's got to wear her addresses she has a bear fucking placard you know hey I'll take care of you come be my friend yeah go and kill you go to locks found out she probably grew up in the upper wide middle class suburbs shit man all I'm saying is this here's what really happened this lady was feeding the fucking bear right she thought the bears were her pet like all these other dumbasses out here that do dumb shit and they think they're gonna be the only one that doesn't get fucked with until they do did you ever see that documentary of the guy that live with the bears he went all through Alaska and he like followed the grizzly bears around and he fucking like got to know him and snuggle him and shit no oh you never saw this did I well you know he he was like it was like a mini series and he it was amazing like he made friends with all the bears like in the wild like the bears came up to him and they fucking like snuggle them and shit and it was like holy shit and he started talking about how he's got the secret gift to the bears and all the bears love him and shit and you watch all these you know all this whole show and at the end they play an audio recording of him getting fucking eaten by one of the bears yeah yeah yeah and he's like no no yeah and it's like mother fucker what do you think was gonna happen they're just doing what they do bro that's just bear shit yep black bear stuff man I didn't say that well that's what polar bears are apparently pretty fucking vicious bro show me a headline of a polar breaking into somebody's house well they live out the country bro they keep moving further out that's why I was talking about that polar bear flight you know they ain't got no issues with black bears out there I bet look at the bear's face he's like fuck yeah I hate that bitch what do you think I was gonna do yeah look at him he's smiling he's like chill it bro bears are cute though I could see why people want to like you
