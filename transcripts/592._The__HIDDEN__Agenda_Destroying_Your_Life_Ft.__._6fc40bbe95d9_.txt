What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the real estate about it lies the fitness and delusions of modern society and welcome. Motherfucking reality guys today we have a very special full length episode. I'm going to get right into it and we're just going to get going on it. Yeah. Alright guys so we have a very special guest on the show today for our full length episode. I told you earlier this week we were going to have an awesome full length for you guys later on this week and this is it and we are very excited to have the man behind the films that we've been talking about agenda and agenda to that I've been you know screaming for you guys to watch for the last three years. Mr Curtis Bowers how are you man. Thank you so much. It's great to be here. Yeah it's great to have you. Now before we get into what's going on with the films and you know if you guys haven't seen the films agenda and agenda to you have to go watch them. Alright and my hope is that if you haven't watched him yet after we've talked about him at length on this show multiple times that you will go after you listen to this and watch these shows because they are very very very informative to what's going on. I think they'll be very eye opening to some of the things going on in the world. Where are these currently playing are they still on Amazon. Yes you can rent them on Amazon if you'd like to buy a physical copy it's agenda documentary dot com. Okay cool. So let's start at the beginning man like you've been at this for a long time we were just talking before the show about how frustrating it is to be putting out this information for so long and dedicate such a massive part of your life and then to still see it materializing. What got you to pay attention to this and where did this this first come from. Well I was raised in a family that were there attentive there paying attention they were involved in what's going on. So from a young age I knew how the world really worked and my parents were great at just encouraging us to stand for the truth and you know do what's right. But I think the main thing was in 2008 I was a representative in Idaho in the legislature and I started to notice that even in Idaho where there's a we had a 85% majority. I mean it's a dream that will never happen again in America you'll never have an 85% majority in the house the Senate and the governor and we couldn't get a piece of Republican legislation through there to save your life. And I was like what is going on and I started to dig in more and in one of the things that it reminded me of as I saw the legislation coming through is back in 1992 an older friend of my father who was from St. Louis asked me to go to this meeting that the Communist Party USA was having at the University of California Berkeley and he had studied communism and written books about communism back in the 60s and stuff and he was curious because if you'll remember back in 1989 the Berlin Wall had come down and everyone was saying communism is dead it's over then in 91 in December the Soviet Union dissolved and so this is six months later the summer of 92 and the Communist Party USA is having a meeting so he asked me to go out to this meeting he said would you go out there and just see what they're talking about because we won there's things over and so I went to that and for three days I sat there and break out sessions and lectures and listened to these hardcore communists and one thing shocking about two I thought it'd be college radical since it was at Berkeley so I dressed like a college radical with some radical teacher I walk into the auditorium there's 14 or 1550 60 and seven year olds with briefcases and I thought whoa this is actually serious it's not just some radicals and many of those exact people as I researched them later ended up being an Obama's cabinet in 2008 and that's what motivated me to make the movie because I rise weight these are the people they read this communist meeting with me back back in 1992 but at that meeting they laid out this plan how they wanted to take America down from the inside they were going to focus all their energies on that now they'd been focusing on it for a while but they realized they could never outspend America because capitalism and free enterprise is so successful and they kind of that woke them up okay we got to go to plan B they could they just keep building more and more and of course we had all the years of Reagan where he really built the military up so they realized we're in trouble here and so that's what they talked about the mean how they were going to do that from the inside and I didn't think that much about it went on with my life but then again 16 years later in 2008 from 92 whenever remembered what they had talked about like one thing that is so clear how to change they had said back in 92 we're going to use the environmental movement to date down the free enterprise system in America and in 92 that didn't make sense because that was not a big movement it was literally people you know chaining themselves to trees and Oregon so they can't cut them down I mean it was nothing and so I was like how would you do that but in 2008 an inconvenient truth by our gourd to come out it was the biggest movement in the world and it still is because they realize it's the ultimate vehicle for totalitarian control because it's a global problem so it demands global solutions by a global government that's that's the way they look at it so they that's why that issue will never go away no matter how many facts we have how many charts we can show them hey it's not going up and if it went up a little bit actually would be good warm warmth is the friend of life cold is the enemy of life all the logical things that they don't but from that I wrote a letter when I was a representative on that communist meeting in 1992 and it just blew up into a huge thing and one of the men that responded to that and said what representative power says is true but it's nothing new you know that's not from 1992 it was all written in a book in 1958 and I got to know the man and it was of course the book the naked communist and it had the 45 current communist goals as of the 1950s in America and I got that book for the first time in 2008 so 50 years later and I read through the list of goals and as I did I couldn't believe how specific and how purposeful and how pre-meditated the the the the collapse of our country had been it had been people in groups for 100 years working to take us down from within and I just I couldn't believe as I read through these things one of goal 17 this is from 50s America get control of the schools use them as transmission belts for socialism soften the curriculum well people wonder why do all the kids want socialism today because in the 50s they said we got to put socialist ideas we got to push it so these kids think it's good and think it's wonderful and so because they know all the hardcore communists know you have to transition through socialism before you can go to communism you cannot go from a prosperous free enterprise system to communism because the problem is in the prosperous free enterprise system you and all the people own all the stuff as though they can't as I how do we get this they have the wealth they have the guns they have the property they have a we got to transition into socialism we slowly get control of everything and then it's easy to flip overnight especially if you can disarm them then overnight it's no more mr. nice guy you do what we say or you get a bullet in your head i mean that's that's in that happened over and over again throughout the 20th century so it's not like some new strategy that's what they did to most of the countries that fell to communism and a lot of people don't know this during the 20th century like 65 or 70 countries that fell that's how they fell they did not they tanks didn't roll in and take them over they stirred up their radical stirred up the college professors to strip the young people for freedom for for no you these it's not a just government because it wasn't a perfect government whatever country might have been like cubers on it no it wasn't a perfect government but it was pro-American they had a lot of freedom they were prosperous but the people there stirred it up and said no and so when what happens is the communists do that then they put up their puppet as the guy that's for the people and the people usually vote that person into power and then once they get the levers of control they the iron fist comes out and like Castro did it started slaughtering by the thousands anyone who resisted in Cuba they not they not just slaughter the people that resist they also slaughter the people that are useless which is the people that they allow to to propagate for them absolutely no Stalin in one of the countries that he took over he had everyone in the country lined up and stick their hands out and anyone that had calluses was allowed to live and go start working in their fields and stuff if you didn't have calluses that means you're an intellectual you're a thinker and they executed you all right you're dangerous because you sold out your own country you were pushing these socialist ideas in the universities that allowed us to come to power but if your own country can't trust you we sure can't trust you and they even execute them immediately um no no communist despise weakness they despise pathetic leadership like Biden's like Jimmy Carter in the 70s I'm shocked I think it's just the grace of God that the commis did not take us over in the 70s because they could have taken us yeah um we had such pathetic leadership I know if Brezhnev would have called Jimmy Carter and said 10 of your main cities are going to be gone tomorrow morning if you don't surrender he would have surrendered but they knew the American people wouldn't surrender and that's why it didn't happen yeah because he goes no there's 150 million armed citizens we can't take them we might be able to take this pathetic government but we cannot take the people I think that's still the case 100 percent yeah no that's what in our side doesn't talk about that enough the right to bear arms isn't just a ride or a swing go hunting or target practicing and sure dear with Kevlar best yeah yeah exactly or I need a 30 round clip for deer it's not the 30 round clip is not for deer yeah as our founders told us it's for tyrants when they take too much power you are there to stand up against them in loving your neighbor by by saying no sorry you can't do this and so that's what it's for but our side doesn't talk near enough about the fact that the armed citizenry in America is the single greatest deterrent far beyond our military that we have to stop an enemy country from taking us over and it's not a new idea it's not a new concept like it's an obligation that's been around since 1776 exactly but it's it's written into the constitution as a duty that's that's what it's obligation we like we have to do it that's right and so but we should talk more about that on our side see this is for our country the the survival of our country that's the main thing that stops China or Russia or any of them from attacking as they go no you know they're militaries you know yeah Biden's kind of dismantling it and they're doing all this but the people the the American people and they all know every everyone knows that's into military strategy to take a people off their own property is close to impossible because they will do any they have everything to lose I think they try that though right like especially when it comes to the gun conversation and we've talked about this on the show it's like they're they have to get public opinion on on board with whether whatever it is and how do you sway public opinion to view firearms as negative would you create a manufacturer's situations that are going to pull on the purse strings of emotions of the people right like that's right mass shooting school shooting like I mean you name it and I think the the hang people always get hung up on this point of thinking that these people these communist these tyrants have morals a classroom full of kids means nothing to them nothing no that's the the a village in in you know thousand miles away means absolutely nothing that's right and if the the end result is getting people to believe that hey this is bad or this is wrong or I support this or I stand with this if that is the end result that's the that's the objective they don't care how it how how what happens or what has to happen to get there that's what people get hung up on all the two more greater weight than to stir up the youth because the youth are the ones that can be convinced that they're being uh you know unjustly treated because all youth grows up it has nothing when you're young right so they look at the young person they say look at these guys they all have all this and you have nothing look at you well yeah you're 15 bro like you're not going to have much you know but well you don't real what they don't realize because they don't have the perspectives their their opportunity is being taken away through their own messaging that they are being manipulated into created yeah you know and that's the dangerous thing that's why we do this show man absolutely absolutely so so you write this letter and you're I'm you had to get some pushback I well was the initial I guess response from from everybody after after that letter came out well a lot of people were totally in favor of it um and wrote me and called left messages on my answer machine saying thank you for standing up for something but the left of course which was a small minority at that time in Idaho it's changed a lot recently because of all the Californians moving in but um at that time uh they realize I was dangerous so that's why they organized protests at the capital and things they realized someone that will just speak truth not worrying about what people think about it or whatever that's someone we we need to get rid of very quickly because that's dangerous I just pulled this headline up from from 2008 when you read it when you wrote that letter for January 27 2008 representative Bowers should apologize or resign exactly you know it's like it might like and that's one thing that always perplexed me it's like you know how is it possible how is it possible that in at UC Berkeley at 1500 people with this evil ideology or even allowed you know obviously I get the freedom of speech I get that portion right but it's just like something that completely contradicts the fabric of this country how is that allowed to even breathe yeah well it's just it's because of our freedoms they've taken advantage of that our enemies realize okay we can come in there and use their own laws against them well we're gonna have these meetings and it started so long before that back in the 30s the Communist Party USA was a massive force back in 1932 the head of the Communist Party was a man named William Z Foster and he wrote a book called Toward Soviet America where he outlined in that book he goes if we want America to be like the Soviet Union here's what we need to do and if you read that book today 90 years later it's some they've done every single thing in there they took over the schools and they got into Hollywood so they're involved in the entertainment world and in the media in the culture and they started changing us as the people from within so all of a sudden the socialist idea that it normally just been abhorrent to an American like what are you talking about that ends in death and destruction every time which it does if you've studied history um it all of a sudden didn't sound that bad to a younger generation that didn't know anything about anything purposefully having been dumbed down you know in the educational system yeah yeah so so you write the letter you get the pushback so what what happened like so when did when did I go okay let's make this documentary let's make agenda right yeah how where did that come in at yeah so I started I came across these goals and I started digging and study more and just even remember a lot of what my parents had taught me growing up and I started realize wait a minute the American people need to know we have an enemy from within and they have a very specific agenda they have given us in writing of what they want to do and they are checking all these boxes off and I had study communism in my life because I was raised by parents that understood it and I realized I don't think Americans know where we're heading and I don't think they know what that world looks like when you get there and so I felt man I need to do something to awaken the American people and I didn't know what to do I thought oh should I write a book and I'm not that great a writer and and I'm a Christian that's where I'm coming from and I started to just feel this burden I'm like God you what how do you want me to get this to American people and he just started pressing on my heart you need to make a movie and I was like I don't know how to make a movie and I've never done that before and I but I as a Christian I prayed earnestly for six eight nine months God you want me to do this and I knew clearly yes that that's what he wanted me to do and I and and so I went to this little film academy I saw this three day film academy in texts that was coming up I thought I'll go to that three days of training will be some kind of help for me and when I went there I met a lot of young guys that were into film and they were only 18 19 20 and they knew a lot of stuff so I was okay you don't have to have done this for 20 years because these guys are young and they know how to do it so I got a lot of great advice from them and I came home and and I just told my family we homeschool our kids and do everything together and I said you know our next project we're gonna make a film and it was just a neat process of how all the things came together to make that a reality and to happen and my kids praying about it regularly and different things that happen to I don't know in our Christian faith it just God strengthen that through just him directing our path so clearly and so obviously blessing things I'd have people come and I do an interview with them and they would just say stuff that I was like oh this is incredible and I knew that was just a gift I was like and then putting it together was was a tough road in process because it was again never having done it and I didn't know anybody that did it out in Idaho where we lived it was just blood sweat and tears but it was two years full time working on every day to get it finished and a lot a lot of neat stories through that process of things that happened that were just a blessing but I finally finished it and we entered it in this film festival in Texas we'd heard about and I don't know it's kind of a neat story I just real quickly here but my kids had been fasting and praying every Friday for nine for 22 months that this film would win and I know if someone's not a Christian that sounds crazy or whatever but God is God and he's there I know he's there but it was amazing because we went to this festival the first film we've ever made in our life and it had a hundred one thousand dollar grand prize and it came to the last event of the evening the best of festival and they called out our film agenda grinding America down and as we as we left this stage I told my kids I go I can't wait God did this and my oldest daughter who is the one who would recommend that we pray about this she said daddy I knew the first day we prayed God was going to do this and I said that's why he did it and I gave them the award I said this is yours because you had the faith to believe that but it fits into us today because we need to have the faith that our efforts when we do what's right all your principles on the walls out here when you go the extra man you love your neighbor just because you're supposed to do that you do what is right because it is right it's not to get a benefit from it's to do it because it's what's right I God blesses those things I think whether you're a Christian or not he does because it's pleasing to him when people do things the right way for the right reasons and but yeah the film then started to take off all over the place and we traveled as a family all around and it was a great blessing to to be there to influence and encourage people to start standing up start educating their neighbors start making a difference and stop taking for granted the precious freedoms we have been given here in this country where we don't understand what they cost especially once you lose them the only thing that gets them back when you lose them is blood that's it's the only thing that gets rid of tyranny is shedding of blood and and to have not taken that seriously what was already done in the past for us I we've really tried to encourage people to keep keep standing for the truth it does make a difference absolutely what uh you know I'm sitting here thinking and hearing you describe all of this and it just makes perfect sense you know to use the environmental movement because like right most people are good people most people do care about the environment and you know I think when people hear the truth about the you know environmental movement globally they automatically jump to the conclusion that you don't care about the environment at all and that's not true at all no like we all care about the environment we care we understand that it's important but what's happened here that I think people have to realize is that it's been weaponized to be the Trojan horse for the implementation of communism and it's been very easy to manipulate people around this idea because people care about it and people are good right like who wants to take care of the planet we all do you know who wants to make sure that the planet's in better shape for our next generation and the generation after that most of us do so it's a very easy thing to get people behind and I'm curious what your take has been in terms of you know because this is an emotionally sense and it's made to be it's have it's made to have been this way they have intentionally gotten people so sensitive about the environment that anytime you push on that agenda at all in terms of it being a Trojan horse these people get angry and what's your experience been in terms of because I know a lot of people now are really seeing the corruption and they're seeing what's happening and I've had people you know we talked off the air you said you have people apologize to you that's thought you were crazy right I've had the same thing DJ's had the same thing and I've had a lot of people who were hard core environmentalist people actually realize that this is actually what's being used now what's your experience with that bin have you have you noticed the same or oh absolutely no it's a total scheme one of the first red flags to me was mcale Gorbachev who was the ruthless murdering communist dictator the last one of the Soviet Union when he stepped down from that he moved to San Francisco and started an environmental group green cross international no like whoa no way yeah they all jumped in wait wait Miguel Gorbachev moved to United States yes personally yes and he started a climate green cross international I've always she's non profit to push it right when he stepped down from the Soviet Union but also I flew up to Vancouver British Columbia to interview doctor Patrick Moore and if you don't know that name he's the one that founded Greenpeace so he cares about the environment he was out there stopping the Russians from you know killing the whales and all that stuff he cared about things and I went up there I said doctor Moore why did you leave Greenpeace in the 80s and he said and he's you know just he's up there's not an American thing he said because the communist came in a took it over all their goal was to destroy capitalism worldwide because it was a vehicle to implement communism so this is a guy up there that's not into this communism or Americanism or he was he was generally into the this is like a way else no any care but he I saw he really had he was a real environmentalist and he's still doing things up in Canada but common sense things yeah like teaching Canada to manage their forest right he goes it's the greatest single resource we have we should be thinning the forest and cutting the dead trees and planting new to keep them healthy and strong so he was into real things but so that was another key when I talked to him I go he said no they came right in and they said all we're about is destroying capitalism and so he had to leave his own group green peace because it became so radical but here's here's something everyone has to understand it's so important because again this issue is not going away no matter how many facts no matter if the world starts cooling no matter whatever happens because you cannot step down from a movement called saving the planet to something else you'll lose all your troops because that is set sound so noble here's the three facts about it the foundations of it are this number one the bedrock of the entire modern environmental movement is carbon dioxide is a pollutant which if you didn't go to government schools that is laughable carbon dioxide is plant food it is fertilizer for everything that is green here's some facts you might not know I studied this um right now the level of carbon dioxide in the world in the air is 400 parts per man well that doesn't mean anything unless you realize well what's the optimum level the optimum level of CO2 for everything that is green if you care about what's green is 1600 parts per man we're at one fourth of the optimum level of CO2 in the atmosphere for everything that is green that's why greenhouse growers pump in carbon dioxide into their greenhouse greenhouses to double triple and quadruple it because then the plant growth explodes it doubles plant growth doubles so a tomato inside a tomato plant inside a greenhouse will produce twice the amount of tomatoes as the exact same plant outside the greenhouse if you can quadruple CO2 that's how vital it is an oak tree will grow to full maturity in 25 years instead of 50 years so their underlying premise is a complete lie but this this is key before I go through the other two when you brainwash some of which Marxists are excellent at doing brainwashing is the process of teaching everyone the opposite of the truth like 1984 the book you know black is white white is black freedom of slavery slavery is free you always teach him the opposite because it's hard to pull someone out of that would you or women women or men exactly so if you exactly so if you tell them a little lie that can recover from it but when it's the opposite of the truth so carbon dioxide that's nonsense we don't have near enough carbon dioxide in the world we're at the bottom level if it goes below 150 parts per million everything green dies which means everything dies because we all eat what is green or what eats what is green so that's one thing then the next lies is global warming something to be feared the top real scientists say man has hardly any effect on any of this anyway even CO2 production or anything but if we could warm the world a degree or two it would be the greatest single blessing we could provide because what would happen is there be hundreds of millions more acres in Canada and Russia that you would be able to farm and in the lie that warmth is not the friend of life is crazy if you ever go down to Ecuador I was down there one summer with my sister and you're standing on the equator where's the hottest place on earth and you notice something real quick life loves warmth I mean the biodiversity of plants and animals down there is unbelievable everything is thriving everything is booming and then you go up northern Canada or Alaska and you rise oh my goodness cold is the enemy of life there's only a few species of plants that even can survive a few animals that can survive and so again it's the opposite they tell us to be scared of warming when we should be scared of cooling cooling is deadly because then you don't have a long enough growing season so you can't grow enough food that's horrible warming's wonderful and then the last thing they tell us because I think this thing is satanic at its core I agree it is it's it's evil it's when you allow kids to be starving to Africa and all the things because you're oh no we can't let them to have electricity because it might add some more carbon dioxide so they can't even have refrigeration so they can't have preserved food so every day they got to find something to eat and all the problems that come when you're not modernized but they tell us there's too many people on the planet but here's the reality if you study and talk to demographers who who that's the science of populations and it's a science because you can't have more adults in the future than you have children today so it's an exact science it's not a theory or hypothesis or anything if you talk to them they say we're getting ready to enter a age of depopulation like the world has never seen people have rejected the blessing of children for 50 60 years in all the European countries America now is finally below the 2.1 children per woman you need just to stay stagnant we're 1.8 and so you see yep the only reason the population is still growing a little bit is because of modern medicine you know we've we're able to live longer and so it's preserving life but as soon as this segment this generation of elderly die off there's not the population to replace them it's going to hit about 9 billion where it 8 billion right now and then it's going to start dropping like a rock for hundreds of years if we don't change anything white by having more children and that's devastating to everybody Adam Smith said 200 years ago it goes you cannot have a growing economy with a declining population it's impossible it's impossible it's math mad everything loses its value your home's not worth anything because there's more homes than people so no one can sell a home because there's plenty empty ones that makes sense why they want to depopulate because they understand it destroys the economy invest the goal yeah what's their number one goal because because they know there's too many people to control too they go we got to cut 7 billion people out of this picture because it's just too many people what I think what gives these people the right to think that they can control this like that's the thing that I keep having like like why the who who yeah like what kind of arrogant egotistical piece of shit are these people that legitimately believe that this is why I say this on the show all the time guys these people believe we are cockroach cockroach insect infesting their home they don't see they for some reason when they look in the mirror they see themselves as better than everybody else as gods yes yes and they see us as the you know legitimately the stream of ants that are stealing their crumbs and they're trying to parade on us that's right like 100% yeah it's unbelievable the amount of like like I can't even imagine believing that yeah no I know it's it's it's it's a war perverted view I mean Karl Marcher there's no fixing you need Karl Marx writings yeah he thought like I'm the one that should rule the world I mean I'm the only one smart enough to tell you what to do you don't know what to do yeah I'm gonna tell you what to do just obey that's what they love that's what the mass were all about it doesn't do yeah if you read medical studies instantly you see right when the covid start I read them I have a lung issue and so I read hey I didn't know if this was gonna be a serious thing or not and I read some studies on mask it says it doesn't do anything to stop the spread of a virus I was okay that doesn't do anything but they keep pushing it but they know it doesn't do anything either so then you because they've been a medical school compliance exercise okay this is submission right you and then put on two it's just tight they're about the double maskers yeah no you went from none to one to two it's people were wearing collagen water helmets on their head at the grocery store I know like like let's let's be real about take a moment real quick people were walking around we're standing in bubbles like legitimately blood inflatable bubbles giving relatives hugs bro I know like we we've forgotten how ridiculous this was yeah and and like Curtis is saying this was a compliance exercise this was for them to have a visual representation of who would comply and who wouldn't comply and the problem with this is is that very few of you actually believed it worked but you went along with it anyway because you were afraid of getting yelled at by some asshole to grocery store that's right that's a big problem that's a courage problem well I think I think to that though right like you know they understand the psychology of humans right and so like one of our needs as humans is this sense of belonging I don't want to be the outsider I don't want to like you know all these bodies I have no problem with that yeah for sure but like it's not a common thing right and so I think especially if you get people in a group setting the sense of belonging the need to belong the need to feel a part of whatever this is and not be outcast it dramatically in cool dude and we've seen it over and over and over again DJ it's the thing whatever the thing is I'm on it coven I don't want to be in love with Ukraine vaccine now it's the Middle East it's the thing yeah these are all compliance exercises and brainwashing techniques that yes have real world consequences no one's saying that innocent people are dying in the Middle East right now or in Ukraine or any of these things but the reality is is the way that they they way that they weaponize these movements is a is a what how I see it is they're taking the temperature how much do these people are they willing to comply still where are we at can we do this and then while we're evaluating how compliant the masses are which they are becoming less and less compliant which needs to happen in a much faster rate they're using the opportunity to push us further into the agenda that they have which is global one world global government communism which is it's led by the world economic form okay it comes from all these people who are over there in Davos who make these rules who all think like marks who think that they rule over us and and dude like we as American people have to get smarter and a little bit more courageous to say I'm not playing this game anymore no Curtis see your point too on even on the deep population point right because I think it's a little bit deeper and I would love to know your input on this I think it's deeper than just people are not having kids right I think when when if you keep if you understand and we can say okay well this is their objective right eventually throw off the global you know capitalistic structure right depopulate humans it's not just people not wanting to have kids when you look at how they've infiltrated the food industries the chemicals that they're putting in our foods in our waters that is literally sterilizing people on mass you know testosterone levels of men have declined that you know 50 percent I believe over the last like 30 years or so yeah it's just 2000 yeah since the year 2000 it's the average testosterone in a 30 or 20 something male right now is the same as a 60 year old male in the year 2000 yeah that's only 20 years yeah no it's chemicals it's fragrances that are synthetic it's it's all the same other pumping in because they make a fortune from big pharma on us being sick yep they get total control when they make us dumb it's it's all the different things again the educational system isn't to help raise sharp individualistic courageous young people it's to create it just it's submissive dumb down feminine man that just does what he is told I mean that's that's what it is so that's but it's all purposeful no absolutely purposeful when they work these other social construct movements into it like feminism right yes like now these guys are subservient to their women that they have removed every bit of you know courage protection instinct strength honor commitment from a man and and basically put them in a secondary role in the household to a woman okay based around the idea of feminism and we're I mean let's just be honest let's look at the average man right now go to a grocery store and count how many of these men look like they could actually like do something uh that matter could they could they fix something at home could they stand up for you in an actual violent fight look at it look at them guys because they're oh they're so rare yeah I agree 100 it's it's it's it's I mean it's it's frightening how rare it is yeah they wanted fat dumb and lazy and they got it that's been the goal for a hundred years just slowly that's why the PE programs and our high schools have gone you know back in the 50s they were so rigorous yeah so you know and they've just been dropping them dropping them dropping we can't make them do anything now they go sit on the playground for an hour and that's their PE yeah so they're not getting any exercise then they go and play video games and sit there all day in junk food and so it's just yeah we're it's just unraveling well then you throw on top of the removal of the of the cultural you know excellence part of it right like I grew up in a generation that I think was the very last generation where you were taught that achievement and drive and ambition and winning and competition and being first place was a great thing to achieve that was like that was this the minute I got out of school it started going towards participation trophies and you know moral inferiority if you were ambitious right um it's crazy how they've weeded this out culturally and it's so quickly too yeah dude real quick and people don't even notice it they think it's like you know how many people you walk down the street that like legitimately think that you know ambition is a bad thing and that drive is a bad thing and then being masculine is like some sort of bad thing like it's a shit ton of people dude like a lot yeah they've been brainwashed that toxic masculinity because they knew that's their number one enemy yeah back in the 1930s even the Frank first school one of the groups that my movie talks about they talked about that they say we're never going to be able to get these children away from the parents in the families where the father is leading the home they got we we got to pull him out we got to get him sidetracked on other things sports or whatever and then we got to create enough inflation so the mother has to work whether she wants to or not so we can raise the children they're writing about that in the 1930s and now you have them on the White House podium saying these are our children exactly these are not your children now our children that's right you know you know coming from the White House that's right which is it immediately like three months ago you know one one thing that I always think back to is like every now and then you'll see one of these pictures pop up so this is a picture of like a 17 year old and Vietnam right and like knowing that like that was that was that was the normal here right like just this peak male right like I mean he's 17 year olds got muscle tone and he's out fighting a war you know I'm saying compared to what our 17 year olds look like now they're dressing up as fur babies and and furries and stuff it's like how do we get there like and it could like and to just you know for this conversation it couldn't just be this one way that we got to this place it's all these different facets on all these different fronts that they've been able to use to get us exactly where we are right now and it's not an overnight process right like no they've been planning the stuff for years oh yeah for it's been going on an earnest for right at about a hundred years so that's why but most people have just awakened maybe since COVID many or that's what woke me up yeah so COVID woke a lot of people Obama woke up kind of a first wave of people and he started talking about shared prosperity and stuff and stuff was wrong yeah like I knew something was off right yeah like when Obama came in and he started giving away a socialism I'm like this is not right this is not a merit I just thought I just thought it was a one guy yeah thing you know but then I started like paying attention more and and you know like I paid attention to the cultural standards of specifically around achievement you know how achievements have been villainized and how you know it's weird because they've they've sexualized it too you know it's okay to be number one draft pick but if you want to go out and build a great business you know you're you're a greedy piece of shit right it's okay to be a movie star and make a billion dollars but if you work your ass off for 30 years and you build a billion dollar company you're just a greedy tyrant you see what I'm saying so that it's like it's compartmentalized in these little areas where where it's still okay when it comes to like entertaining the masses right it's still okay to be the best gladiator and kill the most people but if you do that in your real life you're a problem and I started noticing that and then when COVID happened that's when I started like when I'm like well this is total because so many young people I'm 44 when COVID happened I was 41 the so many people have not been alive long enough that are now adults to understand that's not how we react when a pandemic happens and that's what like the red light flip for me right I was like wait a minute we've been through pandemics before this is not what happens this is not what we do we take the elderly in the sick we tell them to stay home and we continue to go out and work and be smart and that was the opposite of what we did right what we did was instead instead of protecting the vulnerable we we made everybody shut down right and I'm like this is this is not this is not what it is this is not what's going on and so that's what woke me up to like okay what's happening and then I started noticing the psychological manipulation around the mask and I started notice and like you know I've been in business for 25 years I'm a pretty perceptive person and I was able to learn pretty fast but it wasn't until I saw your your films that I really put together what was actually happening and that this was all just a part of this way bigger plan yeah way that's hard for people to like to understand you know they think they it sounds crazy like it sounds crazy that there's a group of people that live in our world that think that they they they have the best ideas and they can they they have the right to legitimately ruin people's lives and kill people for their own personal prosperity yeah like that's not a that's not a that's not a thought or a belief that most humans have oh I know and because we don't have it we don't think other people have it but there's yeah and there's a segment of people I hear that are very evil yeah and like DJ said they have no remorse that's right and they take advantage of us because they know we are like that yeah well we don't think like them so they always give them the benefit of the doubt like oh they must have just been ignorant about that they there's no way they could have purposely done something that caused all this well that's why Biden's the perfect guy for this yeah I know it's perfect because everybody looks at him they say look at this guy he's seen how he's too old he's to this he's to that no yeah he's intentional that's intentional that's right no but it's mocking us again they keep why do they have cabinet members that are all idiots I mean you go anywhere would go this is not a very short person and they're you know head of the defense where I think it's literally mocking us they're putting people in power they're just to make us just as de moralization it is it's for us it's for us to look at our own country and say this is not worth fighting for that's right but I think they learned from covid it's the single greatest thing they've ever done to take the most ground in the quickest and shortest amount of time and so Bill Gates last October one year ago right now he had a conference called catastrophic contagion 2025 where he went in detail about the pandemic that's coming in 2025 it's going to make covid look like a joke and it's mainly going to kill young people yeah because that scares people right when little kids start dying that's that's fearful when a 90 year old dies it was already sick with cancer something and what's that tell you after what we just witnessed that tells me that they're going to actually watch that of course they think we they they're thinking is we're going to tell them about this so when it happens we'll go oh yeah they they kind of told us to be coming not thinking like well you can't predict these things this is not a predictable thing the exact virus and exactly what it's going to do in the exact time like they do with what's wrong see I actually think I actually think what they're going to do my particular opinion on this is that they're going to launch that and then what they're going to do is they're going to blank because children are going to die okay if they launch that and then what they're going to do is they're going to blame the children's death on people like us who have been standing up against them rally the public into like getting rid of those people and removing their resistance that's what I think they're playing it's absolutely yeah or they'll even tied into climate changes now yeah the virus wouldn't have spread if we didn't have climate you they turn everything their advantage every single thing even when you think that doesn't make so sense because they know they control most of the information and so when most people are getting most of their information from them they know if we keep propagandizing them we keep giving them the pills that are going to make them believe this or that that scenario then we've got and so no that's where I mean they've been they've been at this a long time and they're very good at it that's why we need to be respectful of of them in the way of take it seriously when they say things like that because they they mean business that's one thing of of all my study of communism I guess one of the main things I took away is these people are satanically dead earnest about their plans nothing is going to stop them type of thing I mean the commitment they have if we had half of that commitment they wouldn't be able to do any they would vaporize over it they would be nothing but they are committed I'm shocked what you're gonna take on this because we we talk about this quite a bit on the show is that you know I think we were approaching it's like every time I feel that the temperature of Americans every time we get close to any sort of accountability holding these sirens to accountability and the people are waking up okay and like okay we're seeing the face of our enemies come out slowly and surely it's like it gets diverted or there's another distraction that comes up there's something else that happens how do we like I mean how do we make sense of that like how do we how do we stop them from scurrying around this accountability because it's coming and what we say is that these tyrants they know what accountability means for them so what are they going to be willing to do to prevent that anything anything there's nothing off the table that's what again once you get that in your mindset you realize we're up against an enemy that will do anything for victory slaughter young people absolutely create another pandemic absolutely create a world war when in hope in hopes that America will get nuked absolutely anything is on the table all they care about is power we want absolute totalitarian power of every human on the planet period even if they're ruling over the ashes exactly right Karl Marx himself said I want to be the great destroyer who walks through the ashes of the earth I mean that's the end of it is satan it will you destroy everything but you're there just to show how powerful you were to do it so you're not creating anything you're destroying everything that's why I know it's satan it's it's an agenda of a destruction instead of building up building a business building a family building a good marriage building good friendships where you're you know holding your friends accountable and encouraging them and what's right all that's a no they they're just breaking it down destroy it poisoning it perverting it changing it and and that's what we've got to live in the opposite way and say no way I think that's important what you just said we have to live in the opposite way that's right a lot of people think that someone's coming to save us or there's going to be a champion politician that wields some sort of magical wand that fixes this entire scenario that's not going to happen no the only way this is going to be fixed is if we do live the way that we're talking about that's right a lot of things that people don't understand about freedom and the main thing being is that you have to claim it he's not granted to you okay so if you don't claim freedom and you don't live a free existence it will cease to exist and this is something that people fail to realize they believe that somehow this is a granted uh right by another man here you go into you're free yes that's not what this is you have to live it and you have to live the standards that what when you think of like a great American citizen or a great human citizen because this is a worldwide problem you have to think of what that looks like and then you have to work to live that and that is in all areas of your life that's the solution here that we have to have now there might be some other parts of it that are less fun uh that you know fun who yeah well yeah i'm just saying they're going to be difficult people are probably going to die okay but the reality is is that if we don't live if we don't start living it that we we have no chance it's over the game's over that's right no and it's it's something that they've tried to brainwash and us into believing those that love America love truth love their families love their communities that one man standing is not going to make a difference which is a total and complete lie in the Soviet Union there was a man named Alexander Solzhenitsin who was a famous writer and he had spent most of his life in the gulags over there and he would slip out his writings and they would get sent to America and be printed in these incredible books about what life was like in the Soviet Union but his last essay he wrote when he was finally leaving the Soviet Union being brought to America our government put enough pressure on to get him released in the late 70s he wrote an essay to all the people that lived in the Soviet Union and it was called live not by lies and in that essay he he encouraged him he said listen we can no longer live by lies we can never be silent in the presence of of a lie we have to start staying up he and he encouraged him in this essay and it's wonderfully written but he said if you're in a meeting and someone states a lie you must stand up and walk out if you're at the theater or at a movie and something that is not true has said you have to stand up and walk out you can your silence in the presence of a lie makes it look like you agree with that and you're going along with that and he goes only until we have the courage to live not by lies where our life is going to be the truth the things I say I believe anyone analyze my life will go that's what he believes I can tell by his actions that's what that man believes and until we're willing to do that it's we're part of the problem when we're sitting there silent when yes someone's squawking about the mask when you say ma'am have you read the medical studies well if you have and here's a copy why I got one my car here it's a total lie and we have to be able to one person at a time educate them by living the truth but being willing to take the time with some of the people that aren't the brightest and the and haven't studied things as much to to educate them and say look at this do you see this here's the truth you're being lied to and I and I don't want you to be lied to and so but but anyway he wrote that essay it started to circulate around the Soviet Union and by the early eighties they were starting to have the first protest ever that they'd had in the Soviet Union because no one had ever had the courage to protest in the communist country before but from that essay people started to say if they kill me they kill me and that's one of the things that helped them go to plan be in the Soviet Union because they started to lose control more of the people because of that essay that motivated them to live the truth just stand for the truth speak the truth but live the truth where you're consistent and everything you say you believe I love that what would you say to someone who is hardcore environmentalists that doesn't believe that this is communism but believes that this is you know what we're saying is it's just an attack on environmentalism yeah like well sure because I know I have a lot of friends man like I have people in my family who have dedicated massive parts of their life to environmentalism right but I wouldn't say that these people are communist no no no like you said earlier it's a cause that we all believe in if you just ask me oh do you care about the environment and nature and clean air and clean water and I go absolutely yeah I love taking heights in the mountains and doing 100% so they know that so they picked the issue everyone cares about but then they customize the the things that were going to be a solution to this problem to be things that help them gain more power and control and all you have to do to see that as you start looking at the things they're putting forward and you start to realize even the windmills and the solar panels in the EV the electric vehicles and things it's not sustainable they're they're they're more polluting than gas powered cars if you look at the mining that has to be done to put up one windmill the amount of pollution created to do that is 10 times the amount of pollution that that windmill will save in its life so you go that's a lie you're just it's a lie and then when you look at you know with the solar panels same thing the amount of mining that's a great idea but I think we're still 10 years out from being able to do that in a way that we're really reaping the harvest of the sun and it will be a great blessing when we can really capture that energy and it's an endless source which is wonderful but the electric vehicles just the mining to make those batteries and the slave labor going into it and the 100 different things you could that's evil and it's a lie and when you realize we don't have enough power in America right now and you want everyone to electric vehicle but they're not allowed to build new power plants you you start to write oh this is a plan everyone's gonna have an EV but only the good boys that do as their toll will get a plug theirs in and charge it and everybody else know you're just gonna stay home but as you study them and you study their agenda I guess that's what helps so someone listening to this that really cares about the environment so do we 100% and I'm from out west that's where I was originally out in Idaho and all our beautiful forests out there in Montana and throughout that area if you go take a hike out there right now you'll see almost all the trees are dead standing and that's not from climate change that's from not managing the forest man is needed to make the creation what it can be and what it should be and proof of that as you look at any Google satellite picture you look where man is where they've dug wells and they have sprinkler systems and they have green yards and flowers and trees and stuff you say oh it's green and you look at the empty lot in town where man is not taking dominion over that and it's weed patch it's dead and there's nothing there it we are a necessary part to make the the national forest the most beautiful forest in the world which they were for a hundred years before the environmental said no man can just stay out and then it'll be perfect it's not perfect when man's left out you go out west right now and you'll see that so if you as you see the things they're doing it's like no these things earn it's a lie it's just smoking mirrors but they know there's so much fear involved you know we're all going to die that we're just going to do as we're told we're not going to thought through yeah is what is your plan to save the planet really going to do that is your claim that CO2 is a plume is that true and if you look at that one you will see instantly any of you just that one thing it's a total lie CO2 is fertilizer for everything that is green and we do not have enough of it if we were really a green movement saying all we care about is what is green which isn't a bad thing to be we would say no we want more carbon dioxide and and and we want to do what we can but also if you study at the scientific level you get in deeper you realize man's influence on this is not even 1% that's the the bottom line that makes the whole thing ridiculous is our trying to cut CO2 doesn't do it cuts even if we could cut it to zero you know net net 50 zero whatever it would be we've cut 1% off it's the oceans and things so it's it's even the the whole thing is a makework project but when you see the people behind it that are not living consistent they're living by lies the algor is of the world do they have a small carbon footprint because they really believe we're on the verge of you know disaster no they have the biggest of anybody on the planet and they you know carry John carry and all these people so it's you see it's a lie yeah and I've followed the communist into the movement so I realized I've fallen that keep you by go oh this is just a Marxist strategy for global control yeah I think that's important is to like look through that through those things through the lens of control because what all can they control if everybody's driving this electric vehicle everything you know okay well you know hey Curtis just set some statements we didn't like well shut that is access to it's there to be able to drive no like it's a lens of control that I think if you look through that lens it's very very easy to understand and you look at let's do them let's just trace okay what's electric car runoff electric okay how's electric produced yeah right now yeah how is how is electric produced by the mass majority of the electric produced on this planet how's it produced okay where does coal come from the ground what does burning coal produce carbon dioxide okay like what do you guys fucking think holy shit bro I'm so like can we just I'm smart as fuck I got just a patch a little quiz no I just passed the quiz I feel pretty good sound of quiz man this is this is called commissancy bro I would say you're very very skilled in commissation I'm glad I'm glad I'm glad we I'm glad you feel smart but this is pretty easy to understand if you just think it through a little bit yeah really yeah yeah yeah so so you know this is the thing that I try to to remind these people is like once these coming because we talked about this well I've talked about this a number of times on the show socialism is a vessel of communism it's socialism isn't even like really a real thing it's sort of this abstract target that rotates around communism that allows them to talk about communist goals and dreams in a very soft way that gets people to buy into them all right so socialism as a actual thing is very very very very rare it only exists for a fraction of a second until you go to full communism and so when we paint this picture about you know how these people believe all of these things and and how they're being manipulated and then we get them to champion the environmental movement right and they don't produce anything they don't work their their contribution to societies and activists I think it's important for those people to understand what happens to them once it crosses into communism because what happens to those people is exactly the analogy that you said about the calluses they say can this person be productive or can they not and if you're 350 pounds with 14 piercings in your face and blue and pink hair and your whole contribution to society is to run around with a sign and screaming people on social media they're going to tell you to face the wall and put a fucking bullet in your head that's what happens that's why they call you guys behind the closed doors they call you guys the useful idiots they say we're going to use these people to usher in our plan and once we're in power we kill them and that that is real well yeah because they're using their sense of belonging to all these yeah but bro all these activists who run around on with the thing you dude you guys are the first to get killed that's right no and that's Lenin's the one that came up with that term useful yeah he goes we're going to use all these people we'll get them we'll come to them and act like we're into whatever they're into but we're going to use their energies to push forward our agenda and and so yeah they're done with them immediately the united nations in 1992 kind of laid out this whole thing too for people if you want to go read agenda 21 by the United Nations on their website you can see what the future is they tell you they want to outlaw the private ownership of vehicles that's in 1992 the United Nations said that in good old George H.W. Bush was the first one to sign on to get all the countries of the world to sign on and so you you see this and you go oh my goodness it's all right there for everyone to see that's why I called the movie agenda too yeah I go this isn't some hidden conspiracy it's in agenda there's agenda 21 right there on the screen and you go read through that I've read that entire thing and you go okay here's what they're telling us to do they don't they want to outlaw single family homes you have to live in multi-family dwellings in the city which we see that happening right now in the 15-minute cities and also we see this being pushed if you pay attention to what's happening like up in New York for example where they're asking people to rent rooms or make available rooms for the migrant crisis that's right right bro you let those migrants in your house they're going to fucking kill you and they're going to rape your kids that's what's going to happen that's right no it's all part of the strategy a patriotic nation you have to dilute down the patriotism by bringing people in that have nothing in common with you they don't even speak the same language and so they don't have the same beliefs they don't have the same history and understanding and so eventually it fractures things so much it can't the the culture the civilization cannot continue on it collapses because there's not enough to hold everybody together yeah and that's what they're doing that's what the open borders is all about anyone in the world knows it's not a good idea to bring an eight million new people when the economy is not even doing well as it is I mean they're just selling yeah who have different beliefs different cultures and have no intention of adopting the policing culture that we have here yes zero well they're here to contribute to the color not why don't they contribute to their own fucking economy yeah they want to contribute in there the reason they're here how how listen how do you think these people are getting here they're being paid to come here by their own governments and being the listen they are dumping out prisons and they are taking their criminal elements and they're offering them money to come to America like these are not the other countries best and brightest these are not people that are coming here to be upstanding members of society is there a few sure and by the way we're not talking about the the immigrants that we've talked about for the last 30 years where basically these are just Mexican families that want a better life in America that that that is different okay that is a totally different thing that's not who's coming across right that isn't exactly yeah and like people here when I'm saying you know because I know a lot of people that have come here from Mexico and I very well who are very good people who work very hard and I appreciate very much these people are not the problem they are also not the people we're talking about so they've also flipped this this narrative around to make people believe that you know that good Mexican family that you know who came here from Mexico to become American to have more freedom in a better life is actually who we're talking about when we say hey they need to be rounded up the cent back where they came from in fact very more American than most American dude they are they are because they're here for the cultural and the the correct reasons that we all believe in yeah and they have so much in common we have so much in common with them their pro family their pro God they want to be free that's the kind of people yes for our first 200 years in America the through the immigration process we got the cream of the crop of the world right it's the people that like know I'll risk everything if I have to I want to be free freedom means that much to me I'm going to sell everything I own and go on this boat and hope I can make a living a life so that's that's what made America that's why we we look around that's incredible well that's why when we break down the financial position based on race and ethnicity white and black Americans are at the fucking bottom okay you know who's at the top Asian Americans Indian Americans and you know why because these people come here and they appreciate the land of opportunity that we all have more than the people who were born here so they capitalize on it and honestly those people are needed we need those great no's are those are the people we need to come in the immigration wonderful thing that's fine where you're really you're finding out who they are and why they're coming and what skills they have will they be able to provide for themselves there was always questions in the past we need to make sure these people can survive without assistance because we're not bringing them here as a handout but since Biden took off as we have had eight million come in they're not coming in for opportunity they're coming in for freebies oh I go to American I give two twenty two hundred dollars a month for indefinitely yeah a little debit card we've got ten we've got hundreds of thousands of homeless American citizens sitting on the street with no help at all none a ton of which are veterans people who have sacrificed huge parts of their life maybe they didn't get killed or lose an arm but you know what people don't talk about enough when it talks up when we talk about veterans is a sacrifice they make where they potentially lose their family a lot of these guys go overseas to fight these bullshit wars and they come back and their wife's got a new husband and their families gone like we don't talk about these sacrifices these are real sacrifices that these men and women make that destroy their lives and and we're over here getting these people twenty two hundred hours a month and a fucking cell phone and they're not even supposed to be here that infuriates me dude that is that infuriates me and should you too all of you listening it should infuriate you yeah no so you're bringing the worst element instead of the best element yeah so where are we at today man like what do you what do you think's going on I mean is this recoverable where we're at I think the on the good news side is because of covid tens of millions of more Americans are awake to what's going on that's good that's great anytime you get more people on your side that's I don't think they plan on that no they didn't realize how it was going to back right and then the shots all the adverse reactions in the deaths and the miscarriages and the cancer rates going up and all the things that have come about from that and it keeps unfolding it's still going on yeah it's getting worse and then in fertility and everything but each one of those people that were lied to and now realize it they're coming over to our side because no one likes being used no one likes being over they lied to you and your son died of a heart attack at seventies athlete like that's not normal and and things like that so so that's the good news I think a lot of people have awakened the sobering news is the the other side has so much power in position and wealth and control of so much of the information that goes out that they're just going for the gold now I really it seems like they realize okay we were getting some resistance building up we got across the finish line before enough of it builds up where they're going to give us a problem so that's why I just think people should be really prepared personally at a mental level at a physical level because I think we could be heading into some hard times we need to be tough we need to think clearly what should I do and and being ready to protect your family of course even just with the things necessary to survive if they do like go another pandemic but that's really deadly or something okay I've got to be home for a month or so to figure out what I'm going to do so I think being prepared is important but also realizing like we've talked about earlier you living the truth is vital you speaking the truth is vital to your friends and family you must wake them up you must show them the reports on the shot and the great videos that are out there on so many different topics exposing the lies they've been told you you've got to educate one person at a time that's the only way this gets done and it's so vital everyone's rolling this because everyone person you wake up is another person off their side and on our side and the reality is they their power for the most part is an illusion it's not real no they don't have the numbers no and and even if they this I love this is by minority yeah I heard a general talking once he said this he said if the entire United States military and all the police in America all the sheriffs all the national guard all were under the control of the government and we're willing to go against the American people which I don't think they are but even if they worry goes that's only enough manpower to lock down six cities in America yeah it's an illusion it's a total illusion that's why when you stand for it's right you get attacked because they're scared of you yeah because like no no if more people do this we can't stop them we can't control them so that's why they make the example that's why what they're doing to Trump oh you like this is crazy it's to intimidate everybody same reason they pulled this bullshit with January six dude of course right January six is intimidating what the whole thing about January six was to scare people like us that's right from going out in public and protesting at all exactly that's all that's about down the protests because they knew it would get out of control yeah just like it did in Romania in 1989 um and Christmas we know how that ended yeah in 19 where the people came out and they were willing to stay even when they're being machine gunned down yeah and all of a sudden the army saw that in the military there and realized these are our own people and they went on the side of the people and went and grabbed chow chow chow and his wife and executed them yeah and they were free yeah on Christmas day of 1989 no they had no weapons they had no anything but they had the courage to stand for the truth and God bless their little efforts and it changed that country so yeah don't ever underestimate just just being a man or a lady and standing up with courage your stand is influencing those around you and as they've crowd multiplies behind you you'll be amazed at the difference it makes right where you are you know there's a story in business you know this this podcast you you probably don't know this but I had a podcast before this okay it was called the MFCO project it was it was the number one entrepreneur personal development podcast in the world all right and I switched the platform in 2019 to talk about current events because I recognized a lot of this stuff was going on and like I said I didn't put it all together but I was and I was I I felt obligated to to use my platform for that I felt like it was the most important thing and but there's this story in business about Dell computer um you guys remember Dell right oh yeah okay at a certain time you you guys were maybe a little bit younger Dell computer was the biggest computer company on the planet they were dominant okay forget about apple apple was like for nerds right apple Dell was it all right and Dell had this customer in his name was Jeff Jarvis and Jeff Jarvis ordered a laptop from Dell and and unbeknownst to Dell Jeff Jarvis was the number one blogger on the planet all right and this guy was a loyal Dell customer he had not ordered a number of products from Dell well he ordered a laptop and it ended up giving him all kinds of problems and when he went to Dell to say hey you know you guys sold me a lemon laptop and I'm paraphrasing the story here because I don't have a fresh off top of my head they basically told him to get lost they said hey it is what it is tough shit right laptop was 1500 bucks for 1500 bucks this guy this guy made it his mission to use his platform to talk about the what Dell had done to him as a customer and because of what he did in response to uh Dell computers you know bad customer service he actually ended up costing them multiples of billions of dollars in sales okay that's one person that they didn't know how connected he was and the reason I tell this story is because you never know who you're converting when you have that one-on-one conversation in business I tell this like hey you never know who that customer is so every single customer that you deal with you have to treat like they're Jeff Jarvis you have to treat them as if they have the power to make you or break you and that's something to always keep in mind and for those of you there's a little business nugget all right but when it comes to what we're talking about here this concept is also super relevant because we never know who we're talking to in reality of of switching them over to you know opening their mind and seeing what's happening and so many people don't want to have those discussions because of the verbal abuse that's been laid out for the last 12 or 15 years through cancel culture uh through the use of bots on the internet you know the masking didn't help you know the mat where people guys be rated for not wanting wear a mask all of these things have intimidated people into even having the conversations necessary that are necessary to have and when you guys think of it and you hear a curve to say one by one you have to understand that's the same way your business is going to be built the same way that because we talked to a lot of entrepreneurs here the same way you're going to build a business which is one customer at a time legitimately over the course of time there's no hyper fast way to capture all these customers this is the mistake most of you make you think there's this way to get 100 500 a thousand customers at a time when in reality it's always one person at a time it's always one person at a time and the same way that Curtis is describing how we're going to fix this problem is parallel to how you'll build your business it's one person at a time and so you need to keep in mind that when you stand up and you share some truth and you you know share my show or you speak on your own or take the information and voice it yourself whatever it is you do makes no difference to me okay when you do that if that changes one person if that changes one single person's opinion then it was worthy of doing because we don't know what the ripple effect will actually be and a lot of you guys get demoralized because you share things and you know sometimes you hear only the negative back but you don't realize that out of all those negative people there's a few of those people with like little cracks happening in their brain and they're like wait a minute this guy you're a Andy's actually making some sense here this is and by the way a lot of you listening this is how you came to us you came to us and you're like holy shit Andy and DJ you're crazy right and now you hurt us make enough sense to where you're like oh my gosh these guys are actually telling the truth okay and so I want to remind you of this and this is a huge point if we are going to shift the culture the way that we needed to shift and wake people up and win their hearts and minds to win this battle which is life or death for us it really is legitimately life or death all right we have to realize that if we speak and we stand and we share information and it gets one single person to change their mind or join the team that's worth doing and that's why it's important to be consistent with your with your truth be consistent with the information you share don't share the show once or speak up once be that way all the time because every single time you do it you're likely to catch at least one or two more people and that's one or two more people that are going to go out there and get one or two more people and there's an exponential ripple effect that happens there and take that lesson for your business too but right now it's appropriate to what we got going on in the world because if we don't fix what's going on in the world you don't have an opportunity to build a business anymore which is why I switched the format of the show you know because I realized like if we don't fix the soil yeah nothing is going to grow that's right yeah of can I tell you a story real quick yeah that point right yeah it's so key it's from my father I love it it's in from my own family my mom and dad lived in St. Louis, Missouri in 19 so that's just so wow like full circle I know now being back here in 1961 he was going to you live you too no I wasn't born yet okay and but they lived here he was going to graduate school and getting a PhD in electoral engineering and he was working full time for McDonald Douglas and my mom was pregnant with my sister and the doctor told her you can't get out of bed the whole pregnancy you're going to lose this child she'd already lost four in a row and they said you're going to lose this one too so she stayed in bed but she used her time wisely and one of the books she happened to read was a book called Masters of Deceit by Jay Edgar Hoover and he had been head and founder of the FBI and he wrote this book in 1958 that said you Americans if you don't wake up these Masters of Deceit the Communist are going to take you over from within well she read that book in 1961 and it shook her up my mom and she told my dad Jim you gotta read this book he's like I have time to read a book because he was born in full time in school full time and finally he goes okay I'll read the book he read it too and this is a young couple in their 20s right here in St. Louis, Missouri back then but they realized okay we got to do something to share this with others so my mom would read all the St. Louis newspapers every day in bed while she was there while my dad was at work and she'd read the letters to the editor and when someone wrote a letter where they got it they understood what was going on she'd call them up because she was we need to connect with them we need them to start a group in their home so she'd call them up and say love your letter you need to start a group in your home of educating people on this Thursday invite everyone you know over my husband's going to come over and give a lecture on communism and so they would do this one night a week even though they were so busy with life well my dad tells me the story said I came on one night is pouring down rain I've been in classes and then at work and right when I walk in the door mom said I got a meeting set up for you tonight he's like I can't do that call them and cancel it change it whatever and she's like you need to go you don't know who might be there so he went and because of the rain I guess only a couple people showed up my dad was faithful and the little things and we all have to be faithful in the little things and he gave a two-hour lecture to these couple people on communism when he was done one of the men came up to my dad and said if half of what you said is true we are in serious trouble and my dad said well that's what I'm doing this even though I'm so busy they became great friends and he started barring everything my dad had read on communism and in a couple months he knew more than my father and he said jim I'm gonna quit my job and write a book about this and my dad said well don't get carried away he goes no I've got no savings to last two years so this man quit his job and my mom helped him to do research and stuff and studied for two years and wrote a book he finished the book January of 1964 but he couldn't get anybody to publish it because he'd never written a book before so he self-published it but now 64 America for those younger of course there's no internet there's no credit cards if you want a copy of his book you literally have to send him cash or check in the mail it's not in a bookstore in America and in 1964 out of his garage in eight months he sold six million copies and when when Ronald Reagan was elected president of the United States in 1980 he said I would never have been elected president of the United States if John Stormer in 1964 had not written the book none dare call it treason the book from the man that came to my dad's meeting that's that's it right there that's the exact point yes that we're talking no I know that's amazing it started the entire that is amazing in America and one of my first one of my parents first groups too was a lady man I'm gonna be selling some self published books I'll make a ride six billion books no that's crazy that's the best thing yeah yeah because they didn't but fillish laughly who hopefully from earth that name she was she died a few years back but she was a legend out of St. Louis of standing up against this evil tyranny for 50 plus years she started Eagle Form a ladies group and things but but that's just a story from my family and I love it that that that of just faithfulness we just be faithful you don't know who you're talking to you don't know what's gonna come of it but I'm telling you when you plant the seeds of truth and you have the example of living that out to go with it and this is a key for I'm like I said for I'm a Christian so it's the key to the Christian life either go what God says true or it's not but if it is true I need to live like that so when I tell people about him they go I can tell he's there because you're different you're totally different than anybody else so so he's got to be that he has to be a reality which he is but but that's that's what this is if people people to believe and what you say is true you have to have convinced them by your life that it is true and you mean business and they can see how you do I can see that yeah that's awesome man what a cool story yeah I love that that's such a great example of the point that was trying to make like that is exactly what I'm talking about you guys have no idea who you're influencing or who's going to wake up or who's going to become the dragon slayer right like that's right that's a huge deal and and you guys because you share something once or twice you think you did your job no do you think those people are going to stop because you share something once or twice these people are coming for you man they're coming for all of us they're coming for everything American they're coming for our way of life they're coming for our future they're coming for your kids future and they plan on taking it they don't plan on losing so when you think about like what's your contributing and what you're saying and what you're doing to stand up you should think about that that's right and if you don't contribute now when it's easy it's sharing the podcast it's sending people some good article it's doing these simple little things it's eventually going to be it's the cost is blood yeah it just it is as you study world history once you have the chains upon you that's the only thing that is ever freed people well we're seeing that more and more man like you know there's a bunch of people um one of the guys from info wars you know and you guys can think what you want about Alex Jones it's rehab whatever the I don't that it's whatever man I think he says some good shit I think he says some off the wall shit but one of the guys off of his show just got sentenced to prison in a federal prison for something he said about January 6th for something he said that is communism no I know that is that should scare the shit out of every single one of you guys yeah it's progressing further every single day I know I know I know there's January 6th they're setting new precedent with that yeah where they're they're like a president oh you told people to go over to the Capitol and so you're part of this thing too we're throwing you in prison the rest of your life but one of the oath keeper the leader of the oath keepers just a month or so ago this was this significant case he was not even at January 6th and he got 18 years in prison yeah he was not there yeah so it's what do you talk about didn't go to that yeah that matter you're just associated with it so when they start arrest you by association we're all in trouble yes and we should all be connected to the the justice system in certain areas of the country is fully weaponized right now depending on what state you live into yeah okay so we have to be aware of this because if it spreads to everywhere that means that any of us will be next and I'm going to tell you this dude if we don't get through this next election and we don't get someone else in there you could say who anyone else that's not part of this deal they're gonna come for me and they're gonna come for people like you Curtis and they're gonna come for all of anybody who's been speaking up and you guys don't have anybody speaking up for you anymore and now all the sudden you're at their will so you can either join in now and start using your voice like you said when it's easy and you may feel like it's not easy right now but it's easy okay so the worst thing that's gonna happen to you is you're gonna get yelled at at your work or yelled at by some of your peers right who don't understand what's going on which gives you an opportunity to explain but if this goes another year or two and you don't join in you're not gonna have anybody to fight for you because everybody is fighting for you will either be in jail or be dead and that is real shit okay do you think it's comfortable for me to come on this show every day knowing that no it's not but I do it because it matters and when I tell you guys join in and fucking join me it's because I know what's going to happen if you don't so when I say share the fucking show that's why I tell you to share the show it's it gets old you know I'm saying like dude I we come in here you're dedicating your life I'm dedicating my life he's dedicating his life you got all these other people and people think that we can carry the whole water up the hill man it's not gonna work no and so unless you guys join in now like and and I mean like join in get engaged get vocal get loud be aggressive with it unless you join in with that now they're not gonna be an opportunity later because do you think you're gonna speak up when there's nobody else speaking up for you and they're coming legitimately to check if you have calluses on your hands or not no you're gonna cower and if you're not part of their group they're gonna kill you and that that's not a alarmist shit that's that's a repeat of historical fact that has happened over and over and over communism has killed more people in the 1900s than every single war ever fought combined in the history of humankind so remember that yeah and they slaughtered those people it's important brutally brutally but in times of peace yeah it wasn't from wars it was the government slaughtering its own people in times of peace none of the statistics from war war one or war two are added and so yeah that's what communism looks like the face of it is death it's the greatest killing machine in the history of the world and it's gaining momentum because the elites and the globalists and the people behind the scenes the bankers the people that control the purse strings of the world they love communism because they'll do the dirty work for those people of getting control of every person in China is the model for the world and they openly talk about that claw swab does at the world economic forum but also the Rockefeller family which is significant but in 1973 David Rockefeller went over to China and that's when Mao was in power and if a lot of you aren't familiar with Mao Zedong he slaughtered between 60 and 80 million of his own people in times of peace so that he's a butcher and he went over there David Rockefeller to visit him and he said this when he came back in a New York Times editorial that you can still read it's on the internet from 1973 he said what ever happened to create what Mao has in China was worth it and it is the model for the world so that's what these people think about that well yeah if you had to kill 60 80 million people that were not going along that's fine but what they got now that's the model for the world and that's when all of the funds from America started dumping into China if you study the history of the Soviet Union it was the bankers of the world that kept giving them hundred million dollars loans in the 20s and the 30s and because they wanted an enemy there it's very key in being able to control people when you have threats around that's why they love the pandemic oh you're scared of this because when you're fearful you're not thinking you're just obeying and they know that yeah so where we go from here just live a better example work to speak out work to stand up yeah just the simple the simple things the consistency of your life even what you all do here Andy with the you know working out taking care of yourself so you have a right frame of mind when you're healthy when you get up early and exercise and you're ready for the day you're just you're more alert you're more you're tougher which you need we need to be we need to be a tough healthy strong people that are very kind to those around us helping pull them up helping encourage them to get involved and to start taking baby steps to changing the direction of their life if they haven't built in the habits of character and encourage and things like that but it's yeah it's just it's it's the little things they want us to think it has to be a top-down solution and they want us to think that so we won't do anything but I'm telling you this it's never a top-down solution it always is from the bottom up everything I've as I've read so much history in my life it's always the movement start from the bottom up even what's happened to our country my meant movies what they're about they're about how a small group of people back in the 20s said we're going to take this thing down and they slowly start to influence in one person at a time and start to get into positions of power and set hiring from within and fall you know hiring like-minded people and fellow travelers and things and all of a sudden we wake up a hundred years ago man they've almost taken over this thing yeah but it was the grassroots that did that well it sounds like you're talking about the concept of personal excellence to me yes I like to say personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion that's what I think I think that's the fact I think you just described it that's right um you know one thing that you were just saying that I think is important to touch on before we wrap up is you know one thing that those people didn't have that we have is the internet that's right okay so while it took them a hundred years one by one by one it doesn't have to take us a hundred years it could take us literally one year because of the connectivity of the world if you guys all chose to speak up they cannot censor every single person on the internet off the internet be too obvious they can't do it they won't have anything they won't have any money they won't have any revenue they won't have anything they won't have anything and by the way these far left progressive weirdos that are the useful idiots of this they don't have the economic buying power to support these businesses and these sites anyway so when we look at like who has the actual control we have the control we just don't realize we have the control we have the ability to choose where we spend our money we have the ability to choose how we live our lives we have the ability to choose what we say and how we stand for things and we have this amazing technology called the internet that they have convinced a lot of you guys why don't want to speak up because they shadow ban me fuck bro I live my life shadow ban and I still reach millions of people I am the shadow yeah I know just do the point is is if you all join in and y'all started rowing the boat along with the other people rowing the boat this would turn around very quickly this wouldn't take a hundred years it could be done very very quickly you could change your entire life in 90 days man what if every single person listening this show right now said dude for the next 90 days and beyond I'm going to be a changed human being I am going to live the values of personal excellence I am going to get fit I'm going to consume the right information I'm going to limit my time on social media I'm going to be a good friend I'm going to be a good neighbor I'm going to be a good husband I'm going to be a good father I'm going to be a good mother I'm going to be a good neighbor I'm going to be a good you know facilitator of goodwill through my community and I'm going to live the example so that my neighbors and my community and my friends and my peers can witness this and understand what it looks like oh and by the way you'll be a lot happier you'll be a lot more financially successful and you will feel better about yourself in general so not only do we win in society but you win in life by doing that and that's the solution that we have and we can do it very fast but it's going to take action on your individual part nobody can do this for you I can't do it for you Curtis can't do it for you nobody out here that you Trump can't do it for you nobody can do this it's only you and it's done at an individual level and so when you ask yourself what is the solution how are we going to change us get your ass off the couch and go look in the mirror because that's the solution you have to start to work on that when people see that change they change when they change other people's change when other people change we have a big movement that's called a movement and then they have no power they only have power by keeping us silent by keeping us sick by keeping us entertained by keeping our attention on other things by keeping us struggling financially so that we can't pay attention to what's going on these are their tools of manipulation and we fall for them over and over and over again so when you wonder who's coming to fix this get up and look in the mirror because the only person that can fix this is you yeah anyway get off my soap box for a minute listen I really appreciate you making time for us man I know you're busy you're traveling around doing a lot of good work I just want to say thank you for all the work that you do I would have not tied all this together had it not been for watching these films if you guys haven't watched agenda and agenda to these are absolute must watch films they will tie it all together for you better than we could ever do on this show they're perfectly produced they go from a to z of what's going on and and it allows you to see and I especially encourage those of you who listen to the show who maybe do lean a little bit left who maybe do you know tend to be more of you know what I call granola of crowd right like the hippie-ish crowd right bro I'm cool with you guys too right I'm just saying you know who I'm talking about like you guys who who are of the environmental protection mindset realize that that is okay but also realize where the limits are and what you're being a part of when you blindly support a lot of these things going on all right go watch the films that's all I ask I think they're each what a couple hours you have 90 minutes yeah I mean for for 180 minutes of of time you're going to get a very great perspective on what's actually going on and it will allow you to navigate your life at a much better pace so I just appreciate everything you're doing and I appreciate you making time for this and and what you're doing is a big deal it's historically relevant and if I ever become president I'll give you a metal for it all right I'm just

you so just a clever agenda documentary dot com yeah gender documentary dot com you can buy the movies there if you like physical copies and I encourage people to get physical copies if every good
