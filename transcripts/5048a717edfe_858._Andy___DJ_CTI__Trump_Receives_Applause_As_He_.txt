We're gonna we're gonna touch on A brother stuff because I thought this was really really cool. So Trump He went to the NCAA Wrestling championships the wrestling wrestling. Yeah, wrestle It was it was a wild warm welcome. I mean I saw that you've been to stadiums I mean you've you've spoken in front of thousands of people and it's like I was getting like that fucking vibe the USA chance The fucking I mean it was fucking awesome. Yeah, let's check this clip out I mean bro, that's crazy Bro, they were mid interview with one of the guys. There's an angle of this where they're mid interview like with one of the Athletes and bro the stadium just erupts and it like stops the interview Fuck look man. It's cool. It's cool to see now. I mean super cool But do you like cool it in the lockout though? I like that he went over and shook that dude's hand. Yeah You know what I'm saying if you notice that was the only guy that stuck his hand out shake his hand and he went over and shook his hand That's pretty cool. Yeah, I mean, well, I think I mean I don't know that could be just a little bit of like you know Some people know in the history of like you know the assassination of Tim's and shit like that. They're probably not as like Quick to try to you know be as aggressive. I guess crowds can be aggressive. Oh, yeah, so I think they would maybe just Reservin themselves. I don't know. Yes, so they didn't get shot. Yeah, yeah, like I mean They're nervous. Oh no, I didn't say that's a bad thing I'm just saying he identified the guy who had his hand out went over and shook his hand. Yeah, not as cool That's real. I mean got this going everybody else too busy filming. Yeah I mean, that's the society though. I know like people miss out on so much of what's actually happening Because a whole another fucking topic bro. It's sad like listen dude You ain't gonna replay the video the fucking fireworks, okay? Like They you don't yes Let's fucking stop. Oh, hey, baby. Let's sit there and watch the fireworks that we recorded missed out on yeah, right That's so true. That's not true. No, but I mean so this was NCAA championships you rastled in high school I was never a big wrestler But what was even cooler is you got the guy who took the the championship the NCAA title His name's Wyatt Hendrickston Good old American name right this is a good American boy right here this guy this at the 285 of it How many hails of bales of hate is this guy fucking toss bro? All of them bro look at his neck kind of good god. I know that's a that's a fucking grown man bro That's a grown man Fuck man my god Lee looks like he eats some corn He's ready to eat some right there bro He was something that corn protein pro It's a fucking he's a fucking specimen. Yeah, all right, but so he so he has a certain I mean he has his round he wins the NCAA title and this is what he did as soon as he walked off the mat check this club out Captain America Salute Donald Trump My captain American rock. I can't believe it my John's on the floor. Yeah, I like it That's so cool dude That's the last match that's the last match that's what I should look like that's a main event looks like Wow, what the president said he's very proud of me Like man, I'm very very proud of that He came to support his troops. I put on the show for him. I wanted that national title That's fucking that's cool man fucking right. It's fucking cool. I love it. I could imagine like You know mad bro. I couldn't imagine wrestling a dude like the quality of wrestler you have to be at that level at that level to win at the 285 weight class which is big mother fuckers and strong and fast. Yeah, those dudes That's a different breed of a man right there Fuck why do dudes massive bro. Yeah, good god Well, I love the trumped goes out and does this stuff Yeah, well, I mean because it's constantly reminding and showing people the real dude temperature listen he's showing people What it actually means and look we can disagree with some of the things he says or does or maybe He does the wrong thing or maybe he You know doesn't do things fast enough or the way we all want him sometimes. That's fine But there's no way you could question this dudes Heart for America. I mean, yeah, it's just awesome dude. Look at the secret service days and though He's eyeballing that guy's ready to go Yeah, what mean bro? That's where you gotta be. What would you do it like I mean brother? That dude could fucking like pick him up and throw him Yeah, yeah, you know, I'm saying like I mean it'd be the last thing he did Yeah, but look man He's on our side. Yeah look Byner Obama wouldn't go to a wrestling match. They couldn't do it. They do listen Those people fucking hate people like this. They could hate the hate the average American person. Yeah, you know, and you saw it But he can't really saw last last week what Chuck Schumer said that's exactly what they think of you. Yeah, all of those people Yeah, that's real man. So I you know, I think it's healthy to criticize people for In positions of leadership sometimes and when they're right they're right when they're wrong they're wrong But I think he does this part of it very right perfectly. Yeah, I would agree with you on that it makes me it it It makes me feel Good about America seeing that that makes sense 100% dude 100% and And again, it's not that they didn't do this like they being by that's not that they didn't like try to do the shit like they They just got booed everywhere. They went. Yeah, so it's like it's whatever I just thought that was cool though that in there, but Something else happened. So you know It's like a I guess it's it's a it's a thing that most states do their state capitals will do once a new president comes in they put Portraits in their capital buildings. Yeah Trump's not happy with his his newest one they got probably Trump slams 2019 portrait of himself in Colorado capital as quote purposefully Distorted ones radical governor to pull it So yeah, so Trump's going off on this portrait. Okay He said in the statement. I got the picture here. He said in the statement just quote Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves But the one in Colorado and the state capital put up by the governor along with all the other presidents was purposefully Distorted to a level that even I perhaps have ever seen have never seen before Trump rage. So here's the painting I Mean dude come on That's pretty bad. It is and I can totally understand and get like you know you don't want yourself to look bad Well, I would have to see some of the other ones this person painted to know if it was intentional or not I mean the other ones look fine. Yeah, I haven't seen him though I'm just saying that does look a little bit purposefully exaggerated And it you know they're making them look fat You know I mean Trump's a big dude. Yeah, he's a big dude, but he ain't fucking he don't look like he has a watermelon head. No No, but uh, but I mean, so that's up, you know, they're worried on the street. I don't Hunter Biden probably could have did better than that. I mean as a painter in my opinion. I mean, that's a nice bird, you know, but uh Yeah, I don't know, but um We'll see if they decide to pull it down the governor out there. It's kind of weird. I mean, it's Colorado very very Weird and bizarre You know, it's weird about Colorado to dude is like like people are in their it's like There's such in their own world That like they don't it seems like they don't connect with What's going on in that party, but they just still vote that way anyway because I think it's like for the environment or something Yeah, because like dude when when when I've been out there. I mean, yeah, there's some there's some What I would call like granola people, you know, that are gonna vote that way No matter what yeah, right but most of people are just cool dude. I mean they're I don't know they represent the values that that I represent and when we get to talk to them. Yeah It's confusing to me how liberal that state votes for how regular a lot of the people are and how much outdoor stuff they have and hard work shit Ranches farm. Yeah, and it is it is we reminds me a little bit of like how like California is where it's just like people do it because that's the thing that everybody does That's yeah dude. That's what it feels like It's not like obviously it's not California. I prefer Colorado much more, but Oh, no, I get that live it's weird. Yeah, but let's talk about some other Trump moves that came out Since the time of the recording. This is a big one Trump evoked security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and others So so Trump just announced That he has revoked the security clearances and access to classified information from people Such as former president Joe Biden former vice president Kamala Harris former secretary of state Hillary Clinton I'm as well as several others. I mean this is the list that they got put out was a Small letter that was released Um, he says quote I have determined That it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals To have to access classified information Anthony Blinken Jacob Sullivan Lisa Monaco Mark Zade Norman Eisen Latisha James Alvin Bragg Andrew Westman Hillary Clinton Elizabeth Cheney Kamala Harris Adam Kinzinger if you want to heal Alexander Alexander Vindman Joseph R. Biden Jr. and any other member of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s family Therefore I hereby direct every executive department and agency head To take all additional action as necessary and consistent with the Exxtern Law to revoke any active security Clients as held by the aforementioned individuals And to immediately rescind their access to classified information also Direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities From these individuals What the fuck does that mean? Doesn't sound like it's good for them I mean, I don't I don't think this is actually ever happened Right like well, I mean why would those people and I'm asking genuinely why would those people require that Well, I know what I tell us why they require it what and I mean like and then when I say like I don't think this has ever happened Speaking of like a former president getting a security clearance revoked right? It's typically You know the way they tell us the reason is for is like oh, you know, you're the new incoming new president first time first term Whatever the case is you might need some mentorship from a guy who was also in your shoes, right? Like it's hard to get you know, I guess advice from somebody that's never been in that position So they give those former presidents they keep their clearances in case you have to call them They get the updates they get all the intel briefings they get all of that shit Just so you know if you do decide to reach out like hey, what would you I don't think that's a good idea on your current circumstances I agree I think It's very I think the only thing that could happen from giving them security clearance Clearances is for them to understand what's going on for them to plot how they can fuck it up 100% Which is why I think you that's why it took it could be could also be that they're planning charges for these people Yeah, which I hope I do. I mean that would be a first step. I mean you can't prepare for what's coming if you don't know what's coming Yeah, you know what I'm saying like I mean those it's a very interesting move Um, and like it's unprecedented like I don't I don't I can't personally recall Any other president taking away security clearances from a former president. Yeah, I don't think I mean Maybe I just haven't been paying attention, but I haven't I don't remember that either No, what's what else is weird too is the fact that he specifically mentioned Biden's family members Had and like I can't think of a reason why any of like I know Jill Biden may have had one Right, but like I can't even think of a reason why any of them would have one I mean, that's just that's your family members. So it's like to me for some to say that That means that some of them had to have it why would you say it? You know, I'm saying like I yeah, I don't know dude. I I don't know I may or they are these people have they made any statements about that. I haven't seen anything I haven't seen anything it makes me think that they know what's coming and they're keeping them well shut because they're afraid of like What is potentially coming happen? Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of these people are super nervous right now And I think they should be well, I did also see last week that I think Trump also pulled see your service protection from her contract Yeah, and then his response was to go on the internet and view or to make a Real of him like standing alone wherever the fuck he was. It's like bro. Who do you think you are? Yeah, right? You know, first of all, why would you go to I mean listen? There's a lot of issues going on right now in South Africa Specifically specifically targeting white people, right? Like it's a fucking. I mean, it's bad You know, yeah, so it's like you go to the most you know dangerous person for your ethnicity and it's like But why yeah, I don't I don't you know what I don't give two fucks about 100 Biden I agree and I kind of hope that fucking this benefits him poorly. I'll say that in a very nice way 100% man These people have consistently fucked up our entire country bro. I am no empathy or remorse for anything that happens to them At all They don't have it for us. They have zero. Yeah zero for us Um now another news going on guys finishing up this first set of headlines You know, we had the JFK files and this the last thing we covered on CTI on last episode JFK files. What's a big one? Trump weighed in on it. Did he yeah, you weighed in Trump weighs in on JFK death theories during extensive interview after declassifying slew I'm a assassination files. Yeah, I mean look dude real talk before we get into it. I haven't I still haven't You know, we talked about it last week, but I figured by now there'd be some very stable frameworks of what actually happened and still I haven't I Haven't seen anything that Dead Holloway made a good point that I hadn't that I hadn't considered and the country of Israel was the only thing that was redacted The name Israel was the only thing redacted and he was making the argument that the CIA He thinks the sea according to his video and I think dance one of the smartest guys I know when it comes to this he's very intelligent. Yeah he Said that it's undeniably In his opinion that the CIA killed JFK and that they redacted Israel to make people think That it's Israel when it actually was a CIA Hmm So I mean if you think about it like that, it's a different way to think about it Like what would you automatically think if Israel was redacted? I mean only country redacted. Yeah, what would you think? Well, I had to be done had to be right And if you were the CIA wouldn't it be good to Deflect blame into other places cover your tracks. Yeah, I mean do so I thought that was a very fair and well thought out point that I hadn't hurt anybody else say So I don't I still haven't been able to frame it together in my view Interest to what Trump said because I didn't see this yeah, I mean, I mean it was very simple You know, I guess you know one of the questions that was asked the the ax Trump was that if he believed Uh if Lee Harvey Oswald was working alone and so um Trump responded saying quote I do and I've always felt that but of course was he helped Trump answered when asked if he believed Oswald was responsible Um Oswald denied the claim that there was an assassin numerous times famously stating that he was just a patsy Surely before he was famously shot and killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruhrie during a prison Prison transfer at the Dallas police station But yeah, I mean still jump I mean Trump knows he was help, but I think they're also in that interview You know, he asked you know about the actual release and he's like yeah, I don't think it showed much so I mean Well, I think it does if you if you're gonna read the 80,000 pages and conceptually put it all together You know, I think there's a lot of things that don't add up, you know Where the rifle come from right Why was that Sporting good store that the rifle came from also owned by a known Arms dealer that the CIA used To ship arms everywhere right um You know Ruby and and Uh Oswald knew each other Right this there's just a lot of things you know and and real talk look my opinion If Trump why would Trump come out and say yeah So-and-so did it or this guy did it it just puts him more at risk so by him saying I do and I've always felt that you know that's And then him suggesting you know was he helped like If you pay attention to how Trump kind of communicates That's sort of how he does it when things first come to the surface and then it gets more certain and more certain and more certain Into a very certain statement of delivery once time has passed so in my opinion the way he answers things when he says questions like Was he helped like? I think he knows he was helped But he doesn't want to say so until the the people kind of figure it out then he can say it yeah, and You know, it's less dangerous for sure more palatable too. Well, I mean dude you're dealing with two different agencies potentially three Um who have been you know known To kill people when they don't Road the boat the same way they want to row it 100% and you know I was gonna say this you know You know what this reminds me of the JFK assassination reminds me a lot of the Butler Pennsylvania assassination attempt on Trump right two young guys Neither one of them were great shooters, right? This is from all his records all of Lee Harvey Oswald's record He was not a good marksman, right The very the very eerily similar in a lot of ways and I think you know the cuz that's the other piece like Where's the investigation on that where's the information on on that right? Yeah, and why why out of all the rallies that Trump did Why was that the only one that was televised on CNN? That should tell you just about everything you need to know There's some collusion there. Yeah, I mean it makes sense to me. I don't know But I mean another investigation. We've always you know, we've you know, I believe at least on this show We've always been trying to push for more transparency on Is I would like to know who who made the decision to broadcast that one to foresee we'll find out If we could find out who made the decision for CNN to be there at that rally We're gonna know who knew what the fuck was going on And then we need to figure out who that person's been talking to and you can do that by subpoenaing cell phone records on probable cause And if CNN skips 100 rallies and only goes to one To me that seems like enough cause to at least look at who made the decision and who have they been talking to That's a great point. Yeah, I think it's a very simple question that should have a very simple answer right But another investigation, you know that we also have been waiting on for a long time. It's you know here Here we are almost what two months in for sure Where's the Epstein files? Still don't have those and attorney general Pam Bondy provides major update on Epstein files promises only minimal Redactions to protect victims. Let's check this clip up Hey, AJ Oh, we're gonna hear more about the generous sixth commission and what about the Epstein files a lot of conversation about the Epstein files And I recognize that when you're dealing with children It takes much more time. You've got to ensure that what you're sending out publicly is not revealing any personal information But can you give us a sense of those two items and whether or not we'll learn more about them Sure, you're gonna hear all of San January 6th you're gonna hear a lot more about about the January 6th commission in a very good way And as to Epstein yes, you're absolutely right Maria, you know tens of thousands of pages of documents and hundreds and hundreds of victims Um of Jeffrey Epstein So the FBI they have been working round the clock at my directive at cash betel's directive now day in bonginos there Who is a great asset asset for all of us at the FBI as well But yeah, we have to protect their identity their personal information to make sure they're safe But other than that we are we are releasing all of these documents as soon as we can get them redacted To protect the victims of him of all of these horrific crimes You buy it No I don't either Yeah, I don't either First of all They said that about the JFK files and look what they gave us they gave us 80,000 pages that don't even fit together chronological order It's just random shit that you know, they're bummed truth Marist transparency. Yeah sort of right like Hey, here's a puzzle. I promise you a puzzle right and it's 5,000 pieces and I could just give you the puzzle But instead I'm just gonna mix it all up together and fucking throw it at your face and I'm gonna throw it all over the room Yeah, right. That's what they did. I know. That's what they did Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that because You were on the on the page of total transparency If you were on the Page with the intent of total transparency you would have you would walk out To a podium and you would say this is what was found And you would have cash Patel or somebody of that nature Tie together for people. Yeah, and you know, otherwise you can't really say they're being transparent Well, let me let me get let me play devil's advocate here, right? Because I mean, I feel like this is this is the challenge And I look at this like yes, it was 80,000 fucking pages. They they did just dump them There is no like systemic strategic outline bullet points like there's nothing there, right I look at it like this dude. I mean They know that they were being it was a rush job a rush job is how I look at it right like they were being pressured They knew that you know, they're losing public trust and losing that that you know relationship with the people that they promise they would give Get it fucking out there. I don't care how it goes. Just get it to fuck out there. I mean look dude You know, I'm saying like listen, listen, listen, we we don't know. Yeah, okay. They could very well be Fabricating documents right now a whole different narrative because I personally think That the reason that this hasn't been exposed has nothing to do with protecting the victims at all It has to do with protecting their ability to leverage Every single center of influence on the earth to do their bidding Hollywood music industry You know very powerful business people across many different countries especially western countries uh I think they're afraid of losing their their their power mechanism. Yeah, and I think that when they sit down and they say look we're gonna give them all the The Epstein it sounds good until they realize well fuck do we're gonna lose control over this person that person this person that person and now we're not gonna be able to push our agenda or get these people to do and by the way We run the risk of all those people singing like a bird now. So like mid the minute they the minute they throw it out there dude You you're probably gonna have all kinds of different celebrities and all kinds of people come out and be like dude They did this to me or they did that to me or they did and we have a lot of celebrities who have come on said these things But they're always disparaged and shouted down and made through the propaganda machine to look insane And so you know, dude, I think there's a lot going on here that Does not feel right to me, you know, I believe and I'm a big believer that The government has no right especially when we're paying them To withhold information from us unless it is legitimately Based around a wartime operation, right a strategy, right? Yeah, we shouldn't know What's going on in real time in theaters? Yeah, right? We shouldn't know that like because that could be leaked and it could cause the lives of but You know anything else it should not be classified bro. We we pay them Okay, there are Employees servants that's right their public servants and there is no place in the Constitution That grants them the ability to withhold the truth from the American people because they want to And so I don't see I don't see people gaining trust in the government again Until there's legitimately full disclosure outside of the operations of current ongoing military situations and they might be saying that right now because they might be saying Well, we can't let leak this Epstein stuff out because we got so and so on the other team on the hook And if we get him off the hook He's gonna not do what we need him to do right and so I think there has to be that going on something I think I think maybe to like it maybe they're just trying to figure out You know, maybe they came to a realization of like what it really is it is of this operation this blackmail operation And maybe they're trying to figure out how they can use it for their benefit You know, I mean, they're a lot of listen option. They you don't think Trump knew what the fuck it was and when he was first First term. Yeah, no for sure. They all these guys know what the fuck's going on. They all know They all know they all know they're all part of it And the reason they don't want to say anything is because if they come out and say yeah, this is what's going on Well then people are gonna say well how come you didn't say anything 10 years ago or 15 years ago So it makes everybody on their team look bad By not coming out and telling us the truth and I think they're struggling with that as well. Yeah I mean, it's interesting man We definitely got to keep some some some tabs on this situation and what happens hopefully we get something soon I don't know I mean as you're opinion changed you do you think of everyone to be released? I Don't know. Yeah, I mean, I don't know it would I would have to I would have to see what they release To believe If it's bullshit or not. Yeah, you know, and I don't Okay, let me ask you this think I ask you a different way. What do they gain by relate by releasing it? I would say all they gain is just the public trust public trust right and so they're they're They're okay. I agree with you. Mm-hmm. So that's the only thing they can gain Or they cannot release it and just say you got trusted anyway So either way we don't have a choice but to trust them. Mm-hmm. You see what I'm saying right because they have the fucking they have the force so They could be sitting there saying What are they gonna do? Yeah Yeah, because they don't gain anything real by doing it. I mean they do but it's such a long-term game I don't think these people Understand no so Well, we shall see man. Yeah, we shall see Um speaking of public trust think they went a little too far in another area Oh, yeah, trust Trump administration accidentally texted me its war plans Oh boy, so this just came out Literally right before you said out I had to fucking let but not know I had to add some some some things in um Yeah, Trump's national security advisor added a journalist to text chat on highly sensitive Yemen strike plans Well, at least there's some transparency So apparently this is in a WhatsApp. So I mean it's secured encrypted. Oh whatever you guys want to say yeah Sure it is as there's such a thing but they're laying out fucking plans the fucking destroy you may download signal It's totally encrypted. Oh by the way we made it Um, yeah, and so they started this fucking group chat and uh At first, you know the guy who wrote this article Jeffrey Goldblow goldberg That's who was invited to the group chat and he thought it was bullshit at first um He says you guys national security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen I didn't think it could be real then the bombs started falling And it turned out it was absolutely real bruh. I mean here's the screenshots. He posted all of this um We got a dod secretary phexeth he says vp. I fully share your loading of european freeloading. It's pathetic But Mike is correct. We are the only ones on the planet on our side of the ledger who can do this nobody else Even close question is timing. I feel like now is a good time as any given Potus is a directive to reopen shipping lines I think we should go but potus still remains uh, we're still retains 24 hours of decision space Um, and then as I heard it the president was clear green light But we soon make clear to egypt and europe what we expect in return We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement ege If europe doesn't remove what is that remove what is that shit Remunerate What the fuck does that mean remunerate i Think reciprocate now. Why can't you just fucking say that follow the rules. Yeah, just say that Jesus Then what the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain Who's that sm? SM. I think that's Stephen Miller. Okay. I believe it's who that is But yeah, they they they named the chat who TPC small group. But yeah, everybody's clapping good start american flags fire moji's like bro They're just like us No, we just bomb this Dude, this is awesome. This is like yeah How should we do this? My talks I agree in the fire like That's fucking hilarious Yeah, bro that shows you that these people are just like you guys that should show you like these people We're not superheroes man. They're not above you. They're not different than you. They're just like you You know what i mean? Yeah Well, I also like to believe you know and again, like i mean regular dudes, but i mean these guys are fucking smart Oh, yeah, so i personally i have a hard time believing that that wasn't intentional. I mean it could be you know I'm saying why wouldn't it be Like what i'm just saying why would it be intentional? Why what what would they gain by him telling that journalist that For me one this You have an insight that these are regular fucking dudes. I kind of like that. Yeah, you know, I kind of like that Like that's a very strategic way to let people know like fight that one that that goal bird dude in the fucking group chat Yeah, let's fuck with them Like i would do that. Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, I would do that. Wow. We would definitely do that So i don't know man. I don't know We would do it and make it up though and then see if he leaked it You know what i'm saying? That'd be a good way to catch him on the fuckers. That'd be great. Yeah, great. Yeah, trump just walked around the white house naked Bro A play a play bro i got real intel about some weird ass shit regarding that about trump. No about Biden.

Let us ask no Um, this next one at no mad strategic When people ask my political opinions. I just google a picture of Andy That's you know, you think Google correct political opinions. Yeah, right I bet I bet this you with the tinfoil hat on probably that's rolling around. It's why nobody takes me serious What's my thoughts idea though Yeah, all right now I couldn't let this go without giving you a little bit a little bit of a little bit of hate, okay I like it I had someone tell me today and In my DMs I posted something about being a legend, you know 99% of people have to eventually admit to themselves that they could have been a legend and then They're gonna have to uh, you know deal with that and you shouldn't be one of those and I got a pretty spicy email from someone saying that they were offended um You were I respond a back. I don't care You You must have been 99% If something I say rubs you the wrong way you might want to ask yourself why Me the wrong way. Right me just the right way Bro, I don't understand why people think that like I give a fuck. Yeah, well There's so I mean people are entitled to their opinion for sure and that's fine disagree with me I'm not gonna like I'm care you that you're that's America bro That's your opinion 100% yeah, yeah, I mean I don't know if this classifies as hate is really it might be wrong Yeah, who their opinion yeah their opinions always wrong. Well, that's from saying I'm saying might to be nice Anyway, let's see what they got. Oh, we got a rez 84 This show becomes more anti-Israel by the minute well I'm not I'm not anti anything. I'm just reporting what I see You know if that makes you if the things I say make you think that you know you should be against Israel and You know, I'm just reporting what I observe bro. It's a it's not anti anybody. I'm American first like I don't That's it. I don't care about fucking Israel. I don't care about Ukraine. I don't care about those things until we are good That should be a very simple concept for people to understand Like it's not about what I I you know Anti-I'm anti all those motherfuckers. So let's be clear. I hate everybody to fucking say Yeah, I hate everyone equally. Yeah, you can't be all the names if you fucking are equal in your hatred That's what I'm saying right and so I love America. I love the people here the real Americans not the ones that shouldn't be here I'm worried about them and I think that's the way that we should be thinking about things until Things get better here I don't really know how I don't really know how that's so hard to understand or A position that you could actually argue with as an American citizen. I mean drive through our cities Look at our infrastructure Then look at other countries infrastructure and there's cities. We are not the greatest country in the world in terms of What we have to offer and our the way our cities are being run The prosperity of our people at this time It's just truth and there's a lot to fix here and I don't really understand how You know people get wound up I don't think he's wound up. I think he's just seeing what he deserves But I mean, I don't think that's hate. I think he's laughing because he's probably like hey your way behind No, I'm not way behind either bro like I'm a reasonable human I'm not gonna jump in and say it's this race of people or it's that that is a generalized statement that does not allow for uh Realistic solutions to present themselves in the real account of the right so you know It is what it is man. I don't I don't Anti-all of Yeah, I don't know how hard that is. I've said that like I said that on October 7th Yeah, I said it when you crane happen. I've been saying it the whole time And I'm probably the only person who's been consistent in their viewpoints the entire time I fucking give a fuck about our country and our people and what's going on here And if we used our tax dollars that we all work very hard for to produce for them if they were used here Our country would look much differently our people would be more prosperous. They would be healthier America really would be great And uh, that's what I'm about. I'm not about anything else and once once Our home is in order then we can take a look at everybody else's That's real man That's real hope that helped out it rest 84 well guys we do appreciate you for being the real last fans you guys are keep liking commenting make sure you guys are Subscribed and hit that bell notification on the youtube to stay up to date with the latest episodes from LAF That being said, let's get to our second set of headlines here um This is interesting you like Rolls Royce I do right you got a cully you got the rath. Yep Rolls Royce you know they don't just make cars they make a lot of other things they make jet engines They you know they make some pretty cool shit Now the economy has been shifting and you know a lot of tariffs are out We got another surround set to go next week as well And with that being said rose Royce planning to shift production to United States To avoid trump tariffs They're coming here baby They're coming here I got it You don't think so you don't think so Yeah, well, I mean We'll see uh british engineering giant rolls Royce is reportedly preparing to increase manufacturing Production in the United States to avoid tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump London's daily telegraph reporter the rolls Royce is currently drafting contingency plans To avoid the impact of trade restrictions imposed by the trump administration The plans are said to include ramping up production in America and hiring more workers in the United States according to the report The aerospace and defense company is considering shifting production from countries impacted by the trade war such as China Canada and Mexico where currently has around 6,000 workers the source told the british broadsheet Quote if you're making something in countries like China then you'll be looking at whether you can do it in the United States instead This is great though if it is the case sounds amazing. There wouldn't be the first Uh, and only to do it, you know we covered this when it first happened. Huh go back Go back Hold on Go back to get your one brother the last one that one So it's just just just for their aerospace division. That's what it sounds like so but I mean that's jet engines That's you know propulsion engines. Yeah a lot of right stuff like that Well, when you said I doubted I meant the cars. Oh, got you know And by the way if you're listening to rolls Royce You keep making that stupid ass electric shit. I know what you're gonna buy your shit. Yeah, that's real Okay, real talk that specter thing that you're making is fucking horrible. Yeah, it's terrible. It's pretty gay like Fuck you guys thinking people want that fucking Rolls Royce v12 And that's all they fucking want they don't want none of this other shit So until you start making shit that people want you can expect that car to continue not to sell You wouldn't be worried about theirs if that was the case Um, but yeah, now they're not the first uh, we covered this when it first came out. This is back Back in February, Hyundai Kia they they they're planning to to move some production hits United States And then following them German auto giant Audi Looks to move production to United States as well. So I mean dude these are all jobs coming to the US of A are they Are they are they jobs? Maybe I mean if if robots and they I don't get involved well, they are that's my point. Yeah, so Well, I mean there's other jobs created up and down the line from that work. So sure that's true. It's just not the It's not the typical blue collage op. I mean, yeah Yeah, I feel like that that like that has to be I dude. I hope I mean Trump's pretty buddy buddy with the AI shit I hope that he comes out and like puts in some fucking executive water restrictions Well, you can't because if you let that happen Then what about all the other countries that are using it effectively You see what I'm saying? So like if China has no restrictions on how they use AI and we do Then we will eventually lose to them. So What should happen in my opinion is that companies that Minimize the use of AI and prioritize the jobs of actual humans should pay no tax And you should tax the companies that used AI heavier. Yeah, and This is a mistake that they did with the internet when when e-commerce started They actually gave a massive break to the internet companies because they didn't have to collect fucking sales tax And they taxed the actual small mom and pop regular businesses that employed people Which create an unfair advantage and what they need to do instead of doing that same thing again Is they need to flip it and they need to make the companies that use AI as their primary tool of production and employ few people They should tax those companies heavily And people who prioritize the use of actual humans Certain percentages of actual humans should get some massive tax break like like no tax. Yeah That do that would that sounds like a very simple plan. That's how it should be That's how it should be it won't be that way, but that's how it should be. Yeah, well we shall see Um, but let's get in talking about how these crazy leftists are fucking losing a shit. I think that'd be a good good combo to have yeah um No, first we're gonna check in on our our wonderful brilliant intelligent Jasmine Crockett Back in the new fucking genius She's so awesome, isn't she? Oh, yeah, yeah, she's just out there threatening to for people to fucking die and get what? Nated, yeah, um, she she decided to go off on musk. Let's check this clip out Let's just ends so I'll make sure that I keep it short But I am truly here for very selfish reasons Starting with on March 29th. It's my birthday and all I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon to be taken down yes Listen, I have learned as I serve on the doge oversight committee That there is only one language that the people that are in charge understand right now and that language is money And so I've been so proud to see us organized behind a cause Was there any other language these people understand? Yeah, it's about it I mean, that's what the fuck these that's the problem What what what yeah, I mean, yeah Well, I mean body called her out so she needs to check out for carefully because do they've all been ramping up this fuck I mean, it's not nothing new like the way these people like talk about fucking you know There's certainly a double standard about what they can call for and what conservatives can call for right with zero repercussions Yeah, of course zero zero. Yeah, then they've been doing it for a long fucking time and you know this call to You know fight people and destroy property and all of these things Those are in fact a coordinated active terror 100 percent I hadn't I had a guy reach out to me and say well that they're You know that the one guy's gonna get 20 years. I made fun of it on my page. You know these crying shit Well That's what happens when you do things like this and these people have not been held accountable for so long and they've continued to Press and press and press and press and you have all these Hollywood people talking about assassinating the president blowing up the White House You know if you see somebody in person that's that's a Trump supporter you should go confront them right and all this shit and dude like that That all that's all That's all incitement of violence and destruction and None of that should be allowed at all. That's not freedom of speech. That's not fucking like no, but that's terroristic shit Well, dude if you were conservative and you say things like that they put you on a fucking list They come see at your fucking house couldn't fly. Yeah, or you know like one of these guys the FBI is rated over the last number of years And they actually fucking killed them during the raid right there's been a handful of those situations right okay And those situations come from people voicing similar things to what these people say But these people get away with it and the fact that Maxine Waters has been able to say the shit she said in public and then you know We got a Cory Bush want to be here, you know because that's all she is you're fucking character lady You're a character the Democrat party has chosen to replace the voice of Cory Bush because Cory Bush's behavior was Unpalatable to the average American. Yeah, what she's going to jail to by the way her husband just got him died it Well, she should boyfriend whatever we call him For still and to touch all they did was switch out someone who was not palatable for someone who's a little more palatable And they're giving her the attention now, you know, and she's too stupid to realize that she's a fucking character in the play You know, they don't give a fuck about you ladies. You didn't get it at all. No, huh? I said, you know she doesn't get it. No, no You know, but but maybe maybe the accountability won't come from you know the government Maybe it just has to come from the people It sure seems like Elon Musk to start to take that trend He he just and to my knowledge I believe that he actually is fouling or has filed at the time of this recording a lawsuit Against one of the X-Quot members Jamal Bowman Because Bowman called him a Nazi in the thief on CNN check this clip out That's not true and this shows again the American people do not trust Elon Musk and Elon Musk is incompetent in his position And how do we know because they fired tens of thousands of people was challenged in court The court said the people have to go back and now the people are coming back. He's incompetent He's a thief. He's a Nazi and people don't trust him period. Let me just Yeah, and so to that response um To that response Elon Musk said uh quote I've had enough lawsuit inbound. I say you see the shit out of Likes take everything from them, bro. Well, I mean that's You know I mean dude like this like bro and like for just somebody just coming in saying like hey Well, if that's the case then the America people should start a class action suit against Kamala Harris for saying it on the fucking Presenture campaign calling all Trump supporters and Nazi. Yeah, 100% I'll be down to getting that lawsuit. I mean You know, I do this is sick shit that's happened. I mean, yeah, even just today they just uh this happened down in Austin, Texas They found several incendiary Devices fucking bombs planted at a Tesla dealership, bro. Yeah, you know, I'm like, I mean at what point do we say okay? All right Well, what what point do we as citizens start handling these problems as they arise on our own? Well, that was my point like okay, so if they're gonna call all this shit and say all this shit and tell everybody to do all this shit Maybe we shouldn't be so passive in allowing them to do so just thought that's a thought exercise It's a it's a great thought exercise there Um now another news going on. I mean if I were writing a movie about this and The plot line was we have a group of people who are putting bombs and places and destroying property and calling for violence You know the the next step would be the quote-unquote resistance or uh the defeat of these people and That only happens one way and so you know, I don't know maybe In that movie, you know like you would catch these people doing this shit and you would deal with them to the point where they wouldn't fucking do this shit anymore I couldn't do it no I don't know America used to be a place like that in the movies You know what I'm saying? I bet that movie's better than days of thunder You know what you might be right about that Yeah But yeah, man, so so I mean all of this is going on Um and and I want to throw this story here. It's kind of sad line. It's a little weird Um a boy Harry Harry uh Sisson who apparently he's a fucking ladies man Hey, but apparently he's a fucking creep All right Democrats favored influence a hairy system accused of tricking 11 women Including an abuse survivor into sending explicit photos via snapchat and how do you trick them? Yeah, I call BS on that, but I mean I we got some some some some of this things Um right now there's a whole it's trending on on twitter. It's trending everywhere right now Uh, and it's 11 women that are all like came together and they're like putting out these fucking okay With screenshots and everything all right. Let's see it um and uh the allegations suggest that sissin manipulated these women By claiming he had no roster and respected them uh for more than their bodies with one accuser being a domestic abuse survivor Quote hairy sisson convinced 11 different women that he had no roster and respected them for more than their bodies while persuading them To send explicit photos of themselves through snapchat including one from a domestic abuse survivor So here's one of the the screenshots from sisson um quote Now you definitely have a lot to offer no doubt I think right now I can't do exclusivity not because I'm getting new to from a bunch of girls or fucking girls and stuff I don't hook up with anyone ever But because I just don't think I'd be able to commit a hundred percent to someone uh or to something Um also since we live in different states exclusivity would be hard So I'm not balancing a bunch of girls at once my mind and energy are just other places right now And I don't have much more to give um this is another screenshot He said God that ass is fat in quote he sent that to them Very little sniper bro is there more? I mean that was that was about it um she continued saying that when the women discovered each other one by one He called them all insane and attempted to go towards one of them into telling the public that the photos were fake Now several and they've i mean all the screenshots are out there several women have come forward with detailed accounts Carly Hosh shared in a viral video the sisson wooed her from the beginning convincing her he respected her and had no plans of objectifying her So she responded by sending them new photos. Yeah You're not gonna objectify me so here. I'm gonna justify myself. Yeah, right right. I mean let's be real dude I'm sorry and this gonna if this makes people mad or not But trying to blame someone for something that you did You're the one that took the photo you're the one that sent the photo and If you're embarrassed about it, that's fine, but he didn't trick you, right? You know like That's that's bullshit and this is more of this me to nonsense shit like this dude's on the internet talking to a bunch of girls He's 20 fucking by the way. I didn't even like this motherfucker. I'm over here fucking defending them. I thought he was gay Bro, I was pretty sure too. I'm actually kind of happy to find out. Yeah, it's good for here. Yeah But Harry what the fuck man like But I mean let's be real dude, you know this this uh This idea that he's that these girls are somehow the victim when they did this shit You know one's an abuse survivor well then she should know not to do that. Yeah So where is the personal accountability on that side of it? I agree So that doesn't exist. I mean that's that's where I'm at with this. I mean look man Does that make what he's doing right? No, but I mean so he forced you to go take the photos and send him to him Yeah, right right right he had your phone and present. I'm just saying like to choose and then yeah, where's the fucking responsibility? Of of women when it comes to this in this scenario. Yeah, you know to me This is leftover residue from that me to movement that happened five six years ago that still exists in the liberal society It does they still use it. Oh, yeah, they use it on themselves. Right, right, so you know like Dude the guys what is he how is he? How's Harry's is it? Oh, it is Harry's sister 25 24. He's somewhere around there He's young 22 what is he? 23 23 23 years old. Okay, so this dude who's 23 years old Who's looking at all the I mean I'd be real I don't know I couldn't speak because the Everybody knows that Everybody knows that one side is better looking the other side for sure. Okay, so You know just being honest. So Harry. I don't know what pond you're fishing over there, bro But the pond's much better over here um And by the way, uh, I don't think you'll get me to do right over on this side of the thing Um, so you know, I think it's a good time for you to switch. Yeah, and like come to reality and you know Realize that the money what you're getting paid isn't worth. Mm-hmm. They fucking already hate you look at you. You're a villain You're a bad guy. Yeah I mean, I woke up and I'm no longer a philly. I can't trust this party no more. Well, dude. I mean What do you guys think god that ass is fat? Look at this smile. Hey, we gotta work on your game a little bit. Look at this. Yes. We got work on your game. Yes. Yeah, we're going to your game That's poor form. That's bad form. Okay. Oh, I love you so much. I would never object if I use Pleasin nudes fat Dude, I'm just saying like You got work on your game, bro Magnum my day listen, you can't have standards that are conveniently applied in certain scenarios because You want them to be mm-hmm, and you know, we have to have personal responsibility you know You took the photo you sent the photo. It's not like you shared the photo on the internet, which would be illegal I mean is he being a dirtbag? Yeah, but I mean what 23 year old dude Ain't any dirtbag. Yeah, that's true. I mean come on man. That's true Bro, this is probably first study tears you have fuck yourself You know saying he's like I need to see more this actually worked. They sent me the picture Yeah, bro. I think I think you know, he's about to switch teams bro. Yeah, bro. You might well I'm glad I mean, I thought honestly. I'm glad that he's you know, he's on my team You know, I'm saying a period on this team. Yeah, good. I really thought he was gay. You know, I can't listen A lot of Harry siss and shit. I actually think the guy's kind of funny like he's ridiculous like he you can tell like he doesn't he's I'd have him on the show for real bro. It'd be funny as fuck You know Harry who was your favorite? I don't know man. Yeah, man. Hey, it's all right Yeah, I get it, but I can't believe him over here sticking up for Harry siss and no The fuck am I doing? I think that day would ever come. I didn't either. Yeah, but like bro I'm not about to let some you know, right? Some yeah, right is right right is right right is right if you don't want people to have nude pictures don't fucking send them It's pretty simple dude. I think that like that's that should be an expectation like an expected consequence You would think and they like he didn't sit here. He didn't show him out. No, you know, I'm saying he was just admiring clearly I think that was it Well apparently if it's over there is probably pretty fucking fast. That'd be pretty good. Yeah, fuck but not a great way He's blushing. Yeah, he's you know, that's his first fucking thing man Welcome to manhood. Yeah, man pretty soon is gonna be talking logic. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That nonsense. That's I swarrowing's rising. Yeah, that's what it is That sounds like a fucking movie That's I swarrow rising Featuring Harry Oh, Harry, we got some more to destroy here real quick. This is actually really great. Uh, I mean he fucking told him he didn't want nothing with him Yeah, I mean you still and you still sent the news Yeah, hey man, I'd have to see more than this screenshot to think he did you know, there's something wrong. Yeah, I mean he's just trying to be a little ladies man Yeah, Harry just make sure they're actually a ladies Bro, yeah, well, what's a woman? That's what I'm saying.

It was absolute That's real trauma David. Geez man. That's real trauma That's wild man I got some other trauma for you. Yeah, yeah, lives are being exposed to more not just hair here. Okay Let's check in on a OC AOC tries to broaden her appeal within Democrat base spoiling for fight So you got AOC Got Bernie Sanders and they're going to save the Democratic Party also They don't know that yet, but they're gonna try Um, yeah Bernie Sanders stepped on to a stage in downtown Denver surrounded by tens of thousands of cheering supporters And what he described as the biggest rally It ever addressed The Vermont Senator put his hand on the shoulder of the woman who had introduced him a signal for her to stay on the stage Saying quote she has become an inspiration to millions of young people Sanders said of Alexandria, Askyo, Cortez Be counting her biography from a girl who helped her mother clean houses and later became a bartender before emerging as a political insurgent Who ousted a powerful New York Democrat In the US house primary the crowd began a chant of her well-known moniker AOC AOC now here here is the picture. This is like as just a screen grab of the uh Of the rally Bernie Sanders said The video it was a video drone footage basically of it Bernie Sanders tweeted this out The video speaks for itself 34,000 people out in Denver largest political rally there since 2008 the message is clear No to authoritarianism no to oligarchy no to trumpism we are ready to fight back Now it's on to Tucson. Oh you're gonna fight back? The fuck you gonna do bro with just 34,000 peers that that's not 34,000 fucking people that's like maybe at tops Fuck Four to five thousand people, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I mean dude we get we get Yeah, we get summer smash that looks like that You know, it's probably that size at summer smash or that might be a little bit bigger It's because it's a longer run. Yeah for sure But I mean that is summer smash. I think we usually have like 3,000 3500 4,000 That looks a little bit bigger. Yeah. Well Here's the interesting thing Um, I want to actually I don't even know if it's bigger because it's skinny like it's just hard to It's hard to tell how to really judge that yeah sure So we need some hard data here right we need some facts right oh do we have some oh we know how many people were there do we have some It was my guess on point. Uh, no, it was a little bit is a little under the the actual data was was a little bit over Still under 34,000. Yeah, I mean it wasn't fucking 34,000 people there But enters the show Tony Saruga Okay, now he has a an amazing piece on this Tweety this out GPS Here we go again There were 20,189 devices still large crowd but not even close to the 30,000 quoted in different newspapers Nor the 34,000 quoted by Bernie Sanders and a OC here's where it's weird though. Who are these people 84% of the devices present have attended nine or more Kamala Harris rallies and Tifa BLM pro Hamas or pro Palestinian protests 31% had attended over 20 in the past. Yeah, so it's not people from Denver These people from everywhere that are paid to be there right Um for more insight I have a hard time believing it was that many yeah, well that picture is not look like that Well, he he breaks down the data for us Um, he says for more insight and so what data we also look at in addition to GPS location data would be demographic and psychographic data using over 6,000 different databases examples like the bureau of labor statistics Pew research center market research firms like you gov experience socialized Specialized tools like yes our eyes tapestry segmentation etc etc Facebook LinkedIn X things like that Um, but he continues saying additionally by cross pollinating each device with other devices regularly within close proximity to the target device We're able to build a detailed profile for each target 90% of those in the above 84% We're likely working with one of these five groups and is the reason for their presence. Here's where it's spicy once again This is based uh, this is based a various sophisticated algorithm that looks at the behavioral metrics for each device including The physical one-to-one proximity to leaders and paymasters from these groups in the past So here's the organizations each receives money from act blue Um, and at least three of these receive their money directly from us a ID There's disruption project which is the legal status is unclear well Just to clarify uh-huh Just because three are through the us a ID doesn't mean that all Does not mean that all of them aren't correct because they could be funneled through different uh, NGOs and things for sure. Yeah, for sure Um, but we're saying directly funded through our directly funded from us. I uh-huh correct a ID Um, there's the disruption project that has a nice name Right that sounds like you know some pro-America patrises and loving stuff rise and resist Um, that's a 501 c4 nonprofit Indivisible project Trouble makers that sounds like a really good American pro-American movement right trouble makers Um, their legal status is for profit Democratic socialist of America 501 c4 nonprofit now again. What does that mean he is saying 90% The vast majority of that crowd Has close proximity Either one to one or one to two with one of these five organizations that means they're all paid to be there That means they're paid to be there by who We are paying for them to lie to us and manipulate what's the actual optics are pro right We're paying them this ain't a new thing now and for those of you guys well, I mean who the fuck is this Tony guy right like I mean, you know, this is just a guy saying this shit on Twitter right? I think that's a fair accusation Okay, but no, well who the fuck is this guy well, let's dive into his name's Tony Saruga. He's an investor a board member Big data pioneer intel ops he's worked at the CIA. He has a contracting position with them. He's a whistleblower um, and he runs a very large Organization that handles specifically with data, okay, in a separate post. Yes, Pints was programmed profile My partners and I have been lifetime data scientist We own the digital ID of every mobile device computer in the United States and have indexed and archived every IP address in the world Our extensive experience and big and deep data including geo tracking and geolocation makes our dozens of data companies the top authority for providing data To corporations law enforcement in the United States government agencies like the CIA NSA DOD DIA NGA NRO FBI as well as interpool and foreign intelligence organizations There are a number of videos documenting these ghost buses as well This is the same guy that that Tracked all the stuff with the the stop the still stop the steel in 2020 All the geolocation data there he runs basically. It's a marketing firm That is able to basically advertise directly to people right and they take all of this data that he compiles So to deliver those advertisements So he knows what the fuck he's doing he knows data better than literally almost anybody. He's a whistleblower. He's called this shit out For a long very long time Um, and it's very very accurate He also is known for tracking the infamous j6. Oh, there's more he said There's a number of videos documenting these ghost buses as well as a number of non-descript DOJ vans DOJ vans that dropped off ninja wearing individuals that appear in other videos to have breached the capital cutting fencing removing barricades opening doors and other nefarious behaviors We also tracked the infamous j6 pipe bomber from one of these vans DOJ vans Later we eventually tracked them to a virginia metro station where a perfect capture of their vehicle license plate was made The FBI has all of this information shortly after they were alerted however AT&T mysteriously Accidentally corrupted that and only that particular cell phone users data Hmm That's weird. That's just coincidence though Andy right? DOJ vans dropped off ninja wearing individuals that appear in other videos to have breached the capital cutting fences removing barricades opening doors and other nefarious behavior We have also tracked J6 pipe bomber from one of these DOJ vans If that wasn't clear enough for everybody to hear Hmm So our own government is taking our tax dollars Creating false flags and then blaming people like you and I on our fucking dollars. It's insane. Yeah, so what else have they? What other false flags have they done Huh, well, that's a fucking whole topic in itself They're about to do another one though. I'll tell you that because the information starting to come out more and more and more and more more These people are backed into a corner and when these people are backed into a corner bad big nasty black swine style events happen. Yeah, it's crazy, man It's great. I mean, there's guy he's on it, bro Yeah, he did give a little update. Uh, yesterday I'm saying that 20189 is the number of devices present at any time between 7 a.m And a 30 p.m. So about you know a little bit over with almost 13 and a half hours there There were at least that many. Yeah, that means people were coming and going well It's funny. You say that he says 61% of the devices were only present for 20 to 30 minutes between five p.m And seven p.m. That's why that's why it doesn't look like the 20,000 So yeah, I mean at that point. Yeah, I mean, it probably was only like fucking 5,000 people Um, and you know again, I mean, he's very intelligent The guy knows what he's doing. He also said you know, he also addressed a lot of questions in the comments people are asking He says the number of devices present when the When the video was made for example basing the time on embedded metadata found on a blog post of the same video is estimated to be approximately 10,500 That could be. Yeah, that could be it's hard to judge how big that is 134,000 no, no, no, not happening And he also you know Took care of any any concerns or people say and oh well, you know multiple devices things like that And he says quote many had questions on those attendees with multiple cell phones and attempt to inflate numbers Our algorithm removes connected redundant devices including watches, sport trackers, iPads, table tablets, etc So I mean the numbers are fucking real Um, it is what it is and he also said too that however the majority were arriving between three and four p.m The event was supposed to start at five p.m. Lasting approximately 80 minutes But again, they only stayed for 20 to 30 of that so um long enough to what Get the good pictures. No, what get paid. Oh, yeah, it's true. Yeah, that's true You got to be there for this amount of time. Yeah, we got to get this guy. I want to get this guy on the show We got to get him out here. I like this guy too. Yeah, I mean like I mean the dudes know it. He knows the shit man He knows the shit so seems like a good guy to know That seems like a great guy and obviously He'd leap a dick pics please Actually, let's have him and Harry on the guy. Oh fuck yeah bro Not tell him and not tell him anything. That would be funny. Yeah, so Harry though. This is Tony. He's Yo man guys jumping on this conversation Harry let us know what you would you would you guys think down in the comments I Tied me. He's funny Is that the gay dude again? Harry you're fishing in the wrong ponds. Yeah bro come to the the golf of America baby. That's right Yeah, man, all right, man. Let's keep this cruise moving. We got another set of headlines to wrap up here for the day That ass of get your bro Every time Every time Let's check in on some of our you know here's a problem. I've been having we're gonna check talking about these illegal migrants, right They've been trying to use it to I've seen this term start starting getting used more and more They don't want to call them illegal migrants. They're calling them residents and residents have you been seeing that shit illegal Residents yes, or just residents just residents All these people they these are our residents. These are neighbors. They're there are friends Obviously social conditioning for people to start seeing that dude is just got citizens over fucking residents, bro Fuck off. Yeah, fuck off. Yeah Um, you know, I agree No argument over here. Yeah, man. Just like what the like this this word games they do it's calming the ship, bro Of course, it's calming the ship. Yeah, and like it like it like it's you got to see it a couple of times to like become aware of it You know, I'm saying and once you start getting aware you pick up you'll you'll pick it up a lot a lot quicker You know, but it's disgusting. They're not fucking residents. Okay, citizens over ready Well, and also I think it's important to fucking understand that there is somebody calling the shots Okay, communism is installed. It's a coordinated effort and the people who are doing all of the work that are being told to do things are likely just what they call useful idiots. They're just people that are you know doing what they're told I'm just doing my job, right? Yeah And uh, you know, that's why we see all these videos of these people saying the same things manipulating language at the same times Changing the dialogue all in coordination. It's because whoever's calling these plays and writing these scripts is intentionally installing communism into our country 100% You know redefining the language as a core tenant of communism. Yeah, bro The fucking residents, bro. Yeah, not fucking residents, bro And not Um, but let's talk a little bit about what's happening so far at the time the recording the court of appeals. They're hearing arguments Um in the deportation lawsuit now the federal judge um Basically try to you know stop the deportation flights um, and uh, it's now in the court of appeals and DC circuit Um, they're gonna hear or or arguments Monday on whether the lower court can properly address the Trump administration's effort to deport Venezuelan nationals via a nine 1798 war time law Um, and uh, so that that's going on right now. We'll see what happens with that. Trump that the thing that Home in was like well, it doesn't predate the constitution does it still follow that yeah um, you know, but but Trump tapped in on this judge Um, Trump goes nuclear on conflicted judge blocking deportations to El Salvador His Monday morning truth social posts. It's like a cup of coffee, bro He's always putting some shit out um, he went out uh saying quote he should be disbarred Trump demanded claiming the judge was almost as bad as the one who presided over Another fake case against me. Trump called the latest incident a quote miscarriage of justice Um, you know, we're starting to see some things moving that Got GOP reps. They're moving to impeach the judge. You blocked the federal for uh federal fund funds freeze So I mean you're starting to see this. I mean, but that's the thing. It's like we have checks and balances in this country per our constitution How it's supposed to be set up right um, and you know The problem is like politically. It's like, you know, you have the one side they hate they they love to use it when it's in their favor But the hate one is being used against them and this is a classic example um You got GOP reps specifically. It's a Georgian Uh Republican representative from Georgia Andrew Clyde um, he's formerly introducing his articles of impeachment against the road island judge Um, who uh stopped and halted the uh, freeze of the federal funds and so like that's going through um You know I feel like they tried to do the same they did the same exact thing back in 28 uh in 2016 for term one But it's like, I mean, I what I think I think the difference is now it's become so fucking obvious That you have all of these you know judges Getting in the way of executive power right like in the will of the people I don't know how how much longer it can go for It's I mean, it's straight up Activism from the judges. It's not you know, the lady just is supposed to be blindfolded right you know It's not supposed to have bias and clearly These a lot of these district prosecutors a lot of the judges that have been you know placed into power through George sorrows who coincidentally receives $260 million uh a year yeah allegedly a year from USAID Putting these people into power. I mean, this is this is the game right that this is what they're in power to do the calling the calling the coins right yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean dude. It's it's fucking sickening man. I don't know So I mean, we'll see you know, we'll probably know tomorrow or so what the uh conclusion we probably got a couple of days to be real What the outcome of that lawsuit and the appeal score chime and then on well, what kind of person we want to keep people here that don't belong here That are disrupting our cities siphoning off our funds committing crimes And doing a whole bunch of shit that doesn't vibe with the culture of this country Bringing their culture here not adapting to our culture um Who who why would you want people here? Why would you want that? Mm-hmm. You know what I'm saying like That's not okay. It's not good for people Most people don't want it and if you want to really test that theory just say well, why don't you have one living at your house? Why haven't you taken one of these families in their tone will change completely instantly So that sounds like a good virtuous idea. Oh, I'm a humanitarian until it becomes you know time for those people to take a residence in your house And so I think if we're all being honest There isn't very many people that actually want these people here outside the people who are getting paid to say so They're 100% dude Well, that's people trying to get out the country. Let's talk a little bit about people trying to get in still um Not sure if you saw this Trans European travelers warned by their countries about us travel amid Trump to sexes order What what what they warned about several European countries have updated the travel advisories for transgender travelers seeking to enter the United States amid President Nommel Trump's two sexes executive order and the administration's immigration crackdown Finland Denmark the UK and Germany are all urging cautionary planning for transgender people when traveling to the United States quote When applying for an ESTA or visa to the United States There are two gender designations to choose from male or female the Danish travel advisory set on the website But they're posted this shut out to the website like It's crazy I don't get it Because apparently on their passports now and their current countries they can put whatever fucking thing they believe in that day And coming to the United States you can't do that no more well Yeah Oh bro listen hold on hold on bro Okay Let me ask let me ask a question. Yeah, okay Why should I As a person who understands real science Be forced to acknowledge That a man is a woman or a woman is a man when I clearly know that they aren't Why? Would I be forced to say that and people will say Well, what differences are made you're just accommodating that well because I know the difference and when I Say that I don't know the difference. I'm betraying my own integrity and my own factual knowledge of the truth And why would they want us to do that? Because it makes all of the other lies potential truth as well And that's what we're dealing with here We're dealing with another communist playbook of manipulating the language and getting you to admit to things that you know Are not true so that you will be more malleable for other things that aren't true And for you to accept them as reality and dude, that's what we're dealing with here. I mean There's fucking Dicks and there's a giant as bro. That's fucking it Cox balls and sugar well Some people got both a few Okay, like I'm after that's a shit. I'll very few. Yeah, but that's like That's it. Yeah, okay, and just because you cut off your peepee does not make you a woman and just because you have a Whole cutting you does not make you a man. It just doesn't so I don't know and by the way if a man wants to live as a woman or a woman wants to live as a man cool I don't problem with that do whatever fuck you want But don't force me to acknowledge that something is true that it's not true Yeah, and I think this is the this is where You know Well, I think there's two things to play here, you know I think one people don't really understand the actual damage is created by forcing people Or forcing yourself to admit things that you know aren't true I don't think most people are aware enough to understand that that hurts your integrity that hurts your belief in yourself That makes you know that you're a liar on the inside those are those will drive down self esteem and self worth all right, and then I also don't think that people are aware that this language is specifically use to manipulate the reality of What can be called truth and what can't be and I think if people would stop and really just think about that and not just immediately dismiss it And be like, oh, that's that's ridiculous. No, it's not ridiculous Your ridiculous for thinking there's anything other than what science says there is There is no third species of human. Yeah, there's no fucking fork gender or fit gender You all sound fucking insane And you want to know why the Democrat party is going to fucking get crushed from here on out Because they continue to triple down and quadruple down on this fucking bullshit Trying to get the United States to be a globalist nation When in reality, bro, the United States is a nationalist country And that's what it's going to be and there are going to be enough Listen, people have been polite here. They've been They've been reserved here And if these you know global forces continue to push here There's going to be bad things that happen here and it's going to come from the citizens That's reality, dude And so Maybe that's what they're trying to do maybe they're trying to And incite some sort of violence But You know, let's look at the mass shootings and let's look at the violence that's been created over the last However many years. It's come Not from right wing extremists or white supremacists or any of this domestic terrorists It's come disproportionately from people who are Manipulated to the point where they don't even know what the fuck they are Okay, and if I were them, I'd be upset too But where's the violence actually coming from? You know, so how long are Americans going to take that violence or that threats of violence? Did you see the video of that Preacher on San Francisco street and that trans woman came up put a gun to his head? Oh, I saw something and then fucking ran off. Yeah, bro, listen You're gonna do that you do that in San Francisco. That's fine. There's probably not a lot of people But you do that here somebody will fucking kill you, bro Like real talk like don't fucking kill you and there's gonna be a lot of fucking around And a lot of finding out because these people have been told That this is their reality and this is the way it is and now they're having to Reassess what actually is it is going to be accepted as reality and if you were someone Who was The belief that we are going to have unlimited genders and everybody is going to forget about the truth of science Uh, and you now find out that that's not going to be accepted Um, and not that you wouldn't be allowed to live that way But that you know, you wouldn't get to color yourself that in legal documents because it's not fucking true Um, these people's worldview has now been altered pretty tremendously which is going to To Cause them in my opinion to to there's a couple things one that will cause them to be more prone to Uh, you know, you're lashing out. Yeah. I was about to say more more instances of the same shit. They've been doing yeah, and you know um These people also on the other hand have not been held accountable for any sort of breaking of the law for a long time So you combine those two issues together Unless citizens are willing to stand up to these people they're gonna there's gonna be a lot of these motherfuckers a golf fucking rails So it's real bro It's just it's such a crazy and like I think that's the like That's the piece it always got like it's such a very simple concept right like From my my fucking it's ridiculous talking about my my two year old knows. I know the different. It's ridiculous To even acknowledge as an argument, but unfortunately we have to Because it ain't that simple. Yeah. No, it's not and it's so crazy There's a video this dude like goes around trolling uh them and uh And Well, let's be real bro, uh, you know When I was coming up bro, there was just people that were ugly. Mm-hmm. You were fucking ugly now People that don't take care of themselves and fucking you know, they buy a pair of glasses They all got the same glasses. They're either coming blue and red and pink Okay, or clear sometimes. Yeah, and uh, you know, they wear them and They make themselves look as unattractive as possible and then they say they're are they them? Mm-hmm Don't talk about me. You know, when I was coming up There was people like that that looked similar to that But you know if they wanted to look different they just started working out and eat right and they felt a lot better about themselves Because they were doing something that they actually earned 100% that no Make it fucking invincible, bro Like you're not even you're not fully being man. I mean, there's a couple on the internet that I've seen where they've been like I've seen a couple holy fuck like that looks like a girl. Yeah, I've seen a couple You know, and then and then you got these people arguing those people arguing Why don't know if I should actually tell someone bro you get killed for that. Yeah, yeah like You know, why don't see what the big deal is well because dude like if you're not gay And you reach down and you get a handful of fucking dick and no one ever fucking told you about it You're gonna be pissed off bro. I mean real talk. You're gonna be mad You're not just gonna go with it and be like oh Like I don't know what the fuck you guys are thinking man like You know like oh, you know what it's okay this time I'm very happy to reach down you pull up a handful of petroleum jelly What are you talking about? The having you impossible pussy bro. I don't you mean the man made kind of the man made Yeah, like you know, they got a they got a lubricate that shit. You know naturally lubricate They got fucking they got to keep it stuff with like petroleum jelly and so listen You know there's a reason there's a reason why it's hard to find Actual photographs of the butchery that happens during these so it's bad man, right? It's bad. It's hard to find act even on Google and shit. It's hard to find them Why won't they show you that because it's so appalling that like dude? There's plenty of videos and pictures of like open hearts. I heard you listen You know, fucker these people are butchering people's generals bro. They're never gonna get that back Imagine if you were a 17 or 18 year old boy Who was convinced that you were a girl because your parents told you that and your teachers told you that and it was the quote Unquote trendy thing to do and you're 18 and you fucking cut off your dick and then You know five years later you're like wait what the fuck what what I don't feel like a girl I'm fucking this ain't and you don't have no dick bro.

It's 46% if you if you deep like bro real talk Like you're pretty much guaranteeing You're up in that rate into the fucking 80s and 90s percent by doing this to people Because they're gonna come to a realization a lot of them are gonna come to a realization later in life that they really Fuck themselves up. Yeah, 100% yeah Yeah Guys oh no, I was gonna say about the fucking video the dude troll So he like he hop on this fucking dude's live right it's a dude thinking he's a chick happen to live and like I think his cat went by or something in the video And so he was like hey wait what's your cat's name and the guy's like oh his name is like Jeffries or whatever the fuck it is And he's like How'd you know it was a boy You know And the chance dude just fucking you look down and you got like piss cuz he he understood like oh it's caught So we understand it with with fucking with cats and not oh and you cut his balls off and but he's still a boy oh Oh That guy's a hero personal favorite well look man.
