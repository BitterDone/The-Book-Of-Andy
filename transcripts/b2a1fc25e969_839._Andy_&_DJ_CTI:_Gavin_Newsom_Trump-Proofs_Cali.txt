Shifts show alright what's up how's it going Andy? It's going on man I just came in from verbally nooking you know it has to be done sometimes something happens everything that's fine you're good yeah it's fine I feel good about it. God dude I just don't understand how like dude I just do not understand I don't understand this about anyone how the fuck can you not wake up in the like if you're life if you look around at your life and you're like fuck dude this ain't what I want right how can you not wake up every single day every day and aggressively try to improve that I do not understand that I do not I can't be around people like that I can't work with people like that I can't talk to people like that which is pretty much why I'm a hermit right like I am not the kind of person that can just accept things I'm the kind of person that if I'm told I have to accept things I actually makes me want to mold them a different way more intentionally right it's just dude I just I wish people would understand I think the disparity between what people think that it takes to win and what it actually takes to win in terms of not just work but skill development and personal development and consuming information and you know basically sharpening your spear so to speak like people don't understand like you can't it's not a half-ass thing dude like you can't win it's too competitive like people think they can half-ass work and then for a quarter of the time and they should be multi-millionaires it's like dude this is like straight up this is your life like how can you wake up every day how can you wake up every day and just accept your life and all the things that you don't like about it and not go hard to change that I do not fucking align with that at all and and do when I even get a flavor of it or a scent of it or a taste of it I fucking it makes me furious I can't stand it dude. Oh it's even crazy like and then they it's like smelling it's like putting your face right up to a big steaming pile of fucking dog shit and like having to go like over and over and over I can't stand it dude I can't stand being around it I can't stand it and then people think I mean well now that's a thing you know they can still compete with people who have everything and still go to fucking work bro listen it's an arrogance that's what I'm saying like how can you think I mean we just saw this in Super Bowl I'm sorry I'm a I know a lot of the chiefs guys but let's be real guys you could see it in the game all right Philadelphia wanted it you guys are used to winning you were you were comfortable you played like a comfortable team they played like a team that was hungry that's what happens when two elements that have those attributes collide the the the hungerier the harder the more invested the more dedicated party is going to destroy the other party and whether people understand this or not you are in competition with other people that do your job and those people are available for higher you see what I'm saying or if you're an entrepreneur if you're only doing it half ass and you run a restaurant there's another restaurant right down the street that doesn't better than you they're gonna beat you like I do not understand how warped people sense of actual competition has become like you are in in competition you just don't understand it don't get it dude and and when I when I went on around that in any way shape or form an individual I it just I can't stand it it is I only like to be around people to get it like dude that's why like some of the only people I talk to in my personal life or guys like Tim Grover you know I'm saying like we're watching a football game last night through text and I'm like what do you think he's what do you think and I'm like I think we think the same thing you know and like dude we just don't I just can't relate to anybody it's not like that it's like seeing a dime and then they have like a camel here is life it's just complete turn off I yeah well it's whatever I mean this isn't at the time nor place for this rant but fuck man no yeah no it works what is do you guys not get it like we it actually does go it does because culture is changing winning is going to become the thing again if you're not winning you are going to look like a loser like for the last 15 years everybody's been like oh it's okay he's finding his purpose he's one with the universe you know like we found your purpose yeah it's okay that's gonna change because culture is now shifted and achievement and winning and kicking ass is going to become the coolest mother fucking thing in the planet and everybody wants to be cool and this fucking bullshit capping uh capping out pretending that you know oh you know I'm just vibing out over here bro that shit ain't gonna fly no more nobody's gonna think it's cool like they do now they're all gonna look at you and they're gonna say yeah okay we get it bro that's it's happening okay because that is the culture that I grew up in and that is switching back we're switching back to an ultra competitive winning culture here in the United States of America and if you can't get on board with it bro you're you're gonna be sorry yeah so it's just I just it's just hard for me to be around stuff like that now that's real man that's real that's what you mentioned the Super Bowl yeah Eagles lost the Taylor Swift team what no the Eagles won I mean yeah Eagles yeah Taylor Swift teams lost yeah but I actually went so I went to sleep at like fucking I text you yeah no okay do you know why I text you no so you didn't see the halftime show no I don't want to go so I text you right when half time show happened okay and it was in the very beginning of the halftime show Ken Rick the Mars on top of his grand national which is sort of sack religious because grand national when it was made was the fastest car in the world and uh and it's a Buick people don't know that but anyhow bro I don't know what happened but they had like 70 people get out of the car and like they just kept coming out of the car like like bro you're just so fucking funny to me and I was gonna text you I'd be like bro how do you guys fit all these people in the car but you're fucking sleeping I had the perfect joke I'm sorry bro did you guys watch it did you see all those both fuckers get out of the car bro there was 30 40 people got out of the car how I guess they had a hole in the bottom or something but like but you couldn't see the you couldn't see them crawling through I was just I'm like man I you know different cultures like dude it was just it was a great great racial joke that you missed out on because you were asleep you know those are my favorite I know that's how we Indians fit fit people on the scooter I know bro I know I was thinking about you too don't think I wasn't yeah damn that sucks dude I was fucking I was out by like the fucking I think I watched like you know I watched the kickoff open and drive I got all the way up to the first like touchdown and then and then it was lights out bro it's the perfect metaphor for for what happens when you think you're good and you think you don't have to compete I mean even just like not even like wanting to get the ball to start with like you want the car in toss and defer to second half like bro go set the fucking tone like I saw it differently man I don't know I saw I saw I mean look dude there's there's arguments for both but at the end of the day the bottom line is you know winning creates comfort and and when there's too much comfort the winning goes away yeah that's reality for me until you're point about winning bro like and I love the cheese bro and I love the guys I know on the team the fucking awesome dudes bro you know I it's not a personal thing I'm just evaluating the competition and they were flat the Eagles were not flat they came out they wanted it they were hungry you could tell they were hungry you could see it and that was that and you could see the cheese come alive but they didn't come alive until there was four three four minutes left I'm thinking it would be too late for that yeah and it was too late so it was shit you know and well I mean on your on your your your your thing about you know winning becoming popular again and culture is shifting to that I think that was very evident because there was definitely parts I did see the I mean even just when they showed like Donald Trump you know I'm saying how the crowd was fucking wild yeah and they boot Taylor so in they boot fucking Taylor so if there's just a short clip here so it was during the national rhanth and the camera goes up to doubt it which by the way I think they tried to take it off of them too fucking quick because they they saw the crowds reaction check this clip up probably was fucking right they quickly get off over my hour what now that's kind of fucked up yeah then they boot fucking Taylor Swift I mean look man here's the face though they caught what she says she said what the fuck is happening so so so Sal was at the game okay so I text him because I know you know you can ever tell you can't trust these if it's true or not right I said hey do they really boot Taylor Swift he goes bro so bad he goes it was so loud far yeah but like dude you know what man real talk like that's why you don't talk about shit that you don't know anything about it was very clear that she was probably financially compensated I bet when they do the books there was a financial conversation that took place in some way shape or form and you know these people are out of touch with the people that buy their shit they don't have any comprehension like in no fence to Taylor Swift I think her story is amazing I congratulate her on her success you know she she flies all over the world she's had an amazing career you know her audience loves her like I think she's very smart with her brand I have a lot of respect for the whole thing okay I'm not one of these people she's like oh she's just some dumb girl that no she's been doing this her whole life it's a real thing it's a real business she's pretty fucking good at it yeah okay right now she's the best at it probably one of the best ever at it all right so let's be real about well Taylor Swift is some dumb lady made a billion dollars yeah fucking fuck out dude you're sitting in your fucking shitty ass house that she spends more and fuel on her mother fucking plain than your net worth for one trip right okay so I don't only hear it no but here's what I will say when you do live that level of life it's hard you have to make a you have to make real attempts to stay connected to what reality is for most people you understand yeah like just because you don't buy your groceries and you travel all you want and you do like those people that are paying two three four five hundred dollars a ticket bro that's like their family vacation you see what I'm saying and she doesn't understand that she doesn't she's lost touch of that which you know happens to a lot of people to get very well product right and I would say that from now on she needs to embrace a pro-America stance and realize that the people that go see her are you know they're regular people okay and when she calls yourself a feminist and then advocates for men and women's sports you're not a fucking feminist you're fake feminist all right so I'm not being critical of her skill or talent or ability to do what she does she's great at it but if you you know if you want to continue to be great at it maybe either try to stay in touch with where everybody is or don't talk about shit you don't know about that's real brother train the train stuff it's so crazy I just saw this video the other day it was like the director of the NCAA and he was asked how many they asked was it terrorism oh I said ask where the axiomat they asked they asked they at they at the fuck is this a store proposed a question oh shit I thought they murdered them to the NCAA guy got it right okay and they proposed you know they they quarried queried queried queried how many they quarried what they dig up so first they axed them they killed them and then they dug in his quarry buried is that yeah they own buried his ass yeah huh now they asked him like how many athletes that you know we're we're registered in NCAA right it was like it was like five hundred and ten thousand five hundred twenty thousand oh shit really athletes in the United States right yeah and then they they asked him how many of those were you know identified as trans mm-hmm wait wait what would be your guess with all the fucking hype we got what would be your guess I don't know a dozen liberal guests you know I'm saying okay 20 20 right I mean I was thinking like a couple hundred ten yeah ten so I was doesn't was a good kid yeah yeah well it shouldn't be one it shouldn't be one but like all like they were putting this shit out all look like it's mind-boggling wait wait wait who was putting this shit out like the NCAA was going with all of that crazy shit for ten people yeah ten people yeah and you got half a million fucking eyes okay well you're gonna find out why when these when all of these financial audits come about yeah man because the US a ID is just a tip of the iceberg and what we're gonna see is that the USA ID has been used to culturally manipulate the entire western world into believing that subversive subversive communist thinking is normal all right so you're gonna we're gonna find at some point in time that your taxes and all of your taxes listening and watching and my taxes all went to these programs to make us believe that those things we're gonna talk more about this on the show oh for sure there we got more coming yeah but the point is yeah the NCAA was pumping it out because they were getting paid to pump it out and guess who was paying to pump it out me and you and everybody else everybody that was mad at the shit me yeah I'm out bro what what's actually going on in the world right now is it's probably the biggest story in human history it's just people don't understand it yet yeah yeah yeah cuz I'm in the scale the amount of time it's been going on bro we've been talking about it for years yes by the way you guys gotta start putting some of these clips together from the old show man like the old shit because like nobody's good unless you've listened to the show you have no idea how spot on we've actually been so we got to start like we gotta get some editing going call it's preparation I know you guys got nothing else to do but yeah call it's preparation H yeah we're been on the whole yeah I'm saying call it no Lou just spit no but the other other you know super well stuff real quick the Donald Trump bro like this is I like a lot of things about this guy I have my my my concerns and my issues right I love the shit talking yeah I absolutely it's American bro and like it doesn't matter what the fuck it is you'll find a way to talk some shit about it it's American he posted this out on truth set the only quote the only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift she got booed out of the stadium maggot is very unforgiving I think they should be more more forgiving to be honest like I think I think we have to got let's room in we we got to make room for people to unite that's just my opinion and that's something I've always been critical about Trump for yeah but I mean dude like real talk hard what no real talk if you're not on board now you deserve to get made fun of because you're cheering for complete and total oppression of you with your own money mm-hmm and we're gonna talk about that in the show I hope for sure um yeah the memes have been pretty good dude the fucking crazy yeah super all overall uh dude honestly and I'm gonna say this like you everybody's like conjugal moors health times show was horrible you don't know what the fuck you're talking about that was some badass shit bro you know how hard it is for a hip hop star to fucking perform and rap at the same time he crushed it not only did he crush it the only reason that you didn't like it's because you don't know what the fuck he was actually saying and what he was actually saying the whole time was calling out pedophile shit in Hollywood and music and culture people just don't know the nature of what he was saying right so like I thought did you see the part did you watch a joke did you see the part where he goes say Drake and he smiled dude it was so fucking good it was so good everybody was rapping the whole fuck it bro it was listen if you didn't like symbolism that too red riding blue yes you didn't like it it's because you don't understand what's going on in hip hop culture or culture you just don't get it yeah like it you probably want to listen to Billy Joel you know I'm saying like you probably want to fucking you too yeah you probably wanted you too you know you you wanted hooting the blowfish all right or who do you mean cool that'd be fine I like there is record but dude you know what I'm saying like what do you think a Kendrick you like Kendrick or no you don't like him to you I don't bro I thought it was garbage what did you really yeah I did I just for hip hop man I just think they're for me the Super Bowl my opinion is the pinnacle of the performance you go for yeah and there's so many people that came before him that should have got that chance of my opinion that would have been a better performance would that be and said I think they picked it just for the culture it is what it is it wasn't my thing personally all right that's fair that's what arts about you don't have to like it all I thought it was great you know I thought he crushed dude I was watching the whole thing and I'm like fuck yeah dude I thought it was cool yeah I mean the clips and stuff that I see and I like Kendrick dude I like his shit I like what he sings about I think I you know the fuckers only five five yeah you're tiny yeah you little man he's a little guy here little guy yeah little guy big voice little guy he's got a little voice too kind of yeah sounds like a video game or something all right man well guys sounds but you guys not about the Super Bowl down in the car everybody's gonna be like we're fucking hooded it because everybody else hated it yeah now Joe Joe I can value his opinion because he's a hip hop kind of sewer and been in the business for his whole life okay people don't know this man's we got three platinum yeah pretty three platinum albums all right motherfucker knows I mean sometimes he's wrong like this time yeah man guys let us know what you guys think down in the comments but uh let's get to our cruise it's cruise the internet uh we got some good stuff to talk about remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for sell out calm guys can check all of this stuff out uh there yeah yeah go there go there bye some shit we should put some axes up that's the one that's the one that's the one levels now a period with your face on him we're gonna get some fucking axes with this DJ axis let me ask you something man his signed DJ axis yeah yeah hell out number one let's get into this let's go to California this little update on the fires and stuff there I'm gonna some stuff that's been happening in in good old California a little a little time machine here quickly we're not gonna go back too far we just gotta go back about a month or so we covered this on the show right this the deadline reads Gavin Newsom and California Democrats reach 50 million dollar deal to Trump proof the state you remember talking about this right now like this article like so we covered this was back in January okay January 13th is when this article was published and written mind you that was days after the fires had already begun they decided to do a special session um to use California tax to create a law fund to Trump proof California in the tune of 50 million dollars um and why is that interesting why why why's the hypocrisy well it's because uh here we are now in February and Gavin Newsom has to quote strikes delicate political balance with Trump while seeking federal money for LA fires so federal money that he what do you think he's gonna do with that federal money after what we've learned the last few days what you guys think what you guys think's been happening to all that dude how many times like legitimately how many times have I said this over the last four years that they promise us they fund the deal and then they steal the money how many like dude how many times I said hundreds of times at least at least I'm gonna I'm gonna go the deal with no deal thing at least once I'm gonna say just be conservatively you know it's been said at least more you're accent off a lot of extra there bro there was a lot more bro we said that a thousand times over the last four or five years at least and people are like oh dude nowhere dude the fucking Republicans just hate us man white people hate us too because they're fucking white I'm like it's not them it's them it's a Democrat steal in your fuck no dude's Trump Yes Trump this Trump it's Trump out of here and here's I got a little proof video for you it's you yeah it sounds like something a white guy would say aren't you right I hate myself really easy to say that be be successful when you're white so that sounds about white yeah sounds about white I Fuck bro I thought white tea was YouTube huh why you know what I did to you hit me to that I didn't know I I did yeah but see I saw it like 50 times he was probably figured it out What are these people what do they mean YouTube yeah why is that what do they say me to sounds about sounds about YouTube the fuck you guys talking about why tea can go to shit Bro you go on any of the clips on the other on internet you fucking look at the comments there's always like three or four hope well it's really easy for a white dude yeah man dude this really easy for a white dude would take me 26 fucking years bro holy shit this 26 years then what's it take everybody else yeah for man well it's just fine I saw I saw I saw the story but then I want I want to bring this clip in I want you to see this clip you know we talk about we we have said this thousands of times they they they fucking you know put these agendas out cost all this fucking money they don't do shit with it and they still all the money and here is a prime example of Gavin Newsom doing just that and this is not some recent shit this starts in 2008 let's check this clip out you can get down to LA and two and a half hours 55 dollars in California we're still debating a high speed rail what a joke finally California is going to get it right with this new high speed rail personally have been supportive of the high speed rail projects since my time is mayor of the city in county of San Francisco the project is no longer a $33 billion project the projects years and years behind the projects wildly over budget that doesn't mean it's a bad idea you can get phase one done which in essence is from Bakersfield to Silicon Valley you do have the capacity to complete a high speed rail link between Merced and Bakersfield now I know I know some critics are going to say well that's a train to know where we have a real federal partner their high speed rail system an incredible opportunity to finish the work at high speed rail was mentioned or point two billion dollars to be requested a little legislature to finish the job to someone who's all in on high speed rail the high speed rail not as a rail project but an economic development project three point six billion dollars it's about that time we have a high speed rail system we would have high speed rail all the way across the country we'd have the most beautiful buildings we'd have cultural epicentres we'd have crime feet free streets all of our citizens would be wealthy if you fucking fucks would quit stealing our money at high high speed rail system in California that is California's Ukraine that more money more money more money more money where's all that money see do we're gonna find out bro all this stuff's gonna come to light this is why people and by the way I'm gonna say this Elizabeth Warren must have done a lot of shit wrong because she's the loudest one like she's screaming about this oh she's loaded right why are we why why would someone be upset about a colleague in the government exposing all of the the waste that those people who we voted for are creating with our tax why would you be upset about that you could only be upset about that in two cases one you're legitimately fucking stupid okay and you're so bought into identity politics that you cannot break free of it yeah bring right yeah your your your brain is fully rotted or two you're in on it that's it that's it anybody else who's got a problem with what's going on and no one else does have a problem with it right and when you think about the sacrifices that you've had to make bro okay let's talk about your family or let's talk about your family Joe or let's talk about let's talk about all the families that work here and then the families that are listening here and the sacrifices that have had to have been made in the quality of life because these people were taken half your fucking money and it's pocketing it and not improving our country and not building the infrastructure and not creating the schools and not doing what they're supposed to do in our interests we deserve at this point in time not just to never pay tax again but we deserve some sort of financial reparation for the last 20 years at a minimum we can subsidize all of our growth all of by doing different things like every other country does selling our resources etc etc etc these people deserve to be hung well bro what makes it even worse every single person that has figured out that this money has made their way into their pocket by any way shape or form should be executed a dollar it should be executed fucking ballad no executed dude for real no prison note they if we mess up if you mess up by two thousand dollars bro they're auditing you go jail they'll put you in jail yeah but these guys can steal trillions of our tax dollars over the last got 100 years right and then use it to manipulate us in the yeah bro yeah dude bro that was the most divisive part and then on not not only they just still it then they get us to argue with each other all the all the all the tax that fucking got no bro Andy pay your fair share bro yeah all listen bro all the racial division all all of the all of the destruction in our inner cities bro these these these these people funded the black lives matter riots through George Soros George Soros has been destroying our cities for decades by getting these people into our government who will not prosecute crime with our money I'm not saying I thought it was his money I'm like damn his dude's loaded no it's our fucking mind well it makes sense that his net worth never goes down now because he's not using his money like dude this is criminal beyond it's evil beyond the comprehension and I hope that when citizens truly understand how evil and comprehensive this program of overtaxing us using the money to make our life harder manipulating us turning us against each other financially oppressing us so that we can't notice what's happening we've been robbed for 50 60 70 years you want to know Gavin Newsom why our country doesn't look like fucking Dubai because of people like you well I mean even even to the black community but we cry about generational wealth and why we don't have it well this is why we don't have that's right this is what they take everything this is what they take they need victims they need struggle they need hardship they need racial division they need all this shit so that none of us stop and say how much money did they actually spend on that rail right and where did it go like how how how does that steal that normally cost a thousand dollars a piece how is that a hundred thousand dollars a piece what it we can't ask that when we're busy arguing with each other and we're fighting each other and we're struggling and we're having to make sacrifice listen to it I know a lot of people listen and they're like oh yeah what do you know about that motherfucker I live most my life that way okay just because I'm successful now it doesn't mean I don't know what the fuck that's like okay and I don't want it for you I don't want it for our people and it doesn't have to be that way for our people it's greed and it's evil what's happening in this country and there needs to be accountability for real dude for real accountability no not not oh they Gavin Newsom goes to jail for two years for no eliminate the mentality from our fucking country this country supposed to be united it's supposed to be I look out for my brother on the left he looks out for me I look out for the guy on my right he looks out for me we all take care of each other we all support each that's what this fucking country is about and we have been infested with a group of people who think that they have the right to not only steal our money but then use it to create disturbances and disruption and oppression for their benefit and that has that has to be eliminated in my opinion violently like not us doing it but they should be prosecuted and there should be examples made how many fucking men and women killed themselves a year because of the fucking financial hardships that they're in how many people get a tax audit and fucking blunder brains out you know what I'm saying right bro I got audit in one time and I owed my I owed a bunch of money I didn't have a bunch and I'm gonna tell you right now dude that crossed my mind quite a bit just blowing my fucking brains out this is a long time ago but like you know what I'm saying bro like like bro this is not this is not okay what's been happening it's fucking a million miles away from okay I'm a gazillion miles away it's the most evil shit you could possibly think of and I'm have a lot more sample yeah we got a little bit more to go I just want to focus it on this California shit because you know like that that was just one example I'm sure you can count thousands of those same examples every state has one each state is doing that yeah each state is doing that I won't say each state there's a majority of states and there's a common denominator with the leadership of I don't think that I don't even think that elected officials know the depth because all the elected officials I'm friends with with besides Tulsi are all they're all always been Republicans yeah okay I know there's some shit bags over there too all we got to do is look at who's making money on the on their traits yeah for sure but I mean it's local too it's not even just at the state I know I know bro I mean we covered we had a story here in St. Louis it was like five alderman in the city of St. Louis all went to jail right for these backdoor deals that they were trying to you know fleece their communities you know I'm saying I get told all levels bro and you know right now we're seeing it at the at the federal level this is exposing the state level start calling that shit out in your community because I guarantee you it won't be you know billions of dollars but fuck I'm sure your community could use that extra 50 grand of the you know take it allegedly Chelsea Clinton bought a 10 million dollar house based upon the money that USAID gave her for her foundation right now if that's the case then what about the Clinton what about all these people right what like what are we doing so so Chelsea Clinton gets a 10 million dollar house that we pay for for what being a Clinton right that's what they think bro these people this this kid this thought process this is why there was a revolution okay this is what the American revolution was about we had a group of people who believed this is what every revolution has been about for 12,000 fucking years we have peasants and then we have oppressors and we had the American revolution to break free from the oppressors okay we are now in a worse situation than what those people were in 250 fucking years ago way worse way worse way worse and because it's been going on so long and because we're all when when you go to school what do they tell it into it though that's right you don't know any better dude yeah like if you're born in a fucking pig style you're never gonna know it's a fucking smell right okay so like like we are in a situation now where massive reform is going to happen because you can't put all this shit back in the you can't put this back in the in the box bro truth pays out to yeah because enough people there's enough people now that know that it can't be put back so there's gonna it's this is gonna be major major and it's gonna be major disruption major kicking and screaming and in my opinion this is why Donald Trump has to move super fast because their next move will be to create some sort of violent black swan 9-11 culture shifting type situation it's very dangerous right now yeah yeah but this other piece in California I want to I want to show you out real quick so so Karen Bass the mayor of LA right she brought in this guy to be the fire recovery chief okay then again like you just look at the fall of the money what where's the bull shit at 500 thousand dollar salary for three months 500 thousand dollars worth three month position where's your tax money going shit like this shit like this he's the he's supposed to be the fire recoveries are all right and he's gonna three month salary for 500 thousand dollars now grand this is being paid by charity groups okay but even in even in that situation I mean one I don't know who the fuck we go in you gotta fucking disaster zone going on right now you know and and and to even accept that it's kind of gross to me in my personal opinion they're used to doing it dude this is how things have gone forever yeah this is your buddy yeah this conversation and hiring probably took place before this information that we're talking about even was brought to light yeah this information that we're talking about about the amount of fleecing they've just cut people understand this bro this is not just USAID this is every segment of government this is this is the military this is the Pentagon this is healthcare this is everything everything everything it's ever we are living in an actual manufactured matrix of oppression and hardship that has been created to provide for for quote unquote the elite people like this is no different than back in the 1500s you know like another thing I was just thinking about uh so think about god dude this is so fucked up what they've been doing like when you wrap your mind around it it's so evil like they put people in lifetime financial debt to go to to go to a school that teaches you how to think the way they want you to think and they bind you with that debt so that you can't go build your dreams and you can't go live your life you have to work like dude this is insane what they're actually doing and what they've been doing like this is way when you really stop think about the average family dude like I went to a private high school they had a scholarship program okay the the number of families at that high school that are on a financial aid program it's like most of them okay you wouldn't need that financial aid if these people weren't being taxed to death and and the everything being corrupt like dude it's when you really think about how it all fits together and it really sinks in is some very fucking evil control population control bullshit well and then to see the people try to fucking defend it not not only dude though that's sickening bro and most of them are not idiots they're defending it because they know they all know the game yeah bro they go to Washington they somebody puts their arm around them and says hey this is how we do it up here start a foundation I'll get you funded through the USAID then you pay all your your family through the foundation by houses you can buy properties as long as you have a meeting there once a year it's it's a court you see this is what they do bro all the while all of us we're out here just killing ourselves to even make it it's unbelievable like it's to me it's the biggest story in the history of my lifetime and this kind of brother this makes Bernie made off look like fucking dog shit no no no and then I don't know it's just that's child's bro I even I haven't even had the full like wait till we find out the rest of what's going on right the other 99% yeah yeah then then they print trillions of dollars to reduce the value of the money you do accumulate so that even if you are smart enough to work around the system you're not going to get shit at the end anyway and then they hit you on the end with a fucking 50 to 60% death tax depending on where you live which means all the money that you are able to accumulate even though you've been taxed the entire time they're going to take more than half of that when you die unless you go out and create a state's address and do all this which most people in preview too bro most people don't even they intentionally don't let people know that yeah it's crazy man guys got a little bit more on that coming huh that's what down the comments what you guys think with that being said let's go cruise some of these comments we got some we got some heat for you oh doing yeah this first comment comes from Bdubs 52 he says um crime rate of zero while having a felon president you support talk about being a hypocriteal tool yeah well it's better than being a 20 IQ person

of anything right or more and more importantly now why were they trying to prosecute them there be dobs right why don't you tell me why they were trying to go it couldn't be because he's going to uncover all the money they've been stealing from you and then what's that say about you that you support the people that are stealing money from you holy shit bro we got a long way to go those shit

work for real I don't care if it's 20 pounds or 200 pounds or whatever it is man like the shit's hard it takes a real commitment and it takes being a real adult and a patriot honestly to do it in my

100% guys let's keep this cruise moving we got a headline number two again I alluded this alluded to this earlier I like I like the shit talking from Trump yeah it's hard to just not it's hard to not like like I really don't get it and we're gonna start headline off headline number two off with this watch president trump demolishes far left reporter with a savage response when asked a silly question during Air Force one press gaggle and I don't know why they keep lining this shit up for them too bro like it's like they're asking for it you know because they just say dumb shit they ask dumb shit and then like he just calls it out for what it is check this clip out my story suggests that it's a cool way that you know like they can just get worse by the stuff I don't know if we watch it talk to the boss neither do you who you with who I thought they I thought they died at this sort of I haven't read them in years I could have died that's fucking great man it's great I don't know I just wanted to start it off with that but these these are dog man I love it well I'm I'm kind of surprised they're still around too I mean that's true I mean didn't their funning just get cut I don't know if that's true or not yeah I don't know yeah I mean he's but it takes some of those snacks on their force one while you can't I wonder what kind of snack they got you think they got good snacks I know he had a little basket next to him yeah he got a little basket right there I want to know uh Schmidt was on that fly Eric Schmidt was on that fly I want to ask him about the snacks I bet it's pretty fucking good I mean I can't really see that far let me see I think they got some of that licorice we like they do it's right there bro walla be walla be that's fucking good brother some good licorice it's not a plug not at no it's genuinely great like I showed my butthole for you know walla be that's awesome which one you like the best the black or the grape you gave me the other night I know you liked it great I mean listen I'm I knew you were gonna like it when I gave it to you why'd you know that I just had a feeling hmm and swish yeah I like the red I don't know what flavor that is but the red one I don't know for strawberry or cherry huh it's good yeah man those are good solid yeah I like them oh I mean he can't be that bad if he knows what good liquor she is that's true it's true um walla be we're about to open up some sponsorships yeah bro hey bring him I gotta hold team I don't need money just give me fucking liquor he's gonna fuck a liquorice I want to walk in any lit gas station and just take one off the fucking shelf bro it's a deal it's premium it's good liquorice yeah it's not like peasant liquor now it's not the packaging is great everything's great it's a great product and it's premium I don't know probably to find out the people that own it are like fucking communist or some shit yeah oh shit all right whatever man let us verify that before you I don't care they make good shit this is a free market I don't care what your beliefs are I'm gonna eat your good product I'm gonna drink your beer even if you do some some bad sometime one time but uh but yeah let's let's talk about some of the things that Donald Trump has been doing other than getting in the applause at the super bowl um do you see that uh he announced uh that he instructed the treasury department to stop producing the penny I did see that interesting um but I mean yeah like and that's the thing man like when you look at here this stuff you see this stuff face value it's like you know but again like I mean they didn't say it was costing two or three pennies to produce a penny bro the the penny cost over three cents to make and it cost US taxpayers over a hundred and seventy nine million dollars that was just in 2023 well yeah I mean that's a smart cut why would you that it's actually it's actually a great example of how they run everything right but that was a video of a congressman he held up a bag of of bushings that go on airplanes military aircraft and he said it was a bag I mean it wasn't like a fucking crate like a bag of a wallabies liquorish was about the size of the bag and he's like do you know much this back cost he was asking one of the DOD reps they're like no 90 thousand dollars okay so that's another way that this happens okay you ever talked to someone who who's like bro business is so great we just work with the government yeah yeah yeah right the reason they say it is because it doesn't matter what they build the government the government just pays it right so there's fleecing that goes on from the actual reps who are pocketing money and buying houses and shit and then it's happening again on the companies who learned that when they do business with the government they can charge anything they want right because knowing knows or cares want us to our buddies too that make sure that they get those bids and there's an there's an initiative and a mentality that we must spend all of our budget so that we can get more budget exactly and you understand why they do that now because that means more money than right it's usually lose it yes 100% man you know and you know president Donald Trump on his way down to the super actually you know had a couple of statements and things to say but he predict it he also did this interview with Brett Bayer also I think a little bit of that was shown during the super bowl but he predicts that Elon Musk will find hundreds of billions in waste in the next Dodge Directives Doge Directives and he kind of laid this out like that an interview with Brett Bayer and I was just talking about Elon Musk and the work that he's been doing Trump said quote he's not gaining anything in fact I wonder how he can devote the time to it Trump continues saying quote I'm going to tell him very soon to go check the Department of Education he's going to find the same thing then I'm going to go into the military let's check the military we're going to find billions hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse and the people elected me on that check the script I don't know if it's kickback so what's going on but the people look I ran on this and the people want me to find it and I've had a great help with Elon Musk who's been terrific Tom you say you trust him trust Elon oh he's not gaining anything in fact I wonder how he can devote the time to it he so went to but I told him do that then I'm going to tell him very soon like maybe in 24 hours to go check the Department of Education he's going to find the same thing then I'm going to go to the military let's check the military we're going to find billions hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse and you know the people elected me on that no and you know no short not not not just after that Elon Musk says FEMA sent almost 60 million dollars lies just last week yep to luxury New York City hotels to house illegal immigrants yeah which was against the directive that he put out so they did it on their own outside of his own presidential order to pause any sort of actions for illegals so those people should go to jail yeah Elon tweeted this out he says the doge team just discovered the FEMA sent 59 million dollars last week to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the president's executive order that money is meant for American disaster relief and instead is being spent on high end hotels for illegals a clawback demand will be made today to recoup those funds they're calling it out man and I like to see it have you seen I know you're not on Twitter much but you see what he put in his bio Elon Musk has a new bio on Twitter White House tech support I just thought that was great but man he's been calling it out and it's like it's funny man because like you know we've been talking about this shit for so long calling out the lies you know for so long and this is a clip that just got retweeted by Elon Musk also that we actually had here on the show I believe we were one of the first people to break this but calling out these lies when KGB was in office or as a press secretary and how should we just get up there and blatantly lie we we caught it out after doing our own research on the show expose the story of how they were funding all of this shit when they come to these illegal migrants and how FEMA was using our tax dollars to fund that and this was the response we got from KGB check the clip out so disaster relief this is a falsehood disaster relief funds used on immigrants illegally in the US the fact is no money is being diverted from response needs that's the fact oh that's the fact that's the fact yeah but but in fact that was a massive lie we all knew that funds have been diverted they continue to get diverted even after president Donald Trump you know blatantly explicitly says don't do it they're still doing it oh and here's the other thing that he found out right here at the bottom line on this he says they're also appears dude there's so much I keep forgetting to even bring it up this also appears to be significant funds siphon from social security to pay for illegals so social security that they ask you to pay into your whole entire life that they tell you is going to run out is not actually going to run out just because they stole it all right to push their initiatives and put in their own pockets okay so when you start god dude I don't know how like I don't it's a lie here I know but like I don't know how someone could like the key to this the key to this whole thing is to for people to understand what's actually going on this is the biggest story in the history of this country and maybe the history of humanity of modern man because what we've dealt with with the creation of television radio and print and then taxes which by the way all came around at the same time I mean print was available wait before that but now this fucking proper ganda machine that was created and utilized and paid for for decades so how do you know what's true and what's not true how do you know that the textbooks that you read in high school or in grade school or in college weren't funded with your own tax dollars to send you a message that was not historically accurate there's so much here there's according to what Elon said outside of this tweet that there were I think he said millions of identical social security numbers that have been funded outside of ones that were held by American citizens dude this is way bigger than people understand and my only hope is that people will take the time to actually understand it this is not a little deal none of us should ever pay tax ever again of any sort at all at least for the next 50 years okay and we should be paid back of what we've paid for the last 25 years the actual adults who have been paying tax should be compensated back and that should come from substation of our natural resources and a bunch of other things that other countries do to subsidize their economy. I put them out. Bro whether it be oil natural resources. Only that you charge you could charge people to protect them with your like there's all kinds of things that could be going on that aren't and we're not even you know producing our own oil and what what like that that's something that I don't understand first of all the amount of damage that happens with green energy is is irreparable mining operations that strip the earth of resources that do not go back into the earth not renewable oil is constantly being produced by the earth it's a byproduct of decomposition over time it's always being produced and they told us when we're growing up what they tell us we're going to drink all the oil if we're transitioning into green energy and oil is becoming obsolete then what differences we make we make money on it now or not you see what I'm saying right like this this is all bullshit it's all bullshit we had a Curtis on who was talking about the green how the green deal was such a communist scam and everybody is like no it's not true it's you know it's good for the environment what what do the plants need to make oxygen they need carbon dioxide they're trying to ban so so why are they why are they stripping why are they cutting down all of these forests and why is the government doing that right like dude we who founded ecology bro listen bro we are in a position of complete and total oppression that's what we are it's it's not even a little bit of freedom we used to think oh well you know there's some freedom but when you consider that we are told to go to work work till we're 65 which you know now people got to work their whole lives a single income earner can't even afford house anymore okay you can't afford a family anymore you like you got all these young these young this is why I dedicate so much time to you guys getting rich because you got to be right now okay but you have all these things that have changed where they've printed off money to devalue the dollar housing is going up it's not coming down they tax people harder more I mean dude and then they propagate this it's total control it's it is the matrix it's the fucking matrix legitimately just in a different way than what they show you in the movie yeah bro and then get the part they really irritates me too bro is then they try to they try to convince us idolize these folks yeah and we'll do any any person any human being that has that is a progressive leftist those people have just absorbed the propaganda more than everybody else yeah really feel like what about these motherfuckers that had gender transitions and they're going to find out that gender ideology is is actually like an evil concept that's been tried before for the reason of communist control and takeover and depopulation like dude and then they've already gone and done it and like you know the parents encouraged like dude they almost got us dude and they did get some people they got a lot of people yeah it's it's it's a lot of people I mean it's just like just I utilizing try to make mortar out of these people who are you know keeping the foot on the like on the on the next man like you see that they were supposed to be building Fauci a fucking museum well this is another thing Elon just covered Dodge Dodge cancels funding for Fauci museum exhibit along with a additional 180 million dollars in contracts that were also canceled from the health and human human services yeah they're supposed to be a contract for an Anthony Fauci museum exhibit um in the amount of 170 thousand dollars they should build it they should build it okay except the exhibit should be photographs of everything he did and then at the end shown him tied up and quartered to do to four different horses and show a video of him being executed by court being quartered and then at the end it says don't do that shit that should be the museum now with all of this going no I'm being serious I know you are yeah I know you are dude you cannot get people to not do evil shit unless the punishment for evil shit is so bad that it's terrifying yeah like they're not having a problem in fucking elves El Salvador fucking gangs now you know you go in the gangs you in all these dudes got their faces tied in they're wearing on and they say do you still think you're tough because you were a gangster and they're fucking crying okay these motherfuckers ain't they ain't bad ass bro they just not have they haven't faced any repercussions that's all it is man you get you get a tough a quote unquote tough motherfucker or somebody's above the law or someone like Anthony Fauci's a little weasel at thinks he can we and you make an example out of it it stops everybody from doing that shit yeah but though now here's here's something I want to get you take on too right because we've seen this play be ran uh in 2016 right like Trump could have like done a lot more in my opinion had he not had to jump through all the hurdles that they made that man go through yeah they're starting to do it now again um and this time they're using judges to do it did you see this uh this heli reads Obama judge temporarily blocks musk uh doge access to important treasury department payment system orders immediate destruction of all data obtained since Trump's inauguration musk responds to ruling with fire um so CNN reported this past Saturday that a federal judge halted Elon Musk's government efficiency team from assessing a critical treasury department um US district judge Paul a Engelmeyer uh hubo rock Obama appointed Saturday risk of quote irreparable harm that's the point the point is to burn all this shit down and put it back the way it was it's irreparable harm to you because you've been benefiting from it the rest of us it's called the way it's supposed to be now you order temporarily stops access a sensitive payment system that distributes americans tax returns social security benefits disability payments and federal employees salaries uh moreover Engelmeyer ordered the destruction of any downloaded information from the payment system by anyone given access to it since jenuary 20th the date Trump was inaugurated uh inaugurated now engelmeyer claimed in his ruling that quote the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the system in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking that's what they're worried about that's that's what they're not that's not what they're worried about this is not what they're worried about um now it's important to know this bro this is they're not only these people exposing themselves for who was on the take but they're also exposing themselves for how fucking stupid they actually think everybody else is right right you know it's funny watching those people protest like Elizabeth Warren and uh maxing waters and tumour and they're out there protesting and saying yeah and and and everybody's like well all that's been done is we've been figuring out who's stealing money so why would you fight for that and even the dumbest person is like how would you fight for that it's you you know say it like you don't have to be very smart no i mean you know what i mean no no it's it's crazy but i mean to your point they're exposing themselves right and so you know this ruling god i can't wait for what's about to happen it's about to be biblical bro i know it's gonna be fucking huge but but you know it wasn't like this judge is acted on his own right like i mean who who put this shit together when you pill it back the ruling was in response to a lawsuit that was filed by trump hating new york attorney general what's this shit james 18 democrat state attorney generals how that we're out for you infuriated over trump's efforts to downsize the government um why they have to but hold on hold on let me let me point something out to you yeah okay if you were on a company all right and you're a true contributor to that company and you're like all right the company's not making money so some people got to go and you're in that company and you're someone who does good things for that company you know what they're gonna say yeah bro we need to get rid of some people you know why they're gonna say that because they're gonna say if we can do the job with less amount of people and we can make more money i'm gonna make more money right let's see that's not what these people do mm-hmm these people don't do anything they just steal and they take and their leeches on society and now they're being exposed and they they want to make it so you don't notice that they're being exposed except it's too late because they let their fucking fear expose them now you have Schumer today making up some bullshit democrat fraud group who's gonna look for fraud as a democrat like what are you guys gonna do wheeling a bunch of mirrors you know say it like like you know like dude like but but you know how like that's crazy you know how like when there's like something going on and they're like there's multiple people involved and then like people figure out oh shit these guys are gonna win and then there's like some that some of the people try to get on that team you know like the rash jump the fucking sinking shit like that's what he's doing now because he realizes him chanting and arguing and getting in people's faces is over it's over bro these people are circling themselves and gathering themselves together because they're undisciplined and they're fearful and they're stupid and they think we're stupid oh brother swap has been drained and now that's not been drained yet well I think they're stuck in the fucking mood you know what I'm saying yes you can get out yeah you're in it now yeah you can't get out yeah um and to that point water should I mean like you should just shut up go each your granny cookies whatever fuck you do or steal them and hope hope that that you die before this happens you know I'm saying but yeah I mean so in response to this Trump stripped the security clints yeah security clearance that's right Latisha James Alvin Brad loser security clearance our homie up in New York okay but not big homie little homie okay all right when all this shit happened he messaged me by the way I like him yeah he's cool Stefan's cool yeah he's cool fucking step he's like he's like bro Alvin Bragg's badass I'm like look dude just wait I said just wait this is like two three years ago when the saw star coming out just wait just I'm gonna message him after the show but no yeah right as they was talking about Bragg and he's like Bragg's badass I'm like yeah because he's got no checks you know like when nobody watches what you do and you get to do anything you want because you're a certain race in a certain position knowing it says anything otherwise your racist you do whatever fuck you want that's ending too which is wonderful it's great and then you know in response to this the Trump administration just filed emergency motion to vacate the treasuries restraining order assert that no court can sever presidential supervision that's mandated by our concerts yeah no make it prove it's executive branch and judicial branches two different things separation of powers yeah can't fucking control it but they don't know that no that judge don't even know that no and at the end of the day the other thing to that these people failed to remember is that this is what the vast majority of Americans want I know people keep saying like that guy in the comments okay believe we didn't vote for it no this is exactly what we voted for exactly not not only not only did we vote for this and I said this on record a hundred times most of us want him to go way harder because we're tired of your shit okay most people want to see these people who have been stealing strung up and impaled like Vlad the impaler nor Vlad the impaler did bro he had fuck he impaled his own corrupt people in front of his castle okay all the criminals all the bad people in his community he fucking impaled them and then when the other army showed up the fight them they saw that he impaled these people on these poles and they turned around and went home and they thought well fuck if he's gonna do that to his own people what the fucks you're gonna do to us and that's the level of fucking scared these people should be to ever fuck with the people of this country ever again it's just fun to see people squaring and seeing the reality that like we're all in mind I want to see executions do yeah I'm just gonna I know people get upset when I say that I don't care that's what we need do you want your money stolen from you or do you not do you want your to be oppressed or do you not do you want to live under people who think you're a cockaroch or do you want to fucking not live that way and be treated as a human and have opportunity to actually thrive in this country like you were promised and what this country was founded upon you have a choice but the choice for us to get the good shit is gonna require us removing the bad shit permanently and making an example so that your kids and your grandkids don't do the same shit we've got to do that's real guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments tell Elon and Trump to hire your boy to help solve this problem I will fucking do it for free I will come there I'll sleep in the White House right there next to fucking Elon to be no different than when we started this company I we can share a mattress brother I don't give a shit bring me in I'm passionate about this I want to fucking impale motherfuckers not not in a gay way either no I don't think anybody was taking it there I mean you just I was a disclaimer I'm not gonna say I gotta be careful with the equipment I hurt people I'm just saying dude fuck these motherfuckers I'm gonna pale I'm so good yeah I gotta stab him captain stabbing bro bruising for cruising guys bro listen man that's all right I don't care I just want to clear up any confusion I've been a lot of propaganda bro I'm just saying man like where is the fucking demand for this yeah like what are we talking about here these people ruin your lives and not only ruin your lives they lie to your face and steal your money and don't give two shits if you can't afford to fucking live while they're buying fucking jets and planes and boats and getting libraries and shit fuck man yeah man bro we should take this shit back and we have an opportunity to hear if Trump is who he says he is I just hope he is man we shall see we shall see guys let's get to our third and final head on we got head on number three um this one's a little interesting topic on the the deportation that's been happening or lack thereof I should say head on number three reads leak documents says large scale immigration enforcement action coming soon to LA do you see this this shits getting leaked yeah of course it is of course it is listen a lot of these people have been operating sans accountability for decades we're going to see more and more and more of this stuff until it's dealt with hmm you see what I'm saying yeah wow we gotta see what what's gonna come out of this um but you have federal law enforcement agents are planning to carry out a quote unquote large scale immigration enforcement action in the Los Angeles area before the end of February according to an internal government document reviewed by the times the operation which would be spearheaded by us immigration and customs enforcement will focus on people who do not have legal status in the country or uh who already have pending orders of removal according to the document which was circulated among some federal law enforcement officials this week although immigration operations have been ramped up across the country since president trump took office no sweeping actions have taken place in LA the city trump repeatedly criticized during his presidential campaigns ice did not respond uh to a request for comment um now dhs secretary christie known she blasts the FBI so she immediately comes out and says the FBI did it she tweeted this out actually she says uh the FBI is so corrupt we will work with any and every agency to stop leaks and prosecute these crooked deep state agents to the fullest extent of the law now it's weird okay because she's automatically accusing FBI of doing it all right um ice sources they told fox news they do not know where no one got the information or what she is basing it off of um they said they reached out to the dhs for comment they didn't immediately hear back the FBI had no comment on the matter so i don't know i mean did it come from FBI did it come from ice where they're taking turns and who fucking leaks it i don't know but here's the truth is a fact it's coming from somebody i think she is making an assumption based upon the history of what's been happening for the last 20 years okay there's no secret that there is a large percentage of the FBI that has been conditioned to follow orders instead of serving the position that they're supposed to hold and the people of this country okay what you know i i i think she's making an assumption i mean i think there's really good FBI agents i think there's really fucking compromise once too yeah i mean who know i think they might take turns you know like i expect the ice guy probably call it FBI god damn did you we were supposed to be leaking that did you get uh oh there's corruption everywhere i know this we don't need them and we don't need we don't need much of this shit like like but like but i'll do it for 500 bucks a person i mean if you let's subsidize that shit that's what i'm saying we wouldn't be without that we huh sign a little waiver if you get killed you can't sue can't sue i'd fine with that yeah you know i i bro listen i i don't know where exactly where to go to where they go home depot to pick up truck no no what huh those listen we got to focus on the the criminals mm-hmm we got to focus on now it was just that was the easy pickup that you know no you know got it building a house down the street guys i got i don't i did i i get it dude i just i'm just like so angry at at the condition of where we are with everything and to think that we've paid and like when i think back like for me what i think about is like dude i've been doing this 26 years man like every fucking day i've killed myself to become to build these things these companies that employ all these people and i think about like how much of my life was time has been taken because of the intentionality to make it as difficult as possible on me when i've done what i'm supposed to do as a citizen i've built things that benefit other people they also benefit me they also benefit my family but they provide careers and jobs and incomes and they take care of the community and i spent my whole life doing that and to think that these people have taken half of my money the entire time and want to not just personally but from my company too people don't understand that right pay taxes with your company and an individual as the owner and stole it and spent it and like dude i don't look at that like that's a little deal like this is my whole life bro you know what i'm saying i just in all these little concessions that you've had to make for your family you know oh we couldn't order that or we couldn't eat that kind of food or they couldn't play this sport or they couldn't do this dance class or can't do this fake couldn't go on this vacation so that these motherfuckers could steal it like bro this this is not left right black white gay straight this is none of that shit bro this is them and us i don't have any fucking empathy or sympathy because i think back of the pain and the fucking work and the mental anguish that i've had to go through to do what i've done so far and when i think about how much easier it would have been without that it bro it burns my fucking ass no you think about the guy with the fucking gas station topping off with eight bucks that's what exactly the guy we were talking about the guy at the gas station topping off at eight dollars because he do this guy's out there working with his hands he's in the cold he's in the hot his family's probably home his wife probably pissed at him because of how like it's total destruction of the quality of our life dude for no for no other reason that these people are just greedy and they think they're better than you and i and bro that that is the reason for a revolution that these people trump has to hold these people legitimately accountable or there should be a revolution where the people do yeah guys jumping on this conversation man let us know what you guys think down in the comments uh with that being said let's do a final segment we got thumbs up or dumb as fuckers we're bringing a headline in we talk about it to get one of those two options uh so with that being said our thumbs up with dumb as fuck headline reads he's got spunk here's what happens when ashnots ejaculate in space how much do we pay for that how much that costs us how much that nut cost bro it wasn't it wasn't 50 bucks like you know like we guys heard of semen we got spaceman yeah dude call that space jam this space jam all right motherfucker like what is this an experiment where this dude just whipped out his unit and did it in front of all the other people up there for science so they can measure it for science i bet they did i bet they did some weird ass shit oh this information could really come in handy let's hear randy ashnots may find themselves in need of a little sexual relief while touring the galaxy but when a rocket man can no longer keep those inner passions pinned up the release of his bodily fluids and zero gravity makes some out of this world motion so say a set of scientists uh quote let's talk about spunk said sexpert as may lewis james per trending tiktok quote in space added astrophysicist mathu agnew and the collaboration clip dedicated to space cadets and ejaculation talking about getting freaky in the final frontier is a dirty job but someone's got to do it interest in space sex has been peaked in months uh owing to sanita soonie williams and berry butch willmore ashnots of the international space station you know they've been stranded out there um but the two uh they're you know they've been stranded in the great beyond indefinitely um apparently we're supposed to be trying to get them back but um a while uh while solar systems insiders claim that interstellar intercourse is not possible the pros uh say it would be difficult to enjoy the dew due to a lack of stability in the high skies but should a male moon walker find some time for a little self pleasure james and agnew say the outcome of an outer space orgasm are otherworldly uh quote what will happen of a man's rocket blasted off in space ponder james and the not safe for work nasa inspired video um which is the mast over 24,000 views so far quote when a man ejaculates in the vacuum of space how fast backwards is he prepared oh uh exed uh uh and james revealed the goopy answer via the conservation of momentum um it's a fundamental concept of of physics uh the concept states that total momentum bro how much money was spent on this a lot they measured how fast the dude goes backward when he comes in space they didn't measure it they estimated it looks like oh it calculated it yeah um but the concept states that the total momentum of two or more bodies in a system will remain the same that means that the mass multiplied by the velocity of the ejaculated will equal the mass multiplied by the velocity of the man um and uh and to prove that he wasn't just jerking viewers around um agnew and james did the man man juice math um they they calculated the average volume of space spunk approximately one teaspoon huh that seems shy other old oh now I usually get at least like table spoon you measure it I mean I'm a cook so I can eyeball I would say a teaspoon sounds on the very low side it does sound yeah you need to drink some liquids bro that doesn't sound right no it doesn't sound like a lot no um and it's density has a one gram and the average speed of ejaculation is 45 kilometers per hour I didn't know that it's pretty fast um I don't know if it's faster or not I mean if they're only putting out a teaspoon yeah that probably I mean they're probably in the lower performance category of speed as well um I think the speed probably has to do with how strong your I wonder if it's the the cable thing muscle is the cable thing muscle kegels kegels oh kegels oh yeah you know I wonder if it's like strong kegel you can yeah you know I'm saying I wonder if there's like differences by race you know I'm saying like you know historically statistically I'm faster than you right I faster how like just speed like 30 or zero fucking chance you're faster I said statistically statistically I'm faster there's zero chance and I just wonder if it like crosses over yeah you probably come with one stroke yeah you're probably way faster you're a young man you're not old man knows how to do it yet who knew we end up with all them kids bro yeah you don't know how to control that thing yep it's a dangerous weapon bro listen we're great you're a muscle awareness great power comes great responsibility um but yeah they calculated the momentum of of of sperm in space said it'd be about 0.000562 meters per second so yeah all right so let's be real the man in the woman are standing this straight in space forever and ever and ever and you think they're not doing stuff she did look like she was not getting any sleep I'm just he looked relaxed well bro they're in like the fucking photo area of NASA anyway like they're not even up there they're just jacking off in the bottom of pool yeah this is what we pay for yeah we pay for these fucking shows to make us think things now they're making us they're telling us don't jizz in space right you know otherwise you're just talking about cool jizz wherever the fuck I want yeah what I pay by taxes I do have a culture question for you uh because like this is something I didn't know um what is it with the socks the socks yeah we're bottom like in it like a white white person thing like you guys what are you talking about going socks I never heard that before you never like the crunchy socks under the bed sounds of me like that's what you do no what do you that's so that's not a thing listen to this motherfucker he's like what so what is it about this gay stuff haha you ever heard of it no sorry I have I heard your people didn't heard your people are the gay ones but tell me about it nothing wrong being gay no just I'm not fuck man all right well guys tell me about the socks we all want to know it's it no it's a thing bro like you guys you the crunchy socks under the bed right like so that's not a thing they say it's it's it's a white it's a white person it's day black well so we're gonna talk about what black people say about why we're gonna talk about what white people say about black people I had to call with them this morning and they were the black council of truth we're curious about the crunchy socks do you represent the black council truth I do not represent I'm just you're a member I'm just a messenger sometimes you're not a client and the president no listen you're just part of I'm just I'm sometimes they kick me out the room I got a call yeah really dude like you're not in touch with it that's it yeah my my security cleanses so you can get in the lower level meetings of the white and the black councils exactly but you can't get into the higher I'm trying to create unity in the world I get it that sucks so you guys are owning up to crunchy socks for them no okay I'm saying like if you were in the higher levels you would understand what the truth is but I understand why you think what's that's what you're supposed to wait what's the truth well I can't tell you because you're in the you're not VIP I got you know I'm gonna call the white council and ask them something so what is it we pop eyes we should we should have a segment on the show where you call the black council one day uh-huh and then and then we'll call the white council ask them all right I'm not with that I'm done with it I'm not with them are picked up by Joe we get Joe you know Joe too Joe see what we got on this man I would say we probably paid 10 million dollars for that study um I'm guaranteed at least 10 that's being very conservative yeah yeah yeah all right I mean listen you gotta go when you gotta know man like so you know if I decide to jack off outside the space station I don't float the fuck away I was thinking I was that was really stressing me out this morning yeah how would they get me you know I was dude I'm glad they did this study because no fuck do you know I know not to do that the more you know yeah the more you know does Andy that's all I got man all right guys don't forget these people have been stealing all your money for your whole life and thinking telling you to work harder and harder harder so that they can fucking spend it on stupid ass shit like studies on how much you you're gonna go across space if you bust them out in there so just keep that in mind when you can't pay for your kids shit and uh have a great day don't be a hoe show this show in the cold bad bitch who did you roll got a own bank row can't fold does a no here shot case
