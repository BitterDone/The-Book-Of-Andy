Q&A apps where we get people to come in and sit on the show with us today I have the legend in the entrepreneurship author success personal development space Mr. John Gordon sitting in with us what's up bro ending ready with you dude this is awesome it's awesome to have you here man we've been trying to get this together for a long time June yeah shit I think longer than that I think we've been talking about it for a couple years now on oh yeah definitely it's good to have you here great to be here so what's going on man I'm visiting your place it's incredible like just blown away by this place by your customer service your people like how you do everything is unbelievable and you know when you're not very smart you got to do shit right every time yeah that's that's what it comes down to you know people people give us a lot of credit for being intelligent but I think I think the key to ultimately to success in business is doing the things that other people won't do that you know or the right thing and I don't know any other way to do it you know you do the ordinary things with extraordinary consistency commitment yeah focus and discipline that's what I've noticed like yeah that's what the best do the best are always doing that ordinary stuff but but they're so focused on it and that's what I've noticed like everywhere you go everything is clean yeah everyone's putting the right place yeah we don't have a cleaning crew bro like our people clean it wow yeah so so a lot of people ask how we get everybody to do that how to buy into that um you know what I found and you probably realize this too I mean because you've you've coached everybody bro I mean you give talks and I mean every major college every major professional team in the world you guys are not familiar with John Gordon he's an absolute legend when it comes to anything personal development I'm how many books have you written now 28 yeah 28 books I mean this like we're talking like one of the most influential people so for you guys who are young that may not like know who John Gordon is you should go check him out and read his books because a big reason of you know why people like me are even doing the things that we do is because of the work that this man has done previously in his life but you understand that you know teaching people what they're getting out of the process is is one of the most effective ways to get people to operate at a high level right because we all think about what's in it for us naturally as human beings and when we could teach people you know like people come in here and they look at the sink in the bathroom you're like man it looks like no one's ever used to sink well we wipe the sink out after we use it so it looks that way on purpose but why do we do that well we do that not because we want John Gordon to come in and see that the sink is wiped out we do that because we know that every single time that we wipe out the sink we're actually attributing and accumulating more discipline to our own standard right it's making us better same thing with the weights in the weight room a lot of people like how do you do when people you know what do you do fire people that don't straighten their weights well yeah if they don't do it like three or four times but initially usually people buy into it because they understand that you know that little attention to detail makes them better at what they do and if they're better at what they do they have a better life so I think a big part that a lot of coaches miss with people especially when we're talking about performance is tying it back to how it benefits the individual not just hey you need to do this because this is our standard right most people are selfish in their way well we all are yeah everybody is we all look at look dude every single human on the face of the earth that says you know oh I'm a completely selfless human being anybody who says they're completely selfless they're fucking gonna take something from you they're they're your money is gonna go from your pocket to their pocket all right yes so like be real careful because the truth is we can be selfless and we can understand that to be ultimately selfless we have to be selfish and get ourselves right first this is why you know when the airplanes going down they don't they don't say they put the mask on everybody else they say put it on yourself yeah um but you know I think it's a balanced there right like we've got to we've got to become aware of our own selfishness and then and then work intentionally to be selfless understanding that that's what ultimately creates the life that we want and how you do one thing is how you do everything yeah for you so you go to Clemson football I've worked with them work with the Rams right they're focused on all the details you're people being focused on the details in the bathroom with the sink also says they're gonna do that in their jobs yeah you go to a restaurant that has clean bathrooms okay you probably can figure out the kitchen is probably gonna be clean too yeah but you know that's dirty yeah restaurant yeah you're like okay I may not want to eat here yeah yeah for sure man yeah that's good yeah I think John I think so we we were talking about this before the show started by I think we are for first met you was out at Ed's event and was in North Carolina yep I think I'll refer you to the camera yeah he's best for our first met you oh shit I forgot about that yeah yeah yeah that was right after my shoulder surgery yeah right right after right after yeah that was where I brought the axe mm-hmm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah almost the almost didn't let us on the plane with it yeah that's right but I think that's why first measures that's I it's been awesome good to see you again yeah yeah yeah this is awesome culture yeah I'm a student of culture yeah I teach culture but I'm always looking at culture I work with in an out burger one of my clients mm-hmm I got a great culture yeah you can't make a hamburger unless you work there for a year yeah yeah really you have to be there for a year before you can make a hamburger and then you have to be chosen to be a hamburger maker so it's like an honor to say I want you to be a hamburger maker and you're gonna print us under me it's like it's a big money right well that makes sense that's the product man you know like it makes sense that you would you would build value around the the the process of making the most important thing right that makes a lot of sense to me what's your going on what's new with you man so I just wrote a book called the One Truth so I've been speaking about that you know oneness and separateness everything comes down to oneness and separateness are we divided and separate you get weak when you're divided and separate or we want connected and strong so it's all about that so I've been speaking a ton like going non-stop from place to place doing a lot of events speaking got a number coming up but it's been crazy just the amount of events I've been doing speaking yeah yeah so well that's an appropriate message especially right now culture right now yeah what do you think of culture right now I think I agree with you 100% by the way every yeah every is that everything that you are well you know I loved there was a time maybe about a year ago when we were we were talking we met we were talking and I said you know during COVID I stood up against the mandates I stood up against cancel culture and you know it was a big risk for me and you said no the fact that you believe it was a risk is wrong you believe that it actually has power that's wrong that really stood out to me that made me really think cancel culture only has power if you give it past correct and that was a huge lesson for me that you taught me in that moment I'm like no it can't affect you unless you believe that can right so you got to be bold yeah you got to take a stand so I'm huge on principle I'm huge on integrity I'm huge on leading the right way doing the right thing and so what we see now with culture we see a lot of people doing the wrong things we see a lot of misinformation we see a lot of lies there's evil and evil will always lie to you and then make you feel like you're the liar yeah and that's what's happening right now so the people are standing for truth are being told that they're the liar no we're not the liars we are speaking truth so yeah I love that you're taking a stand I think more people need to yeah to address what kind of culture do we want to create in this country yeah like we have to get back to what we stand for that's what made America great everyone knew what we stand for and I think today people don't really know what America stands for and you have to get that so diluted yeah freedom like we stand for freedom and if you stand for freedom then everything we should do should be about freedom and individual responsibility and your individual rights so when things happen where they try to take away those rights where we more and more see those rights are rooted that's a big deal in culture today so so for me I'm a big on individual responsibility individual ownership but also leaders doing the right things that is in the best interest of people so I don't see that happening a lot today what do you think on term like I agree with you on cancel culture you know cancel culture can only hurt you if you stop that's where it hurts you you know like people come to attack you and then you just stop doing whatever the thing is that you were doing apologize yes dude that's where cancel culture will get you guys if you just show up the next day and start saying the same shit again they're gonna come at you again except the next time they come at you it's less and less and then you show up the next day and then they come at you again it's less and less because bro these people want these people come at people for the reaction they want the apology they want they want the the crying video they want the oh my god I'm so sorry for saying what I actually believe that's what that's what is for yeah okay so if you never give it to them eventually they go find people that are gonna give it to him wait did you call him racist yet that they didn't work yeah that doesn't work bro like I could defend my arguments like and I think that's a big part of it too is that a lot of people are so uncomfortable defending their positions because they don't understand their positions that they can't fend off any sort of criticism like I'm aware that not everybody like I don't expect our audience to agree with everything I say when it comes to what's going on in the world but I I am very comfortable standing in front of someone who ever it is and having a conversation about why I believe what I believe and if you make a great point and I say well I that's a good point then think about it like this is called being like a good communicator you know and if you just communicate with the intent of solving the problem versus the intent of being right now you're in a situation where I think conversations can be had and so that's what I'm trying to show people man I'm trying to show people that like hey you could have stances but you can also be open to other ideas and when people come at you that's okay that's the way the world is right now but if you if you stop that's where it hurts you and I think a lot of people you know they they think that like oh my god they came for me and they ruined my life no you ruined your life because you stopped doing whatever it was that you were trying to do and the reason why they're afraid yeah so you asked me about culture what do I say I see fear yeah people are really struggling with fear anxiety chronic worry chronic stress and we're not meant to go see life that way living that way and you can see how people feel more and more separate when it comes to that you know the root for the Greek word of anxious means to separate and divide and so when you feel anxious you feel separate and divided so these people feel divided they feel anxious so fear is taken over their life we have to get them back to that wholeness yeah they're not healing that oneness that power like discover the power that you have like when you look at the world if you believe that the world has power over you that actually lowers your state of mind and you actually approach this world in a very timid week way when you realize that you have the power to change your circumstance to define reality to create the future then that oblixture state of mind and allows you to actually approach this world in a much more powerful way I think I think you know most people out here and you travel the world bro you're all over the place I mean when I go when I go in public which is rare I really don't go in public that much but when I do I don't see this division in real life no like I don't feel it in real life like when I go when I do go out into an event or or see people or you know even go to a sporting event occasionally or whatever like this shit doesn't exist in reality it only exists on this phone and it's continuing to be stirred and stirred and stirred so that everybody can be at high levels of emotion and then react to whatever the distraction might be and it's very clear to me the manipulations going on but man like DJ and I we talk about this all the time dude like winner when do you think people are going to wake up to like oh shit I'm being made to feel this way intentionally like when is that going to happen because that's what's going to be required for us to really get things back on track to even have a conversation of what America stands for you know if we're consistently reacting to every single crisis that happens and these crisis are happening every three or four fucking days now okay we just had you know we have the Middle East situation now we have this shooter situation but like has anyone else noticed this is 2020 the amount of crisis has increased tremendously at the rate of speed the lag has got this wasn't like this pre-2020 like we didn't have a situation where you know some major single three days we had this national division divisive crisis on the internet and like dude a lot of it comes from like and I you know look I'm gonna call how I see it but a lot of it comes from you know not just the progressive left a lot of it comes from the conservative influencers too because they're selling fucking shit on the views and the like that's their whole purpose right they don't have a business they don't have a career they weren't relevant before 2020 and now they see it as their way to you know monetize themselves and so they sensationalize the propaganda think you look under the under the pretext that they actually care and like people have to start getting real like these people who look at every single headline that comes down the pipe and say holy shit look what's happening oh my god and then they fucking tell you buy my shit these people are doing it they're these people are just manipulating you in a different way they're they're getting you all hyped around something that you care about and then trying to monetize it when in reality bro the manipulation mechanism is the same emotional manipulation stirred high emotion and then a call to action and I can recognize this because I'm a fucking business guy right but like most people can't see this shit and dude when I see like what's going on in the world man it's just a massive marketing campaign geared towards us but the marketing that they're selling us is misery and anxious and depression and financial hardship and you know being unhealthy and I don't know man like I'm I think the internet like real talk like I think the internet is a net negative for humanity I think the world was better before the internet completely better and I think there's been a lot of good things I think you know there's money to be made there's connections to be made there's some good things I'm not saying there are some good things but I would say and I would be curious what your opinion is on this as somebody who's lived pre and post internet era I 100% would give away everything I fucking have everything I own everything to go back to that life before the internet every bit of recognition I've gotten from it every six everything it was a better life that's my because it was the cost bro you don't even know what it's like yeah well I do a lot because I'm not broke you don't know you know you know you can afford the internet you don't know it was totally different people were different it was a different thing like this whole thing where people go on the internet and just berate people and and try that never happened in the real world dude like these kids growing up in high school right now where they're getting called out on the internet and bullied on the internet from being different or weird or whatever that shit like dude and when I was at high school that sucked right like you you you have to walk through school and you know there was people chirping and talking to shit now the shit's all over the internet bro like everybody sees it your parents see it their parents see it the whole schoolteacher see it like really think about this what that does to people like growing up is hard enough man you know when was the last time you went somewhere and had a real conversation with someone that actually meant something and made you feel good about people you know like I just I don't know and I know it's not we're gonna go backwards but it's just it's like I'm mourning for it because I'm like mourning the way of life before the technology and like I don't know part of me wants to like I really think I will get to this point where I completely unplug everything and disappear from the fucking internet what's your take on it the media is the bible of the fearful and too many worship it yeah and that's a problem the thing is social media just magnifies and it reinforces the separation and the division that's there like there's always been a little division and there's always been comparison there's always been jealousy like when you're a kid growing up and your neighbor got a new car you were jealous of the neighbor that got that new car or the kid who was the cool kid in school got the new outfit you know the new clothes and there was jealousy now there's a thousand cool kids online and you're seeing it every single day so the jealousy was there the division was there the bullying was there it was just in person I fought a my neighbor at all the time yeah like I had to never for it oh yeah maybe stronger yeah I was beat up for a wild and eventually you started doing it and then and I was able to beat up my neighbor and never beat me up again yeah but I dealt with it my dad was a New York City police officer yeah you know I'm to cover narcotics so in our neighborhood we battle we fought yeah so those were challenging times like that's not happening today and that way now it's online now it's bullying now it's rumors and gossip and all this other stuff but with social media like we often blame social media but it's really not social media and I actually wrote about this in the one truth it's the fact that we're looking outside instead of inside and there's an evil there's a force always trying to make you to look outside instead of inside to look at your circumstances to look at others to look at the opinions of others and to actually look and think that that has power over you just like cancel culture so the key is you should be able to look at social media because there are times you probably look at it and you're in a great high state of mind you're you're feeling great you're positive and it has no effect on you whatsoever you like this is a bunch of crap move up move forward yeah and other days when you're in a low state of mind not feeling so great stuff's coming your way you got a lot of clutter you're looking at that social media and it really bothers you what you say yeah and so the key is to recognize it and we have to teach kids this because kids are always looking outside it's why so many of them are stressed and anxious because they're not living their life from their purpose their passion what they're meant to do they're looking at everyone else and they're like and then they feel inadequate and the more they feel inadequate they then retreat from life and they don't have the boldness in the faith actually take on life so this is I think that's a great point when you're teaching and when I'm teaching I think it's the same thing like you have the power to take on this life yeah you're not meant to go through life fearful anxious and stressed you're meant to go through life with power and peace and joy and confidence and courage and this is how you need to go through life so we got to share with kids the truth that this media crap has no power over and I think that's where we have to get to like where people recognize like this media is a bunch of liars and when the media lies democracy dies when the media lies it affects everyone and when we look at we look at social media I actually think it's a good thing because if we just had the media and not social media we would never have the dissenting voices yeah think about it would be literally like propaganda russian tv which we have now but at least we have the voices to counter it right now so I agree with that point but here so that we that brings up the argument of is ignorance bliss right right because because we yes because we have all woken up to the amount of propaganda yeah because the propaganda has become stronger because there has been dissenting voices so when when before you know the internet was really a thing the they kind of let us live our lives in peace right and yes you know they they did all this dirty shit but we didn't get it pushed down our throats all the time we were allowed to like function in society properly and since the internet's come along it has created dissenting voices which has forced them to create new techniques to control those dissenting voices which we end up with a situation where you know now I mean you know it's kind of the discussion of like is it better to know or is it better to not know I'm happier when I don't know yeah that's like I'm happier when I didn't know what was happening because when you were a family gathering and you're talking about this yeah for those who don't know they're just happy going about their life they have no yeah understanding or realization that their rights are being taken away yeah they have no understanding that they're being lied to they don't see what can come into the future though they haven't studied history they're not looking at other countries like we do we know we can come here and I'm very concerned what can and may come here if we don't take a stand that's where I agree with you 100% on that and I think most people are waking up to that fact of a lot of people some are still into Niles some some don't see it but you're right ignorance is bliss because I was a lot happier when I didn't know but it's about finding the joy with the courage to take it on and say you know what I do know this is evil but how do we beat evil always with truth yeah and with good yeah see I don't have I don't have any joy in it you know what I mean like for me this is total obligation I people have people have a hard time understanding that the reason I do really have the way I do it specifically the CTI stuff is not because I like doing it it's not because it's fun it's because no one else has the fucking balls to do it okay and also I recognize that you know my boss can't really fire me right like you guys who have bosses and you gotta keep quiet I'm speaking for those people and it's it's very fucking it's a very large burden dude like it's it's very bird it's very tiresome it wears you out it's emotionally draining and so I often find myself in this situation where I'm asking myself is it worth doing and it goes into the discussion that we're having right now like is it better to be ignorant and live in the dark and let these people just do what they do as long as we get to live somewhat peacefully or is it better or is our time and our our historical relevance okay this is gonna sound probably arrogant and egotistical but like I oftentimes think like fuck bro this is what you were meant to do you know you were meant to fight these fucking people and beat their asses and get everybody straight on what's going on in society and you know I have a lot of things that would make me to say why that's happened to me you know when I look back over the course of my life and I think about you know me getting stabbed and what I learned through that and then my business journey and then like you know it's just weird things that have happened like I ended up living at a pret former presence property you know shit like that right I don't I can't have kids you know like there's all these things and like people say well how's that play into it well like you know if I had kids I probably wouldn't have the courage to do what I do you know what I'm saying so it's a it's this constant battle of like is this why the fuck I'm here or should I just go live my life and let these fucking idiots sort it the fuck out like it's just a hard it's just because you could take the easy route if you really want to and not deal with any of this dude this is the thing I don't know if you saw I did a day in a life episode on YouTube where I showed my life because I come on here all the time and I'm like guys I don't think you understand like I don't have to do this you know what I'm saying and ever since the day in a life episode which has been a week in a day I've gotten thousands of messages from people like holy shit you really don't have to do this I'm like yeah I've been trying to say that guys like I care about this shit I care about you I care about your fucking family and all I ask is very simply that you share the message or speak up or stand with me you know and it's just like for three and a half years man we've been getting beat by these by these manipulation techniques in the media and these these criminals and it's like fuck I'm just waiting for everybody to like get so tired of it and stand the fuck up man like we could beat these people very simply without violence by just standing together and saying hey no but we have so many of these little people inside the movement who are willing to like capitalize on it for their own self gain as opposed to like working towards a real solution that nothing ever gets solved because we're always infighting it's like look at look at the situation between Trump and DeSantis right Trump and DeSantis the people the people who like DeSantis hate the people who like Trump and vice versa they hate him and dude up until DeSantis decided he was gonna run for president there was not that division everybody was like Trump and DeSantis and now you have this part of the of the community like legitimately eating each other up and like guys for what like do you not understand like if you don't understand that whoever wins that primary you need to vote for to get us out of this mess so you're telling me you hate the other guy so much you're gonna vote for fucking this guy you see what I'm saying like we have to have some more common sense thinking and conversations and and and by the way I'm a political I'm voting for the better out passable outcome I don't give a shit about Trump or DeSantis I care about fucking us I don't know man I think I think a lot of things it's just you know it's interesting as I was walking around your place and going on the tour that actually came to me that thought came to me like and he's built this he's had the skill the ability the persona the boldness the faith the confidence the courage like everything you have I said he's been brought to this moment to be a voice for our future like I had that thought as I was walking around you just said that which is really cool like I have no doubt that God will choose people along the way that will fight for freedom and individual responsibility because there'll always be a force trying to oppress you want to hear something crazy dude so when I pray at night always through when I was a kid I always told God I said if you if you help me I promise I'll help other people and what I think is happening now is like I'm having to repay that debt now sure time to help people that was my prayer too God God provide for my family and I will do your work yeah and for me that was like impacting people positivity I thought that's what it would be for me too but I thought it was like hey I'll just share what I know and help you guys win and all this stuff and now it's become this whole other thing but who can do what you do that's the thing like I had a lot of people could know but NBA coach had a star player come to the NBA coach and constantly complain about the other members of the team they're not this they're not that they're not this and the coach said if they were that they'd be you and that's why you stand out and that's why you're a superstar and so we wish other people would do it but not everyone can I believe they could all be bold be courageous but they also can't do what you do in the way that you do it I can't do it the way you do it I'm a fighter but not the way you're a fighter so it's it's different but I've also made the stand and I my wife and I've talked about this like as the future comes depending on what happens in the future like we will take a stand yeah like we will take a stand for others it may mean we lose everything but we will take a stand for the future of this country we do have kids but for their future and they like my son loves your stuff like they they think that way like yeah we know that we're in a fight for the future of this country and also for the moral fabric of this country yeah and what we need to create going forward together so so but it can be done again I'm all about positivity like positivity doesn't mean weak positivity actually is strong because you believe the best is yet to come you're going to take the actions necessary to create the best outcome and you can be positive and fierce so like I feel like I'm positive but I'm competitive I'm fierce yeah so I believe this is the way it should be so let's make it so so sometimes when you get down or reminds me of a like some of the coaches that work with at the top level he's like these guys allow the burden of the jobs yeah to bring them down but what I remind them of is that love cast out fear so anytime you start to get fear or down you're allowing the weight of everything to take hold that's actually what the enemy's trying to do to keep you from your destiny and keep you from being courageous to say I'll just give up yeah screw it I'll just give up right right but no but but when you when you love the battle yeah and you love the competition and you and you love the ability to take on this challenge just every time you start to like get frustrated just remember I'm gonna love this battle and love that I get to do this dude it's such a sick thing that's gonna get you to a higher state that's so sick dude because I cannot quit right like I can't quit anything like it's it's so good in some areas and in some areas it makes my life fucking torture bro like I feel what you're saying man and I take it to heart you know I appreciate your sharing that because that's helpful for me to think about it's helpful for me to know that that other people feel that way you know what I mean big time so anyway you know how the show works brother so we get questions from the audience and then we try to answer them so you want to know a secret what yeah I got some goings for you all right they always does get into it man guys 80 John question I appreciate that bro like that talk I'm glad I'm glad I'm actually glad we had it on the show for people to hear yeah I really like that dude yeah that's real shit man yeah thank you yeah well John 80 question number one uh recently I was told that I am not spontaneous enough and that I require a rigid timeline for myself which impacts others as I self reflected I suppose that's an accurate assessment I have raised my four children I've been a teacher for 17 years so to say I function well with strictness and time management is an understatement my question is how do I know if what I thought was a strength may actually be a weakness how can I distinguish between having high standards for myself versus being too rigid for those around me that's what we've got on this is it keeping you from what matters most to you and what will make you be your best so if it's keeping you from that if you're being rigid if you're not making time for relationships because you're focusing on your routine more than your relationships then you're probably being too rigid but if it's helping you get better helping you improve if it gives you the freedom to actually do what you love and also to be your best then that routine and that rigidness is actually a good thing I have found on my journey though I've allowed the routine the schedule to get in the way of what matters most and so at times I can allow that to the best of me and I don't bring out the best in me for others so that's how you would know. Well would you I mean would you say that there's like a period though like like you know because I think like the conversation of balance right like that's a big one especially for younger people but like would you say though that there is a phase of your life that you have to go through where there is not going to be this you know quote unquote balance that you're going to expect to have like there's going to be working years in your life where hey like listen some things that do matter on the grand scheme of things they can't really matter right now in this moment or in this phase of your life yeah I don't I don't believe in balance in life I believe in rhythm like you'll never find balance anybody who's pursuing greatness or a company like this and building something amazing will not have balance in their life there's a season for everything so the key is to find the rhythm in your life of the seasons so like my family we find our rhythm where July and December things slow down and that's when we find time to really spend together but I'm not having balance in the course of my day I haven't seen my wife in about seven days you you you an ad both do that so well you both you guys are great friends yeah great friends people I if people didn't know and John are great friends and um I'm talking about am I right uh you guys do that so well and I admire that about both of you I I feel like when it comes to the balance thing I think it depends on when you ask someone what they will say uh what answer they will give like if you asked me my first 10 years of business if there was balance I would laugh in your fucking face I would be like bro you're insane and honestly if you ask me that right now because we're in a position where we're leveling from a mid-size company into a you know a small large company um I would laugh in your face so I think it's important for people to recognize that if you're in the beginning of the journey and you're talking about balance bro you're not going to make it it's impossible it takes too much to get something started what if you're starting something and by the way this could be your career it could be your your uh two hundred pounds overweight it could be a business it could be an organization it could be a charity it doesn't matter if it's new balance is gone if you want to be competitive real talk okay you're gonna have to put that time in you're gonna have to put the reps in you're gonna have to put in the struggle that is a requirement now if you ask let's say uh you know let's just take a famous athlete right like uh if you asked come right Kobe Ryan okay well co-rides bad example because he never got to live his other part of his life now that's actually a good example because how I look at balance is over the course of a life right like how I break down balance and how I break down my life is so different than what like most people think of when they think of it I think of life in 20 year chunks and then I think of inside those 20 year chunks I think three to four year uh like spurts and then inside the three or four years I think of one year as four quarters of a game okay and and I I use live hard my live hard program to operate to produce the most during that one year so when I break down how I frame out how I look at life it's I don't think people look at it like that I think most people kind of like look at their balance as a day right super micro yeah like do I do I did I spent enough time with my kids today or did I did I get some time for me today and dude you're gonna go years without that time I mean that's just reality if you're trying to build something great so when we think about balance I found a more realistic way to look at balance is over the course of life where you're gonna have seasons where you're gonna have to go all in and it's not for a week and it's not for a month bro it's for years this is real shit like if you want to be anything it's for years that creates some financial freedom you get a little bit more uh you get a little bit more freedom and you get a little bit more balance and then there might become a time where you have to go again and you know then it's all in again right and so when we look at balance especially from a beginner standpoint I think it's a very very very bad thing to to to expect that you're going to have it at all it's not reality and when we see all these people on the internet saying that that's what they're after well if that's what you're after and you're trying to be great as something that's a no-win situation it just is so you know I think it's I just think it's important to have the proper expectations you know if you want to be a regular person a regular Joe and earn a regular income and by the way I'm not judging I'm this show is predicated on people that want to be great at things if that's what you want to do then balance is probably achievable on a daily basis that's something that you could probably do um but for the rest of you guys you trying to hit that when it's not reality is only going to make you feel bad about yourself it's only going to make you have less confidence you're going to feel like shit you're going to feel extra guilty because you're not giving yourself to these other people that probably would like to have it and and to have the success that you want to create that it takes times of of of actual selfishness where like I am this is what I'm doing and this is my priority and this is what I'm going to go after and everything else kind of like is what it is and those are the sacrifices that it takes to get to get I mean dude like we're in a competition this is where people fail to realize about like this is a fucking competition like there's always shit on the internet about oh my god I'm competing against me yes that's true that is true you are your biggest competitor however inside right behind right yeah right outside that competition is a real competition where you're competing against real human beings who are trying to do the same things that you're trying to do all right and there's only so much room for the winners so this idea that there's an endless abundance and endless winning and endless being the best is not actually true okay now is there abundance yes but you have to compete very hard to have it and these are just things that like 25 years ago dude were common sense like this was common sense bro like I was taught this growing up and like I say this to young kids they're 20 years old and they're like what do you mean what do you mean not everybody can I'm like bro how many Super Bowl winners are there a year there's one how many MVPs on that team of the Super Bowl there's one how many MVPs of the league there's one sports it's so bizarre to me that society has gotten so off track and all these other areas of life in terms of understanding reality of how they work but yet every Sunday they will watch the NFL and then they get this mirror image of how life really works which means the people who put in the most work who work the hardest who become the best get the biggest fucking paychecks and are the champions they're watching this exact metaphor for how life actually works every Sunday and then turning around and pretending like it's not how that works balance yeah how many of these NFL guys that are how many of these guys are balanced bro these are young men who are literal warriors bro they're putting on arm or every Sunday and going out and trying to kill each other these dudes are not balanced bro these guys are coming out saying everything I do everything I eat everything I train everything I read every single thing in my life is geared towards this battle that I'm trying to win and that's your life dude and that's what people can't understand they want to believe it's like this fluffy nice thing and the internet you know when I say what I just said they get so pissed off and it's like okay well show me you guys to get pissed out pissed off show me what the fuck you've achieved show me because I know I'm right I've seen it a thousand times this man coaches some of the best coaches in the world some of the biggest fucking names in the world dude am I right yes okay like this is how it works man like there's no other recipe to it's it's called natural order it's it's the reality man it's this is why bit lions who who are or are at the top of the pride eventually get eaten by the younger lions this is how it works there's nothing you can do bro you get old you can't do the shit no more and they kill you that's a cycle of life man the only goal that you can do is to be the baddest motherfucker for as long as you can be until someone takes you out that's what the game is yeah I don't know I don't know and then when you're successful you take care of those who can't take care of the time and you help the old lion yeah you know what you try to do you build a sanctuary yeah but what you what well the good that's why the goal if you're in business is to become so big that it's late you from that you know others always they will take your shit you know so that's why rhythm is so important not balance because when Andy saying it's so true because if you see that and you try to achieve balance and you're not you're now feeling guilt and shame and I meet a lot of women out there who work in the working world and they have this guilt and shame because they have kids and they're not doing enough at home then they're not doing enough at work and so they have a double dose of guilt which is a double dose of misery bro I did your life when you live that way right I get it too because I can I watch all these people on the internet who aren't me who aren't doing what I do talk about how balanced they are and how perfect they are and then I look over and you know here's me and Emily and everybody I care about like paddling the boat as hard as fuck I'm like holy shit bro I'm a fucking tyrant like like you know what I'm saying like but but then I got to remember we're on a different path than those people are on and we and you can't feel guilty for choosing the path that you're on trying to be the best at it it's what you're focused on what your mission is what you're to do I asked my daughter my daughter's 25 now did I travel too much because I was gone a lot when my kids were young speaking all over building the business building my name you know what she said that I don't remember you gone I remember when you were home because when you were home you were so engaged with me and with with cold my son you were engaged you were present and I would go to her lacrosse tournaments again July December November slow times but that's what they remember so I want people listening to know everything Andy St. is true you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna bust your ass to be successful but at the same time rhythm might be I work six days and I have that one day that I engage with the family to take that time for them it might mean I work two weeks straight and then I have that day it might mean a month where you know what hey family I'm building this right now we got a product launch I'm not gonna be around but after this month after the launch let's make time to do this this and this and then you do that that's how you can actually make it work for you but the greatest of the greats they call it a dark side of success because it'd be truly great you have to sacrifice and there has to be a cost that you're willing to pay to actually be great at what you're doing I mean I was writing every morning when I was writing my 28 books and I still write that's a morning cost every morning to write that I'm not spending with my family and I'm writing but my kids saw that and now they have a different spin a different understanding than other kids who grew up in a different way it's not really a sacrifice either though dude because you get something out the other end right that's what people forget there's not a media yeah like dude yes some things are gonna have to not be done or you're not gonna be at the thing or whatever it is but there is something that comes out the other side and you have to remember that that's coming and that's going to happen if you continue and like dude the guilt thing is a big deal for me because I get caught up in that sometimes right the internet has become so touchy feeling and cultures become so touchy feeling that even like somebody like me can get like in my feels a little too much and start feeling guilty but every time I do I remind myself dude I'm on a different path I'm on a different path I'm on a different path and that person that asked that question you're on a different path so don't feel guilty for that what this is because you got some friend or some friend saying you need more balance look bro real talk and this is this is gonna hurt some feelings but every motherfucker I've ever known in my entire life told me I needed more balance and half of those motherfuckers asked me for jobs okay so real talk okay so there's good things that come of being on your own path and being committed to it and just because you're not you know sitting on the internet with your you know meditating and touching the grass for seven hours a day and drinking fucking you know kombucha yeah like and not showering like just because you're like actually being a productive human being is that something that you should feel guilty about you know it's real shit yeah I love it man guys giant question number two all right guys I quit my job in April and I started my own landscaping company and things are going great with that being said I keep having days where I feel like I'm on top of the world and then the next day I feel like a total fucking failure I understand that it might take years before I can say that I am getting it going but my question is at what point do things start to level off and how do I get myself to that point quicker no man I'm the wrong person you know I'd be lying if I fucking sat here and DJ knows these guys here know too if I were to sit here and answer this question and say oh yeah right here at this time this is when you figured out and everything works out great and you know I never had that prop like bro I'd be lying to your fucking face like there are days where I feel like I could fucking legit run into the White House and impale these motherfuckers and conquer the world bro and then there are days where I like have to scrape myself out of bed like that and those days usually are back to back I don't know maybe we're bipolar bro I don't know but I haven't solved the puzzle to that yet that hasn't I have not entered that season of figuring that out about me I am very hot and cold I am very streaky here's what I figured out the way I've been able to manage that about myself is to be committed to a structure where I know I'm building momentum even if I don't feel like I'm building momentum this is why I love the live hard program so much because even on those days that I wake up and I feel like I've had to scrape myself out of bed and I start to have that negative self-talk where I'm like fuck dude you're you know you're a piece of shit which I gotta something to say about that too but even on those days I can look back and be like what are you talking about dude for the last 68 days you were fucking literally perfect like nobody's doing that so like that having like actual evidence to back up what I'm what I've been doing and taking action in my life when I feel those low days really helps a lot that's a big thing for me it's also important to know that there's an ebb and flow to thought so there'll be days that you feel very positive and there'll be days you feel negative I call it high state of mind and low state of mind and so a high state of mind is characterized by a lot of clarity a lot of focus a lot of positivity a low state of mind a lot of clutter a lot of anxiety a lot of stress a lot of worry one day you're in traffic and it bothers you the next thing you're in the same traffic and it doesn't is the traffic that's making you feel a certain way yes no can't be because this morning actually yeah no if it's the if you think is a traffic then the traffic would make you feel the same way all the time yeah during the pandemic some people struggle during the pandemic other people thrived people blame the pandemic it wasn't the pandemic it's our state of mind when your state of mind is high the circumstance happens and you rise above you move forward when your state of mind is low same circumstance happens and it really bothers you it affects you in sports you make a bad play low state of mind you're thinking oh man what I do revved up thinking and then now you think something's wrong something's broken and now you're trying to fix it high state of mind you make a bad play like let's go next play so it's all our state of mind and I would say you have these highs and lows states of mind yeah which defines how we respond to the situations so the key is for that person is stay the course that's a part of growing a business there are so many days you feel like you're not building anything and even now when you have success you still feel like you're not doing enough you still feel like you can do more the best always realize that they've never arrived at the door of greatness like like no I've never arrived I gotta keep going if the minute you think you've arrived it gets slammed in your face yeah and so that high state of mind is so helpful for people because the key is to realize you're in a roller coaster and when you feel like the roller coaster is going down what happens is you want to jump off the roller coaster you want to give up don't jump off don't escape too many people escape they do drugs they drink they play video games why they're trying to avoid the low state of mind that they have this feeling they have it's a discomfort a lot of discomfort so what you do is you stay on the roller coaster and then what happens is you write it back up and you're going to have this for most of your life yeah high states and low states and then when you realize this though and you realize it's not the circumstance it's not the traffic it's not my company it's not my status what happens is instead of these highs and lows that are very steep it actually becomes more more you know equal more you know leveled out yeah more leveled out and then that allows you to move forward a more powerful way where these events these circumstances the situation my business doesn't affect me I stay the course working with the Miami Heat one year they start out 11 and 30 they finish 30 and 11 what happened they stayed the course they stayed positive they stayed connected they didn't allow this circumstance to define their mindset they kept their mindset going and then their circumstance basically was the result of their mindset I love them I think there's a lot of truth to that dude I explain it a little bit different way you know I feel like when times are the hardest is when you learn the most and I feel like when people opt out of the hard times what they're what they're actually doing is denying an opportunity for growth and a skill acquire acquiring a skill that they wouldn't would not other I actually just did an Instagram story on this yesterday where I was talking about how the ultimate skill set to have is grit and the ability to not quit because in my in my life the only way I've acquired these skills has come through the the dips right it's come through the hard times where I wanted to quit and every time we push through one of these times where we want to quit not only do we in acquire a new skill but other people who are on the same path as us they do quit all right so the more times you can push through the hard shit the more skills you acquire the less competition there is so you end up in a position where you get more and more and more skill and you have less and less and less competition and this is what the the importance of endurance and pushing through actually is it's a strategic tactical great play to run because after 20 years of that you end up on some mountain that you climbed and there's nobody else around and not only has nobody else climbed it you have all this wisdom and all these skills that none of them were able to acquire because they quit and so like dude when I look at entrepreneurship and I talk about you know I think about the most successful people I know dude the people think they make up these hard stories right like oh you got to have a hard story to tell on the internet no the reason they're successful is because of those hard stories that actually happen to them and you know and I've had millions of conversations about this like over the years where business is going up and down and up and down and up and down and and here's the thing that I think makes your point you're saying it a different way but I agree with it 100% is that you know I don't think it ever for me I never saw it as like it gets it gets more leveled out but my ability to handle the things that would normally mess other people up becomes much more much stronger right so like the bumps that do come like like where I'm at in life right now right like I get these calls from people I know and they're freaking out about so I'm like what's what's the problem dude that's not a real problem right you know what I'm saying bro dude just do this and this right that's not a real problem right so just someone it's a mountain but you see it as a hill because you've been through so much of it right so you become conditioned to the the normal ebbs and flows that happen and even when it's moderately bumpy it feels pretty smooth it doesn't really feel out of order until it gets real bad you know and so that's part of the mental conditioning that you have to have is an achiever you have to be able to push through these hard times but you also have to realize that there is a legitimate tactical advantage to grit there's a legitimate tactical advantage to being mentally resilient and tough and showing up and giving everything that you have especially on the days where everybody else quits like those are the biggest wins everybody thinks the biggest wins are the trophy or the money or the house or the lifestyle that's not the biggest win bro the biggest win is that time where you almost quit but didn't because without those wins the other wins are impossible to achieve and so like let's give ourselves some credit about the real wins here the real wins is when you'd rather do anything else than what it is you're supposed to do and you still do it that's the biggest win you could ever have as a human being at least that's my experience that's so good that is so good because adversity is your partner in growth and I think back to my life you know I opened up restaurants I second mortgage my home 20,000 thousand credit cards to open up this first Moe Southwest Grill franchise we were the first Moe Southwest Grill in Florida fifth Moe's in the entire country we had everything on the line and we were barely hanging on by a thread but that taught me that made me stronger yeah that helped me grow when I became a writer and speaker the energy bus was rejected by over 30 publishers yeah my first book that book is now sold over three million copies but rejected by 30 publishers but I had the grit I didn't accept rejection I kept going kept believing everything you've been through in your past makes you stronger for your future and I know what you said because you don't see the mountain you see the hill yeah because you've been through that at one point they looked like mountains yeah but now they're hills for you yeah and so good you go and so adversity is your partner in growth and also adversaries are too rivals are negative people are we often don't realize that we should get rid of negative people when you face someone who's negative when you face a rival I always ask you have a rival in high school oh yeah okay everyone had a rival because your rival made you stronger we all need a worthy opponent my good friend has a book coming out about that the worthy opponent helps you grow and if you don't have the worthy opponent you're not going to be who you're meant to be and God gives you worthy opponents in your life to sharpen you and to make you stronger throughout your life dude I'm laughing because like you know you've heard the story that Grover tells about about Michael Jordan kind of making up his enemies oh yeah you know so like you know I don't talk about this publicly anymore because it was just too fucking ruthless and it got to the point where like people like legitimately didn't want to be around me because they thought I was like a fucking crazy person but I have a list of people in my head that I fucking hate I fucking hate them and and they might be great people they might be awesome people bro they might be the nicest people the best people in my mind I fucking hate them and I want to crush them I want to burn their fucking house down I want to eat their fucking food at their fucking table bro like I fucking hate them and that drives me so much as a human being but like I can't talk about it no one gets it you know what I'm saying like Michael Jordan pitch of this like sweet old little grandma like she I don't really hate that like if I saw him in person bro yeah it would be all good it's just like I operate in that space so well it drives me so well it's such a good driver for me because I'm just an ultra competitor so like when I get to a certain space where I'm feeling complacent I have to start adding to the list I'm like all right I'm like crush this on the fun and they don't even know like they don't even know they don't even know they're on the list yeah like they don't even know I'm like all right one two three four five I'm going to fucking annihilate all of these people and I don't do it by attacking them I do it by going out and winning in my own way and like you know it's it's funny because like I never talk about it anymore because people think it's crazy but you know Tim told me that's Tim Grover who who was Michael Jordan's trainer and had been a mental coach of many many high-level people a great friend of mine huge mentor mine too you know he told me that story about Michael like making up shit that people were saying to him like he he'd be in a game dude and somebody would be like coming up to defend him and he'd be like what the fuck did you say oh man what did you say and the guys like what he's like I fucking heard that bro like dude like dude I just do that in my own level man it's dark side energy bro and like certain people are wired for it and I'm just to me for me personally that is the most powerful energy like the most the worst thing you could do to me as someone who competes with me is talk shit about me say one fucking word bro like I'm the guy that like you hang the headline in the locker room and I will literally destroy myself to fucking win that like it's just what it is no man and I I here's the thing DJ almost every super high achiever I've ever met in my life is the exact same way they can say all this positive I might not say it out loud that's right they might not say in a person they might not be willing to admit it but every single killer that I've ever met even the ones to smile and you know you think are the night bro these people will slit your fucking throat in their mind they will dude I love it yeah I love it man doing what I do and you said you're great case study I mean I've listened to them this is like I'm like this is fascinating to me as a mental coach yeah and works on mindset I'm just as I'm saying that I'm thinking yes that's true killers yeah killers but as Michael Jordan happy in his personal life now no that's what I'm saying you have to draw a box around it right it can't be real right you know what I mean like it's got to be this thing that you kind of come compartmentalize when I was younger it was real right like it was real shit now it's like this thing that I build in my mind to fuel me you know like when I don't feel like doing something I'd be like oh so you're gonna let and I'll fill in the name you're gonna let that motherfucker win now we'll get the fuck up bro like it's just what it is when they do the documentary and Andy it's gonna be a ticket personal yeah it's very personal that and that's like that's true it is what it is dude I'm not gonna sit here pretend it's not like I'm fucking low but here's the thing in real talk I'm thankful for those people I respect those people I am thankful for them because of what they provide me and fuel and there's been a number of people I'm not gonna name any names who over the years I've actually become really close friends with who were at one time on that list for me you know what I mean because like I I value what they've provided me and then we'd be end up becoming friends right maybe you rivals yes and you were competing in many ways against but you're really competing for yeah because they made you better in the long run yeah and you made them better right by running hard you know love that man well guys John Andy R. Third and final question question number three hey guys in a management role how do you find the balance of mentoring your subordinates or employees while maintaining professional boundaries context we have made it a priority to cultivate a company culture where everyone feels supported and is very family like I know there is a balance of being interested and knowledgeable about each staff members personal life to a degree but I find it at times their personal drama or struggles are boiling over into my life but when they say that something in their lives is affecting their mental state which in turn affects the productivity and urgency and work I feel confused as to what to do please advice I'm a big believer in love and accountability you got to have both and you got to set the standard like this is our standard for our company for our team our department we have the standard and I'm going to support you coach you encourage you and love you along the way but we have a job to do like we're here and we're getting paid and we exist because we have a business we have a company whatever it is a police department we have a role in responsibility for what we're here to do and we can't let outside forces get in the way of that so we know and we set the clear expectation that this is what we're about like we're here to work together like NFL players they become friends but they're also on jobs right and they have a job to do but their friends coaches and a player coach loves that player but guess what that player has to perform that's where they're gonna get cut yeah so you got to perform you have a responsibility to that job and do that role but I'm gonna love you along the way so you make that very clear up front and caring about someone and being invested in their life doesn't mean that they should be bringing their drama to you that's where the boundaries get crossed because your job is to come to work every single day and be your best and bring your best now if you have personal things going on your personal life and so forth starts to affect your mental health obviously you want to have services and you want to be able to provide solutions for that so I'm not saying you're not caring about that person but at the same time when that person's complaining or constantly bringing their personal drama and that's not your role as the manager or the leader to be dealing with that like my team knows like don't bring me drama bring me what's going on your personal life just had a baby death of a loved one we're gonna we're gonna support you we're gonna be there for you but don't bring me your drama that is off limits and that's not allowed because that hurts our performance it hurts our mission and we're here to do a job I don't think a lot of people realize personal I agree with everything he said I think culture as a whole has somehow made people feel like that every single person in their life must accommodate every single ebb and flow of their life and that's just not reality reality is exactly what you said we're here we have a mission we're here to be great at it and whatever is going on in your life if that fucks that up I'm gonna have to put someone else in there because if I don't I'm letting down the other 400 people here all right so that's a reality that the workforce has to come to terms with for the last 10 years we've had this situation where everybody's touchy feeling and everybody's extra you know caring and kind and this is the thing and they've forgotten while that's a good thing performance is the thing that drives everything else and so when we think about you know let's just say in somebody with a career if you're someone who brings every single thing to the office that happens to you no matter how good you are at your job you will be passed over over and over and over again for opportunities because your leadership clearly understands that you are a cultural issue okay you're a distraction to everybody else and so for practicality purposes I think it's very important that people realize that while your leadership and while your managers you know at any level may accommodate and deal with because we care about you your issues right that will actually cost you opportunity without you realizing it because when it comes time for the promotion or the advancement or the opportunity that part of it will be taken into place even if they don't say anything to you about it at the time yeah you know so like if you have three people that are equal candidates for a opportunity that you have in an organization and you have you know two of them consistently bring their drama or their gossip or their problems or any of the shit those people will stay right where they are regardless of their performance and the people who don't have that baggage will continue to move up and this is a reality of any organization if look let's talk we talk a lot about the NFL let's talk about the NFL combine okay the NFL combine is a literal display of your actual physical skills how fast can you run how agile are you how strong are you how tall are you how much do you weigh do you have any injuries and then they have this other thing basically like a character test okay and then they evaluate what were all the things that this person did when they are in college what kind of drama did they have with girls what kind of crimes did they commit what kind of distractions were they for the team and every single NFL draft there are players that are amazing like this highly talented maybe the most talented players that do not get drafted because of the excess baggage that come with them because teams understand what that damage can do to the organization and your superior and your team no matter where you work they understand that too and this is an unwritten unspoken thing that people should be aware of you have to create boundaries not only as the manager and and the leader but also as the the team member like you like when you want to vent and you want to bring that shit you just stop and ask okay is me bringing this stuff gonna come up later is this gonna hurt me later because if it is it's probably best that you handle it and not bring it now if John says like what John says like if it's a death or it's a real thing or someone's house burned down or they're facing a real tragedy that's different we're talking about gossip and drama gossip and drama are for the weakest individuals in society those people never win and the reason they never win in spite of what skills they might offer is because the people who are the gatekeepers to their opportunities understand the collateral damage is created with that baggage so this is something that like all of you guys who are entrepreneurs who are in a career you should really examine because a lot of people get passed up over and over and over and over again for opportunities and they can't figure out why they have great statistical numbers they they do everything they're supposed to do and more and they and but see what they don't realize is there's three other people doing that and those two of them aren't bringing the other stuff so this is super important for you to be aware of and it is reality it's not bullshit this is not just the way I think this is the way any leadership thinks even if they're not transparent with you about it which usually they aren't because they're trying to be caring and empathetic to your situation so yeah I mean dude you just can't do it like it's not reality and it's a love tough you love your team you love your people but then you earn the right to challenge them and if I love you I'm not going to let you settle for anything but your best I got to hold you accountable to our standards our culture our values our principles and how we do things and if your performance is suffering from our standard then we have to talk about it and I have to coach you up or maybe at times let you off the bus going back to college like in today's where we're seeing kids get upset when a coach coaches them hard but these great coaches like that's how they coach and it's how they get the most out of some of these kids now the best coaches love their players they do love them but they also challenge them and so you're watching the game at home and you see a coach be hard on a player like oh what's going on that player knows that coach loves them but now that coach is being hard because that player is doing something that's hurting the team so you got to make sure that you're not hurting the team and like Andy said if that one person is actually affecting everyone else it doesn't mean you don't care about them you care about everyone else because if you're constantly acquiescing to the person who's the problem then that means you're actually allowing that person to sabotage everybody on the team in the organization and what's signal are you sending to the people who are your actual winners what what what signal as a leader are you sending to your team to all these great people on your team who show up every day and do everything they're supposed to do without causing any problems when you're giving the attention to the person that does what does that tell you what does that tell them it tells them that if they want attention from you what are they going to do okay that's how they're going to get your attention and now you have a problem that replicates itself through a culture cancer exactly so this the these are the intricacies of leadership that people don't think about you know a lot of people they get cut from a team or fire from a job and they're like well you know that's not fair well from your perspective it feels not fair but from the leadership perspective they're looking at the four hundred other people that they have to look out for their families their kids their their futures and you're you're you're standing in the way of that right and so like dude there should be some that's not fair it's not that exactly dude that's not always two sides to a point you put leadership in the positions after choose to deal with your bullshit or effect like that's not about that they never think about that bro and then when they get fired or cut or moved on the what do they do they go on the internet and fucking boohoo they don't tell the other side of the story that they were a fucking problem here you know what I'm saying like dude this is this is a big problem going back to the first topic of conversation and culture we have moved for we have moved so far away from reality that we now operate in this make believe land that that is so worked that if you've just choose to operate your life in the real structure and the framework of how things work which is natural order okay the best win the they win the most they get the most they fucking earn the most they eat the best they have the best fucking lives if you're the best that is reality bro that's reality if you operate with inside that framework you're gonna be fine if you operate in a this other framework where everybody you think everybody cares about your shit dude real talk most people are waiting for you to shut the fuck up and get out of their office because they got real shit to worry about that's real shit and like dude you know people get upset when they say that because they think that work has become some sort of therapy session it's like dude we're a team we're that we're the we're the we're fucking Clemson bro we're trying to win the national championship every day like does does Davos we need allow people to come in and disrupt this team culture or does he cut them does Nick Saban allow people who come to practice because the girlfriend broke up with them and dropped seven passes in a row to stay on the team no this is reality performance dictates success your feelings do not so can you perform in the face of your feelings can you perform in the face of hardship can you perform in the face of tragedy can you perform when the last thing you want to do is perform if you could build yourself into that person you will have no problem succeeding if you're anything else it's going to be real rough simple rule no complaining rule you're not allowed to complain unless you come with a solution yeah so get rid of all toxic complaining complaining complaining rule I love that man that is a great rule I love it man well guys Andy John that was three yeah John thanks so much for coming on the show man
