It's yeah I mean then everybody comes to your house and they give you a bid and You know Man, they're watching when you were at a little when you were at a little normal house that the bid was you know $100 but now they come to your house and they're like odds $10,000 you got the special AC system that's right Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then you got to argue with them and be like what do you think I'm fucking idiot? Because they think you are because they those people think everybody that's rich is stupid. Yep Yeah Here's a fucking here's something for all you guys that do a Age of Agnashay anything that has to do with given bids Rich people are rich for a fucking reason and it because they don't know what the fuck's going on So just remember that when you think you're out smart and all right and by the way A lot of times they won't say anything they won't argue with you. They'll just They just won't call you back. Yeah, and then I'll tell everybody what you try to do What's a double S war right because if you do push about oh you know you being cheap rich guy like you know No, that's how I got here. Mm-hmm paying attention my money. That's right. It's right anyway. Yeah, not that's real man Yeah, yeah, what's going on? Well guys, I got a little nostalgia here for you. I figure this would This this first little intro topic would be closer is it pizza? No No, it's not pizza. It's almost. Yeah, I mean it's in the city you guys like you guys have maybe all seen like pizza hut has these like retro locations a few of them. Yeah, that are like when you were a kid you would go into pizza hut and Anybody my age understands what pizza hut was all about bro. Yeah, like you would go in there Joe You know you go in it red cups Red and white checkered tablecloth Personal pan pizza book at stickers fucking flat table Pac-Man like it was all it was they were awesome Every Friday now you went to pizza. It had a smell Anyway, no the smell was good. It was a good smell. Oh, yeah, yeah, bro Well anyway, they got some of these pizza huts and I thought we should for one of the day in the lives Do like a road trip to one of these pizza huts to the old school So DJ could see what it was like because he didn't grow up in that era. I'm down bro That's the guy long as I can use the same interest as everybody else Well, you can't they got a different they got a different water found Well fucker. They'd that one though Well, no, I mean similar to the pizza though. There is there is something else. It's a little nostalgic for you I'm sure you always this what you're gonna you'll relate to okay. Um, you got a well uh, aol to discontinue dial up internet service I didn't know that they still had it. Yeah, bro Yeah, yeah, so the aol the company previously known formally as America online is discontinuing It's dial up internet service after 34 years. Well, we'll shut her on September 30th meaning the associated software the aol Dialer software and aol shield browser which are optimized for older operating systems and dial up internet connections will be discontinued Observe is provider settlements internet website You had I mean dude, I feel like that's one of the things like everybody had fucking every yeah, I mean yeah Everybody cuz that was it. Yeah Yeah, there was no high-speed internet bro. It was you plugged into the phone line That's crazy Yeah, and you could hear it like dialing up like it would go ah And then you it would show up and then you would go looking for boobs That's a fucking fact through story. Yes Oh shit, and you can't call anyone while you're online. Yeah, no one could interrupt your booby searches. Oh, man Yeah, that's wild. Yeah, man So Granny falls and fucking breaks a hit and you just there's nothing you can do. I'm looking at boobs Sorry, Granny You're gonna have to call someone else So that's why the life alert thing came that's right. Okay, yeah, okay. Yeah, things are making fucking sense I'm falling Okay, get up It's cuz a little fucking grandson strolling fucking boobies. That's right Bro, that's fun. Boobs used to be hard to see. Mm-hmm. That's a big problem in the world right now. Yeah, too easy to see Right like it used to be like you had to like Yeah, I mean, but you had to like do work to see some boobs now you just go everywhere and see him and like nobody's motivated get any better That's just wrong with society. It is I mean this is not joking. It's real dudes used to have to make money and then have to get jacked and then have to develop a personality all So we could see some boobies and Once the boobies came you know to where you could just see them People stop trying. What am I working for and you got all these girls being like Why are all the men suck? Well, I mean because they don't got to try for anything So I said you have to find a friend whose dad had a mag stash. Oh, yeah, yeah bro. What's a mag stash magazine? magazine stash We had a neighborhood area where like everybody knew where they were Yeah No, there was a chicken coop and it was in the rafters of the chicken coop. I swear secret location. Yes, everybody knew where they were Under dad's bed bed was the pile of mags. Hmm. Can't see all these guys know. Thank you Says boobs are so easily accessible that even the dudes are showing them off. No shit, bro Yeah, dude some of these dudes because they don't got to try any hard. They got better titties in the girls. Yeah, geez, man. What's that like? You Yeah, man, all right. Well, yeah, AOLs out Um, I wonder how many people are still using that though like it can't be many. It's probably a lot of old people. Yeah They probably think they just send emails and shit bro. They probably think the world's ending like what are they gonna do Yeah That's crazy, man. That's crazy. Yeah, I just saw that thought that was interesting, man But yeah, let's get into our crew ladies and gentlemen I remember as always if you guys want to see any of these articles pictures links videos go to Andy forsella.com you guys can find them all link there for if they if they cut off the supply of boobs Men we get jacked they would get rich and the world will restore order if you if you made it hard to see boobs You're illegal to punch people in the fucking face when they get out of line The world would correct itself. See, I'm gonna I'm gonna believe I feel like put not like online pornography should be illegal personally Well, I mean is that a statement that you're going to back up or you're just gonna be like a lefty and just say shit No, yeah, no, I mean, I think I think I think the I mean to your point is the accessibility issue that I have it's bad for society Yeah, you know what I'm saying? I'm not knocking any of the girls that make money or whatever bro Like you got to work within the system that you're given to fucking do it for sure Listen, it's whatever it is, but I'm telling you this it's bad for men It's real it's probably really bad for women too in a different way They don't even realize it, but it's bad for men like it is it it removes ambition Like real talk bro every successful person when they started off Every successful successful man when they started off whether they want to be an athlete or a fucking entrepreneur or Whatever and they all want the same shit Okay, and this is when you start as you grow Your motivations will change because you mature sometimes But every dude wants the same they want money they want status they want cool shit and they want some boobies and bro when you remove the motivation for that That's a big problem for the the natural order of society. Yeah, you know what I mean and and we see women complain about it all the time They're like Man, there's no good men anymore. There's no good men. There's no there there is They're they're just not as many because a lot of the ones that would have become good men or now just sitting at home jerking off Right, they're not out trying to make money because they can get by and they don't care about their appearance because they don't really got to leave the house and You know, they don't really care if they got to attract a mate because they have unlimited supply in front of them. You know like it's I Mean dude. I think it's all a plate. I think it all fits into the play I mean, I know we're joking and but like if you really think about it the big picture puzzle piece of it It's just another control mechanism. It's another it's another defanging of What would otherwise be a formidable opponent in the American male? You know what I mean? No Like if you if you remove the drive lower the testosterone through chemicals in the water in the air which is fact mm-hmm Demonize masculinity Which is fact Remove men's motivation to make money become fit You know become sexually attractive If you if you do all of these things what are you left with you're left with Exactly what we're starting to see and see prevalently in society which is I mean I was at the gas station yesterday and I mean dude like I looked around and like every dude and by the way This is this was me in 10 years ago But I looked around bro and every fucking dude was fat as fuck Every one and then every girl looked almost just like him. Mm-hmm. You know what I mean and it's It's just destructive and it you have to you have You have to create a situation For control where there is at least amount of resistance possible and if you look at everything through that lens You can very clearly see why things are the way they are yeah Yeah, well, and they also hit it from every angle like you said to it's like it's not just in one facet of life is about every single fucking angle Yeah, of course every angle they're hitting you from all their Why do you think why do you think they make it so morally superior to be poor Right like I had a dude tell me this weekend who's a big uh I guess you know Jesus a new found Jesus person. Oh, those are okay. Yeah, you know like there there's there's people who who are You know Pete they have their PhD in theology right for they spent 20 30 years of their life studying God and religion and different religions and then you know people Find it for the first time and all the sudden They're an expert they know everything they know what's allowed they know what's not allowed They know all the rules and they're an expert and they're on social media talking about God 247 and like There's just a lot of misleading information that comes out and I was told this weekend uh In an off like in an off Not in a insulting way, but in like it was off putting to me somebody said well I see you're still chasing material stuff And I said now I caught all the material stuff Hey Pokemon, yeah, I fucking piss, but like the point is is like They they you they weaponize every little angle that they can to make people feel that there is a noble superiority in being less and dude that's all for control. Yeah, all of it. Yeah, so my son the one of the comments Like that's by design, bro that's no shit. Yeah, bro, but but dude it you have Once you wake up and see it. It's just you can't unsee it. Mm-hmm. It's everything. Yeah, no we we living in it can we live in an entire environment that is not conducive For men to be men to be successful strong fit healthy intelligent contributors to the family and to the society We live in an environment that is intentionally created to remove all of that so that it can be Deferred to the elite into the state which is one Step away from full-blown communism so you know That's real man guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think And then the chat as well chat Yeah, forget fucking good those are I thought I heard a eagle scream fly by there. Yeah That was a different bird that was a that was a single yeah, that was that was an African ceiling bird He's what that African way ceiling bird ceiling bird. Yeah There we go Yeah, that's freedom right there. I feel freer. Yeah, there you go. No, but yeah guys, let's get it to our cruise man Let's uh, let's get this move in with headline number one um Gotta go to uh, let's go to DC. Got some interesting things happening I'm what big bad orange man is making some people mad. Uh-oh Let's check this out uh trump banishes Obama and bush portraits from prime white house spots and dumps them an obscure stairwell So this uh, this is business people off. I don't really care. It's not that big of a deal Um, but yeah, Donald Trump he uh exiled the presidential portrait of his predecessor Barack Obama to a less prominent position Um out of view from thousands of visitors who tour the White House every day the portraits of trump uh, Trump's other recent predecessors including former president George W. Bush and his father George H.W. Bush Have also been removed from prominent areas of the White House according to a report from CNN um Yeah, so this this came out apparently it's uh, it's an area that's restricted to secret service um, the first family and only a select few of White House staffers um, it's like some back stairwell emergency exit route or something like that um, but that's where he put all of all of their uh, their portraits up. I mean Shouldn't they be like in a wood shipper? There should be an up dungeon So be real all of them not just not just berries, but all of them man But yeah, so I mean that that that kind of started this uh this push coming out of the weekend But it moved to something a little bit more crazy um, Trump takes control of DC police This is probably the one of the biggest topics you guys are seeing right now um moving around He deploys the national guard and his stored capital crime crackdown is what this is being Being held at let's dive into this little bit president Trump announced a historic Escalation of law enforcement in DC on Monday deploying the national guard to patrol the streets and placing the city's police department under federal control Quote uh, we're going to clean it up real quick. So he had his press conference. I got this clip. Let's check this clip Little real quick uh, see what uh orange man had to say about this and worse This is liberation day in DC and we're going to take our capital back. We're taking it back Under the authorities vested in me as the president of the United States. I'm officially invoking section 740 of the district Of Columbia home rule act, you know what that is And placing the DC metropolitan police department under direct federal control and you'll be meeting the people that will be directly involved with that Very good people but they're tough and uh, they know what's happening. They've done it before Yeah, so you have that happening um, that's going on right now Now a lot of people are uh upset about this apparently then this is CNN reporting this um, but the DC mayor and police department weren't aware of Trump's plans uh, that that's coming out Um, that they had no idea that this was going to happen which i have a hard time believing to be honest because of just the logistics of having to handle that There's no way they didn't know or have a heads up But the DC attorney general Brian Schwab um, he uh, released a statement slamming Trump's move says quote the administration's actions are unprecedented Other not They're not unprecedented. There's other times in history this happened. Yeah for sure a few times. Yes actually Um, unnecessary and unlawful. There is no crime emergency in the district of Columbia Violent crime and DC reached a historic 30 year low last year. That's a lie. You didn't report it And uh, is down another 26% so far this year we are considering all of our options and we'll do what's necessary to protect the rights and safety of district residents He said um, and they're already out the i mean You know the the announce became a day, but there's already plenty of local Or i should say federal enforcement that are in the move this video has been circulating online to check this out This is inside of one of the hood areas of DC check this Oh my god Oh, they really hopper now. Oh, that's shit real Hey really coming to your churches ain't jumping out and bagging away is running all type of shit boy with the Oh my god Now of course, it was gonna be some criticism right um, well yeah, of course Uh, they have criticism of it. Yeah for sure um Nancy Pelosi She was uh, one of the first people to open her uh her trap She said posted or somebody posted this on twitter for from the Nancy Pelosi account saying uh quote Donald Trump delayed deploying the national guard on January 6th when our capital was under violent attack and lives were at stake That's not real. No brother. This is real now He's activating the DC guard to distract from his incompetent mishandling of tariffs health care education and immigration Just to name a few blunders first of all That can't be real that's real Everybody knows what happened She's been in hammered. They've been posting the video really in the car On January 7th and also when she's walking into the fucking and she's straight up saying that Yep, she fucked up and it's her fault. I accept the responsibility. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, she's she's been saying I mean all you all you know row these people do everything on Predicated on the idea that people forget about things very shortly and they do They do how many people do you have still pissed off about COVID? They're crimes against fucking humanity and you got people to act like it didn't even happen You know i'm saying and then you have people today saying Look at Trump being a tyrant do do do it. It's it's martial law. What the fuck happened during COVID? We couldn't even go outside You see what i'm saying like bro people forget Anyway, uh, yeah, look dude I'm all about this real talk like We've been talking about this multiple times for many years on the show the cities need to be cleaned up The police need to be able to do their job Criminals should be afraid to commit crime and they're not all right and a lot of people are criticizing this and saying Well, this is the first step to authoritarianism. They're gonna use planet terror with you know to fucking Palantir to you know do they're already using it dumbass Okay, they're gonna track us everywhere we go. They already track you everywhere you go You got a fucking cell phone all your money's digital. I'm gonna do digital currency your currency right now is digital Like all the shit that people say is gonna happen has already happened so That that's the first thing the second thing is I'm all about this bro if if if this is done in a way responsibly where they come in they clean it up they get the fuck out they let the police do the thing That'd be amazing But that takes a lot of trust and this is where my criticism comes in because this could also be the beginning of a permanent state of martial law. I don't think it is but it could be and It's something to watch out for you know, we're all cheering for it right now but Is that a good idea to cheer for it? You know, I'm saying because When happens next time there's an issue What happens next time there's an issue so there's a lot of Very delicate things that need to be addressed here and I would be careful to cheer for this even though I do personally think it's necessary in certain places I think Chicago fucking needs it. I think New York needs it. I think L.A. needs it. I think I think say Lewis needs it and and like dude we can't you guys who don't live in these places You really don't understand they go on TV and they say there's no crime. There's no crime It's no crime. We have DJ and I have covered multiple times that they're not reporting the crime or they're intentionally miss assigning the crime to different races and for us to have a City Like like dude if you live in these cities You you pay taxes and by the way you pay a lot of taxes You can't go downtown without being on your guard You can't take your wife to dinner without being on your guard. Sometimes you can't even do any of that Here in St. Louis do you gotta be real careful or to fuck you though And like dude for the amount of money that I pay I don't think I should be the case and most people are not criminals Why why should tax paying contributing members of society have to deal with any Criminal shit. Why is it tolerated at all? It should not be tolerated at all in society A lot of people like to make fun of you know the Middle Eastern countries But these motherfuckers got it figured out okay. Their punishment is so harsh That people don't fuck around And that's what needs to happen right now we have all kinds of people who are running around doing crazy as shit Because they've been allowed to fucking California They could steal up to a thousand dollars worth of goods and you can't even prosecute them The fuck is prosecute? I mean dude that's the biggest problem that I have with all of this and like see in These these you know because mainly as people on the left that are like against this obviously and they're all like oh No, you know, it's not needed. This is not right. You got Al Sharpton in on this and my thing is like okay like His thing there are problems right And so you have somebody that's coming in saying okay, where is the solution right Although we don't like that solution and so their solution is to just allow it to continue to fester and be the shit hole that a lot of these cities are And that's the solution You know and like it's mind boggling to me because What we're gonna see you know had had Trump not stepped in and again I mean you can kind of see it from both sides like okay, maybe he should maybe he shouldn't but the inner they broke a lot of innocent people are being affected a lot of innocent people are dying getting robbed getting stabbed Homes getting broken into again, can't drive down. I mean you got even the homeless problem in a lot of these places are bad I couldn't you know again. I'm driving down the freaking street and there's two people overdose in the middle of traffic Oh, yeah, you know, I'm saying and so it's like there's a lot of issues and like you start peeling it back and it's like Why why wouldn't they want this why wouldn't the leaders of DC or any of these cities? Why would they be opposed to this? Oh, it's because they profit off the problems They don't want there to be solutions man, and it's like Do decide to me. I think every single person that would be against any like anybody else against it They're not they're not coming up with any actual solutions Well, they're just going to use it to paint Trump as a tyrant and they're going to say he's a authoritarian He's a tyrant. This is unprecedented. Bro Abraham Lincoln declared martial law people fucking loved it You know why? Because they have to deal with no shit. Mm-hmm see the average people the people who obey the laws who do what they're supposed to do Those people aren't going to have any problems with this at all this this this Listen violent criminals got to be dealt with. Well, that's the thing. I mean quickly And like I think that's that my one critique with Trump handling this is like bro whatever the plan is and he's to be put in and putting very very quickly So that way the people do Understand the benefits of his heavy hand having to come in involved in this because at the end of the day bro DC bower Mayor bower Bowser or whatever name is She she wasn't gonna fix this She wasn't gonna fix it. She had no intentions of fixing this because if she did it would have been fixed But no she instituted and and was a opponent proponent of the cashless bail system Like I mean bro, there's so many problems man. It's just like It's unreal Um, it's unreal. Let's see what the chat saying on this because I do have another Another update here in a second. Let's see anybody lives in any of these areas that we've named off by the way I would like to get your guys to the pain on this we got the live chat here Um those guys somebody said I live okay Andrew Mulligan as he lives by DC All right Yeah, let's get Andrew up here. Let's see what you guys to say Andrew what you got bro. He can't can you hear me? Yep. What's up guys What's up dude? How you guys doing? Yeah, man Good good. Yeah, I grew up outside of DC and Northern Virginia and DC Has some very beautiful parts like most cities, but there's a lot of areas where you just you don't go I Mean dude, what should we be doing with these people like what do you think so Um, you never when they brought back the baseball team the nationals yeah They built the stadium in the worst part of the city So what do you think happened? They probably arrested people No, they all moved to the outlying areas So then it just kind of shifted over So it becomes a problem of You know, do we do we provide more opportunities? No people can bring themselves out or no we've been doing that It doesn't fucking work these people don't want to fucking do anything. They want to live off our dollars They don't want to fucking work. They don't want to contribute For whatever reason we can say oh they were left behind by the system Doesn't fucking matter because now they're a disruption and they're harming and stepping on other people's rights So like I feel that bro. I feel that argument. I'm like yeah, dude. What can we do we could we could put more tax dollars We could give better opportunities those things only work for people that want them And unfortunately we have a lot of people in this country that want to victimize themselves and they they don't have any Intention of pulling themselves or doing any effort forever For themselves Their whole intention is to bitch complain pretend that they're here In this situation because of all these other people and that's why they got to do the crime and dude It's just not true like we have to start judging people away from idealistic opinions Or could be's or should be's or should have been or whatever and start dealing with what is and here's what it is We got a bunch of people who aren't afraid of the law who don't give a fuck about other people And the last thing I want to do with those people is give them more shit Fucking lock them the fuck up dude cut off their hands Whatever do we got to do to get crime to stop because We the rest of us the 98% of people that do everything the right way that's What we deserve no we don't deserve to deal with the shit. Yeah our women don't deserve to be nervous Going down in any part of the city by themselves they dude That shouldn't be a thing Shouldn't be a thing. It's so normal right now. I know it's so normal All of this has been normalized in what's supposed to be the greatest country in the world bro And it's not right. It's not right Dude, I and you're out of feel you bro like I mean that's that's the that's the hard thing But it's like you want to have a big heart for these people.

This is do not saw this and I laughed my ass off When I first saw this headline Not because it's funny, but because it's it's it's funny I'm head line number two reads Israel says it killed a Hamas terror is posing as an al Jazeer reporter and four others and targeted strike All right Uh, so a prominent al Jazeer let's let's let's translate this yeah We killed al Jazeera reporter because they were telling the truth That's what happened without even reading it. I already know pro all right like it's like okay All right Let's go on. Yeah, I mean fuck man. Well, come on guys. Come on man. You make it. It's not good Um a prominent al Jazeera journalist was killed in the air strike along four of his colleagues as Israel's military Accused him opposing as a reporter to run a Hamas terror sale a nice al Sheree for 28 year old co-respondent was among those killed Sunday when the strikes hit a tent near al Sheree for hospital In eastern Gaza city Gaza officials and al Jazeera confirmed it quote Intelligence and documents from Gaza including roasters terrorist training lists and salary records proved Prove was a Hamas operative integrated into al Jazeera the IDF said A press badge isn't a shield for terrorism before his death al Sheree has denied ties to Hamas and had his network Um now they called the al Jazeera called the air strikes a targeted assassination and accused Israeli officials of En sightment calling al Sheree for one of Gaza's bravest journalist al Jazeera blasted the attack as a desperate attempt to silence voices and anticipation of the occupation of Gaza um, so this is this is this is wild so the al Sheree the the Journalist he had more than half a million followers on Twitter And he'd been posting on social media just minutes before the strike happened um And uh, and yeah, I mean he he's been a prominent opponent of of all of the the Wild stuff going on going over there. This is an image of him um Over there and like dude it is At what point do we like who has those conversations? Who who who starts those conversations? Okay, like all right Too much Too much Dude listen, they're out of control too much they're out of control listen. They're out of fucking control Okay, and it's all it's all bullshit It's all bullshit. I just feel like it's so easy just to say they they bodies are fucking them Correct. That's what they're gonna say they say that about little kids. Yeah, they say oh we killed we killed 50,000 fucking kids Uh, they're Hamas. Yeah That's right dude. They're they're four Well, they're gonna grow up be Hamas the same thing. They were gonna be Hamas. Yeah, that's right Well, you killed you know a bunch of old people Hamas You you killed you killed all these people with no food and water and no fucking Hamas Like everything's that oh you killed a reporter. Ah, he's a moss Like I think you could just get away with killing people just say Hamas you say it's Hamas. Hamas. Yeah, that's what Trump starts saying dude I got a perfect idea What if all the the violent criminals here in the converse they have to be what if we just called them Hamas they they probably are Yeah, if we just call them Hamas Netanyahu just kill him We wait yeah same same. It's fine. Yeah, it's fine. We got Hamas here man. Yeah, hey helpless. We got Hamas infestation here I Fuck this is sad man. It's fucked up. It's so fucked up I like this one. I got laughed when I saw this just because it's like come on man like nobody's believing that shit, bro Nobody you have a guy well nobody that's not on the fucking payroll not on the payroll. That's the propaganda payroll That's real which is another there's a lot of these influencers out here right now where I've seen him totally fucking switch around because all the sudden dude, you know You know like I've seen a number of influencers have been very critical about Israel's uh, you know situation of what they're doing Who are suddenly, you know pro israel out of the blue It's weird people people I know it's weird. Yeah Very weird nation. I trust anybody dude. No, it's all right too, bro Like how how you gonna trust someone if all the stuff if they're willing to flip their opinion for a couple bucks You know what I mean? That's fucking not cool. No No dude, and then this is another thing another like conversation that were like real talk because I feel like there There has some implications here to to America for sure But it's like, you know, they're targeting, you know Journalists over there that are reporting the facts right and On the ground truths if you will and then like here, bro like there's been some like I feel like there's a steady push That's really going hard and I feel like in a couple of months maybe even within the year, bro Like I'm very scared of our first amendment here being targeted Because of the whole anti-Semitism thing that people so easily, you know Well, look bro, they've already showed that they're willing to pass speech laws for one segment of the population Which is insane right that's insane Okay, so you're gonna pass Anti-Semitism laws so that people can't point out what Israel's doing But you're not gonna pass Anti white hate laws when it's all over the media all over the news and every fucking movie and every fucking commentary You don't say shit about that not that I want them to either way like I don't there shouldn't be laws about that But there should be laws about anything and if there's a law about it, it probably means that there's some truth to it Why is it and they don't want people talking about it? Yeah Yeah, so yeah, I do they're already doing that dude. You don't think they're collecting data on anybody who criticizes Israel or says anything About Israel right now They're dude a hundred percent they're gonna do that because that'll be the set the It's that first amendment it'll be second amendment too Because they won't they'll say oh well, you know, you're guilty of this you're not allowed to have guns You know what I mean? It's a very dangerous slope. Yeah slippery slope. Yeah For sure go down. Yeah, anybody who proposes proposes anti-semitism speech laws is a fucking they're the enemy of this country For real yeah, because and it's not because it's anti-semitism It's because it's anti anything. It's it's against free speech Which is the fundamental foundation of our country, you know, if the whole reason the first amendment exists is so that we can criticize Our government for when they're doing tyrannical shit and uh, you know When we can't do that The power goes to them a hundred percent and we Nothing we can do there shouldn't be any sort of restrictive speech like that The restricted speech laws should exist for things like Yelling fire in a crowded theater or something. Yeah, right right but outside that man, you know Uh, there shouldn't be any and if someone says some wild ass shit Then they should have to suffer the consequences of that shit. Yeah, I think that's the biggest difference is that like because I again I'm perfectly fond of this They did they were okay. There will be consequences. Yeah, they shouldn't be the federal government enforcing those consequences Well, no they they started with a social movement of cancel culture But now that's blown up in their face. It doesn't work anymore Well, and that was also pushed by the hands of our federal government Right, and I'm saying so it's like It's what's one of those things man like yeah, no, you say what you want and you you can have consequences But those consequences should be dealt out by your fellow citizens not by government. Yeah, that's just my that's my place on it Yeah, man, dude, it's a very very slippery slope when you start getting into this stuff and I don't like it I don't I don't like it and I see it a fucking thousand miles away, bro. Yeah, it's not good On the on the is because they also came out and said something about you know in a new statement about taking over Gaza completely yeah going in on foot. Yeah And this is a debate that's going on chat out I would love to see what you guys have to say about this too, but you know the whole You know, I guess the biggest thing right now going is like okay, what is the solution? Is it the two-state solution? Is it a one-state solution? Who has it? What's it look like? You know what I think it is? What is it? I think it's I don't give a fuck solution. I think that's what it is I think it's we got fucking 200,000 fucking homeless veterans in our country. I think it we have crime rates that are unacceptable We have all sorts of tyrannical shit happening in our government and I think that for us for our attention to consistently be distracted and put over into the middle east is ridiculous Period and I don't think it's a dollar should be sent anywhere. I don't think people should be sent anywhere I don't think bombs should be sent anywhere. I don't think we should have any involvement with anything until our shit is straight And our shit is not straight That's what I think yeah, so if Israel's gonna go around and you know fucking kill a bunch of people and do all this shit Then they shut the stand on their own two feet and deal with the consequences of that in that area That's my personal opinion Yeah, and that goes for any country if natural order Always takes care of itself and the reason that it doesn't in these certain situations in the world is because the United States of America has served as the quote Unquote big brother to a lot of these little countries With the idea that we're protecting them because they're little because they're unequip because they don't have the people because because because because because because because because because But in reality what it's actually created is a situation where those little countries go around flicking everybody on the ear and kicking them in the balls Know and they can do whatever they want because big brother United States send their fucking men to go die for this shit And that ain't right and it needs to stop and if all those countries new that we weren't sending our people And we weren't sending our bombs and we weren't sending our money and we weren't doing any of this shit They wouldn't be acting so crazy Because they would know there was be repercussions If Israel didn't have the United States standing behind it the Muslim countries over there would have fucking dealt with them a long time ago You know what i'm saying and At the bare minimum if America wasn't standing behind Israel over there. Don't you think they behave themselves a little bit better Don't you think the strategy be a little different to be better than they would say yeah Hey, man, you know, we're kind of the new guys here. Why don't we make these guys some cookies You know i'm saying why don't we be friends with these guys? Why don't we create a Union of of the Middle East of some sort where we all get along and we all work with each other see that that would be What would happen if they didn't have us but because they have an unreasonable amount of force behind them It allows them to act and behave the way that they do know and that creates more disruption in the world than we need Period no that why do they have So much support from the United States Well, I mean that's clear. Is it forced? Is it forced? It is forced that's why the fucking Epstein list isn't being talked about or forgotten Like it's dude look Everybody knows what's going on. Mm-hmm. They do. I'm back My my thing is bro if you're a country and you can't defend yourself on your own If you can't handle your own stuff you shit Don't deserve to be a country. That's my personal. That's that is the title is always been that's not your belief That's the truth that's how it's always been and that's how it should be yeah, okay and On top of that dude, you know Everybody's on Trump right now saying he needs to fucking release the list Y'all know what the list is y'all know who's on it everybody knows Okay, second of all Let's say he releases the list All right, and let's say The entire world says because the the entire world the average group People don't have the ability to think critically when they get emotionally stirred They don't think like man, you know, there's five of these people doing all this shit We need just cut the heads off of these five people right they think oh well, you know It's all of them and if this were to come out And Israel's fingerprints are all over it Israel will cease to exist which will trigger the Samson option. They will send nukes out okay So when we think about what he says when he says I don't want innocent people to get hurt He's not just talking about the Jewish people. He's talking about all people all right So I believe that all of that will be held into account I believe that it will all come to the surface And I believe that he intends to bring to the surface But I also believe that he understands that there's a ton of collateral damage that should be work to be avoided During that time and that's that's how running something works you don't just come up with an idea And walk out of the office where the idea was made and say we do this right now Sometimes it's like okay, we got to do this this this this then this in order to set the table for that And how I'm reading this from the outside is exactly what I'm saying now. So uh I know a lot of people get upset with that they say you know, well you're fucking Support no, I'm just saying what I think it is I I I would have done it a lot differently, but also I don't know all the I don't know all the things You know like how can you make a decision about what to do when you don't know the variables? You don't have all the information. Yeah, you can't it's all back It's all it's all Monday morning quarterback bullshit and Everybody at this point right now is very guilty of it And in my opinion, you know, I don't give a fuck what's going on there. I don't care what's going on Ukraine I don't fucking care. Here's what I care about when I drive down into downtown St. Louis and and you know I'm worried about getting shot Okay, when I drive when I go to other cities and I see you know uh You know thousands of homeless people and then you find out that a lot of them are veterans and people who have sacrifice that's fucking wrong Okay, the fact that we play pay the taxes we do in this country and that money gets stolen through through the USAID And refundled into people's political programs and eventually pocketed and taken hope that's wrong That should be talked about way more than what's going on in fucking Israel or anywhere else You know, and then everybody's like what are you then you're not a true Christian? You don't really stand with the Bible Yeah, bro, you were jerking off to fucking naked bitches this morning on the internet So don't fucking lecture me about fucking being a good Christian. Fuck you I agree, ma'am. Yeah, I wrote you fucking new Christians Targeting everybody thinking they're better than everybody but not even understanding that that's not even how Jesus lived bro Jesus fucking lived with centers He didn't live with people who judged everybody else, bro You know what I'm saying? And it's weird to me how religion has become this thing because it's this new thing For a lot of people that all of a sudden they're like like bro, I know people I know people who are shitty fucking people who have all the sudden found God and now they're They're preaching on Instagram about you should be doing this and you should be doing it.

What's crazy is is if you do the math They just went from 500 million a year to a billion a year which means their next deal will probably be two to four billion a year yeah Taylor Sheridan does not own paramount okay creator director writer and executive producer but doesn't own anything got you Gotcha, okay. I like it's playing there's playing with sweet. Yeah playing with speed sweet. We got to fly on his plane There's coolers and stuff. It was cool. It was pretty cool. The four six is cooler.

I thought I mean it's fucking amazing bro like look dude Look Dana White All right, he's my business partner. He's my friend Aside from that Aside from where I before I ever knew who the fuck he was One of the greatest entrepreneurs that exists in our time. All right He's just a normal dude. He's got one of the greatest entrepreneurship stories fucking ever the guys built this amazing Entertainment company Which is fuck if not more popular as popular as any other sport mm-hmm. Oh with this dude is definitely gonna be yeah He's probably the most connected human being on the planet everybody fucking loves him and you know why? You know why because he's fucking nice to everybody dude like people don't see The behind the scenes of this dude like Dude he walks up to everybody. He doesn't know in the room and says hey, how you doing? I'm Dana White as if nobody knows it's like yeah, we know But like he just treats people with respect and he's always complimentary and he's always fucking good to people and it's it's cool to see And then he doesn't take any shit like dude What's so we what's so weird and I told him this and it's it's gonna sound It's gonna sound a little goofy, but I don't give a fuck. He's 10 years older than me like I've looked up to the dude in terms of how he runs his business for years and years and years bro and uh The way he handles himself the way he doesn't take any shit the way like he dude he's just I just love fucking everything that he represents bro and to see him get this kind of deal done I mean it doesn't surprise me, but it's fucking awesome dude It's it's into it because I just like seeing people fucking win and I like I like seeing people Who are cool? Yeah, and who are good dudes and who like are also regular You know what I'm saying when yeah, yeah, that's real. It's funny because I thought this like And it's full circle now, but like I remember seeing like when they did the Netflix thing You know, I'm saying they did when they went live on the Netflix and I'm showing the UFC fights. I was one. I'm like man. Wow Makes sense. Yeah, makes sense. They were just testing out right? You know, I'm saying Netflix I don't think nephalic I'm glad Netflix wasn't the move because they didn't do that well on it, but um This is cool, bro. This is cool and like you know I remember the pay-per-view thing being big years and years ago decades ago It did it did seem like kind of like a out of date thing To do and I'm like brother romp the time to change me. It's not just that bro. You're moving into an area where you're gonna reach You know like okay pay-per-view Yes, a lot of people watch USC. There's a billion fans of USC worldwide. Okay A billion that's one eighth of the fucking planet think about that. It's crazy. I know dude. That's crazy. So so If you take this event that has been how much is it 80 bucks? Yeah 80 bucks for the last I don't know however many years And you remove the paywall and now everybody can fucking see it pretty much Now a pair might might fuck this up because they might increase their subscription rate. Yeah, but if they don't What it's going to do is create so much more exposure for USC That the dollars that they generate off of their ads are gonna be exponentially higher So the viewership's gonna go up the fan base is gonna go up The ability for them to drive revenue through ads is going to go up and All of those things together aside from the seven billion seven eight billion dollars of the deal Are gonna be where the fucking juices on the deal. So And I've seen a lot of people you know, they criticize it's oh the fighters don't make it. There's enough money and shit Look, there are fighters that make a lot of money. They all understand the same thing The fighters that make a lot of money understand they got to be graded fighting and they also got to be entertaining Good in and out the ring they they got to be they got to be good at fighting and they got to be graded entertaining and We have a lot of great fighters who aren't graded entertaining. They don't make that much money and then people will say They they were one of these fights. They should be no. You're only fulfilling half of the fucking deal If other people like Conor McGregor have gotten richest fuck off the sport Maybe you should take a slice of his recipe and say I should be a character People root for polarizing characters. They either hate them or they fucking love them And if you are a polarizing athlete you get paid more money You know why you get paid more money because more people watch It doesn't yeah, it doesn't matter if they fucking hate you and matters that they watch you And this is why people this is like a lot of these athletes Fuck themselves because they think like this I'm not that kind of guy. I'm quiet. I'm reserved It's not my thing. I just like to keep well then you ain't gonna get paid as much bro I'm just sorry. You're not playing the game. Yeah, it's part of the game. I play the game Nobody in the WWE that isn't good at talking shit makes money Okay, the rock didn't become the rock because he fucking kept to himself and said oh, I'm just this humble man No, and I believe the rock is humble in real life, but he still plays the fucking cocky character which people love I smell what he was cooking. That's right and dude the these fighters Have to go to fucking brand and marketing school. That's it. Yeah, so just as much time as they put into their skill of fighting they should be putting that into their brand And you know if I was them I'd be like if I was them I'd go to count them Gregor I'd say teach me make me into a character. Yeah, how do I do the fuck am I? Yeah, I tied up on the right like bro All they got to do is go back over the last 30 fuck there. I mean dude. It's the same group as WWE go back through the WWE roster and pick a fucking character pick one Riding riding piper start coming out with your bad pipes and a fucking thing and you know like patty patty the baddie like bro that come out with the fucking eight dudes playing the bad pipes and your fucking skirt and shit and Kick everybody's ass you're gonna pay one money. What's this face makes a bunch of money The dude with the pink afro Sean O'Malley. Yeah, you know, I'm saying it like these dudes make money because their characters, bro So like you know to people that are gonna say that I would say back It's on the fighter to be the product and if you're not a demanded product then you can't make as much money No, that's real man. Nothing too like is I mean yeah, like I've seen the criticism of that but like I also feel too like Everybody this giving criticism like they have not seen the kind they don't know the ends and outs of it They don't know what's the cement for these five of them. No There's a There's for every dude in that fucking ring There's 50 other dudes that are just as good. I didn't make it. So it's not like there's a fucking Supply problem of athletes like when you go to when you go to the NFL, bro There's only so many receivers that can run a fucking four two. Yeah, you know what I mean Like you're getting a spot. You can run a four two Ever now people are gonna get upset when I say this but everybody can fight Every man can fight now they might suck at fighting. Yeah, they might get their asses beat And most people would yeah, right? Oh, yeah, but it's something that One man can do and another man can do and you could take a guy from the u.f. scene You could take a guy that doesn't fight and they can fight Not everybody can run a four two Okay, so what I'm saying is there's a lot more men who have trained and become great And and they're the supply of great fighters is huge But the supply of great fighters who are also great brand and characters is very small. In fact I'm just gonna start this agency Hmm come sign with me motherfucker I don't go shit your deals. I got an in you know what I'm saying and And uh and I'll teach you how to be a character. Yeah Man, that's all that's needed in my opinion, bro It is because people is not just about all these agents are fucking Dorks too, bro like they don't know shit like dude. We deal with agents all the time and no offense But like most of them are terrible. They're they're just jockeying the nuts of someone who's already gonna do it anyway And then they take these people who don't know any business and don't have any acumen And they they convince them that they have to have you to be successful and it's like bro There's a lot of there's a lot of taking advantage of these athletes If they want to get paid for real you got to become a fucking character It's real man.
