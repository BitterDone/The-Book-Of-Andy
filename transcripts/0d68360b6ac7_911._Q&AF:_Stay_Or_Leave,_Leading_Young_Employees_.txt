Let's let's help other people win. How about that? Down with that Q and a f. So let's make some people better today. We're gonna start with the call Get things going nice and easy. Let's give our boy Hunter a call hunter hunter Hunter hunter hunter. I wonder if he hunts You're writing his jokes. I did it for Z. Yeah What is going on he hunts he 100% he hunts What's up dude? What's going on DJ? What's going on brother? Hi, Joe. What's up, dude? How's it going Andy doing good bro. How are you? Where are you calling from? We are from like northern Kentucky since an out of area. I have my wife and A good friend of mine and his wife in the car. All right. What are you guys up to today? We're heading home from the lake. All right brother. He hunt you. Do you hunt hunter? I have before okay, I don't miss once doesn't count as a hunter Exactly. Yeah, I guess that's true. Yeah, just like that time you did that gay shit Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, 50 bucks 50 bucks You know what I'm saying? Oh, it was black Friday was half a 25 bucks Hunter what's going on the door busters? How can we help you not a whole lot So I guess I could just read my question But uh, it's basically I guess I'll give you a background. I work for a plumbing contractor And I'm not a plumber. I'm a project manager estimator. I can't do a little bit everything But uh recently it's been pretty tough because I try to value loyalty and stick around but They've kind of admitted that I'm out of sight out of mind because I'm in like a separate department So I've had a struggle with opportunity because they continue to tell me like I'm too young to do this. I'm too young to do that And it's it's just been trying to decide like what's best for me. Do I Stay doing what I'm doing keep my head down and grinding and hope that eventually like the opportunity comes or Do I try to find another place to go Where I know for sure there's opportunity guaranteed that makes sense. Well, how old are you? I'm 24 okay, so like dudes that were 19 founded the country I'm pretty sure you're old enough to do whatever the fuck you want to do. Let's let's let's be real. I agree. Yeah All right, what do you think you should do? Kind of think that it's it's worth look like I've kind of started looking around and Kind of talking other companies and seeing what's out there. Mm-hmm and I kind of feel like it's not a bad idea to get kind of some exposure other companies and see what they offer and make sure that it's not me thinking wrong And seeing if the opportunity is there you mean like like the grass is always greener types in there Oh Yeah, mm-hmm So let me ask you this dude. I'm kind of Go ahead. No, go ahead I was gonna say I'm kind of leaning towards recently leaning towards staying and just kind of just being completely honest with them and opening up the same like I know This is why you guys make a lot of decisions because of my age, but I mean if you give me a chance like I'll prove it kind of kind of deal Yeah, bro. I mean I was running my own shit at 19 years old Not that I was very good at it, but I mean we got to be bad at things for me good at them Um, yeah, let me ask you this dude. Do you want to is this the job you want to do for your whole life? Yeah, I think so that's the thing like I feel like I'm I've been in I've been in the company a little over four years So like I enjoy the people around I enjoy what I do That's a big deal. I just don't know if I if I've had enough time in it to say like okay This is exactly what I want to do the rest of my life, but I do enjoy what I do Well, that's a huge deal, bro a lot of people do things they hate for money and they end up ruining their lives, so um Yeah, so All right Here's what I would do if I were you I would go to your Your company and I would say hey look I Love what I do I love I love what I'm doing here. I Want to progress. I want to build. I want to be a more important part of the company. I want it I want a career path. I'm 24 years old. I'm very hungry. I Want this company to win What can I do more to be more involved? What do you guys need done and then Listen to what they say and if they say something, you know that Sounds like they're not down with that. I think it's important for you to have an open mind about finding a different career path Because the last thing that you or with another company the last thing you want to do is trapped in some company that's stale Um, and is it wanting to grow or do things? Because somebody else is comfortable. That's not what you want to do. Yeah, all right, so I would clarify that um, I think you know, just being honest with them being direct with them Being professional with them will probably garner you a lot of respect and help diminish that Feeling they have about you being too young Yeah, a lot of times when you know young men Make it known that they've thought about their careers. They're serious about their careers Uh, it garner's respect from the leadership. They stop looking at them as little Little kids and start looking at them as grown men And those things come from honest conversations Um, they you should never be afraid to have especially when it's in terms of your career So it sounds to me like you have a pretty good grasp on this bro But you just need to communicate a little better and a little more directly and I bet with a little bit more communicating Directly these guys are gonna have a little more respect for you, which is probably gonna open some doors The one thing I will say when you first Started talking about this you said something about waiting for the opportunity to come Don't fucking do that, okay? Opportunities are never coming you have to assume they're never coming a lot of people will Wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for an opportunity that never comes The whole idea of opportunity is you have to take it you have to capitalize on it You have to develop the skill set that is needed to capitalize on that opportunity and to be honest dude You're gonna have to break the mother fucking doors down on your own because nobody wants to give the new guy Opportunity they see it As a threat. They see it as you know hunter's gonna take some of this or some of this a mine or some of My hours or some of my salary and the only types of people that that really value Ambition when it comes from young people are the ownership and leadership of the company that wants to grow beyond where they are right now So like dude, yeah, don't wait. That's the biggest thing. Do not fucking wait Go in assert yourself be a leader Don't be afraid because you're young that they're not gonna take you serious They're not gonna take you serious unless you go in and force your way in so That would be the one thing that I would say you know, you need to tweak your thinking a little bit from what you said Yeah, and I've kind of sort of already done that where I've explained to them that I'm not happy with Exactly what I'm doing. I want to do more. I'm hungry. I'm young. I got the time. I got the motivation. I got the discipline And they've kind of sort of brushed it off So I did sit down with a couple other companies and kind of talk to them and And I just don't want to sit around and wait and hope that you know this other company gives me a better offer And then like you said grass isn't always greener. I show up there and I hate it. And I'm like man. I regret that Yeah, for sure, dude. I mean, it's a big decision no doubt the the best bet that you have is to come to some sort of An agreement about where you're gonna go in the company that you're in you already have investment in for sure Yeah, but if they're closed bro sometimes they're not open to that. So you just got to be prepared which it sounds like you are Yeah, and I think it's hard because like you said there uh They're they're exact mindset is they have guys that are afraid to Have somebody trained under them because they think they're gonna take their job or kind of push them out of the way Yeah, well, that's that's a them problem You know what I'm saying? That's not a you problem. Yeah, you got to worry about you bro. Nobody's gonna worry about you You have any kids No, okay, but are you planning on it someday? Uh, hopefully soon. Yeah. Yeah, so you better start you know Thinking of when these people do that shit. They're taking food off your table You know, I'm saying like bro nobody gives a shit man They just don't and a lot of times because we're nice people and we're good-hearted people We think that other people are gonna like let us eat, but they're just not bro It's not the way the world works and so you have to fucking remember that it is your job as a man to go out and Makes shit happen for yourself and dude none of these other dudes are gonna want to give you anything that they have so you've either got to go in and fucking take it or you've got to make your own Lane to where you can become very valuable and be able to take care of you and your family which dude, you know At 24 and you're already thinking the way that you're thinking. I don't think it's gonna be a problem for you Most do most dudes at 24 still stick in their mom's basement fucking video game headset on you know what I mean drink and hop pockets That's right. Yeah So unfortunately, that's the truth So yeah, bro. I think you got to figure it out for the most part dude go in there and fucking tell him what you're gonna do And if they don't agree to it just go take it anyway I love it. Yeah, well, I appreciate your guys this time. Yeah, brother. I really appreciate what you guys do for this country and It's just I think we need more people like that and I'm glad you guys are taking your time and we're To do that for this world. You're doing it. That's the reason we do this is so young men like you will go out and take their lives seriously and kick ass So thank you Love it. Yeah, all right brother. Appreciate your brother I Have a good one. Thanks Andy. All right. See you guys You gotta be like and I don't want to say be careful, but like it's cool to say hey I'm gonna come and do all of this and do all of this do all of this But isn't that like a piece of that too? We're like maybe the leadership is looking like well I mean we've had a bunch of 24 year old kids that it's all set the same fucking thing Dude look that haven't done any yes the thing isn't Say you're gonna do this. It's do the shit right create the value and then ask later That's the thing you know Everybody comes in and says I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna be great I'm gonna blah blah blah and they want to pay up front They want the opportunity of front that is not how fucking works the news. I really should have it And it doesn't work anywhere. It doesn't work anywhere think of it you work for yourself dude And you said You know, you're gonna cut grass and you show up to someone's house You've never cut their grass before and you're gonna charge twice as much and you're and and then you Tell them they're like dude is twice as much you're say yeah, I'm dude twice as good of a job They've never seen you do it right there. No one's buying that Okay, but if you go in there and you know the grass and the stripes are perfect and the and the The everything's trim nice and there's not a blade of grass out of place and all the leaves are picked up and everything's perfect Okay, and then you hand them the bill and the bill is twice as much They're gonna say why is it twice as much you be like look how great of a job I did And then there's gonna be at least a thought process there, right? You know what I mean? You might not get twice as much, but maybe you get You know a 50% increase. You know what I mean? Yeah, um, so you have to do the job and then Have the ask for the for the opportunity or the money. That's that's how it works. You know like I can't think of a situation that it doesn't work that way. Yeah Yeah, dude, it was just ringing through my head man because like I mean you've told like we've had you know plenty of conversations on this But it's just like, you know, well fuck they don't believe well. Why would they believe it? Yeah, why right? You know, I'm saying like you get them here's the reality there yet. Here's the reality dude If they were to pay you up front you wouldn't do that great for job. Oh, man That's human fucking nature bro. Everybody knows it. Yeah, you think you're gonna be the one guy that like Transforms the way humans have been for you know 12,000 years you're not people know So like do a great job show what you can do Then go in if I was hunter bro, I would I would be doing I would put myself in a position inside that company where the company really legitimately couldn't run without me That's what I would do. I would work myself into that position Then I would say hey By the way Here's the deal. I would like To do this in this and this and I would like to get paid something more like this and have a conversation after you've displayed the value That's how a fucking works pay us what you owe us right? Yeah, right Yeah, we'll talk about that tomorrow. That's the wrong guys. I do love it though. Man, sick. Let's let's keep this Let's keep this moving. I got it right in for you. Okay. Let's go question number two Hey Andy hey So I worked for a very small software company for 12 years And about eight months ago I was offered the opportunity to buy out the owner who had basically just given up and was ready to move on We worked out a very reasonable deal and just wrapped up the transition. I have six employees All of which have been here for less than two years And all are under the age of 26 saying that to say this. I'm an old school tech guy. I love what I do But never really took the responsibility of leading seriously or put the time in to better it But after a few months of now running the business These kids have lost their minds and I see why the old owner left typically this line of work is independent teamwork So we all have our parts to play but it's not day-to-day real group teamwork Um, and we will need that to move forward I know my employees know how to do their jobs But they are just lazy and it's excuse after excuse to get things moving and done on time And I simply don't have the patience for my mind is saying Fire all of them and start fresh But my heart is saying to try to get them realigned But I don't have the skills of real leadership to do so. I really respect your advice and would love the help here Uh, there's two parts to this question number one It's important to understand and I give you credit for this That just because you're skilled at one area and just because you own a company does not make you a leader And certainly doesn't make you a great leader all right And you already recognize that and that's a huge huge huge thing because most people that have companies They call themselves the CEO They assume that they're a great leader because they have employees not if their employees are actually productive or working as a team or Developing as individuals They just say I'm a leader because I'm CEO and that's just not the case So I give you a lot of credit there for recognizing that It's very similar to like guys that go to Medical school for 12 years and then think that they can run a business because they went to Fucking become a doctor or People who are lawyers that think they can run a business because they went to law school It's a different skill set and leadership is one of the skill sets inside that skill set So you're gonna have to learn it And it sounds like you're committed to learning it Um, and you will commit to learning it your entire life if you want to be any good at it. So That being said There's a lot of things to consider with the Reality of how your employees are performing number one is it you Is it your leadership your lack of leadership your unskilled leadership that's creating a scenario Where these people are not performing the way that you want you have to answer that question up front Yes, or no if That's not the case and you feel like you are dealing with people who You know like you said have lost their mind um look man Here's the reality dude sometimes you got a burn mother fuckers asses, okay? Sometimes you got to get all the way up on him to where they are fucking Super uncomfortable to get people to perform Um, and sometimes people won't take you seriously until you get like that Nobody likes to get like that. I don't like getting like that But sometimes when people don't believe especially in the early days when you're trying to do something great You are going to have to do it by fucking force And that is by any means necessary So a lot of things today people are like well, I don't like the way he talked to me. Well, how about this you're fucking fire How about that You like that you like the way I talked you there you like okay? Um Because dude, here's the reality There's not much opportunity out there. There's not as much opportunity out there as a lot of people think we're moving towards AI Jobs are getting eliminated if you're not of high skill and you don't contribute you won't have a job Anywhere because it's going to sweep across the entire fucking job market. So Especially in tech, okay? You got these tech guys who have For years and years and years and years and years hid behind their magic knowledge of code and uh You know you ask them about when things are gonna be done and they say oh well, I don't know and we don't it's just you know It's a little harder than we thought or it's not realistic Dude these people have lost their leverage. They don't have the leverage you think they have or that they think they have So the reality here is this you hold all the cards they hold none If you have a clear mission a clear vision And you paint that for them and you continue to lead that way and people still aren't doing what they do And you've made it very clear this is going to happen regardless Yeah, maybe sometimes it is you know what you need to do is get rid of them I don't know if you have six. I don't know if you need to get rid of all six you might need to get rid of one or two Find out who's causing the cancer find out who's causing the uh The cultural infestation of laziness because you're probably not dealing with six people that are fucked up You're probably dealing with one or two that are infecting the rest of them And I bet it would be the one or two people that you think Are probably the best and the reason I say that is this Because inside that little culture of six people there is a leader Okay, and the leadership inside Those little bubbles usually comes from the person who has the most skill So if you want to dig deep into where the cancer is You should look at the person with the most skill first because in that little six person group Those people naturally look at that person as the as the ring leader, okay? Sometimes it's not but from my experience. That's where um You we usually find it But yeah, man, you know, we live in this politically correct society I think it's actually over now. I think people are back to their fucking sanity and You know, here's the truth dude You're not doing anybody any favors by letting them coast you're not doing anybody favors in their life by letting them Fucking slack you're not doing people any favors by Letting them walk all over you or think that they have the leverage Sometimes you just got to fucking become a mother fucking monster and let these mother fuckers know who the fuck is in charge That's the truth and people don't like that People will say oh, that's not how you do things. Well, here's the reality bro What's the scoreboard say because the scoreboard says a lot too a little for every mother fucker that leaves that way I don't know what to tell you do you want to win? Yeah, or do you want to lose? Okay? And that's that and if they don't respond to that then fucking get rid of them and Reality is you could find apps that'll program for you now. So a lot of employees for the last 15 years Have been coddled have been made to believe that Their opinions or their political stances or the pronouns and their fucking bios or all the shit matters And it doesn't fucking matter and it never mattered all right Here's what matters do you put points on the mother fucking scoreboard or don't you and that's it And we're back to that we're back to that legally Okay, this idea that we have to put people in positions because they are Diverse or they're a woman or they're a this person or that part that's over You can without guilt and should for the interest of your company yourself Everybody that's in your company play the best mother fuckers on the field. That's it. Okay And all this other shit doesn't fucking matter and you say well, I don't you know, I don't know about that Okay, well are you helping the families of those five other people by playing someone and that six position Who's not as good and shouldn't be there no you're hurting all of them So you have to understand dude. This happens by force every fucking company that ever One anything or did anything great legitimately Their leader was a fucking tyrant sometimes that was the truth because you have to fucking force it You look at fucking what people say about Elon you look at what people say about jobs You look at what people say about Bill Bellichick you look at what people say about saving yeah, he's come until he isn't Right what you see yeah, dude you got to have the fucking monster in you bro and people got to respect it and You know, I don't like bringing that out but in the early days of our business I had to bring it out a lot Because people didn't believe they didn't think I was serious They thought that we were gonna fucking coast our way there and you know what almost every single one of those motherfuckers Has they're still my friend and they tell me on a regular basis how grateful they are that I was hard on them Because now they're doing something real in a different area of their life So you're not doing anybody any favors by being fucking uh, you know Their buddy quote unquote and letting them slide by yeah, I was thinking by the suit because you know there's an age old saying of like pressure makes diamonds right like how many times I guess have you seen it And I'm not saying it happens every time but like where you have to apply that that fire to you know a couple of people or whatever Yeah, and they end up becoming your best fucking beat absolutely You know what I mean it's so what what's the reality I mean look dude that's saying I guess I think there's a lot of truth to it I think you can you can overpress your people and break them for sure, but uh You know, I think in most cases people only do their best work when they when they have to do their best work You know, no one does their best work when there's no pressure no one's just sitting around and you know creates this amazing, you know piece of Or this amazing innovation and business or Product or this or that under no pre it doesn't happen like that it happens under pressure. So um Yeah, I mean, I think it's a big huge part and and uh You know if you don't apply pressure, you're gonna have people that don't really produce and that's that man Yeah, you know like do you really think you're gonna get the six employees who want to run the score up to a hundred Just on their own. That's not how the fuck it works. You're the fucking leader bro. You set the standards You set the expectations and it's their job to meet them or get the fuck out. That's that. That's how the world works That's how the world works and if you're a good leader you will figure out That when you Allow them to grow their position their role inside of those wins You start to get a team that buys in and uh when they buy in Everybody wins because the company grows They grow It's way more fun when things are winning and um Yeah, that's that you know, but sometimes bro. It's not that fun. Sometimes it's not fun You know like a lot of people think that when uh a coach or A CEO or somebody has to get like you know a manager has to get fucking rowdy They think that that person likes that that that they don't like that They would much rather not do that It would much rather walk in and just say hey, can you please do that uh, but the problem is is if you're honest with yourself you don't So If you don't want to get fucking you know, it's like they say if you don't want to fucking smoke uh, you know Do you fucking job? Yeah, right? You know what I mean? Like it's interesting today how we deal with people who think that like Showing up on time and stay until fucking you know the last minute of the day is somehow like like that's it No, no, they think that that's worth celebrating bro like I can't tell you How many times I've had people in my career come up to me and say I deserve more I work hard. I show up on time. I stay till five o'clock. It's like yeah, that's called your fucking job, bro You know, so we have this this issue With a younger employees especially who've never had to compete never have to like go hard never had any pressure never told that you know um You don't get a trophy for 17th place you get a trophy for first fucking place and we're we're dealing with in the job market with the younger people a situation of Bad parenting choices over the last couple decades, you know and uh That's what we got so at the end of the day bro um There's plenty of people out there that want to win. Yeah, you know last little piece on this because you know he he's you know talked about leadership too do you have Couple of book recommendations and I guess what would be a good place to start bro I think one of the simplest things of the lead the simplest bro. There's two books that I like a lot about leadership Okay, actually three books one It's called the Lombardi rules. It's very short. It's easy to read the rules are very clear and they are very very accurate Two there's a book on John wooden um, I think it's just called wooden It's a black book with his face on it if you don't know who John wooden is. He's one of the most famous successful and And see double a basketball coaches of all time He Yeah, wooden on leadership. That's name of the book and then the uh the third book is extreme ownership by my friend jaco willick um those Those three books give you a really good understanding comprehensively of what leadership's about um, but None of them will say you have to crawl all the way up someone's fucking ass to get him to move Yeah, and sometimes that's reality. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the Andy book Yeah, I love it, man I love we got one more uh we got one more question here. Let's do another call in uh to finish things off We have Andrew Nancy Good guy let's give him a call Oh Good afternoon, this is Andrew wow that was that was very fancy there Andrew I So I think it is I holy shit dude, you know, I'll tell you what I stayed up late last night and I woke up and I see this text message I'm like you've been selected again for Andy show I got one on Friday.

How many times I have to hear you repeat yourself Andy with the Constantly constant similar questions. So I really hope this isn't it Also, I wanted to congratulate you guys on uh, winning a month. Uh, that is absolutely incredible Yeah, I mean, I've been the motorsport fan my my whole life So motorsport first and then kind of came into business and then Follow you guys and then um, obviously through following you. I started Following Ryan Hardwick and then do that whole journey from Few years ago saying you're gonna win to now. That's just honestly incredible and watching and I had goosebumps the whole time And I woke up and saw the results. I just it was amazing as a fan Not only I'm the sport, but as of the brand. It's such an incredible and called accomplishment Just wanted to uh, congratulate you guys. Thank you, bro. That's awesome. Thank you, bro. Yeah, man Um, right. So my question. Uh, I mean, I had it Uh, typed out, you know under 60 words and I guess I can mock that but um, long story short um You know in the the 60 60 frames or less. Uh, now I'm 28 Um, I just got laid off from my first six-fitter job I got brought on. I was actually approached from my last firm and I got brought on to this bigger firm I'm pretty much sales rep business development rep for a custom integration firm We do high-end residential construction lighting projects, AV projects, home theater, things of that nature And yeah, so um, I was working for this company for about six months You know, I had a bunch of initiatives and targets to hit and I was kind of crushing it all It was nothing but praise for my management for the full six months um And then last Friday I got called into the office kind of short term and uh, launched a short day kind of ran me through The company had a really four first quarter and second quarter collecting cash that was outstanding from materials proposals and um, they had to let me go and uh, to be honest with you man, it crushed me um, you know, I take my work very personal uh, you know and not only that, I've kind of forged this path completely on my own and I'm really proud to be where I am I mean four years ago. I was in a ditch digging holes to pull wire. I mean, I was signed up to be a union electrician and I was going through an apprenticeship program and um You know, honestly after listening to your show every single day in the ditch. I just I knew I wanted more for myself and I knew that you know, the union wasn't going to provide for me What I personally wanted to achieve and you know, obviously nothing against anyone who's chasing that dream and I'm sure it can still provide a great career and a stable life for many people who want to live it But I just wanted to chase more um You know, and I listened episode two away um, I did my first live hard program uh Unfortunately to be completely transparent. I didn't keep it going as long as I probably should have um You know, and back then I wrote down all of my goals and I had mapped out what I wanted my life to be um, you know, and I think Kind of the biggest problem I had with that exercise is that just that the the main thing that I couldn't identify is what I wanted to do So uh, I just Figured out that the best thing I could do from the union was to get back in the sales So I need a few years to kind of forge my way through and I finally found this little industry um And to be honest with you since last Friday a lot's happened I've already had five interviews in industry. I have two second-round interview schedules for next week um You know, I have to travel to Long Island to uh to go ahead and meet one of the big firms as a competitor And I even left my last firm with letters or recommendation from both my CEO and my salesmanager So um, you know, this was just a big shock and I take my clients very personal I mean these these relationships that we build I you know, we're dealing with a lot of private clients high-knit worth individuals celebrities um, I mean kind of you name it You know, we'd we do it and uh, you know, building that connection with these clients and and advising them over the years of Uh, you know, what technology to use in their new projects or whatever it might be You know, although it might sound simple to me. I took a lot of pride in it To kind of have it stripped away from me. I just felt totally lost and um, I guess my my ultimate question to you um Really would be you know with a few years experience that I've developed in this field It seems like it would be somewhat transferable You know to take this kind of high-stakes high-network In that word, tight-ticket sales experience You know and transfer it into another industry if need be but you know kind of since last Friday Obviously, you know, I know what I have to do short-term is you know get back on my feet and establish You know income again, but you know, my only thought about this and chasing this industry was that I don't know if it would ever be able to achieve my long-term goal You know my my big goal and um You know, I know everything has to happen in steps and I know I gotta start somewhere and I'm very proud of the short-term success of gains in this industry I just kind of don't really know what to do from here and I don't know if I'm wasting my time How old are you? 28 okay Um, look dude. There's basically three skills that are required to be successful At anything that will transfer Anywhere all right and your job is to build these skills within yourself one Is sales okay, you're already working on that you're already doing that Number two is management or leadership. I don't know if You were running guys or if you had a crew or if you had a team under your own position or not Um, but if you did great if you didn't that's okay because that will come along the the better of a salesperson that you come Eventually you will find your way in managing other sales people number three You said you kind of created this little avenue for yourself which Sort of goes into the the third category of people that become successful which is people Who could identify a problem take the initiative solve the problem without ever being told and that report the the findings or the results of the solution of that problem With their own initiative all right, so You know What you're learning and what you're doing in your previous you know up until last Friday situation Is definitely transferable into other areas um But you've got to make a decision on where that is and that decision can be made around a lot of different things How much money do you make want to make how much time do you want to spend with your family? What's the trade off for that um Do you like the people that you're working with do you not like the people that you're working with there's all kinds of things that go into this decision Uh, but the good news is is that you're learning the fundamental skills to transfer over to any of those things so You know In the short term like you said you're gonna have to you know get some income coming in But in the long term You know 28 is still very young bro, and I know you probably feel like it's old But dude at 28 years old I was living with my dad Okay, I had to move back in with my dad at 27 years old because I was so broke Okay, so Don't think that you're behind you're you're making way more money than I was making at at that age Uh, and if you continue to develop your skills and take your um work seriously Like for example, you said you know, I take my relationships with my customers very serious and personal Dude, you're not gonna have any problems getting where you want to go You're already way ahead of the game And I know it doesn't feel that way because you're probably thinking I should be here like we always think But like I say on the show all the time dude if you're ambitious if you're driven if you want to achieve You're gonna always feel like you're behind you're gonna always feel like there's more to do You're gonna always feel like there's more skills to learn and that's a great thing because that hunger is what forces you to develop And pushes you into the realm of the next level so Dude, I don't think uh You're as lost as you think you are. I think you're just in a natural position in life Where you've learned a really valuable lesson and the valuable lesson should be bro that When things aren't going well. It doesn't matter how much you contribute you could be on the block and uh You know the fact that Your company wrote You letters of recommendation a couple of them speaks massively to how valuable you are so um Yeah, in the short term dude. I would get it where you can get it and in the long term I would and by the way in long term. I mean the next like two years I'd be working towards creating something or building something or or getting in somewhere where you're going to meet your long-term goals for yourself um You know, I talked to a lot of you guys as entrepreneurs all the time You know, it a big a big part of being a successful and entrepreneur is getting yourself on the right team Right if you're on a team of a company Who's been run three generations and the third generation doesn't give a shit about growing the company It doesn't matter how good you are you're gonna lose So you've got to be smart enough and aware enough to put yourself into a place where there's tremendous upside And if you can't if you're not ready to do that right now What I would do is you know pay the bills with the skills that you have right now and then Start to create this you know new path of where you want to be but I wouldn't fucking wait I wouldn't I wouldn't get the job and then say all one day. I'm gonna do this I would I would get the thing that's gonna pay the bills and I would immediately start working on your nights and weekends To figure out a scenario that's gonna get you where you want to go because dude We regardless of what people say on the internet. We only have a limited amount of time That's the reality and as a 28 year old man You probably have 12 more years to really set your path in the right direction For the rest of your life because the truth the matter is is once people in their 40s and 50s They don't get the same opportunities as people in their 20s and 30s. So That would be what I have to say to you um What do you think No, I mean it makes a lot of sense. I think my my main concern You know kind of with all of it is making sure like you said I have those 12 to maybe 15 years to put in you know to really get my roots in the ground And I just want to make sure that I'm doing that you know in the right place and you know when I started back in this You know little niche industry I was definitely not in the right place for my first year and a half and I knew that So when the time was right and I got poached it was okay and I was ready to go and I was really happy where I was at Right now that that was kind of taken away. I'm really trying to be picky I think of you know where my next firm is going to be if I'm staying in this But like you also said, you know, I already acknowledged internally that I am an entrepreneur I supposed to entrepreneur and I read Tim Groger's book you know and Reading that I found you know It was a little polarizing from one side to another, but I definitely think I was more of a cleaner than I was a closer And you know kind of where I'm at in life. I don't have kids. I'm not married yet. It's just me and my girl We're kind of free to go where we want you know I'm really pitching myself to these new firms for growth and development in terms of expansion um You know, I think that's a good play, but unfortunately I think where I'm at I just Only time will tell if it's going to be a good place and you know hearing your words of encouragement and Not that I think I I needed the reassurance that I'm kind of Doing a good job and I'm not far behind, you know, it's great to hear especially coming from someone like you I do greatly appreciate that Um, but at the same time I you know, I need to make sure I'm doing absolutely everything I can do to make sure I win and You know, oh, I'm not saying that I'm not saying that to make you feel good. I'm saying that to you Tell you like you better fucking go right now You know, you're doing good, but don't go sit on the fucking bench. That's exactly what I'm saying Like don't get a job and say oh, I'm making a 152 hundred grand a year and and and you know in your heart that you want to make two million Or five million or whatever and just sit there and wait. It's not gonna happen. You got to go fucking do it So yeah, and I think that's that's kind of like the next phase of my my worries is figuring out what that is and You know, I think I've struggled with that internally of what I'm fucking listen you're fucking 28 of course you're gonna struggle with that Of course you're gonna struggle with what to do with my fucking life Brian 45 years old and I fucking think about it all the time. I'm like fuck am I doing the right thing is All you guys look at me and you're like fuck dude Andy's got it figured out Fuck the fuck I do bro. I come in here every day with these guys you you can ask any one of them and I'm like Hey, what should we do this? Maybe we can do this maybe we can do better at this. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I just never quit and dude That feeling that you have of uncertainty is a tremendous asset to you because most people your age don't have that they don't they don't get anxious or Urgent until they're fucking 38 years old and they're like holy shit. This isn't what the fuck I wanted Okay, you're you already recognize that brother. You've already recognized that early on so That's a great thing the anxiety the the worry the concern These are great things for you because most people don't have them and they what the world will tell you Andrew You're very fucked up for feeling anxious and you have you know what you should probably take a pill Maybe Maybe you should just say this is what I want and I'm gonna fucking do it instead, you know like bro Look man, the point I'm trying to make is It's normal if you're an achiever if you're a winner if you're someone that's gonna build something or become something worrying about making the right choices is a very fucking good sign that you are aware enough and because you have that awareness You will make the right choices where people really fuck up is when they don't think like you're thinking They think they have all the time in the world they find another job in the Rome of what it is that you do telling themselves that I'm gonna make two million dollars one day or one day. I'm gonna live this life And changing nothing and then being surprised when they're in their mid 40s that the shit that they want to never materialize All right, and then They're in a big fucking problem because now you are Kind of out of range and date and age for a lot of things And it becomes much harder and no matter what Gary V says I love Gary When you're 45 you have less options than when you're 35 and when you're 35 you have less options than when you were 25 and Fucking away your 20s and your 30s Doing shit Yeah, I mean you can recover, but it makes a lot harder and that's just the truth of the matter So you're in a good spot, bro, and what you're what you're thinking and what you're Analyzing and the way that you feel is that's how winners fucking think brother like I'm just telling you that's how winners think I hear you Spout I got nothing to say other than I got work to do. I mean, I know exactly what I have to do and I appreciate the reinforcement Yeah, brother Listen, thank you sales Management and taking the initiative to identify a project see it through without having to be told If you could develop those three skills You you will write your own mother fucking check whether it's in your own company or somebody else's company The it's real shit So people are always starving companies are always starving for skilled individuals the job market is always amazing Always amazing for people who have real skill the job market is not always amazing for people who show up Hide in the corner don't contribute and you know Watch the clock all day the job market is fucked for those people like bro if you're You know if you're a killer you're always gonna have a place doesn't matter of AI or well it doesn't matter It's it's it's gonna be in demand so just keep working on those skills bro, and you're gonna find your way I have no doubts about it Most dudes that are 28 you they think they got all the time in the world because they got all these dudes on the internet Telling them yeah Colonel Sanders started at 63 years old bro Colonel Sanders was frying chicken for 30 fucking years Before he even started you know, I'm saying like people don't talk about that part of it You know fucking so anyway All right listen When I get to that point then you know I'm coming down to St. Louis and I'm good Dude I don't even give a fuck if it's sound I don't care if it's sound learn how to fucking lead Learn how to sell and learn how to see projects through from beginning to end and you'll have a place anywhere I fucking plug in to any I got a bunch of companies. I could plug people like that in at will anywhere That's the point I'm trying to make. It's not exclusive just to put an in sound systems It's a skill set that can be transferred from thing to thing to thing to thing because those skills are always in demand bro so You know yeah Go fucking developer skills that come down here and I'll plug in somewhere and we'll beat some ass About that that sounds good to me in the meantime you got to get first form on the east coast man I tried contact me two weeks ago All I got is vitamin shop and they don't have anything new I talked to the store managers grow They don't want to give anything in here yet We're trying to get them in gas stations Fucking everywhere I go I want to see first form well, I mean we by the end of the year we will be everywhere 200 something thousand doors, so well, I don't want this It'll be there since it's coming. Yeah It's coming all right, but I appreciate you so much. All right, all right brother. Have a good day. Thank you Andy. Thank you. I appreciate it guys. Thank you. Thank you, bro Yeah, bro, you know It's overestering to get a lot of the younger guys in and like Excited about fucking win and dude. They're not just excited. They're worried. Yeah, okay Like look concerned being excited about winning is way less powerful than being Terrified that you're not going to win, okay? When you're terrified that you're not going to win and you're gonna be broke And you're not gonna be able to eat you're not gonna be able to pay your bills That's when the fucking dog comes out, bro. That's when you figure out who the fuck you are, okay? So I'll take someone who has massive anxiety Massive worry about winning and is fearful of losing Over someone who wants to win a thousand times out of a thousand Because that urgency and that fear will drive them into producing, okay? I don't have anybody back in me to fuck up. I've never had someone my entire fucking adult life Back me the fuck up, okay? So what did they do? Oh, it made Andy crazy You're right. It made me fucking crazy. Made me crazy competitive It made me crazy detail oriented and made me look at every single thing every single day even though I'm 26 years in business As a plus or a minus to whether or not we're going to win or not It made me look at every single detail from the fucking top of the List to the bottom of the list big small like bro, you come here to first form There's no fucking water droplets in our sink. There's no pissed droplets on our toilets Every fucking place in here is spectacularly Perfectly clean you can eat off of our fucking warehouse floor Do you know where that came from that comes from years and years and years of getting your ass beat and realizing That the only way to win is by being fucking better than everybody else and so like dude once you figure that out Because you're terrified of losing everything winning becomes really easy because you're willing to do Anything you're willing to do whatever it takes and that is what it takes to win There's this there's this false expectation that you can coast and you can cut corners And you can have the right relationships and blah blah blah blah and all these things and that's where people's minds are People's minds are how can I get the most while doing the least But that's not what my mind is and my mind isn't there because I didn't have anybody to fucking rely on So my mind is to get the most I got to do the most Because I and it's funny because people will say why and he's not very humble actually. I'm extremely humble Let me explain to you why because I know that if I don't do the best fucking job and every mother fucking detail my life I'll fucking lose. I know I'm not good enough to win without giving my best. How is that not fucking humble? You see what I'm saying? So like dude just because I drive a fucking nice car or Every day of the month, all right doesn't mean I'm not humble what it means is is I'm living the rewards of actually being Extremely humble by knowing that I have to be perfect and then moving that culture of Absolute fucking deep attention to detail being perfect the best I can Down through our people which our people do a tremendous job at it 99% of the time. So You know fuck dude I will take those people who are fearful over people who just think it's fun to win I mean dude legitimately a thousand times out of thousand. Yeah, they got some to fight for They got some they're afraid of like bro. There's nothing worse for me than thinking about like Going back to where I was I mean dude. It's I'll fucking do whatever I gotta do if I gotta sleep up here every fucking night If I got it if I gotta eat two tons of fucking dog shit one bite at a time I fucking sit there and do the whole thing It is what it is. That's what it takes wherever fucking takes bro It's whatever it takes and doesn't matter what that is does not fucking matter If you got to hike across the fucking Sahara desert then you fucking do it If you got a fucking swim down the Nileful Alligrators you fucking do it whenever to fuck you got to do bro Whatever you got to do that's what the fuck it takes and dude people who want to win casually don't do those things Because it's like why don't you like doing that? Because I you know when you want to win but I do yeah, but now I'm not doing that Yeah, and the guy the guy who's afraid of losing that guy's fucking like fuck all right Well, I can either lose this or I could fucking swim down the river with some alligators. I hope I don't get fucking eating Fuck and then they get the river alligators. It is. Yeah. That's what I'm saying bro. I can love it man. I love it man guys Andy That's a hell of a way to start a Monday man. Yeah. Yep. Whatever it takes all right guys Well, listen, it is whatever it takes that's the fucking live society, okay? The live society is that you can win without doing whatever it takes and you just can't you're not that good I'm not that good. Nobody's that good nobody, okay? So to think that you can get by and build a career as an entrepreneur or build a career as an entrepreneur Doing what you feel like doing as opposed to what the fuck it takes is a false Expectation there are too many people who are high skilled have tons of experience have tons of resources and have come from nothing And are willing to do whatever the fuck it takes that you cannot beat them unless you at least at a bare minimum Do everything perfect and that's the disconnect Between you know people what they think it takes to win and what it actually means to to be a competitor and win and You know, I think I'm grateful that a lot of people don't get it because it makes it easier to win All right, but I mean if you're listening this show and you want to win you think you're gonna half ass There's people in your industry Whatever you do whether it's sweeping the fucking warehouse floor or that running a multi-billion dollar company that Quite honestly are willing to probably do way more than you're willing to do and unless you're willing to fucking literally Like fight them and fucking kill them to win you won't win you won't fucking win It's that competitive. It's the most competitive thing on fucking planet earth is your career and your fucking business I don't know how to explain it any any different than that It's a it's a false expectation, bro You know what I mean absolutely man Absolutely We'll go out there and fucking do it man. That's it man guys. Andy that was three All right guys Don't be a hoe
