I'm used to the hogs. Yep. Yep. I know you are Anyway Yeah, then big white hogs you like to ride. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah anyway, um, so People are probably wondering why we're having Q and A F in the middle of the week. Uh, that's because It is time for all of you to start participating in the revolution Which is the revolution and the rebellion of personal excellence We have to understand that if we as humans are going to thrive and even survive at this point We have to become everything They don't want us to become they want us to be fat. We have to become fit They want us to be stupid. We have to become intelligent. They want us to be dependent We have to become independent. They want us to hate each other. We have to work together These are things that are required for humanity to progress and your story Your outcome What you do on a daily basis is the revolution and you have to understand that we all play a part in that there is no Opting out there is no oh, well, I don't have a big following. This doesn't have shit to do with your following This has to do with the example that you set this has to do with what the people around you observe This has to do with what they see so they can know that certain things are possible for them And we as humans have an obligation to set that standard and that Obligation and that duty has been forgotten by a lot of people especially here in America So With that being said we are going to focus much more on personal development at least giving you guys a couple shows a week of that Until we get this new podcast launched which is imminent so Yeah, what okay, I'm in dude. Yeah, you got me you know what I'm ready to punch through a wall bro. Oh, yeah, let's make some people better. Yeah, that's uh You know like I said punching holes through drywall we have a Kyle cool. We're gonna get on the phone Let's go let's give Kyle a call here we go Hello Kyle what's up, dude? Oh? What's up? Do you get it? What's going on for how are you? I'm alright, let me get to an area. It's not so bad news Now you got me on a roof A roof You on the roof? Yeah, sir. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, don't you don't do it. I think I bad bro I'm thinking about it. Yeah, I need that man So we're going fellas doing good Kyle how you doing bro? I'm good man good Actually got some some rain up here in Washington state right now shit dude Isn't it I think it's isn't it always raining up there? Yeah, I usually get probably two weeks in the spring and two weeks in the fall It's actually like comfortable weather For me to work. Yes, either Potta shit or below 12. Oh, no that sounds pleasant Yeah, do why you're on the roof. Yeah So that's why you're on the roof. Yeah, all right. So what can we help you with brother? So uh I'm gonna get what I wrote I imagine had something to do with changing direction on my life though is I'm at that point now at 38 I've done this for 20 years of my life Uh six of the most resonant entrepreneur when I was real young and stupid Lost my business during the recession but uh When my wife had her boy Uh her kidney failed So I had to get you know a good job with you know awesome health benefits So Went to the union refers and been doing that for the last 13 years And now she's finally got her transplant So we're able to have a little bit more freedom and figure out like what we want to do because And I'll honestly I am just border roofing now And uh I got a few things lined up, but the problem is it's gonna be a pay cut Right off the bat until I work my way up And at 38 given my family the lifestyle you know I'm coaching my boy right now Is the last year I get a coach in until he goes to high school Uh Do I just stuck it up and Keep doing what I'm doing? Given in the lifestyle they become accustomed to or Figure out something else And is it too late at 38 to start from somewhere a whole new industry and work my way up Well, look man That's that's a lot and I think a lot of people Get to be the age that you're at and they start to consider these things that you're considering Is this really what I want to do? Is this really what I want my life to be um You're it's not too late all right, so let's just get that out of the way Especially with the technology that's available today the scale at which someone can Enter a business build a business and bear fruit with that business Is much quicker than it used to be um, it's significantly quicker than what it was when you were Uh, you know doing this shit back in 2008 all right, so The reality of the situation that you have to deal with right now is Do I want to take a step back for three years? To Take a step forward for the next 50 And if you think about it like that It's the answer is very obvious Okay, and a lot of people ruin their lives because they don't want to take a step back When they have to to move forward and the reality of success is that at points in time along our journey We have to take steps back and sometimes that looks like for an entrepreneur that would look like Not getting paid for a year or two I've gone through a number of phases like that my entrepreneurial journey where I don't get paid from the companies in order to let that money Work for me in other ways For you know, an employee for someone else that might look like you know downsize in your car downsize in your apartment downsize in your house, you know um But I think it's important dude to Think about this in a scale of decades not in a scale of the immediate Discomfort that it might cause you or your family um Let's be real bro material shit as cool as it is house car Lifestyle it's really not that important and once you've experienced any of it. It's not it It's not a huge deal Being satisfied with where you are what you do what you accomplish and fulfilled With what you do with your life is far more important than taking a step back Financially for a few years while you figure something out now with that all being said It's very important that you know where you're going to go from here and don't just say I'm gonna jump off this cliff because I don't want to fucking do this thing anymore And then not know what to do because that will that will end up in a place that's not very good. So um My advice bro is you know like a few were my brother and I was saying hey Kyle look man Uh You fucking hate what you do, okay? You don't like it you're over it. You've already done it Do you think you could do it for another 30 years? What what's your answer? No, okay Well, no you can't bro mentally or physically. Let's say you could do it physically for another 30 years You know what you're gonna think at the end of 30 years Fuck I could have done so much other shit You know what I'm saying and like bro you I can hear it in your voice bro. You're this path for you is exhausted It's kind of require you to make some changes, but at the end of the day brother, you know I think you already know what you need to do. Yeah, I just The issue is I spent 20 years You're coming a master at what I do, right? Yeah, and that's you know real thing construction Uh-huh, whatever right uh All my other skill sets like I'm I'm given computers. I got great discipline work at the call that That's that's all well and good, but I have no other marketable skills Besides what I put on my resume for the last 20 years. I can't go into a different industry Just say um discipline. I got written for two buttons fades Okay, is there not I like market that's where it's not you know half of what I it depends on what you're trying to do What do you what do you want to do what are you when you said you had other things to do what were they? Well, I got one option at long-sorman and five six years come a captain of boat And the other is pretty much entrepreneurship. That's really my only other options You don't think that you've learned enough skill or about construction and roofing to do your own Thing as an entrepreneur in that in that lane Oh, yeah, I just got to find the money to do it Well, I mean bro that's everybody's problem Right everybody's problem is they got to find the money to do it like You're gonna have to back the fuck up off your financial obligations and and reinvest and start small That's that's what it takes dude Listen at the end of the day Here's what it is You can either continue you can continue to do what you do You already said you don't like it. You already said you're tired of it Okay, yeah, you can go be a long-sorman Like you said that sounds pretty cool. I think that'd be fun But I bet if you did that for five six years, you're gonna say I don't like this either Okay, it sounds cool because it's new And at the end of the day you've already started a business It failed that doesn't mean that you're a bad entrepreneur Most entrepreneurs go through failure after failure after failure But you got to understand that that comes with a different level of anxiety stress um You know It's just a different life man and I can't tell you what life You're gonna be the happiest to live But what I can tell you is that if you're thinking what you're thinking now In two years it's gonna be worse and four years it's gonna be worse and eight years it's gonna be worse And you're gonna have to decide and make a decision brother and then just stick with it because at your age You know, this is probably we're getting to the point where you know Just talking real you probably only got one chance to redo your life at this age So it's not like you're gonna have another one is 60 you know what I mean Um, and that's where I'm at yeah, absolutely. Yeah, so it's important that you think you know decades ahead bro Where what do you want to say about your life when you are 60? What do you want to say when you're 70? Do you want to say I spent my whole life doing roofing even though I hated it or do you want to say I Had the balls to change something up and I did whatever the fuck it takes to work I can tell you this dude if you're not all in on making whatever decision that You want to make from here work no matter what You shouldn't make any moves Because you'll end up flat on your face, but you already said you have disciplined grit this that the other You know you ask how to market that I mean Marketing that comes from your own Displaying of results of what you've already created so I mean bro. I I don't I can't tell you what to do with your life, but I can tell you that if you continue down the same path that you're on you're gonna have regrets and Most people don't want that Oh, yeah, absolutely right And yeah, you you're right earlier. I do know what I need to do. Yeah, bro. I know you do you're you're not you You already do know it's just it's uncomfortable and you got to realize bro that most people will fucking Stay in that uncomfortable situation their entire lives and then fucking just eat the regret later and say oh I had a good life and dude if we're being real that's bitch shit That's bitch ass shit. That's pussy shit. Okay, you're not a you're you haven't You got to have the courage to beat look man If you don't have the courage to become what it is you want to do or become what it is you want to become It's gonna be you that has to fucking go in the hole with the regret So it's all about what you want to deal with for me You know I don't want to have to fucking wonder if I went hard. I don't want to have to wonder if I had courage I don't want to have to wonder if I was just being afraid and For me when I start to feel like I need to make a move or make a decision or move forward I just fucking do it Because the minute I start thinking about it. I know about myself. It's just gonna grow and grow and grow and grow and grow Until it gets so uncomfortable that I have to move anyway. So Bro, I understand where you're at and I understand your hesitancy because real consequences right on it And that's okay, dude. You could say hey, I want to stay in this another year and then I'm gonna do this I'm gonna wait until my son gets out of high school and then I'm gonna do this But I just don't want you to go for another 30 years, bro, and be like fuck I wish I had done something different. That's all I'm saying Well, I appreciate it, man. Thank you guys. Yeah, I mean, what do you think, bro? No, I mean you said it. It's exactly what I got to do. I mean I'm gonna regret it either way. I spent my life my entire working career Working my balls off and being uncomfortable as it is. So I'm either uncomfortable doing this or uncomfortable Making a change for the better. There you go Bro, and on top of it, man Like those skills that you learned are valuable skills. They're gonna be more valuable the next three or four years Anyway, because so much technology is gonna replace these pencil push your jobs You know, there's an opportunity for you right now to move into as a roofing entrepreneur and innovate the roofing space I mean right now like right now is the perfect time for it. There's gonna be new technology There's gonna be new equipment. There's gonna be new ways to do things and these older guys. They're not gonna adjust They're gonna say just like everything that happens, you know We don't need cars because we got horses and that's gonna be that's gonna be a major opportunity in construction people who start construction companies or start Blue collar tradesmen jobs who are willing to innovate and build businesses off of the technology available are gonna beat these older guys Who you know, we do look I grew up around construction too. We all know the kind of guys that do it. They're like this Hey, that's not how we used to do it We did it like this and that's how we're gonna do it and we're gonna do it like that until fucking the wheels fall off They're not very open to to evolution and if you can be, you know, that's where you're that's where your lane is you know the shit You you are already keeping up with technology you said your go-wit computers Pour yourself a little bit more into that start thinking about how you can innovate the roofing business and and work towards something like that dude Like that way you could look back and say well, you know, I I didn't waste my life. I went to school for 20 years for this that makes me a fucking expert, you know So dude, I personally see lots of options for you. I just think you've got a you've got a push past That Playing the middle right like the the playing of the middle the uncertainty. That's what exhaust people. That's what wears people out and You know, you you've just got to decide. Hey, this is my plan. This is what I'm gonna do and you got to go do it If you if you're waffle, it'll fucking fail, you know what I mean? It's not due guys. I can't I can't thank you enough. I appreciate you all the time and what you do for everybody still Well, look man, you're going through a natural part of life and I think you got a great opportunity in front of you It's just about making that commitment and going and making it work So thank you again, man. I appreciate brother. All right. See Kyle. Thanks brother. I see Did something I was thinking about during that that conversation and you pointed this out to me years ago But just on the the idea of just being a little uncomfortable It actually helps propel you forward it keeps that drive alive almost right man. You can't win without it Yeah, you can't win without it. This is something that people have to understand You in the beginning. It's very easy to Move forward because you don't have an option all right when you When you're broke and you don't have shit going on for you You have to eat You got to pay your bills so you have to go do things When you get in a situation like Kyle's in where he's making a decent living He's working hard. He's getting paid. He's taking care of his family That allows him a certain level of comfort which makes it harder to make the decision all right So the pressure I call it zero options mentality is required to succeed and a lot of people They will say well this doesn't work then I'll do this well if that doesn't work then I'll do this And they make all these contingencies and because they have these contingencies They don't go all in on the initial plan Which is what's required for it to work and the real trick is that whenever you start to become successful and you start to build some You know means you can afford dinner and a decent car and a nice house and you're not starving That's where it becomes extremely important for you to leverage inside of your own mind the idea that you don't have any other choice but to do it and that may require you Fabricating a story or taking extra responsibility for the people that work for you right like I know that I'm not legitimately responsible for everybody's life But the story I tell myself so that I get out of bed and go hard is that if I don't get out of bed and go hard These motherfuckers are gonna starve and so that's a that's not acceptable to me So that's a zero option mentality that I'm developing you see what I'm saying absolutely and so in the beginning It's easy because you actually have zero options, but where you work Kyle is You know that now you have options So it's like really hard to fucking move and it's especially hard when you've worked so hard to have stability To take a little bit of that off the table to move forward on what you actually want to do And sometimes for some people the right move is to stay right where the fuck you are because you're not gonna fully commit to anything else So that's why it's such a hard question for me to answer for him because I'm not him You know, I'm saying if I were him Knowing how I am I would absolutely do what I said I would stay in it and while I'm in it I would fucking start fabricating a plan around how we're gonna innovate the roofing business something I know a lot of everything about I'm a master like in his words How are we gonna do this with technology? How are we gonna do this with with the changes that are coming? What's the roofing industry gonna look like in five years? How can I get there before everybody else and that's where I'm working if I'm him Yeah, absolutely come down on the fucking gas station tequitos. Yeah, it starts to save it up Bro a little goes a long way, you know, it's like for fucking Ramsey says, you know fucking note no starbees Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I'm saying right so I mean dude, you know a lot of people tease Dave Ramsey But like Dave Ramsey is it gives a lot of really good practical advice for people to free up their income And they're debt to be free at something later and I actually agree with them I think most people live beyond their means they get caught up in this fucking bullshit rat race They have way more shit than they actually need to be happy. It's short-lived and It puts them in a financial bind that that enslaves them for their entire life And the truth of the matter is is like the good shit that you really want That requires passing on the fucking Jordans that requires passing on the on the you know the five series Beamer whatever to fuck you're trying to flex in front of your neighbors with like Dave Ramsey's selling a $15 million fucking mansion in Nashville right now. It's bad-ass But he didn't get there by You know Stretching himself in up until that point right so you have to understand like you know You can have these little luxuries, but these little luxuries that you're stretching to have keep the big life that you want from happening And there's a lot of truth to that There's a fine line of like being able to tread right now once you get enough offense going and you're fucking just You know you're printing that's a different thing right But like when you're first start getting started and you're trying to work out of where Kyle is That's required. It's what it is and a lot of people will fucking trap themselves their whole life because they're ego-wonal Allow them to take a couple steps back. They don't want to be seen driving a used car They don't want to downsize their house because they're afraid of what their fucking friends will say You know, I'm saying you shouldn't be worried about that you should be thinking about what they're gonna say when you Roll up in your fucking brand new fucking rolls. Yeah, right because you innovated the roofing business. Right. That's real shit Yeah, that's real. I love it man. Well guys. Let's get a question number two going We have a write-in question number two Good morning Andy and DJ A little background on myself. I'm a 47-year-old mom wife veteran deputy rancher and all time follower of your content I'm on my fourth 75 heart and seek mental toughness and control on the daily my question for your expertise knowing your mindset and experience I have adult sons And other friends and family that I know for a fact need 75 heart in their life One son struggles with weight and has attempted 75 heart two times But when failing makes excuses to get back on board Uh, I find myself having a zero empathetic attitude towards the people that refuse to do the work to help themselves How do you help and support people that you care for when you know what they need to do to help themselves But they refuse to do it. I find myself biting my tongue in so many conversations to basically save my relationship with them But it stresses me out because I want to just be real with them And I'm sure I would not come across the right way. I would appreciate your thoughts on this And hopes that you have ideas on how to approach it have a kick-ass day Uh here. I'll solve it to you in three words tell the truth If the fuckers fat tell me's fucking fat When I was 350 pounds none of my friends told me I was fat And you know what I wish they had I had a listen to the internet tell me fat And when the internet was telling me I was fat I was like fuck I guess I'm fat and I lost a hundred mother fucking pounds Okay, so my answer to you is probably not the answer that you would like is probably not the socially accepted answer But I would bully the fuck out of them until they stop putting food in their fucking mouth and get off their fat ass and start a fucking working If you really care about him if you really care about him, okay Here's the thing. They're never going to do it by you just saying oh I really would like to see you do that that is not enough pressure It's not enough pressure They have to feel like shit about themselves. They have to look in the mirror and say fuck I'm a fat fucking lazy slide and however you can facilitate them learning to Observe that on their own The quicker they will change and that's just reality and people don't like that They say it's mean they say it might be mean But you know what's meaner than that Allowing someone to be a fat piece of shit who fucking won't do the work who constantly complains about being fat and unhealthy and doesn't you know know what to do Um, but you say you love and careful that you say you love and care for but you keep you keep you know Babying them and and you know like bro hurt their feelings. It's not you don't have to I'm just telling you how I would do it I'm not saying how you need to do it, but that's how I would do I'll make fun of them. Yeah until they fucking stopped I mean how much way are you down? I'm down 45 pounds. Yeah, it's because I call you a fat fuck every single day It's part of it. Kind of these guys. Yeah, well as mainly I Listen dude if you really care about people you tell them the truth otherwise it's fake care You care about yourself. Okay, if you don't want to offend people with the truth It's because you lack the courage or the care that you claim to have To actually deliver the truth in a meaningful way. I have zero Empathy for people like that as well and the reason that I have zero empathy for people like that as well It's because I have conquered that problem for myself and I realize that if I can conquer that problem for myself Soak in anybody so I Totally agree with you and I think you're putting too much weight into being Quote unquote nice or whatever you think that is But I just see things different bro. I see I see kindness and niceness Pretty much different than what everybody else sees it as like I see kindness and niceness as the truth I think if you actually care about someone you will tell them the truth. I think if you actually Want someone to be happy and you know what they need to change you will tell them the truth And I think people that don't Are full of shit. Yeah, I think too like it's also important to to make like to continue to be that example for them Oh, yeah, I mean that's that's you know, I'm saying because I mean that's a big shame it was his kids It's our sons. Yeah, how are they? I didn't say she's she's 47 So they're probably 20. Yeah somewhere in there. Yeah, so uh Yeah, they're old enough to fucking they can take it here. Here's the reality too They should realize like look dude if you're overweight In a significant way your life experience is completely different than what it would be if you weren't shit completely different So people who are fit people who are healthy people who take care of themselves send a message to everybody in every situation Whether it be the people they work for whether it be their potential mates in a relationship Whether it be their friend group Anybody their kids they are sending a completely different message which brings back a completely different quality of life and When I was 350 pounds I would argue that and I did argue that I said hey, you know what? I'm a great entrepreneur You know much better. I got when I lost a hundred fucking pounds You know much more money I made you know much more opportunity. I got like it's not comparable and If you want the best for your sons you should probably explain to them like things that are gonna matter to them You know like hey Do you like girls? It's very simple. Let me see. That's real. Do you like girls? Yeah, I like girls Well, do you know why you're not getting any because you can't see your own dick? Okay, and like that's the truth Gert listen if you're fat you're gonna have a limited selection of women unless you are Insanely hilarious like Shane Gillis through okay, but you're No, no girls want to Mo when they're that age they don't our any age. They don't want to fucking I know there's chubby chasers and shit, but like I'm just saying in general your your opportunities are gonna be limited in every and every area Or during the winter time when it's colder out than you a little bit more warmth. Yeah, maybe yeah I mean, that's something that I told myself when I was fat It's real man, you know, it's real. I just don't think You know I Think if someone had sat down and explained it to me when I was 20 years old and said if you don't get in shape You're not gonna make money and you're not gonna meet girls. I would take it serious because that's what I cared about it Yeah, you know what I mean? I just tied to something they actually cared about. Yeah, that's real I mean, you know what I wanted to actually this because I feel like a common thing out there too But also remember 75 hard isn't for fucking fitness. It's a fucking mental transformation program so also you should be explaining to them in a very real way that If you don't learn how to follow through on your plans, you're never gonna be successful in anything And that's what that program fucking solves. It solves the problem of adherence and when people can't adhere to any plan They can't be successful in anything So we have to build our discipline and our toughness and our grit and our fortitude Everything that contributes to our ability to follow through on the plans that we set forth for ourselves in order for us to have a fulfilling successful life If you can't adhere to very simple things such as I'm not going to put X in my fucking mouth And I'm going to get off the couch and walk for an hour like if you can't do these things You can't you don't have you can't do anything You understand absolutely man. You can't do anything. So you have to fix the problem of adherence before you start saying Oh, I'm gonna do this or I'm gonna do that or I'm gonna do this or I'm gonna do it shit Because you can't even control goes in your fucking mouth You know you don't say it like a lot of people are like oh well that this program's better net for what There's not a better program in the world to teach fucking discipline. That's why there's Billions of fucking hashtags all over the goddamn internet. I love it, man Why just get tired of it? I love it. Yeah, I mean broke Do your kids want to be fat or do they not Your kids want to be broke or do they not Your kids want to fucking get pussy or do they not I'm sure they want to say yes to all of those things Whether your mom tells you probably not you know, that's probably not what they want to hear. Yeah Hey boys you want to get some want to get some pussy What Bro it's the truth it's the truth people don't like the truth you just say it like this. No, I'm gonna say it like I say it Fucking be miserable or fucking fix it I love it, man. It either you either are you aren't It is or it isn't They're either doing it or they're not doing it like That's it And I don't know like how to soft Hand feed somebody the truth to where it's gonna affect them in a way like if you ever has anybody ever Fucking ever ever ever and what everybody to fucking think about it Have you ever had a polite conversation with someone and then they completely fucking change your behavior Do you have you ever seen a football coach walk on the fucking field with a bunch of grown men and saying hey guys I'd really appreciate it if you went out there and you execute the play and I really appreciate that you did it perfectly And if you ever seen a coach that doesn't like that win Okay, so the truth of the matter is is this is what people respond to people respond to confrontation They respond to directness they respond to truth and they respond to it in a when you presented in a way like hey, man I fucking care about you, but You're a turd Okay, and you need to fucking fix it and that's what I've found Works the best whether it be in a team or whether it be as an individual I've never had a team and I've never had an individual as much as they cried about sometimes the way that the message is delivered I've never had someone respond properly to I really would like to see you be a little more healthy I've never seen it now There's there's a reason that when you go to fucking boot camp They say get your fucking ass on that mother fucking spot right now And it's because most people are so fucking pussy and so soft that they that's the only thing that can fucking respond to is the The fear that's something might actually happen to them if they don't yeah, yeah That's really one thing too. It's like, you know ultimately man You can't want it more than somebody else wants yeah, that's it for themselves. Yeah, that comes in time. Yeah, you know You gotta want it man. Yeah, well, I mean bring your fucking kids up here. I fucking tell the truth I'm just be real most y'all parents no offense to this lady that wrote this in but most y'all parents the reason your kids suck is because you suck You won't have real conversations with them. You won't hold the line You don't live a life that that that you think they should live and then you expect them to just magically sprout into these Amazing individuals. It's not gonna fucking happen, bro So it's real man. That's real. Well, let's get call it number two question number three. Let's knock this out We got John Let's get John on the phone Hello, this is John hey John what's going on man? DJ what's going on buddy? I can't call it just another day, you know, just a squirrel trying to find a nut what's going on with you? Oh, just checking boxes man working away. Yeah, where you calling from Uh north Idaho north Idaho we got we got we got Washington now. We got Idaho. All right I don't know what to lean all right That's sick man. Yep Yeah Well, we got the big dog here. How can we help? Oh Oh boy Andy, how you doing? I'm doing good brother. How are you? Good man Good good. I got one for you today. I uh Something that I maybe I should give you a little backstory on uh four years in business um And uh doing construction and excavation work stuff like that and uh you know you see guys come and go new businesses Then you see guys that end up you know sticking around and uh You get a little competitive with them seeing them, you know, scoring jobs or landing jobs You've been on or wanted and you know, whether it pisses you off and fuels the fire a little bit I always thought that was normal, but um My buddy of mine started doing the same thing and at first I was kind of helping him out and You know teaching him tricks the trade and whatnot and uh I found myself getting you know starting to get annoyed when he was getting the landing jobs Um, so it seems like You know everyone and his mother knows everybody that's looking for the kind of work we do And uh it started kind of making me feel like shit am I It might be such a shit for thinking this way or you know, is it okay to think this way should I just use it to Be more competitive and try harder or you know, I'm kind of just don't know what to do with it You mean negative feelings Yeah, you know are just you know, he'll get a you know all my my uncles buddies build in five houses and he's got all this work for me And I'm just like Mother fucker you kidding me so this this was your best friend that started the same business as you you helped them in now Got it. Yep Well, I mean Why is he doing better than you Well I've asked myself that and it you know It honestly it feels like it just comes down that he just knows more people um Well, you know, I feel like I go out grind in and knock indoors and calling dropping off flyers and then He'll call me up be like oh, yeah, my uncle's brothers got Up this property from you do all this work on and then it's just like well all the time First of all is it true? Is what he's saying true Second of all, uh, well, it doesn't matter, but I mean these are questions that you should ask yourself One is he full of shit Okay, because I have a lot of people that that you know and by the way a lot of you know their names Because they happen to be pretty famous on the internet who tell me all kinds of shit they're doing Uh, and and they're usually full of shit and it never materializes and I never see it and uh, you know We're doing this so we're doing that and we got this this and this and this and this valuation in that and then nothing ever changes in their life So that's a natural thing amongst people who want to be competitive is that people will flat out lie to you and make you feel like shit um Secondly If it is true Why is it true? Well, you answered the question it seems like he knows more people than me so If that's the problem then what you have is an awareness problem You need more people to know who the fuck you are So what are you gonna do to make that happen? How are you gonna solve that problem? Because If it's just as simple as more people know him or he knows more people then you have you know exactly what it's gonna take to get business You you I mean assuming that's what it is Okay, uh I don't know if that's what it is I don't know I don't know if If he's actually having more work. I don't know if He's full of shit I don't know if the real problem is is that he knows more people but I think deep down you Probably know exactly why He's doing more than you And I think you need to be honest with yourself about what that is and then address that problem because if I was blessed enough To be able to recognize where I was failing Then I would put my attention into that area So that that would get my business on the level of where I would want it to be But at the same time Like your goal what is your goal your goal isn't to like Outdo this guy right like That's not that's not a real goal Your real goal should be your goal and your goal should be so fucking big that You're consumed With how well you have to execute to achieve that goal all right and like I say all the time There's so many people that waste their time and their energy When our time and our energy are our most valuable resource we only get limited amounts of it every single day on a 24 hour period All right, and if we spend it watching you know Steve's business and Steve's business Fucking is doing all these things and we're getting jealous and we're getting that feeling in our stomach where everything is on fire and this and that Uh We don't have the energy to work on our own shit and what I do to handle these things is I make sure that I have a A massive plan that I need to work on and then I make sure that when I do Get competitive or I do get jealous or I do start to get aggravated at other people's shit That the minute I feel that coming on I go to my plan and start executing on my plan and I think that productivity pivot is one of the most valuable things Anybody can learn how to do because one we're no longer looking over here We're focused on our own thing number two I don't care what anybody says the most valuable Energy that we get is the dark side negative energy So I would say the fact that you're getting pissed off is pretty good. I think that's a great asset I would much rather Work with someone who felt that way than someone who just like oh well, you know fuck steves Steve's doing it and I'm just happy for him I would much rather work for the guy who says I'm gonna fucking stop on Steve's mother fucking throat With how successful I'm gonna be those people win yeah, and The the reason that those people win is because eventually they figure out how to harness the attention and the energy and the attention in the right way so You know don't think that I don't think there's anything wrong with you bro Like if you and I were partners. I'd be like fuck yeah bro. I love the John fucking John's got that fire in him bro I love that shit dude like that not many people have that dog bro, and when you have it You got to figure out how to use it because you will hear people say things like this Well that negativity will burn you down if you're not careful says the guy with no money in his bank account All right the yeah, the reality is dude is being a competitor is part of being successful in business And you're obviously a competitor because right or wrong it bothers you and other people win There's this famous saying in the movie no country for old men where Ah Is it no country no it's there will be blood the movie there will be blood. He says uh You've seen that movie oh yeah, okay, you know at the part There's a part in the movie where The main character Daniel Day Lewis goes It's not just that I want to win. I want everybody else to fucking lose I don't want anybody to have anything and like bro. That's the extreme Nature of a competitor and while they may not mean that literally like I really don't want people to starve But you know, I want to fucking win bro like I'm trying to fucking win and yeah And it mindset yeah, bro. That's a healthy way to think when you're in business and other people depend on you I mean, that's a great way to be and these other fucking People on the internet writing all this feel good, you know fucking Bullshit gets our minds fucked up like we're competitors. That's what we're supposed to do You don't fucking talk to a gladiator right before he's going out into the fucking Arena and say hey, I hope you have a peaceful journey my son like no you're gonna be like hey Mother fuck you better swing that axe as hard as you fucking can cut that dude's fucking head off like are you gonna die? Yeah, you know what I say it like literally yeah This is just something that most people aren't cut out for which is why the most of the advice out here is so fucking off From what it should be so anyway to summarize my little rant here, bro One, I think it's awesome that your book that you burn hot number two All you got to do is harness that into your own shit It doesn't matter if your buddies doing it for real or not, but just remember He's probably lying or exaggerating at least half as much and for me I have to I have to yeah, bro I have to remember that because That DJ knows this I'll get so fucking pissed off dude that like and then I have to remind myself well They're probably lying at least half of its life. So you know Take that in and he poured into your mission Create your mission that's so big so fucking powerful that it's gonna take your whole entire life to do it And you won't have time to worry about what the fuck that's doing and the pro the thing you gotta be careful of right here Is that you want to make sure that you don't become beholden to this guy's limits By continuing to compete with this guy who doesn't really have a big plan a lot of people will really fuck up their lives By competing with the wrong person because the wrong person isn't Committed to like a big vision. So like You know like is it really a win beating someone who's really not got that big of a thing going That's not really a win So, you know, let's get clear about about what's a win for John what's John trying to do and then Focus on those things and then when you get When you get jealous and you get mad and you get angry like we all do anybody who says they don't their liars Uh, take that energy and focus it on your plan bro And and before you know it you'll be so far ahead of everybody else who you would use to piss you off You'll forget that they used to piss you off because a whole new group of people will piss you off Yeah, it's the truth like I used to get mad at like local people that would do stuff right and then it would be like National people and now like I look at fucking People that I honestly shouldn't be looking at at this point and I'm like fuck that guy. Yeah, right, right? You know like Why he's done the following actually this answer? How shitty be handling this best friend like I mean did does he keep it cordial with them? I mean look bro. I'd make fun of them I'm how's it all right. Yeah, I know you got all the connections bro. Okay, Donald Trump You know like I'd fucking make fun of them, but like you know, yeah, dude. I got friends that are full of shit We all got friends that are full of shit Part part of being friends with people is how good a full of shit they are like do they tell a good story Like can they make you laugh or are they good people like that dude fish fish stories, you know like they they got the biggest one Yeah, bro, it's it's fucking it's it's old as time like you're not gonna you're not gonna change people's You know like I like people like that. I like people that are a little full of shit. They got funny stories You know you can't really take them too serious, you know, and then when they start exaggerating their shit You know, you got to call them on it and I think that's what makes good friendships. Yeah, you know, yeah So yeah, that's true. That's good shit man. Yeah, and bro. Also, I think there's more to that too Like a real winner like a real fucking winner They want to be friends with other people that are winning even though it pisses you off right people will say I want all my other friends to win Yeah, you do, but not because you want them to win It's because you've learned About yourself that when other mother fuckers win that are in your vicinity You are so competitive that you know you will fucking step up to compete with that person So like my friends my friends the people I associate with are all Successful people, but do not think for a fucking second that I'm not trying to fucking beat them You know what I'm saying like it's and they know that I know that about that. It's understood. Yeah, that's understood But they're also the same people that if I call them I said hey, man um, I need to fucking borrow you know Money because I'm low on cash. They'd all be like are how much you need you know what I mean? Right Yeah, so you know, it's it's just about learning where you fit in the game and How to navigate these different personalities? And then you know most importantly how to harness our own fire in the right direction and uh Bro, I don't think you're a bad guy for thinking that I think you know I think you're an honest guy for thinking that and I think there's very few honest people That will communicate what you just did here on the show and what I did back to you But I know for a fucking fact All the names all the people that you look up to and maybe watch on social media They're all the same. They just don't say it on the internet. They're all competitive They all want to win They all fucking hate when other people win and then they they act nice about it. You're right like It's bullshit. Fuck yeah, and like I will straight up tell them like I'll be like hey I'm gonna fucking beat you bro like I'm gonna beat your ass and they'll be like oh you think so like yeah I really do and then we'll smoke a cigar You know say like So it's all good bro You know the best friends you're ever gonna have or the people you could peat with that's the truth The best friends in the world that I've developed over the course of 25 years in business are people that I've The people that I've competed with because there's a natural fucking respect That you have that's mutual. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, that's good. I haven't thought of that before That's awesome. Yeah, so how old are you bro? Uh, just turn 32. Oh bro. Yeah, I didn't figure most of this shit out until I was like after 40 So like your way ahead bro. You're doing good Thank you. Yeah All right, John. Hey, man You get a little uh get a little swimming at lake force up there. That's a beautiful spot. You're at I will absolutely All right, brother. Well, hey, man Keep the fire going dude that that'll take you places take a lot further I'll take you a lot further than having inner peace Christel's shot. I'm gonna learn how to use that dark energy broken about I think it's I think it's 80% of most of the successful people's Energy is dark energy. They just don't fucking emit it. So That's my experience from being around people behind the scenes Love it, man. Yeah, I heard it from the first time from your your show Couple years ago. Yeah, talking about it. It was badass. I listened to it a few times. Well, that means you're one of us so So yeah, and if you're fucked up so my So that's what it takes. Yeah, that's right. All right, brother. Well, hey, man I appreciate you calling in dude and uh appreciate all the good work you're doing up there and the hard work you're doing keep it up You know, we need that in the world We will absolutely. Thank you. All right, brother. We'll talk to you soon. All right. See you. See you, DJ. See you brother Yeah, I just wanted to ask that that friend question man because I feel like some people like well Well, fuck that guy that I won't ever talk to him again. Now let's see if we're like you know you can use that person Not only that why would I not want to talk to him if he's giving me all kinds of good energy to use Sometimes you got to pitch yourself off on purpose Fuck man. Yeah, like bro when you're really good Like there's stories about Michael Jordan doing this. Yeah, Michael Jordan when Michael Jordan was at the peak of his career Nobody was talking shit on Jordan nobody was coming out saying bro I'm gonna hold Jordan to fucking eight points It's not fucking happening bro So because everybody talks shit and everybody respect him so much He started telling himself stories He fucking wouldn't make up stories about what people said about him And then go out on the court and look at the mother fucker in the eye and be like I fucking heard what you said about me And the guys like what Michael He's like I fucking heard it. I saw in the paper. I read it like there's nothing in the paper You know like but this is the psychotic nature of ultra competitors bro Like you have to figure out how to flip the switches on internally to get the result that you want and sometimes that requires a fucking paranoia Imagination like where you're making shit up like Man, these motherfuckers they all think they can fucking come take my shit and like you know I might go talk to him and they're like fuck dude. I Never even thought about that like I was actually gonna quit my business Like You just it's just part of being competitive bro. So like we have to fucking understand that You know That that is that's part of it dude, you know sometimes you got it goes back to what we're saying about zero options Sometimes you you have to manufacture that intensity and that urgency and that competitiveness Especially when you're dominant like when you're beating the fuck out of everybody and everybody knows it Now you got to make something up to prove You know what I mean? But what I said is the truth bro. There's never been a fucking there's never This polite niceness and courtesy shit that Everybody types on the internet that doesn't win It's in practical advice. It's written by people who've never won It's not realistic. It sounds good. Listen DJ nice. I'm just telling you it's It's written by people who have never won and the only motherfuckers who have ever won doing it Are these therapists who promise this idealistic bullshit and purposefully victimize people and keep them trapped in their little business cycle That's the only motherfuckers that win with idealism everybody else wins with reality They win with like hey, uh you either do that or you're gonna lose all your shit I mean bro. I was just writing this fucking Instagram post uh a day or two ago and posted it yet, but the truth the matter is Most people aren't afraid enough of losing Most people haven't taken the time to consider what their life will look like if they don't change it And if they could zoom into the future 10 20 30 years from now and like just live one day in the life of what their current habits are creating They would change instantly they would change fucking yesterday But because they can't feel it and because they can't notice it and because it's progressive and slow and Inperceptible people just write it out not realizing that it's gonna cost them fucking everything down the road Okay, people should be terrified of losing usually if you are if you don't have anything going for you right now You should be fucking Terrified is not just going to work out is not This magic fucking fairy is not gonna fly down and hand you an inheritance or get you your shit together like You should be afraid and enough and people aren't they're told every day and it's gonna be okay No, it's not it's not gonna be okay unless you make it okay And that's what the world needs to understand that's what people need to understand and if the if people were properly afraid of what their life was gonna look like By continuing on the path they're on then they would do something about it today And that's my point of that question too with the two The two sons the two sons If they knew what their life was gonna look like at 25 at 30 at 35 at 40 at 45 because they're unwilling to change now Versus what their life could look like They they would fucking change but you know who's gonna tell them Mom's not gonna tell them she doesn't want hurt their fucking feelings You know what sometimes people need their fucking feelings hurt That's the reality That's real man guys. That's a little midweek pickup right there man. Yeah. I love it man go get better. Yeah. All right guys Don't be a hoe shut the truck Got a own bank row can't fold doesn't know here shot case clothes
