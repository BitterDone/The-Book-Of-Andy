I go that makes sense Got it. So what's going on today DJ a lot of interest and stuff happening today? Let's start off with the dumbass of the day. I think that's a good place to start Yeah, it's always a nice three dumbasses will add one more. Yeah, why not four? The most of the day goes to this MSNBC host Who gets pissed off because he gets caught in the lie So let's dive into this little bit. Hellenry's MSNBC host threatens to sue Trump 8 Corey Lewandowski for defamation then is exposed by his own words and shocking video So the host is Ari Melber And he brought Corey Lewandowski on during a live broadcast of his own show that was a mistake That's a mistake because Corey's fucking with it. Yeah But the exchange occurred after Lewandowski had the audacity to quote Melber's own words back to him Words that expose the media's obsession with sensationalizing any aspect of President Donald Trump's life Even following a failed assassination attempt so Lewandowski again, he's a senior campaign manager He was he played a big role more in 2016 and he's running the campaign right now Trump just brought him back in for this one Yeah, so he I don't think he did much in 2020 But he's back in so but he called out the MSNBC host for his hypocrisy pointing out how Melber had described Trump's appearance at the RNC last month So let's watch this little exchange here Fox news, which has been caught in defamation ran a false piece falsely stating that I said something else that I didn't say so I stand on that I stand on the New York Times to look at this bandage was a Propos spectacle from a candidate not to say that's what's spectacles that's fair a placard for delegates to fill in an image for Political mobilization a spectacle for this candidate who we know is by his own admission Obsessed with assorted spectacles He's our mr. Lewandowski. I did not say that that is a false quote and you what you have is a false quote And if you I'm putting you on notice if you continue to repeat falsely That I said that you will be potentially in a defamation situation because I didn't say that But I understand that you're working off the internet a lot of false Information I wish you luck with that and Cory Lewandowski we gave you time I appreciate you coming on for that. Thank you for joining me Cory Lewandowski from 2024 and we will be right back What an asshole Listen up and I don't even I don't even like I don't I stay the fuck away from like all this shit because if I don't know Fully about it. I don't put it on the internet and my dad always tells me that because he's like But I mean dude They're talking about that Trump bandage. You know when he got shot. Yeah Yeah, and so that we're saying it was fake they're saying it's fake and so he gets caught off where his own shit Yeah, did you see Lewandowski's fucking face light up when he said he didn't say it Like if you watch the clip again like his his eyes he's getting like excited. He's like all right It's funny while people the same guy I did not say that is a false quote Here you what you have is a false Reversive If you bring it back to me on notice if you continue to repeat falsely like no no before that All the way kind of like in the beginning When all right right here Look at his face Hold on right before that watch his face like light up when he starts realizing this guy's gonna lie That's fair a placard for delegates to fill in an image Bro reverse the fucking video holy shit, man. We know you making a segment all fucked up falsely stating that I said something else that I didn't say so I stand on that You didn't say that you didn't say this bandage was a proper spectacle from a candidate not to face with That's fair. He's full of shit. Yeah, I mean Cory's pretty fucking witty bro. You can't you can't you can't try to well What's crazy is is like what the fuck? How do you not remember you saying that like it was like a week ago? Well, I'm saying that it's a complete lie like like all these people they say all this shit And they forget that like it's on camera all the time. Oh, yeah, and then once it's on camera It's never it's never gonna leave. Yeah, you know, off the internet. It's like all the shit You see those pandemic clips where they're all like saying all that crazy shit And then let's say that yeah, exactly. No, we didn't say that.

I'm kind of wondering it too All right, but guys, we appreciate you for being real ass fans keep liking keep commenting Make sure you guys hit the bell notification on the tube to stay up to date with the latest headlines Uh latest episodes dropping from really after that being said headline number two Uh Let's talk about get on Trump a little bit Trump's been getting some heat here lately this uh today Uh, headlines trump respectfully honored fallen troops at all into national cemetery amid altercation report So apparently some shit happened when he was right before he was laying the wreath Uh, or the 13 fallen servicemen and women So let's dive into this a little bit Um, so AP released this this article this headline saying all in some cemetery official was pushed aside in trump staff altercation, but won't press charges So apparently there was a uh, uh, altercation that happened before the wreath ceremony Where's a member of trump staff pushed a member of the orleans and cemetery Uh, staff because of the cameras being allowed and not allowed some where it should happen in there. So Stopping this a little bit Orleans and national cemetery official was abruptly pushed aside during altercation with former president Donald Trump staff During a wreath laying ceremony, but declined to press charges and army spokesman said Thursday a statement said the cemetery employee was trying to make sure those participating In the wreath laying ceremony earlier this week We're following the rules Quote this employee acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption the statement said the incident was reported to the police But the employee decided not to press charges the army said it considered the matter clothes Trump's campaign was warned about not taking photographs before the altercation at on the to national cemetery During a wreath laying ceremony On Monday to honor service members killed in Afghanistan war with draw a defense official told the AP on Wednesday Uh, the defense officials speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matters said that the Trump campaign was warned About not taking photographs in section 60, which is where the members were buried at Before their arrival in the altercation Section 60 is the burial site a Familitary personnel killed while fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq so The media runs this fucking story right runs as narrative that like there was a fight between a Trump official on the campaign staff and this all into national cemetery member But the media is lying and the gold star families the parents and relatives of those fallen are coming out saying that no It's complete bullshit Saying that you know one Trump was actually invited there to do that by those family members um The media team for Trump there was already you know a meeting that they had on the Sunday before where the family said that hey We want them to bring cameras to take pictures Um at the site. This is one of the pictures for example Um, we're not supposed to be taking pictures But because one of the parents of the fallen were not able to be there They wanted pictures so that way they could share the experience Um, and you know how mainstream media does what they do Best which is just lots of fucking everybody Um, but another news so that that happened, but that's not even the stories. Uh, here's them the the main story Um, we know that com com queen Uh, and uh, Timmy to the walls They're they haven't done a press interview in like over a month Well now they're doing one and they're getting blasted for it Harris and wall sits down for first major television interview of their presidential campaign Um, so vice president comah Harris and her running mate Uh, we'll sit down Thursday for their first major television interview of their presidential campaign as the duo travels in Southeast Georgia on a bus tour Uh, they're doing the interview with Dana Bash from CNN um And the problem is is that It was supposed to just be comah And now she's doing it with Tim walls Uh, which even Anderson Cooper from CNN um said that that's going to decrease the amount she's gonna be pressed because now she has her cover buddy with She's not gonna be impressed anyway. It's a fucking CNN. It's Dana. It's Dana Bash It's Dana Bash the fucking mean darkheaded one. No, she's the blonde uh, the weird looking blonde. She did the debate with uh, Trump and Biden That other one looks like the devil Which one that darkhead one With the fucking Unibrow the asshole. Yeah, she's an asshole. Yeah, I know you tell me. Yeah, she's an asshole. She could be cute But she's just so fucking mean. I think that's a stretch. You have to play you have to do some work up here You know, it's a lot of beer. We're to that bird. It's a lot of beer. Yeah, I'm drinking in a ball. It's up top Yeah, yeah, it is it is the cat of the maker's mouth. It's like a whole bottle But uh, but yeah, even Harris uh, Anderson Cooper jumped in on this thing Paul Talk about the interview tomorrow that's gonna be airing Dana Bash is doing it here for CNN. It's Harrison walls Harris is obviously being criticized by some for not doing the interview solo If you think she should have done her first major interview since accepting the nomination alone I don't know how long this interview is going to be but obviously with two people It does eat up the time that a reporter can ask her directly questions and follow up with her directly um So you have that happened and the same way that happens apparently now Harris is in the lead over Trump In polls by rotors who the fuck believes that Who believes that like you go up and down the street dude of anywhere any of these videos Anybody's doing that are street walking videos and they ask anybody who they're voting for and they are saying fucking Trump Like you ask anybody it Dude, they're over sampling the Democrats to create a false poll It's it's just insane. The church hasn't spoken to anybody in over a month Didn't they didn't they photoshop like a photo of a crowd in front of like a plane? I think they got Well, there was some stuff about it. The plane being like AI generator or something. Yeah, there was there was something about that I don't know I couldn't find the actual like you know what was I know for sure what well that was Inclusive because some people were saying it was some I don't know But I'll tell you what for sure they're doing I know this for sure because I got people on the ground at these events Is they're taping off like So at at events, you know, they'll put these big drapes down to make this to block off all the empty seats And when they went to they saw Dean everybody gets to one area Yes, and when they went to Milwaukee during the the DNC they tried to make it look like they sold out the Chicago venue And then they had overflow at Milwaukee and Milwaukee they coordinated all off to one section and and just did it for TV And I know that for a fact because I had friends that are I'm not gonna say what they do, but they were there And they said I got a video. Yeah, no, it's insane. That's fucking I showed you the video right? Yeah, I seen it I'm not gonna put it up there because I don't want to burn who sent my I don't want to burn my contacts People believe everything they fucking see in the internet. That's what's for there's so much deception It's it's really insane the crazy and it's not Russian disinformation. It's our own fucking government. It does it I think the worst part about it like I just can't get over the fact that like bro like two months ago People fucking hate it. They still hate her bro. Listen. They still hate her. It's all fucking fake that listen dude I'm telling you it is all fake People still hate her and they actually hate her more all right When we get they are What is going on here is they are propping her up in the media. They're using deceptive techniques in every way shape or form They are fucking with the polls by oversampling Democrats and not sampling a actual Fair unbiased group of people to create the perception that it's close enough so they could fucking cheat That's what the fuck this is about. It's not about anything other than that and and dude nobody likes her She's not she can't talk she she has no policy bro. They don't even have a policy. They said oh our policy would be published after The election So there was there was like another video so she was like Everyone has to be more woke Yeah, like be well. I'm like I go woke. Oh broke dude like that's fucking crazy. Yeah people are over it dude And I think the longer I think the more they push with this like obnoxiously Deceptive and fake shit The more the people who were Democrats who were like this is fucked up are being like damn dude look how bad they really are It's like it's dude it it really is it's like when you grow up and you have like an uncle that you always like thought was cool And then you figure out a little bit you're like brand this guy's kind of fucked up and then you start watching it Yeah, but then you start watching them and then you're like holy shit dude my uncle's a total degenerate Like you start seeing the truth when you like open yourself up to it And so there's a lot of these people who are who are opened up to it now Who are the more they push the more they're realizing that this is total bullshit So I would argue if they were pulling the exact same way as they did four months ago I bet you she has less of approval rating now than she then she did that Which was like 27% yeah Do I think another thing too a lot of the stuff that an astronomer come back now is like even just the shit with COVID You know, I'm saying how bad was COVID up there for you because you were in New Jersey New Jersey I used to get I That the whole mass thing was the most unbelievable fucking thing in the world and the and the the the craziest part was like Going to a restaurant and having it on and then sitting down and take it off That's like having a pissing section in a fucking swimming pool. Yeah So Bro And then and the virus is so smart. It's an intelligent by yeah, it's not it's not it's it's like it's everywhere Like they flew around the booth in Paraglyres over the border still wear it though to this day in cars alone Oh my god, bro think how psychologically like manipulated and fuck that person has to be oh, yeah, 100% I can't really believe that like they're gonna die from yes, it's sad dude.
