What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate goodbye to the lies the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome the mother fucking reality guys today We have Andy and DJ cruise the motherfucking internet. That's what we do. That's what CTI stands for cruise the internet. This is our society culture current event show We think it's comedy you may not think so, but that's what it is This is where we throw topics up on the screen we speculate on what's true We speculate on what's not true and then we talk about how we the people can be the solution of the problem other times You tune in we have shows within the show we have Q and a F That's where you get to submit questions and we give you the answers these questions could be about anything But typically they're about business entrepreneurship and personal development. That's the core foundation of this show You could submit your questions a couple different ways the first way is guys you can email your questions and to ask Andy at Andy for solar.com Or you can go on YouTube and you can go on the Q and a F episodes and you can drop your question right there in the comments And we'll pick some from there as well if you're not subscribed to YouTube You should go subscribe because we have some new concepts that are dropping In fact the first one will be this Sunday So this coming Sunday there will be a new concept that I'm going to drop on YouTube and if you're not subscribed You should go subscribe Other times on the show we have real talk real talk is five to twenty minutes of me just giving you some real talk Other times we have full length full length is where we have my friends or other interesting characters come on the show and We talk Shocking all right, and then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus is where people who have completed 75 hard And taking back control their life come on the show tell their story talk about how they were before How they are after and what their life is like now that they have actually learned the skill sets that this program provides If you're unfamiliar with 75 hard it is the world's biggest most successful mental toughness transformation program Let's be real the reason you're not where you want to be in life isn't because you don't know what to do It's because you lack the skill sets to actually do it and that's what this program teaches you So if you are interested in 75 hard it is not a challenge It is a program it is actually part of a bigger program called live hard And 75 hard just happens to be the first phase of it you can get that all of it for free an episode 208 on the audio feeds There's also a book called 75 hard that you can buy off my website It's unnecessary, but if you're somebody who likes to know all the ins and outs and the wise and how to's how I do it It's a great book to read. I think you'll enjoy it a lot I also have a new book coming out Which will launch on January 1st that you're going to want to keep an eye out for that I'm going to start letting you guys kind of know what we got coming up here on the show But the the newest thing is this YouTube drop that we're going to drop on Sunday So make sure you go over there and click subscribe for all the information that we give now guys Those of you that don't know I'm not just a podcaster or a supplement seller or a youtuber or whatever the internet calls me a right wing extremist I'm none of those things actually. I'm just an entrepreneur who has built many different companies over the course of the last 24 and 3 quarters years and I give the information of what I've learned and how I've done it For free on this show and I ask that all you do is Support me support my companies and support us by sharing the show a lot of you guys come to me You say hey, this message needs to be heard and needs to be out there I'm asking you to engage in part of the army here to get this message out all right, so don't be a hoe show the show All right, hey, what's up? Hey, how's it going? It's going good man. Yeah. Yeah, how you doing? I'm all right man Came off a training weekend, you know, I guess we got a got a train every now and then you mean like security stuff Tactical stuff. Yeah, it was cool though. I had a nighttime fighter course I thought you guys ever asked me to go you don't want to show up Basically, yeah, basically you don't you want to actually seem to be valuable that happens bro I'd lose my job. That's right cuz I could take care of my own stuff So I'm gonna see people don't understand dude. They don't understand what the security is actually for it's not for you It's not for me. I know it's for you So no, it was good though. You got a good weekend. Yeah, I don't yeah, I think so I don't remember what I did Yeah, I just did my stuff. No bullshit. Yeah, man like every day for me is the same shit like it's weekend No, it's like you know, I we don't have kids because it just didn't work out for us. It's not our thing So like you know every day is kind of the same thing. I I did go to cars and coffee How was that the first a second time this year? That's a record for me. It was really cool Um All the bro it's so cool. I think I said this last time I went But it's so cool because like all the people who are into these car shows like the they they're ambitious people right like their goal is to One day have cars and own cars and experience cars and so what I enjoy the most about it is you know Talking to all the young bucks who are out here trying to build stuff do stuff create things um And I don't know it kind of fills me up when I go there man. It gives me hope for the next generation You know because we talk a lot about how you know the school systems are all messed up and it's true They are and we talk a lot about how you know a lot of the youth is confused on how things are and that's true Um, but at the end of the day man, you know when I go to these events and I get to like I spend typically you know Three four hours there and try to talk to everybody that wants to talk I leave Feeling very hopeful for what we have coming down the pipe because a lot of these young people are very hungry and very ambitious And the questions they ask me are not like necessarily about what car I happen to bring But the questions are very much so like what do you think about this or what do you think about that or what would you do if you were in this situation and like hearing these 14 15 16 17 year old kids Ask me real questions about the direction that they're trying to take like it makes me realize like I like I spoke about on on yesterday's show I really need to do a better job of showing my actual success Because the last few years I haven't And it's created this vacuum where people think that I'm just always hardcore work in work work work work work And they don't see the prize of it And it's you know, there's then you need to see both and so it was cool I brought out a very special car that I've had for over a year now that I really haven't brought in public and People freaked out about it So it was cool. Yeah, you know, it's it's funny And I'm sure you think the same way or you feel the same way, but like I like seeing those like you know Those seven to ten year old kids when they see those cars and I see them light up I'm like, you're up. There's another business right there. Yeah, right? Like that like that guy's gonna grow up and employ somebody because of what he just saw Yeah, and a lot of people don't get that man, you know when they look at cars or they look at someone who who drives cars or into cars they they see it differently, you know like they see it as somebody who's just trying to show off and bro Let's be real. Yeah, it's cool to pull up somewhere and get out of something badass. They're it's cool as fuck and like really you Probably wish you did too you wish you had it, okay? But the truth of the matter is is that really has nothing to do with it. That's a very small amount that Some people tend to focus on In reality You know cars for the people who understand cars is a true passion It's something that brings people together and one of the things that I enjoy about cars the most is the culture that comes along with it Because it's a very positive culture and it's a very supportive culture um And it's it's really honestly like it's it's very similar to what we have here at first form where Everybody wants everybody else to win Everybody's helping each other win, you know some might some people I do business with I've met through cars, you know what I mean? So like People a lot of people don't get it, but I love it and I had a great time and it was the best part was talking all the guys You know you don't drink the coffee though No, I'm not calm right? Yeah, just there for the car. Yeah, I drink water. Yeah Yeah sweet, man. Well, uh Let's get into it man. We got some interesting stuff out there guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to any for seller.com you can find them there If you're watching YouTube jump down in the description below you can find them linked there as well So with that being said man, let's get right into our first headline panel number one reads Donald Trump in court civil trial gets underway Now this is like The talk of the town day a lot of a lot of our users actually been calling us telling us we need to cover this so Yeah, Donald Trump's in court. So let's look over these fast facts. This is from Fox News. Okay So it says Trump invoked his fifth amendment rights during the first deposition in august 2022 I remember that that was hilarious because we're going through question my question and he divided it to his lawyer right it was cool However, he did answer questions during the second deposition in April of 2023 judge author and goren ruled last week the former president trump and his company deceived banks insurers and others by massively Overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork Okay, now Trump's legal spokeswoman Elena Habba said in a recent statement that the judges ruling is quote fundamentally flawed at every level And call the Trump organization quote an American success story Now a New York appeals court narrowed state attorney general of tisha james civil lawsuit against the Trump family in June dismissing evonka trump as a defendant and deciding that the statute of limitations would prevent her from suing for alleged fraud Okay, now they went into recess I'm at the time of the recording, but Trump of course being trump made a couple of choice statements Dog in the judge, okay, so one of the EC says quote this rogue judge refuses to acknowledge that we won 80% of this case in the appellate division Trump said claimant engoran has quote contempt for his own court system He continued saying quote the judge is wrong the judge is wrong in his ruling Trump said Quote he said mara loggo is worth 18 million. It's worth at least a billion Maybe 1.5 billion Trump's lawyer had no previously pointed to james promises to voters That she would quote get trump if elected that was a really really big deal of the case um Trump didn't stop there he even moved to call the judge a democrat operative Getting away with murder now You got that going on and I don't know if you guys saw this but merit garland He also went in on an interview for 60 minutes Denies charges against Donald Trump are linked to 2024 campaign Releases he said in that interview saying quote the justice department has general practices about not making significant overt steps or charging within a month or so of an election and we are clearly outside that time frame in these cases Garland said in the interview with cbs 60 minutes Uh, he's continue saying quote Prosecutors special counsel they follow the facts and the law where they lead yeah This is a very deceiving statement because what he's saying when he says the justice department has general practices about not making significant overt steps or charging within a month or so of election And we are clearly outside of that time frame in these cases That means nothing because they understand the court process is going to drag on from now and through the election cycle So in my opinion This is actually just showing that they understand more about what they're doing not less right this shows that it's more intentional What what's more damaging? Introducing charges a month before the election or a year and a half before the election and then letting a drag through the pre-election cycle Right because that's exactly what they're doing correct. So he's telling on himself here 100% dude and like there's a saying bro Like nobody knows how to break laws better than a lawyer And that's all these guys aren't they know exactly what they're doing man. Yeah, I know exactly what they're doing And they also assume that everybody watching and listening is literally a fucking moron Well, here's the thing though. So I mean in the most recent uh you go of survey Trump's doing just fine. And he's gonna continue to do fine I agree and I think the more they do this the bigger his following is gonna get Yeah, so I mean with all of this stuff going 80 can you break it down for us a little bit because I'm green I don't know much about net worth. I don't you know, but break this down. What exactly is happening? Well, well look okay This is a very dangerous thing and nobody's really understating. I don't think that most people are really taking the Perspective that I take when I look at this you know when we talk about net worth all right You have to understand that you fill out a piece of paper that says what are you worth? Okay, and whenever you put on that paper That's debatable. It doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter if you're Trump It doesn't matter if you're you guys listening or me or anybody or any of these people even pressing charges If we were able to turn this same microscope onto these people and look at their personal finances We could make the same accusations that they're making of Trump. We could say hey your house that costs $500,000 is actually only worth $18,000 because that's what they're doing to Trump Marlago is not worth 18 million and anybody who's looked at real estate here Understands that if you go down and you look at Palm Beach real estate. There are a number of comparable properties That you can look at right and when I say comparable I mean they're not the same as Marlago, but they will give you an idea of what the property is actually worth when you go right across the street And you see properties that are I don't know one fucking third the size or one tenth the size going for 50 60 70 80 100 150 million dollars and then you have this massive estate Palm Beach where that estate is located is some of the most valuable real estate in the United States If not the most valuable. It's definitely in the conversation so to say that Marlago is worth 18 million is Is absurd. Yeah, I also don't think it's worth 1.5. No, I don't think so either. I think that Three years ago, maybe could have been argued that but the truth of the matter is the value of that property is up for debate But it certainly is not 18 million. No, okay It's way closer to 1.5 billion than 18 million like way closer for sure You know for me when you look at that property and I'm assessing it to me it looks like it's somewhere between You know 408 hundred million dollars. That's what it looks like to me um I could be wrong. I don't even know how big Marlago how big is Marlago Because I've never actually been there so I could be completely wrong Okay, it's 17 acres in the most expensive real estate. There's two acre properties down there going for 150 million dollars exactly Okay, so maybe it is close to what Trump saying it might be a billion dollar property for real Okay, it's certainly not 18 million That to equate that to your like our math out here in the real world, okay $500,000 house that would be like them coming to you guys and saying your $500,000 house is actually worth $18,000 that's the level of difference that we're talking about and it's probably worse than that Okay, so the danger here Is kind of twofold in the way they're eight the way they're able to Show this and do this out in front of people's eyes and people not be super and rage like Trump is is because they want us financially illiterate and most people are this is why they don't teach us financial literacy in high school uh and They can get away with things like this because most people don't know the difference between a millionaire Someone who earns a million dollars someone who manages a million dollars worth of assets Like these things can be looked at by many different angles by many different ways So like the actual net worth of a human being is up for debate no matter who right like if someone were to come and evaluate My company for what it's worth there would be people that would say it's worth a billion dollars There would be people that would say it's worth five or six billion dollars And the argument is where in between does that go right so We can we can say it's this or satirist this but ultimately the market tells the truth Okay, and the market can change the market two years ago is not the same as the market now So what will the market actually pay if Mar-a-Lago was for sale today all right That's what the actual worth is and because it's not for sale. There's no way to tell It's not the big thing like I mean what this whole thing is like he's not playing like there's no intentions on sale But but but what they're saying and this is where people need to understand what's actually happening here What they're doing is they're going around and saying all right trump got all these loans from all these banks over the course of many many years He lied on his application his personal financial statement and That makes him a fraud even though he has paid all those loans. He has always done good business He has always done all these things This would be like you Feeling out of personal financial statement on your first house trying to get a loan and you getting a loan paying off your entire house And then then coming back later and saying Uh, we're gonna fucking sue you because you lied on the application by fucking $2,000 you understand? Yeah This is very dangerous and it sets a very dangerous precedent And this is my angle of seeing this. This is how I see this okay People are missing the point if they can do this to the president of the United States What can they do to you and me and anybody else if they don't like what you say or they don't like what you stand for or they Don't like the way you commented on something on social media or they don't like your tweets What could they do to you? That's the danger of the precedent being set here and it's being set because the actual financial literacy of the average American is Intentionally kept at a very low level so that they can do things like this This is why what we talk about the solution of these problems You don't hear me say violent revolution you hear me say personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion Because for us to not be taken advantage of we have to become intelligent Right? Oh, but this shit is confusing and it's made confusing intentionally So they don't teach us about it and then they make it really hard to understand. Why would they do that? Well, because their asset is our debt or our debt is their assets So when we go out in the real world and we make stupid ass financial decisions because we don't know any better And I'm just taking a stab in the dark I would say most of you listening to this right now have probably made a few financial mistakes Why did you make them because you didn't know why didn't you know because they didn't teach you? Why didn't they teach you they didn't teach you because they want you to make these mistakes because every time you make one of them You make them richer and you enslave yourself Yeah, man So it's a big fucking problem, bro. I think I'll talk about that too, man. People got to remember too. It's like You know, it's what we allude to it. We're beginning of this topic They want to keep this man's name Orange man bad in front of as many people's faces As much of the time of the day as they possibly can't like to try to you know propagate this narrative around it None of this shit's gonna stick. That's not that good. See here's what those people are understanding If this does stick or this does go through and Let's say someone I don't know Like me would eventually become president You bet your ass. I will take out the trash on the same fucking laws that they're allowing to be set as the president right now That's the danger for them. They don't get it yet. Yeah, they're setting their own president correct and here's the thing If they cheat and we don't And they're willing to do unethical things and we're not Guess who fucking wins and who loses? They win and we lose They're playing a different game than we're playing these people are playing a complete different game than we're playing We're out here pretending like we're virtuous Good-hearted Americans and all this shit, bro Sometimes good-hearted people got to do real ugly shit to make sure that these people can't do things And here's the thing that you're not considering These people think that those good people are them They think that the alternative is so bad That literally any action is justified to protect democracy Which we all know democracy does not mean democracy democracy. Democracy means mob rule Okay, we're a constitutional republic We obey the constitution and one of the things the constitution says is that we actually have a duty to overthrow people Just like this So when that line up starts to appear it's gonna get real interesting. Yeah, for sure, man They don't say you can Don't say you should they say you have a duty What's that mean you have to Now guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think on this topic using hashtag no change So it was our first headline, man, let's let's keep this cruise moving But before we get into our second headline as always man, let's cruise some comments sweet Let's see what we got out there guys this first comment or I'm sorry.

It's out there. Okay You get a guy a little more creative with the name. Yeah, listen. I mean it does look like you It looks just like you that's my Halloween mask. Yeah Yeah, we guys just keep this shot moving. We got headline number two headline number two reads McCarthy rolls the deep state advances government funding plan the cuts off Ukraine cash So the shutdown was a verdict overt it for 45 days But there's some interesting stuff happening here. So let's let's talk about it So this bight bar article reads speaker Kevin McCarthy scored a shocking victory over the deep state Saturday by securing house passage Of a 45-day stop gap bill to keep the government open and cut funding for Ukraine McCarthy's victory seemed almost impossible as recently as this morning amid disagreements inside his own conference Uh, and a willingness among Democrats to shut down the government over Ukraine funding Uh, yet as it became clear that momentum for a stopgap continuing resolution or CR Uh, without Ukraine funding was building panic Democrats began utilizing delay tactics including a long filibuster Uh, speech from a norty leader he came Jeffries Um, so you know, we stopped it but dude. Did you see you see this shit about the fire alarm getting pulled Yeah, I saw a little bit of it dude That really happened that really that really because he was saying that he actually just went in a door and and went off Well So these people are like legitimately pulling fire alarms during votes Yeah, so so this had only squad dim faces calls for expulsion after pulling fire alarm mocked for ludicrous Explanation So representative Jamal Bowman a Democrat out of New York will face an expulsion resolution after a video surface showing him pulling a Fire alarm as the house prepared to vote on a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown Uh, Bowman was seen pulling the fire alarm over the weekend ahead of a crucial house vote in one of the house representatives three office buildings Uh, it happened just after Republicans announced they would rush a stopgap spending bill known as a continuing resolution or a CR to the house floor on Saturday just as the Senate was weighing its own proposal Uh, since the incident Uh, Bowman has been accused of pulling the alarm purposefully uh to delay the vote Although he has adamantly denied these claims Um, here's the thing Andy New picks Throw cold water representative Jamal Bowman's excuses for pulling fire alarm and house building so his excuses are going up in smoke This is a new You write that one now Show me for that too My fucking wants trophy for writing this shit Oh shit wait, let's see what this article. No, not me Nope, Jorge Fitzgibbon. Yeah, that's a nice name Jorge I don't see it All right, yeah, so images The representative Jamal Bowman pulled in the house office building as his fellow Democrats were trying to delay a key vote to fund the government appeared to throw cold water on his claims that the move was just a bone head mistake Uh, so here's the picture of him pulling the alarm. These are the doors. Okay Um, in the doors they have signs on them that says emergency exit only the sign reads here Here's here's a good picture of the door. There's the fire alarm that he pulled Okay, and bright red letters There's a better picture of that right so his statement you mean like every other fire alarm that we've ever seen in the history of time Like the schools that he was a principal that he knows exactly what he's like these long two Right, so this let's hear a statement. So this statement uh, he wrote this. I don't x He says quote today as I was rushing to make a vote I came to a door that is usually open for votes, but today would not open Bowman said in the statement Um, he continued saying quote I am embarrassed to admit that I activated the fire alarm mistakenly thinking it would open the door I regret this and sincerely apologize for any confusion this caused He About to lose his bro. This guy should go to jail. Oh 100% you should go to jail for this I'm glad you said that Andy because here's the thing he's facing up to 30 years for doing that Yeah, you should listen dude. These people are enemies of America They have infiltrated our Congress because we have failed to pay attention over the last 10 to 12 years All right, we have radical extreme communist people in our Congress right now that are willing to do anything and everything To push their agenda forward and they don't They are not going to stop there is going to be no I feel bad or We're going to slow down or this or that because dude these people understand that the pendulum is now swinging back to common sense And they understand what's going to happen to them for all the things that they have done a specifically the last Four years, okay, there's going to be accountability These people are willing to do whatever they can to make sure that they don't lose Which is what I've been saying and you've been saying on the show for years Because they understand that the accountability to be had is going to be harsh and is going to be steep And for some of these people it could include literal death So they are going to do whatever they need to do and that includes another pandemic that includes war That includes whatever they have to do because what would you do if you knew That if these other people came in and gained power You were likely to spend the rest of your life in prison or actually be executed What would for the crimes you committed? What would you be willing to do to make sure that the other team doesn't get back in power and the answer is anything and everything Which is what makes this time Super dangerous for all of us These people are radical extremists and everything they say everything they point at and say You're this or you're that That's what they are They are masters of gaslighting. They are masters of projection They we can see the stuff happening. They say it's not happening. You're imagining it Biden goes on TV every single day and talks about Bydynamics when every single American statistically is in a worse place Okay The average credit card defaults are at an all-time high all right the amount of difference in expenses for the average American family is $9,000 per year to live How can you come up with an extra $9,000 if you're making $60,000? $50,000 $40,000 a year That's a quarter of your income That these people have Expunged out of people's lives and they have the nerve to go on TV and say oh this is great everything is going well Jobs are being created thinking that people forgot about how the economy was shut down for two fucking years And what they're actually doing is giving us the data on the jobs that are coming back Not actual new jobs being created and they think that we are stupid And this is going to continue and it's going to continue over and over and over until these people are held accountable And it's up to us the citizens of this country to call for accountability and to demand accountability These people are traders they do not care about America. They do not care about you They only care about themselves and their agenda Which they believe is the right thing to do which makes them extremely dangerous Because nobody is more dangerous than a person that is really dumb that believes they're doing the exact right thing Also doesn't mind doing whatever is necessary to get the result that they want you understand That include over the history of human beings This is why wars start this is why genocides happen like people say oh Genocides, you know, why does this happen because the people that are doing the genociding Believe it is actually the right thing and people do not understand this in this country We give everybody the benefit of doubt we give everybody the high road We we do not call things for what they are and it's put us in a very dangerous situation because these people have the power right now Which means they have the power to start a war Which means they have the power to release another pandemic which means they have the power to keep the borders open Uh instigate crime All of these things inflate the currency these people have the power to destroy America right now Because we have been looking in other places for the last 12 years It's very very dangerous and they think they're doing the right thing and I think what's happening here is they're kind of crossing the The Rubicon so to speak meaning they are they are now having to buy fully in that what they've done is wrong And they understand now they're playing defense and if they don't play defense it's going to be literal Life in prison or death from yeah, so I we're in a very dangerous spot dude over the next year especially Year in four months. It's it's extremely dangerous to be an American like I'm not throwing anything off the table I think these people are capable of burning the world down and I think that's what they'll do if they think they're gonna lose Yeah, brother rule over the ashes Yeah, I mean, I that's my opinion man. I don't know I You know you guys let us know what you think but that's for my observations You guys who have been listening for the number of years that we've been doing really since 2019 I mean how many times have I missed the mark how many times have we missed Not very many and so I I'm very concerned about the next year year and half now I'm going to approach it as if things are going to get better I'm going to work as hard as I can I'm going to be the best I can I'm going to act as if Things are going to get better and if we all do that and we all live our lives that way things will probably get better Because we control the culture. This is why we talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion and that culture change rebellion versus You know guns and and grenades type thing you know what I mean like this is this is about changing culture and if we change culture the politics will change so You know, I'm gonna go as hard as I can With the understanding that things are gonna get better and if they don't we'll deal with it 100% man guys like again, he said let us know what you guys think in the comments Let us know using hashtag stop drop roll this guy should definitely go to jail for this 100% I mean Here that's gonna be the interesting thing is whether they hold that line right because I mean I don't think they're gonna No, there's no way they will but I'm just saying like I mean the the court of public opinion. I mean We see what they do with the JCX prisoners, right? We see how they're still doing it and then what they're still doing for insurrection This is no different. This is no different Um and the laws are very very clear. We ask you this see they're very very clear Let me ask you this if you're willing to pull a fake fire alarm To stop a vote Are you willing to fake a pipe burst to stop a vote counting? That's not good. Yeah That's one of our flag words are you are you are you if you're willing to pull a fake fire alarm to stop a vote Are you willing to intentionally sabotage voting machines in Arizona in the governor race so people can't vote? You see what I'm saying? The votes have they tried pull on bro. This is how they operate people don't understand this like this is what you guys have to understand This is what these people fucking do It's what they do They're not if we continue to play a game Where we are taking the high road and we understand that they do not we will lose that game we will lose that game If we were playing baseball and we said we don't take steroids because we don't believe in steroids We're better than steroids and every other motherfucker out there is taking steroids. Guess what? You're gonna lose and That's what we're dealing with and we're dealing with this virtuous mentality and this I'm better than this mentality From the American people when in reality sometimes you got to get in the fucking fight Sometimes you got to beat the shit out of people Sometimes you got to get your hands dirty Sometimes you got to do ugly shit to win and this is one of the times where the people of America should not turn the other cheek And they should say this is this is bullshit and we're gonna not stand for it and You know, I hate to say this, but I don't think we're there yet I don't think we're there people know no, but well, I don't even think so as our audience of the show All right, I come on here for three and a half fucking years and I ask you guys to share the show Where will we be where would culture be if you had shared every single show this entire time where will we be Where we be because I'm doing my part bro. I come in here every day and give it fucking everything I got I tell people what to do how to defeat this what's happening and I've been right the whole time That basically guys let's get to our third and final headline headline number three There's a number three reads Meet the farmer union boss who is Gavin Newsom's senate replacement for the late Diane fine-steen So she died So that was a thing. Yeah, somehow she stole I think voted the day after that the day before it was the day was it Yeah, the day before she'd asked yeah, super weird But I also saw some stuff that apparently her daughter had power of attorney Which means she shouldn't ever voted to begin with At listen bro, they don't keep people that are above 65 years of age should not serve in our government I'll help you one. I don't think they should be able to drive well, I That I think I think taking a driver's test on a regular basis after the age of 65 Let's say every two years an actual test. I think that's in a that's required Gonna month rope no because bro. I'm going to be 65 In 15 fucking years you start smelling like mothballs no fucker. I'm driving till I'm fucking dead And there ain't nothing anybody can do about it. No cop no fucking law no fucking yeah you not anybody Nobody can do shit about it. So like you know, it is what it is. That's real shit um This this whole scenario Of elderly people who Are incapable of thinking talking being Aware this would be like your oldest relative who you have over for thanksgiving that everybody ignores and everybody kind of just like sits over there in the corner Literally making What That's what happens exactly. They just sit in a little chair. That's right Okay, yeah, and then asking them to vote on the fucking laws Okay, that's dangerous shit. It is like bro. This is not cool. No like we are led. We are led by a bunch of people Who have lived their lives these people have lived their lives you you guys fucking sucked and I'm gonna say something else to you generation of like 55 and over people you fucked our entire country bro. You guys fucked it up Okay, you came in with these parenting strategies and all this bullshit and you didn't hold the line and now our country's fucked Okay, you guys are in you guys inherited a country that was beautiful a country that had good laws and Order and all of these things great economy great of opportunity for prosperity and you guys of that next generation older than me You fucked us bro, and that's that should be the failure of your mother fucking life Because now we got to clean it to fuck up. It's fucking bullshit And do to pisses me off to think about it like when I see old people now I get fucking angry because like you guys didn't speak up You didn't fucking fight for what's right you let your kids do whatever they want You've fucked our entire shit up man, and we're trying out here now Now I have to give up my life at 40 something years old to talk about this shit when I work my whole life To become successful so I could just go do what I want to do Road that's wrong and it's I'm tired. I'm tired of pretending I'm tired of pretending it's okay, and these people who are 65 70 75 80 they have no business in our government whatsoever We need a revolution of youth and fresh ideas and people with experience Bro ideally it should be 35 to 65 for people to serve in the government. That's what it should be. Yeah, okay It's absurd and these old people It's it a 90-year-old woman, bro who can't think who can't talk who can't Function as a human being having some of the greatest power in our country. Do it. Does anybody else see a problem with that? Nobody else. He's the like what the fuck are we talking about dude like this is real shit You got a president in the United States who is literally shitting his pants on television It's a problem. Yeah, and dude And everybody's acting like it's fine. Yeah, and these people the reason they're destroying our country is because they're looking out for their useless kids And those useless fucking kids are the keep the people who literally created this scenario that we're living in 55 year-old. Yes And they're doing all these corrupt deals with all these 40-year relationships scratch each other's backs Bro, our country is a fucking fake country. It is a fraud What they say that we are is not what we are we are not of the people by the people for the people we are of these old people By these old people for these old people who are eventually gonna die who are trying to run corrupt deals and put their kids in a position to carry on the legacy No different than a royal family in the old times like that's what we're dealing with it's a cabal Yeah, these people are fucks and their tyrants and their traders to us all of us the people Yeah, what did you see who replaced her? Yeah, so they so I know I know he said he said he was going to replace her with a with a black woman Okay, which is racist this fuck Okay, like I'm sick of acting like this isn't racist. Yeah, this is fucking racist Okay, when you choose someone because of the color of their skin And now by the way the supreme court agrees with me When you choose someone for the color of their skin that is racism whether that skin be white or black or anything else Okay, so to for a group for a governor of a state To openly say Replacement is going to be a black woman is incredibly racist and insulting to anybody who isn't black Who happens to be qualified for the job in any way shape or form if we don't get back to a meritocracy And we don't start calling out this racism for what it is Okay, we're going to ruin the country because people who are qualified to do things are being rejected for people who are Unqualified to do things based upon the color of their skin now I don't know about you guys, but let's say the NFL was run that way What would it look like slow and no point okay? There wouldn't be a very good product and that's the closest thing that I can fucking admit to okay If the white dudes ain't good enough and it's all the black dudes that put up the points play the black dudes I don't give a fuck. I don't fucking care in fact it makes for way better product But in whatever situation What is that that's how racist? It's what you said it it's faster. It's fucking Okay, I'm with you. Yeah, I'm with you. Yeah, bro It's reality. Yeah, I don't give a fuck what color you are bro. You can either play or you can't play I put the best on the field. That's it and that's what America's built upon and I don't give a shit without you guys think You guys think that's racist. I don't care. Everybody calls me racist for even being fucking bored No, it's not racist and the thing it's a very obvious thing that everybody understands And so it's like you know if we can do that with our sports Why wouldn't we take that same approach with companies because people with pussies? That's what it is man That's why because people don't want to say the truth white people don't want to say hey that ain't fucking right Yeah, and then the crazy thing is like win those people who are unqualified get in those positions and continue to fuck things up You can't say why they fuck things up Oh, it's because they're black. No, it's because they were unquiet because you're not good enough for the job Yes, and for the last 10 years bro, there's been this immense pressure to be inclusive Okay, well, we should be inclusive on the skill set. Are you good enough to play? Are you good? Bro, nobody talks about this in sports. Yeah, no the only sport they talk about it is hockey Why is that because most people are white and hockey that's why so what the fuck are we talking? So we're gonna make hockey more black for the sake of black But we're not going to make basketball more white for the sake of white or NFL more white for the sake of white That's racism. Yeah, okay, and I'm not for any of it. I'm not for any of it I think the best hockey players should play I think the best football players should play and I think most people agree with that Most people want to be entertained by the best and I think the best people should be in your company If you own a company and you don't have the best people playing in those positions You're a fucking idiot. You're gonna lose. Yeah, you're gonna fucking lose And it's gonna be your whole life because you believe some virtuous shit that ain't even true Okay, I'm of the I'm of the opinion that It doesn't matter what fucking skin color you are. That's my position on it But I am going to also point out the hypocrisy of these scenarios because it's very clear It's very open and nobody wants to talk about it. Y'all call me racist anyway. I don't give a fuck Okay, fucking call me whatever you want the ribbing being called racist since I was 10 years old because I'm fucking white So I'm give a shit anymore And I don't think most people do either. I think most people are starting to get the fuck over it No, 100% bro. Well the crazy thing is we have the point is bro We have to call it out as the truth on both sides you have to yes, you have to you can't just skirt around it or not say it or No, we can't act like one side of the of the coin It's all these special privileges and it's it bro actual racism Here's what actual racism is actual racism as we Know it to to exist in our day-to-day life is thinking that black people are not capable of becoming skillful on their own and competing on an even playing field That's the fucking racism that actually exists Because that assumes that black people by nature are not as capable as other races Which is fucking not true. It's not fucking true. Can't get IDs Dude, there's a million examples look up on Walgreens or CVS. Well, look man It is Groaches Just cockroaches. I mean all of that For Biden's in bro. It's it infects every ounce of our humor Every every little bit of culture is affected by this We could tell white people jokes all the time and white people laugh at them Yeah, you tell a black joke. That's funny as fuck You know, we all laugh, but some people get pissed You're a racist you're this you're that and by the way the people calling us racist. They're always white. I'm never black Yeah, yeah, bro, listen. I want the I want America back. I want us I want us back Like I'm fucking tired of this shit You know what black people do some funny ass shit so do white people I'm comfortable laughing at both of them In fact, that's what I would enjoy. I think all of you would as well 100% dude this manufacturer shit everybody know I think a lot more people know that now and they're seeing it more and more Um, but the thing with this replacement though, so right? So he replaces Diane fine-sning with this this later her name is Shit I can't even pronounce this one La Fonda Ha La Fonda Butler, okay, La Fonda Butler Um, but there's a lot of interesting things about La Fonda Butler Okay, so she's the president of Emily's list, which is a democratic political action committee dedicated to electing pro abortion Democratic women to office, okay, so you elected her But but there's some issues with this She's she's she's she's not even a resident of California So she he put this lady in the seat that's not even representing the place that she supposed to be representing to begin with and then she tries to cover it up Trouble cover up so La Fonda Butler removes Maryland as residents after Newsom appointment as California senator La Fonda Butler has apparently removed her Maryland residents from her ex account as well as her professional biography after governor Gavin Newsom appointed her to us senate seat in California, which was vacated on September 29th upon the death of senator Diane fine-sning After news broke of her appointment reported Alex Michelson Captured a screenshot of her ex bio which had Maryland as a location is recently a Sunday. So on Sunday her account looked like this Where you see Maryland right there? Yeah, um, the natural of the announcement. She takes it off Hmm now only that it's also been uncovered that California's newest senator La Fonda Butler literally lives in Maryland and is registered to vote there There's the voter registration once even more as even as recent as 31 days ago her FEC filing still lists her active residents in Maryland So aside even from all the color you know optics that they're trying to paint this into That doesn't even make no that means she's part of their operation 100% well What what hold on let's walk this through here mm-hmm what reason would there be To elect this person what a point him or whatever he's doing Who's from some state on the complete other side of the country? What would be the reason You mean acceptable reason one Because there's only one I got it. It's this she's on the fucking team. Oh, I guarantee if you trace back all her bank records and all her donations And all her things they all go right along with the ones that Gavin Newsom got No, I like work for the Clintons Because that's in there listen bro. We're under attack Like this is fucking insane these people are trash bro, and they need to be fucking taken out Yeah, apparently there was talk hashtag take out the motherfucking trash. Is that what we're going with? Yeah, it's long Well, there is in my hashtag. Well, maybe maybe maybe so what are you saying?

Did you make so I took some Jack or jacks links or slim gyms all right and I took some sprinkled cheese Uh, yeah, and I put them in a fucking tortilla and I wrapped the motherfucker up and I threw it in a microwave and it was actually pretty decent It wasn't terrible Yeah, it was like good.
