Are you working the way up? Yeah that's nice. Four up there my. I can watch you to a. You sure I didn't watch you too bigger for the rest of the show. I'm chilling. No I try to wait at least five minutes before I let it out. You try to get me before how do you move up in the ranks of that organization? Well we use data to track a lot of things. And you know there's like. I didn't know if it was like bike stolen or what it was. You know what I'm saying? Well there's a vote. And you got to you know cross like a 53% threshold. Oh yeah. That's racist. All right stop fucking around. We're going to edit all that out. No leave it in. No I'm not. We always do. All right guys don't forget. All right we ask very simply.

Yeah that's right that's it. Yeah it's kind of like the slogan of the show like if you see someone out. And there were some real. He kind of looks like a hoe. Yeah. Oh it looks like a pussy. Yeah oh. Yeah. Look at that guy. You should battle him in a run. Yeah no that's fine. I don't think I could be anybody in a run. Yeah. So you're so California tone. Yeah. Right. And. Pacific. We're exactly. I'm in studio city. In studio city. LA. That's LA. Yeah. All right. Sick man. Is it the first time I'm saying this? This is. This is probably the only reason I came down here. Really? Yeah. I mean we've talked about it before. You said it's hard to get people to come out. It is. Well dude it's hard to get in here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it makes sense. Yeah. It does make sense. It's not our airport here sucks. They're trying to encapsulate the crime. You know what I'm saying? Keep it from spreading. They call our flights. That's it. It's nice though from what I know it's cool. We're just teasing. It's nice. Same as it is. Yeah. Those are good people here. There's great people here. Yeah for sure. And he's here. Here. Yeah. That's got to be all right. They don't claim us. They won't claim you guys. No. No. So bro tell us about like what what you're doing because you like what we just connect on the internet. You met me at a club I was partners in maybe like in 2017 but both of us don't really remember the only reason why I remember is because we had one DM on Instagram. Yeah. That when you came out after you came out that night. Well then I guess yeah I probably must have been having a good time. Maybe so. But you know my man right here is out there one of the top runners in the world he's running where you run 200 300. 256 miles. Yeah. That's right. 40,000 feet of climb. That's insane. Yeah. So how did you get into this dude? I was in the nightclub scene. My life hospitality for a long time went through a fucked up situation got accused of things I never did wrote a whole book on it. My stories on the internet you guys want to go read about it's there. And got sober during that time and when I was writing my book I picked up I never read a full book of my life until that time and I picked up like this guy Rich Rolls book and picked up Goggins book and then I read like maybe 30 books in the next couple of months and then I was kind of like fuck if these guys can run 100 miles 100 mile races I can do this shit. So then that triggered me and then I started just running 100 mile weeks on my treadmill for like nine months straight. And then that next year in 2021 I did my first ultra marathon is a 50k and then just worked my way up from 50k 50 mile or 100k. So when you say 100 so how much were you running when you when I wasn't before. Yeah like when I was on before. A marathon. Yeah that was the most I'd done. I couldn't even fathom doing more than that. I'd met some guys like under marathons and they were like oh I run these ultra's no one what the fuck is that. Yeah no idea what it even was even when I was even into the running game I had no idea what these all they was nowhere it wasn't anywhere near popular at that time. Yeah still people have no idea what the fuck it is. Yeah I remember kind of when that was starting to come around you know we had you know you'd have one or two people be like do this guy ran a hundred miles or whatever and now it's like a thing like there's quite a few people running a hundred miles. We have three or four guys here in the building to do it. All sucks. Everything sucks. I can't fathom it bro. 10 miles today in your humidity today sucked. Yeah. Are you running around? I run every day. I run every single day. I run every single day. I run like maybe 70 to 100 miles a week. Jesus. I try to like lay off the hundred mile weeks because it's not helping me during the races. I just like the grind but it just kind of you're just my body that was taxed. So when you say you like the grind what do you mean. I just like to go suffer every day. Like just go do tough shit and like just feel like shit. I don't know. I understand. Yeah. Yeah. I just like to figure out how fucked up you are. Yeah. I'm pretty fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like to just every time I get out there I'm just like why the fuck am I doing this? Like every time and I'm just like not recovered from the day before and I just feel like shit but I'm just like it's become part of the routine to become like it's like when you put out your little morning statement it's like my morning statement. Yeah. And people are looking for that run. You know. And there's like I'm starting to try to take one day off from running a week. It doesn't mean I take off like working out but I'm trying to give my it's making me run better in the races like when I'm kind of pulling back on the miles. I'm trying to get my like myself out of this fucking mental mode of like wanting to just keep running every single day. Just kind of like let my body recover a little bit. But yeah, just like beating the shit out of my body. Well, I'm curious. I would like to know it's like where like I mean we talk about now right? You got all these these medals you're running these races. Like can we get a little bit more into like what where were you before you became this guy? I wasn't I was drinking and doing drugs a lot of the time I was running a nightclub wasn't happy. Looked happy. Yeah, but there was just nothing fulfilling from that lifestyle and there was just no real purpose or no real angle. It was just like what's the next car going to be the next house? The next girl or like the next nightclub we're going to open. It's just that should get so quick. Sure. And it's just constant chase of impressing people that don't fucking give a fuck about you and nothing great came from it. I made a lot of good connections. I will say that I'm very well connected and I networked a lot but I'd say I met more shittier people than great people in in that light. And like I was say like if you can't be used you're useless and that's how that entire industry works. Once you have nothing to to give people you won't hear. Yeah, I don't care. Then you can fuck. Right. I think that's just people in general man. If people can't get something from someone they're almost invisible. But I feel like people that have things they value like a real friendship with somebody or a real connection with somebody because we don't need anything for these people. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I mean, look dude, we had an office in LA for a long time and I was, you know, I knew a lot of people out there and it was very much so how you describe. But also like I feel like that's just the nature of human beings. I don't necessarily know that it's like the LA scene. I think it's just people. I think people, you know, when they think that they can get something to get ahead, they will play that role and when, you know, they can't, they won't. And I think it's just an opportunist thinking that comes from our culture. You know, we don't have a very, you know, I guess deep culture anymore, you know, when you look at like, like you were saying you have all these things and you're not happy, right? When you look at culture from really at 360 degree view, it's kind of how most people live. You know, it's just on levels of it. You know, there's guys that they want to have another boat or another plane. Then there's people that want to buy another car and then there's, you know, the guy who wants to get the better lawnmower than his neighbor, you know, and it's just, it's all the same psychology. It's just different levels of it. And unfortunately, because of the, I think a big reason because of the internet, especially, it's just accelerated that line of thinking, you know, there's very, there's a, there's a lack of substance. There's a lack of depth. But I also think there's good things to it. I think it also weeds out people who are like that much more easily. I think you can identify that way easier than you used to be able to. There's can only do it to so many people before. Oh shit. You did it to YouTube. Got, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, dude. I just think the world, I think the internet, you know, when we look at it, yeah, it's brought a lot of good. But I think it's, I think it's a net negative for humans. Correct. You know, well, most people aren't winning. They're losing and then they're seeing all the shit on the internet every single day of people winning. Allegedly. Yeah. Right. Well, yeah, whether it's, it's legit or not. Right. And they're just comparing themselves to it every fucking day. It's draining them. Yeah. I think we're all victim of that. I think like we look at what other people are doing at some points like, oh, I should be doing more. I should be doing better. I don't like drown myself in it. But I'm like, oh, I'll see something. I'm like, all right, fuck it. I need to go run another race. I need to just, it actually motivates me. Yeah. Me too. But that's because we're actually doing shit. Yeah. So it's like, if you're moping around sitting around, you're going to look at it and get insecure or get jealous or fucking make a fake account and talk shit to people. Dude, I think, yeah, I just think you have to know who the fuck you are, bro. Yeah. I was talking about this last night to a bunch of my buddies who are all entrepreneurs. You know, we're inundated with information and the reason I say entrepreneurs because it's a competitive thing, just like running or anything. Certain people are wired to compete, man. Certain people are wired to get better. They're wired to push. And we're inundated, unfortunately, right now with victim culture nonsense throughout the entire internet. You know, we have all these fucking stories, all these slides, all these fucking boo-hoo. Look at me, you know, nonsense. You have to live this way. And if you don't, you're this. And if you actually pursue this for yourself, you're not humble or you're out of line with God. You know, we just have a lot of, which is funny because it seems like the most judgment we get are people that think they're aligned with God, which is ridiculous. But the point is is that when you're wired to achieve and you're wired to push and you're wired to do more, the world is the resistance, dude. And everywhere you look, every person you talk to, for the most part is going to be some sort of resistance to that because it's so rare. It is so rare to be somebody who wants more, who's driven for more, who wants to achieve that the rest of the world that you identify with is not going to get it. So it makes you feel lonely and they will say things to you like, well, don't compare, well, motherfucker, I compare all the time. You know what I'm saying? Like, it doesn't make me unhappy. What makes me unhappy is when I try to pretend like I'm like everybody else. Right. When I try to pretend I'm not wired for the fucking fire, dude. Like that's what makes me unhappy. And it took me a long time to realize that, man. You can see that too, like with like what mainstream culture relates to. We're like, I saw this post the other day, they were talking about like Taylor Swift, right? They're like, you know why people like Taylor Swift has nothing to do with her lyrics or her music at all. And I can lay it out like her background, like all the ex boyfriend, she's not married. And like, you know what I'm saying? Like she's going like went through all this thing. Like that's what her fan base relates to. They relate to the woman Taylor Swift is not necessarily to the music or anything. And I think that in the same combo of like just success, like people don't relate to it. So it's like you can't look for any type of support or anything from everybody that's not really doing it. Well, I also think dude that like, you know, you know, take Taylor Swift is a great example. She talks about her losses. She talks about the shit that goes wrong. Dude, like you said, most people are struggling. Most people are losing. And when someone talks about that who's actually winning, it makes winning seem more achievable for them in some way, shape or form, right? Like, yeah, I can have relationships not work out. Yeah, I can have bad breaks and I can still end up in a good spot. And that's a big problem with the internet, dude, because the internet, these people don't share their fucking losses. They make it seem like it's super ease. Yeah, bro. They make it seem like it's super easy. It's, you know, because their own ego can't handle people seeing any sort of like cracks or weaknesses. When in reality, dude, we all know, we all know, bro, like we all know the shit ain't easy. So I just think if people were a little more honest and transparent, it would help a lot of people. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. We got a question in the winning now, too. Huh? We got a question in the winning now, too. Like, is that person actually like to that point? Like they're only showing you the good shit. Yeah. But usually those people aren't because they're just fucking capping. Yeah, because bro, anybody who's actually winning knows the price that has to be paid to win and they respect those losses. They respect the people who are willing to take the L's and continue to move. And that's not something that happens with people who haven't won. People who haven't won that posture as if they won, they pretend like it was easy and that they're special and that they have the skill that no one else has because they don't understand what winning is really about. You know what winning is really about? It's about getting punched in a fucking dick over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and getting back up every single time. That's what the fuck it's about. And then learn how to move like an inch so you don't get quite tired. You know, that's what it's about. And people who don't really go through it, they they they misrepresent it. It's very obvious to people who have. So I don't know man. I you know, I think we were talking to locker room, dude. I think that a big I think a big problem in culture right now is that people think there's people who are wired for hard things and then they think there's people who aren't and they and the people who aren't talk about, you know, you need to have more balance and you need to take it easy and you need to like be like us, right? And you're two you're you're two you're getting two out there and you're not humble and all these things. And then when you look at those people, they're very unhappy. Not winning. No, they're fucking miserable. And so all it is is a lot of miserable people saying, hey, you know what? It would make me more comfortable if you were like me, right? And and the thing is that they miss is that every single human being, whether they admit it or not, is wired for achievement in their own way. They're wired for the pursuit of a mission of a potential of something that matters in their own way. And when when I think when human beings don't pursue something like that, they end up in a place of being completely miserable, like a superficial existence like you were talking about earlier. Like you could have money. You could have cars. You can have a house. You can have girls. You can have all this shit. But if you don't have a real purpose that you're trying to pursue, it's going to always feel empty, you know, and I think people don't really understand or at least don't give themselves enough credit for what they're actually capable of and built for. And if they, if you guys would like, I mean, I know our audience gets it, but like if people would step out and do some shit, they'd realize they're a lot happier doing shit than that. Then they are sit on the couch. That's real. I think sometimes the people that are in it, like I was saying before, like I didn't know any better at that time. I thought that's what I was supposed to be doing. Well, that's what they tell you. Yeah. That's what the world tells you. That's the Hollywood dream. Yeah, right. Exactly. Get rich, get famous, get bitches, fucking party, fucking miserable. Yeah. It's shallow shit, dude. Yeah. So what was the, what was the piece that got you to like, all right, this is not good no more? All kind of just give you a small rundown that that that kind of went down. I think that I wrote about in the book basically. And this is the book, by the way, right? Listen to an audio mask. Basically long story short, a girl left my house with three other people, went in after party somewhere else, after they were party in my house, and then the girl overdosed at the house like five hours later, which I wasn't present at. I didn't give any drugs. I wasn't doing anything with her. Nothing. I was just into the story because when the investigators came to me, I had locker room talk in my phone, but I didn't do anything to the girl. So I didn't delete anything. So I was like, hey, I'm just going to be honest. I'm going to give you everything and I gave it to them. And they're like, okay, cool. You're good. Well, now they have all the screenshots of all my locker room talk. So that goes into police report. Parents get ahold of that. They put out a civil lawsuit and twist all of my texts. I have nothing to do with their daughter pretty much and made me look like a scumbag. And that's how I got twisted in. And I went through like a whole cancel culture situation in 2020 when they were bullshit and us with all the COVID stuff and everyone. That's when everyone was scared locked in their house. It was like April 1st. It was like right around that time and then no one had anything better doing it. I don't think the word cancel culture even existed then. And it was a shitty, shitty fucking week or two, man. It was like, I lived in the mirror and I was like, fuck, this is what it looks like to want. I feel like I want to kill myself. I wouldn't do it. But like, I felt it. I felt it and I felt like I was the most loved guy in LA to the most hated in the matter of a day. Over something I didn't do. And I looked at it and I was like, damn, they did a good fucking job. Like, this is like, I don't know how the fuck I'm going to bounce back from this. And that's kind of what started it. I got sober since then, since my birthday, April 14th and been sober by five years, three months now. That's awesome. How did a friend come by and was like, yo, you should write a book on your life. You live the fucking insane life. You ran the best nightclub. You're friends with all these celebrities and influencers. Like, people would want to hear about this and I'm like, fuck this industry. They'll turn their back on me. I'm going to fucking write about it now. But I did a very good job with the book. I kind of shit it on myself without having to shit on anybody else or the industry. I had to self discovery book. Like I did a very good job with like, not being like a name dropper and kind of making it more about self discovery and kind of how I flip my life around and putting the truth of the matter of that situation in the book. And I mean, I'd say majority of the public's back on my side. The second I came back on Instagram eight months later and had no fucking idea. Rose, I made a career out of running. None. Had no idea what was going to do for money again. Nothing. But I did decent enough for myself to live pretty good for a while where I could figure it out. I just kept running and kind of posting about it and then me and Andy connected. And yeah, everything kind of last year was kind of the time where like I was like, ah, maybe I'll go back to opening a restaurant or whatever and then it was like, you know, the saying goes, it's like, right, when 99% of the people drop out and you just stick to it, everything fucking flipped for me and just started getting sponsors and brand deals. And now I'm doing better than I was in night life. Really? Yeah. That's fucking awesome. Yeah. So I'm just helping people every day, you know what it's like. Yeah. How do you so, so dude, like when you talk about being at like the low low, right? Like where you're looking in the mirror and you realize like you're like, fuck, I don't even really want to be here. This is terrible. Crying in the mirror man. I'd take a lot from me to cry. I just fucking looked in the mirror, be down. Well, I mean, a lot of people, a lot of people are there in their own way, right? Yeah. Like a lot of people, maybe they don't get, you know, the entire weight of the media and the world put on them, but you know, they go through other things. Yeah. What would you say to those people who are trying to, you know, who might be in a situation like that where, you know, they feel the pressure coming down on them dude and they're like, fuck, like, yeah. I'm trying to think back on that time. It was really tough. I think for me, I guess this wouldn't resonate with a ton of people, but for me was like basically changing my phone number and never looking at the media, never looking at social media, didn't look at anything for almost eight months and that should change my life. And I think once I stepped away from that, my whole perspective in mindset changed where it wasn't bothering me anymore. So I don't know if someone's going through it and I think that does resonate with some people because people are shifting through social media all the time and it's making them more upset or more depressed comparing themselves, but I don't know man, I just, you just got to keep fucking going. Like it's just because the end of the day, you're not going to always feel that way. Like I don't know. I probably wake up feeling like shit five days out of the week, two days out of the week, I feel good and I want to run the other five. I just have to fucking push. And like that's just the reality of life. Well then after you get that first hard thing done through the day. I think it's good. I bet you feel better. You're good. Right. And I share that stuff all the time. Every morning I wake up, my face, yeah, your page is awesome dude. Yeah. It's kind of, I mean, I take a lot from it. Yeah. So I take a lot from your page. So like we both write up shit every morning. So it's kind of like we're like weener bros. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Motivation. Well, I am standing at your house tonight, right? Yeah. Oh, is that right? Yeah. You can't stay tonight. Weener bros that we're doing now. Motivation. I'm gonna hear this and get jealous. Yeah. Oh. That's how me and my boys talk. Yeah. And we keep it real man. Yeah, you know, real gay. All right. That is a crazy story. Yeah, dude. It's a, it's a, my book's very entertaining. It's a, it's every time like someone's like, oh, and they're like, holy shit. That, that, because I pretty much is whacked down the curtains on nightlife. And no one that knows how nightclubs work or operate and how fuck they are. And like just, just the reality of the people in it. I just, I talk about all of that. And I talk about like, you know, a relationship. It can resonate with anybody. Like a seven year old lady can read my book and resonate with something in my book. Yeah. So people are thinking, is this either gonna be running or nightclub? And it's not. There's just, it covers everything. You know? The, uh, how have you handled, I guess, because you're still kind of geographically, right? Like you're in the area. Does that, uh, majority of that scene, they love my comeback. Yeah. Yeah, they love it. Um, I'll still go out every once in a while. I still talk to a lot of the people in it. I'll go out if there's like a birthday or something like that. I don't miss any of that shit, man. I was running around fucked up and like, it's just, everyone's doing the same shit. We're all getting older. I'm 37 now. You know, I started when I was like 17 years old, I lost, you know? Like it's just, that's a lot longer than I mean. I do, I started bouncing in bars when I was seven. Oh, you're around, kind of around this. So I was in the nightlife scene. Yeah. I was just saying people every weekend. It's sad. When you kind of see the same shit. I'm just like, dude, like, what? Like I don't judge. Man, it is what it is. And I'm just kind of like, I know they're not happy. Because like every time I see them, I'll make a joke. Like, yeah, we're going to relapse tonight. They're like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, we look up to you, bro. Don't do that. You know, I'm like, just kidding guys, like, just like, yeah. I'm like, relapse tonight. No, no, no, no, no, we're just kidding. They're all fucked up. Like, don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it, bro. I'm not in the morning. I'm like frozen. Yeah, man, there's not... It's different, dude. I did that too. I was in the bar scene forever and ever and ever. To get our company going, you know, Chris and I both worked in the bars for the first seven years. And it was cool. I made a lot of friends. But like, after a few years, you're like, what the fuck? But it's also different now. Even your seven years older than me, like, your scene of nightlife was lit. And like, I caught the, like, end tail a bit. Like, I probably got like a good five, six years. But then after that, it was just social media's thing started coming in. The influence started coming in. Everybody wanted everything for free. But back then, if like, you know, Reggie Bush pulls up to the fucking club, he's spending 10 grand on a table. Yeah. You know, now it's like, when like, the Odell Beckham started coming in, that was it. It was like, the influence or social media shit. Well, I'm not coming here then. I'll go, I'll go here. It's just getting me a free table. So there's no one's paying anymore. So you got to get like, Mohammed Ali Jaheeb from Saudi to come spend the money now. And people in LA don't like to spend money. They'll go to Miami and LA and spend like 100K on a fucking table and they come here. I don't want to get more than two bottles. You know, this how it was. It's like the culture in LA. They hated it. They hated spending. But the nightlife's still going? Yeah, but it's dead. They're not making a lot of money. No, I talk, I still talked to everybody. Yeah. Yeah, it's like, it's, it's fucked. I don't think people are drinking as much as they used to. They're doing drugs. Yeah. The younger, the generation like 2021, 22, 23, they're doing drugs. They're not in alcohol. Alcohol people are like. What kind of drugs? Tussies. Like the thing that people are doing is like this pink powder. I don't know. It's like this pink powder maybe has like Molly and ketamine and some other shit. And I don't know what the fuck it is. Jesus. I don't know. That's fun. Crazy. They got the diddy case has it. They pulled them out with all the pink powder. They's called the pink powder. It's funny. What's it called? Tussies. Tussies. I don't heard of that. Just bring back the good old days. Just pure cocaine. You know what I'm saying? Like, just the pure shit, man. Like, now they got all this crazy shit, man. There's just so much crazy shit. Yeah. And like, I don't, and then also it's not them just doing drugs too. There is health is such a big thing now. Like, I think if I was 21 now, I'd probably be into like being here and wanting to work out. Like, I don't know. Yeah. It wasn't. Dude, I see that with the younger people, dude. Way more into like fitness, live and straight, make money off it now too with social means. Yeah. So like, being fit and big like you broke when like fucking like when I knew like J Cutler and Phil Heath and all these guys, well, yo, who these big guys pulling up to the club? I'm like, those are my boys are like, all right. Whatever you say, man. And then like, I think these guys are cool, you know, but like L.A., they want like these twigged out coke that look and dudes coming in, you know, it's like that's just what it was. Yeah. It's, I don't see that anymore, bro. I see a lot of, I see a lot of the young kids bro doing like pretty healthy shit. Yeah. You know, living right, living straight, you know, training eating right. Yeah. Being good, it actually gives me a lot of hope for the next generation. It's dope, man. I'd be honest. Yeah. Not Gen Z. It's the, yeah. I guess it would be too. I'm millennial, right? Yeah. I'm millennial. Yeah. Well, how are you? I'm 30. Oh, you're 30? Yeah. How old you think I was? Kidding here, man. You can be your son. Yeah. I know. How old you think I was? Crazy. Yeah, we're the same gen. Yeah. You're millennial too, huh? Yeah. I'm like, I'm like, one, I'm like on the edge. Your baby boomer, right? You're fired, right? That's what I was doing up. No, I'm, like, there's boomers and then there's the baby boomers and then there's, is it not the, there's Gen X in there too, motherfucker. I wasn't, no, Andy, Andy, I wasn't even, I'm telling you right now, dude, I'm on the borderline. I'm like, I'm right in the middle of, of, I'm like the last of the X in the first of the millennial. Hold on, what are, what are the generations? Nicknames called. There we go. Okay. So there's the silent generation. I guess that's the old people. 1925 and 1945. They're silent because they're dead. Okay. And then, okay, and then, okay, and then, okay, then it's baby boomer, your generation X, then the millennial, what years does this say for X? 1918 to 1989. It's 19, 1965 and 1980. That's, that's generation. Oh, yeah. I'm one, I'm one year. Yeah. You, you just missed the millennial cut. Yeah. You're right there. Yeah. Big bro. But you're not there. So you generation X. Is it generation X? What's it called? Yeah, generation X. And then millennials, then generation Z, then now apparently there's generation Alpha, which I don't, I don't know who, who voted on that name. And then generation beta, that makes more sense. Those are once cut out their decks. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy, man. That's crazy. Well, sick, man. You guys will do some cruising. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, you want to get into some topics? I do. Yeah, let's see built on guys. I've been seeing these, these images for fucking years. Yeah. On Andy's stories. It's good to see them in real life now. You guys ever, like get into, you guys ever, ever, ever argue? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not talking to them today. No. No. Yeah. Doesn't seem like it. Yeah. I'm not really like that with anybody. Neither do I see. Yeah. I'm a very direct person, dude. Well, if you don't like somebody, you just don't talk to them. No, if I don't like somebody, I go right to them. I know, but you don't talk to them anymore. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm very, I have zero problems with any kind of confrontation at all. Like it's just a nature of being in business for so long. Yeah. I don't look go to it like that. I always go to it to like solve it. So it's, yeah, I don't know that, that, that, that freezing people out. Shit. That's not for me. Yeah. Yeah. That's okay. Anyway, well, we got, let's get, let's get into it. Before we get to our first one, I wanted to bring this up because I thought this was cool. Maybe Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez got married. They did. Yeah. Or they're getting married like officially. Yeah. And. How old is she? I'm not bad. She's 55. He's 61. But what I want to put attention to is this wedding, and I'm sure this is like, chump changed to him. Guess how much you're spending on this wedding? Just random guess. Random guess. Two billion. All right. I mean, that's a good thing. I think it's like 20 million or something. Yeah. Well, new estimates, it's at $53 million. I know. That's the same. That's the same for these guys, huh? $53 million. Fucking dollars, bro. And apparently a lot of the locals are pissed off. And Bezos has apparently been going around and just paying off the locals to keep him quiet and happy, I guess. I see in my neighborhood. Yeah. But they are 90, 90 private jets have been coming in. It's a billionaire guess list. They have the entire, like entire sections of the city completely shut down to locals. And it's crazy. There's a video here of them leaving their hotel. Let's check this out. They get right onto a fucking, the $1,000,000,000,000. Yeah. Just can't yell. It was paparazzi, bro. They're crazy. It was paparazzi, bro. They're crazy. $56 million. Well, the $56,000, or is it $53 million? Well, I'm sorry. Yeah. $53 million. I mean, that could cover 10 weddings, maybe. Another 3 million. Fuck, bro. Maybe a lot more than that. Like listen, I love you, babe. But damn, that's too much. That's too much. That's too much. I mean, it's all relative, right? I mean, I guess. But even like, listen, I don't give a fuck how much money I make. There's like what you don't make. That kind of money. But I'm still, I don't care how much money I would make. Yeah. But you can't say that because the more you make, the more you spend, your lifestyle changes. What you think is expensive is no longer expensive. Like what you think an expensive meal is, now is not what you think, then it's totally different. Now I do think it's pretty excessive. But I don't know. I'm not him. I'm not living that life. The guest list is great. He's one of the most famous dudes in a fucking planet. He's worth a lot. Yeah. And security has to come. Here's what I would say. That kind of stuff is not my style anyway. Like, you know, you got to have all the celebrities around. I don't know. That's just not list, bro. Tom Brady's there. Kim Kardashian's there. Holy shit. She looks like dog shit. Yeah, she looks like. And she got all that surgery done. Fuck her in her. That's not Kim Kardashian. That's the mom. That's the mom. Yeah. Cory, I know that guy. Too used to come out a lot. Cory Gamble hates to come out. Is that her boyfriend or something? Yeah. He's come out all the time. Damn. So she's gonna need bottom surgery too. No. They just need to head shots. She looks weird, dude. Yeah. Fuck Orlando Blooms there. Um, I forgot about Deca. I forgot he was even still around. Leonardo's there. Oprah. Yeah. These aren't the people I want to hang around. I don't really knew you at all. Yeah. Yeah. He can have them. I want to hang out with some tough fuckers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. That's all we need. Yeah. That's just how they like. How did they meet. Pezoson. I don't know. I don't know. Let me see. Let me see. How did they meet? How did he. So as they met at an Amazon party celebrating the movie Manchester by the sea, they were both married at the time. They reconnected in 2018 when Bezos hired Sanchez's company Black Ops Aviation to film for a space company Blue Origin. Oh, got it. So she's doing pretty good to that. I'd imagine. I don't know. She used to be married to Tony Gonzalez. That's on you. The football player from the chiefs. And he and Joe. No, I'm thinking of Aaron Hernandez. He's dead. Yeah. Tony Gonzalez is like a good dude. I'm talking to you. Yeah, he's like a role model. Like you're totally an opposite ends of the spectrum. Yeah. Sorry, Tony, man. I'm bad. Tony Gonzalez. Yeah, Tony. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Tony. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't need to do none. Yeah. No, dude, you know, it's not my thing, bro. Yeah. You know, that seems that seems, I mean, I'm all four like some cool shit, but I don't know. That's a lot. I don't like the fact that you're like making people from there feel inconvenienced. That's kind of like not cool. No, yeah, like I said, apparently he's been going, they've been going around. You see, yeah, they were going around like I guess like some of his security guys were like going around and literally just handing people cash just to like shut up. Shut up. Yeah, no protests because he's been getting a lot of protests and shit lately too. I need a really at least 100K, at least 100K and not speak up, you know. I mean, he's got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, man, I don't know. I thought that was crazy, man, but let's get it to our, let's get into our official headlines show. Guys, remember as always, if you would like to see any of these pictures, links, videos, go to Andy for sell it.com. You guys can find them all linked there for you. I would that being said, let's get into our first headline. It might be an old face to bring up. This is a hot topic right now. Head on to number one reads, liver king, freed after threatening Joe Rogan and immediately starts ranting online again. Have y'all been seeing this shit, bro? That sounds like somebody we know. You know, that dude out there, I know you talk about, I know you talk about bro, did you see the videos on them? Oh, yeah, it sounds like I'm too. Sounds, bro, it looks like it's that fucking MK ultra 5G in the brain, bro. Dude, this is, this is bad. Alright, let's get into this. This is pretty bad. Yeah. So troubled influence of Brian liver king Johnson has been freed after his arrest for allegedly making terroristic threats against Joe Rogan and immediately began posting bizarre videos again, the 47 year old steroid popping influencer was there. I didn't say that. That's not that's the words was arrested in Austin, Texas on Tuesday night after he suddenly showed up to Rogan's hometown after ranting for days about picking a fight with the podcaster at one point seemingly brandishing guns. The testicle munching muscle man. But I'm not giving this guy any fucking love, man. Bro, how would you like to be written about the paper as a testicle muncher? Oh, testicle munching muscle man has since posted a $20,000 bond according to court records reviews by KX AN. So here's his mug shot man. Wow. Here's his mug shot and I just want to point something out here real quick. The pupil like bro needs help right now. That's different sizes. Yeah, like one of them one of them on XC the other one is just normal. Like it's bad man. He also looks like 20 30 years older than he is. Yeah. Oh, he looks bad man. He looks like I got in like there's pictures of like him from when he was younger like before he became liver king online. It's like, dude, he was a cool looking dude. You know, he's all right. Like fuck, he's in the short amount of time. He's went really, really down really. But he's been banned from contacting Joe Rogan or his family's ordered order to stay at least 600 feet away from their homes and businesses. He was also ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation within a week of his release. But once he got out, he went right back to it. So this is the video that kind of like started at all before he ended up, you know, leaving to go to Austin. And this was the clip here. Let's check this out. Or anything and everything. Because Joe Rogan, we don't have to make videos to pretend anymore. All of this is happening. We're coming to you. I've challenged you man to man to a fight. Honorable. And we don't have to pretend or make any videos. The world is watching. They'll make the videos for us. And you don't have to hold a camera. You can hold the hand of somebody that you love because what happens next to you, you're going to need to remember that feeling. You're going to need something more than what you did to give you something to fight for. Because I have my family to fight for. That's what I'll die for. And you know that. And you're a black belt. But you've never come across something like this willing to die. Hoping that you'll choke me out. I pray to God because that's a dream come true. It feels good. And then the limbs. I'm fighting for my family. So limb, limb, limb, limb, limb, limb. Go ahead. But then you have to contend with something else. And I weigh 177 pounds. Actual savage. And so at first you're like, fuck that guy. Fuck that guy. And you're right. When you all the sudden you get your attention, which I already did before this. You're the same. I'm going to choke that motherfucker. That piece of fucking shit. I'm going to choke him out. So warriors do you and Andrew K. are good warriors, but you're actually better than that real tension we have. Comedy. Comedy that you do is good and true. We have real tension. But what I see in you is comedy is good and true. Touch points for how people laugh. If we don't make fun of them at their expense, they laugh. You should all make fun of me. Liver. You should all make fun of me at my expense. Tell me that it still works. And then you should get paid for it. And let's go. Let's go. Because we're leaving. We're going to Austin. What was my very last point that we're going to kick you all over that? That we the real genius. I know this is my speech just in fence. What's wrong with what's wrong with his teeth? I think that's what was the drama like why is he calling on Joe? I don't know. Nobody know. Like the only thing that I could find is from like years ago when he first got when when liver king first got exposed for actually like taking steroids. I think Joe Rogan talked about it. Because the cops have talked to him. Joe Rogan said that he was actually surprised or shocked about it. But yeah, Rogan amplified the scandal on his huge podcast. But in the rest documents obtained by that. Rogan was surprised by the recent episode with Johnson. He's never had any actual contact with him. Joe Rogan also told police that Johnson had a significant drug issue, according to the arrest documents. But yeah, he talked about them on his podcast, I guess. But that was back in 2022. So we're talking three years ago. It was the last time Joe Rogan even mentioned the liver king. But he claimed that the muscular physique based off of corner word diet was bullshit. Well, fuck anybody knows that. Like, listen, anybody that looks at that dude and says, oh, he's not fucking take it. Dude, you're retarded. Like for real. Like I'm just I'm sorry, but you are he's eating. He's doing all of them breakfast lunch dinner, baby. You know what I'm saying? Breakfast champions all day long. Yeah. Okay, you can't look like that without that. No, nobody can. So that's the first thing. The second thing clearly he's on a fucking something. He sounds like one of those manic. It sounds like he's in the manic. Like a manic episode person. He sounds like that one stalker that guy we had. It sounds just like him. Yeah, a few of them. Yeah, maybe, you know, yeah. I mean, dude, I don't I don't know, man, like, but I do know what I do know though. I mean, Joe Rogan is a black belt. You know what I'm saying? Joe Rogan would beat that dude's ass. Correct. Yeah, it wouldn't even be a fight. I don't know if Joe would like to fucking liver King's one of those icy red people. You know, you don't know me, man, you're doing nothing like that. I know you're a black belt, but what was I saying again? Yeah. A kick is ass. You know, you an and your tape. Yeah, what? I'll tell you this though, I mean, I go lie when you crawl up to me on four legs like that, bro. It's going to be a problem. Yeah. And it's also interesting that people fucking think that like people don't have guns. Like the days of kicking people's ass is kind of over. Like you're not going up to Joe Rogan and kicking his ass. He's got security. Those security guys got guns, but they will shoot you in a fucking face. Yeah. Maybe a last delivery King. Yeah. Anyway, bro. So he gets out and he starts talking again. He's right back on it. Yeah, he's right back on it. Yeah. Right back on it. Yeah. It's sad to see, bro. It is sad to see. Do people still like the Libert King or like is he got fans and she's still? I mean, I think most people that are watching him now are just like watching him literally for the entertainment. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? You mean they're watching the self-destruction. Right. Yeah. Right. Because I've like, I've seen a lot of his videos lately. People just been on it like fuck man. What? Or even the videos right before he lost it, lost it. People were even still like man, this guy's losing it. Something's not right. And yeah, I mean, he's live streamed him getting arrested and everything. Well, I mean, with a living dream. Could it be that, you know, this guy understands how the internet and the media works and he just attached himself to the biggest name in the world and he understands that it's putting his name out there. Correct. That's what I see. Yeah, that's real that way. I mean, there's no way he's like this acting this fucking crazy. Yeah. The whole thing was set up like him running to his phone, picking it up and asking him, he didn't technically say I'm going to be Joe Rogan's ass. He had them say it. So it can't be like, well, I didn't say it. He definitely got arrested for it. Yeah. So I mean, he's trying to avoid that now because he wants to keep making these videos. So, do you think it's just a publicity stunt? I mean, that's how the internet works now, bro. That's why all these dudes call each other out and talk shit to each other. I mean, they call each other ahead of time and say, hey, let's start an internet beef. It'll make us both more famous. Like that's the shit people do now. Yep. And I'm not, I don't think Rogan's in on that. I know he's not. But I mean, a lot of the time. Yeah, bro. People come at people. They do it for their own cause. Yeah. So I think he's just playing the internet. I think he is fucked up. And you can't, you know, what, I don't know. It's whatever, dude. Here's what I'll say. Anybody that ever believed that dude got that jacked off eating fucking liver, your brain doesn't work, bro. Bro. You don't understand it. Completely fried. Yeah. Bro. And he had a lot of people doing that shit, too. A lot, a lot of people. And it just shows you like how many people are willing, they want to look for the secret. Bro, there's no fucking secret. There never has been a secret. The secret is this, fucking drink water, move your body, resistance train, eat some fucking protein. And if you want to get bigger, eat more than you burn. If you want to get skinnier, fucking eat less than you burn. Like it's fucking math. And there's no secret other than that. You got to do it for a long time. You got a bunch of testicles. Yeah, there's, yeah, right. And the fitness industry as someone who's been in it their entire adult life is fucking predatory, dude. Like I don't know, I don't, I don't really know any other companies besides ours that talks about like you have to do the fucking work. Like the work is what does it. Something that's can help, they can improve, they can make you healthier, but they will not do the fucking work for you. And it's easy to sell someone the idea that they could take a pill or take a powder or do a thing. That's going to help them get in shape and avoid all this pain. And the sad part about that is one, it's not true. But secondly, you miss out on all the great shit that the journey gives you, which is confidence, self belief, grit, fortitude, you know, the ability to endure things. Like all of these skills that you're going to need to acquire to like have a great life, you miss by, by missing the journey. You know, the journey is what gives you all the good shit anyway. So, but you have to go through it to realize that. So it's not about, it's not even about the end result. Yeah. But whatever, man, I mean, look, this dude's 15 minutes are fucking about over. Are they not? Oh, that's real. Yeah. No, that is definitely real, man. Guys, let us know down in the comments what you guys think. With that being said, let's go check some of these comments out. Yeah. Yeah, let's cruise the comments. Let's do. This one is from Jace, J.C. Hedra, 83. Just had my first grape smash, first form energy drink and holy shit, it's tasty. You guys are stupid for making it so good. PS, DJ screw you. I don't know what the fuck I did. I don't know what makes you stupid for making it so good. Well, thank you. Thank you. All right. Yeah.

And then orange and then grape and then the blue. I'm not a blue guy. You're not a blue guy. This is kind of mixed with blue though. Bro, you know what it is? Our people are age. We didn't have the blue. The blue is like a next generation thing. The blue was, oh, yeah, you're in there. It was like a kid thing. You're in the silent generation? Yeah, just about.

I don't know why he wants to screw me though. What? What did I do? Maybe he thinks you're sexy. Big sexy chocolate. Yeah. He put a heart next to it. I think he just meant to say DJ, I want to screw you. Yeah. After I drink a grape energy, I want to put it on you. A lot of typos in that. I want to put it on you, big chocolate. Well, let's get one thing clear. I'm the big spoon, big dog. Yeah. All right. Yeah. So you can be putting on him. Yeah. That's right. All right. Fuck this. There's no way to not make that sound.

New York City mayor Adams announces reelection bid after mom Donnie wins Dems primary. So Eric Adams is back in the move. I guess that's cool to see. Mary, Mary Eric Adams announces reelection campaign Thursday on the steps of New York City Hall surrounded by supporters, union leaders, business partners, our protesters called him a criminal from across the park. Adams was elected as a Democrat in 2021, but chose to run as an independent this year amid low approval ratings and has his sense dropped federal corruption charges. In his absence, former governor Andrew Cuomo was widely expected to pick up the Democratic nomination in Tuesday's primary election, but 33 year old self-proclaimed democratic socialist Zorhan mom Donnie shocked the political establishment when he declared victory. This was this was the scene when the election results were called. Let's check this clip out. There was not one fucking milligram of testosterone. I was in that whole entire room. Sutton fucking so similar to that. That red head guy has never seen titties as a whole life. Fucking ever. Ever. The only one that other guy seen was his own. This guy right here, wait, where'd he go? All those dudes. Every single one of those dudes is there. I'm just jumping. That's right. Trying to fuck some communist bitch. Yeah. 100%. You're a pussy, please. Yes. Maybe if I do all these things, you'll want to bang me. Friend zone, bro. Yeah. Friend zone. Forever. You know you're wrong when she's got arm here. Listen. She got arm here. This one does. That's how she put her arms down so quick. Well, they're going to find out. You know what I'm saying? Well, I mean, so like he's been getting some heat. Who? Mom Donnie. He should be. She's been getting some heat. This is his platform. So housing, he's doing freezing the rent, building affordable housing. He has LGBTQIA plus protection. He's expanding and protecting gender, affirming care, city, white, making New York City and LGBTQIA plus LGBTQIA plus LGBTQIA, sanctuary city, affordability, creating city-owned grocery stores, fair, free buses, and attempting to raise the minimum wage to $30 by 2030. I'm okay with every with none of it except for freezing the rent. We should always be able to live for free, you know. But how does that work though? I will say the New York City's rent is ridiculous. Like you have a room this time. It's not. It's not because of communist. No. The rent's high because people want to fucking live there. Correct. Like that's the that's the supply and demand. Like if people want to live somewhere, the rent's going to be fucking high because there's too many people that want to live there. Like I don't understand how this is not understood. You see what I'm saying? And by the way, if you import millions of fucking communists into your city, you can't be surprised when communism gets celebrated and elected into office. Like Eric Adams is like, what the fuck's going on? Well, here's what's going on, brother. You fucking cater to these people for the last fucking however many years. And now you got someone that's come in that's more extreme than you on those same views who is now taking your fucking thunder. Eric Adams did this to himself. And so did all the fucking liberal people of New York who vote liberal because they don't want to get fucking made fun of or yelled at or looked down upon and they have no courage to stand up and say what they actually believe or think. And so dude, actually, if you look at this guy, these are the more reasonable of his views. Okay. His actual views are very, very, very, very communist. They're not a little bit, they're not socialists. They're communists. And look dude. He's been getting a lot of heat too for code switch and too. What? Because like he's apparently he changes his accent depending on who he's around. And he got, he got called out on it from like media, you want to see what I'm saying? They all do this, but nobody cares. Yeah. Let's watch this clip. Let's check this out. For the time being, I'm fighting to change this all. Rent free, free buses, universal child care and such grossies. But I want to ask you one question. Hey! You've never voted for anyone! Yeah! Because I think that New Yorkers, more than they hate politicians and they disagree with, they hate politicians and they can't trust. On the subject of trust, you've adopted different speaking accents in different scenarios. But they go to their local bodega. Is there one that's real and one that's affected? What I would say is, as any immigrant knows, having been born in Kampala, Uganda and then raised in South Africa and moving here when I'm seven years old, is there different parts of my life? Well, Dwight Joy is a well-dewight joy. Is a well-dewight joy? Yeah, yeah. And Mamdani was talking about a worldwide press tour back when he was a rapper. Bring the Fibotina fish for the Fibotina rice. In a Disney movie directed by his mother. The Nepotism in Hot Look goes a long way. Here in New York City, this is how I speak. This is how I am. You believe in the question that makes me job on man? One. One. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. You know this one? Yeah. The crazy, here's the craziest thing between him and Cuomo though. You just know the voting like numbers have come out of like who voted where, you know, and demographically who voted where? These are the numbers. And as always, Andy, it's your people's fault. What do you mean? White people voted him in? Yeah, I see that on the phone. No black people voted for him. Or the other or multiple races didn't vote for him either. Yeah, it's because white people are fucking virtue signaling fucking liars. That's the truth, okay? Liberal whites. Liberal whites. Yeah, they are. Liberal whites. They claimed to not be racist, but yet they believe that black people can't think for themselves, can't do things for themselves, can't work a computer, can't get an ID, need someone to protect them. And the reality is, that's kind of racist. You don't think that they're fucking capable of doing their own shit, okay? And then on top of that, they wanna look good at their little branches and say, oh, I'm standing with these people. Well, I voted the Mamdomni, and that's right. Yeah. Why is making a state-owned grocery store a bad idea? They wouldn't be able to tell you, right? So don't you think that's a problem that you vote for shit that you don't even know what the negative would be? Like, I don't know. Every other time they've run state-owned grocery stores in the history of Earth, where people fucking starved because the government's so inefficient that they can't even get food on the shelves. I mean, all you gotta do is go look at the fucking, you know, the plagues that happen under communism of starvation, like in Ukraine, where 60 million fucking people were starved. Because of... I mean, it's pretty of examples on this. Look dude. It's whatever, you know, it seems like the Hispanic people understand communism. You know why? Because they come from communist countries. Looks like the black and African Americans get it. They're voting for Andrew Comel. Looks like Asians, you know, are voting for communism. Maybe we should just ban Asians. I'm kidding. But, no, let's be real. Where do Asians come from? Where are they proud of? Mm-hmm. A lot of them are from China. You know what China is? It's communist. Yeah. It's communist. Here's the end of the day, dude. People that aren't born in the country can't serve as president. So why the fuck are they allowed to serve as mayor or governor or anybody else? Why? Why is Ilyana Omar allowed to be from Somalia? Come here, serve in a fucking Congress, and then say that she served Somalia first before America. How is that allowed? It shouldn't be. It shouldn't be allowed. Nobody can make a case for that. No. You can't make a case for that. You cannot make a case for anybody that runs in any of our government at any level saying that they represent other countries before us. Whether it be Somalia, whether it be fucking China or whether it be Israel or anything else. We can go do it. We can't do it anywhere. Like an American citizen can't go to fucking Yagandam. Like, oh, I'm gonna run for office here. I got you guys. It's not happening. Well, it's not happening. Well, Eric Adams, you fucked yourself, bro. Like DJ Khaled likes to say, you played yourself. And what's so crazy too is like New York, I feel like New York City could be an awesome place to live. Same with LA. Same with LA, man, but it's just like fucking Friday. What is it? Like it gets so nice. What do you mean? What is it? It's very simple. It's people who don't know what the fuck they're talking about pretending to know what they're talking about regarding everything. Okay? Like they think because they have a fucking social media platform that they understand what's going on. And they want to look good to their friends. So whatever they perceive to be as cool, they go with. It's just like the Simone Biles shit the other day. Simone Biles is so out of touch. She makes this fucking ridiculous out of style comment about men competing in women's sports. She does not understand that that's not cool anymore. So she's saying that thinking it's cool amongst her crowd, not realizing that almost everybody has rejected the idea of men in sports. So it's not cool anymore. So then she says it and gets backlash. But the reality is is most people don't know what they're even saying when they say, I stand with this or I stand with that. When they said, oh, I stand with George Floyd. And the corner report comes out and says the dude died of fentanyl poisoning. They don't care. They're like, I still stand with them. What are you talking about? What are you fucking talking about, bro? Like the guy fucking was a criminal. He took drugs. He overdosed on drugs. You can't choke someone out. The way that they say the Derek Chauvin was standing. That does not, I've had that done to me. You can still fucking breathe, bro. He couldn't breathe because he was hyped up and fucking fentanyl. Like, and then you present that to people and people are like, oh, fuck a blood square. You're a bad person. And it was just like the people were like, oh, I support Ukraine, but you're not in the mat. Why do you support Ukraine? They don't know. They don't know. That's my fucking point. Because you get a nice little profile picture out. So now you import millions of people who come from these types of countries, which is ironic, right? Like, why do you come here? It's like people who export from California to Texas. They hate California politics. They leave to go to Texas or Nashville. Then they vote for the same shit. It's fucking retarded. It does not make any sense. It's insane. What's the same thing as these people? These people come from these kind of countries to escape that shit and then come here and then try to put that shit in here. And then you have a bunch of people who are by legitimate literal terms, useful idiots who think they're doing something good and virtuous and want to look good, who are literally voting our country down the fucking drain. This is why I say voting rights should not be exclusive to every American. If you don't pay tax, you shouldn't get to vote. If you don't pay a fucking tax and get a tax return for that year of voting, you should not be allowed to vote. Because by human nature, people who don't pay in are going to vote for all the benefits to themselves. They're going to vote your money from you to them. So why the fuck would you give them a vote? That doesn't make any sense. So it's not about men or women voting or even an age. Like if you're 14 years old, bro, and you're working part time and you get a fucking tax return, you should be voting. I think so. I think you earned a vote. You know, like... But they let people that aren't even supposed to be here voting. Yeah, dude. It's insane. It's fucking nuts. None of them make... You can't put any logic on it. There's no logic on any of it. It's just a sway, sway something. Just a way of vote won't wear the another. Yeah. And it's... And dude, it ends up fucking... Bro, and it ends up fucking people who go out and make the money to pay for the fucking taxes. Dude, the system is totally fucked. Like, you have all these people... And dude, there's a whole book about this called Atlas Shrugged. This will happen here, okay? This will be the collapse of this country. When you take everybody who works and you remove the incentive for them to work because you overtax them and they stop working, that's when the country fucking falls. Correct. And that is where we are because the amount of resistance that there is for the average person working is almost on the borderline of them not being worth them working for the middle class American. Middle class Americans can almost earn the same amount not working as they do working. Some can earn more. And when you flip that, we end up in a situation where the country is not sustainable because the people who produce are no longer willing to produce. Well, that's the other thing that I saw some headlines about that is like, my place is like Florida, Texas, they're already preparing for another wave of business owners, operator CEOs that are gonna be leaving New York City to escape it because like just as tax plane alone, he's trying to raise his plan is he's gonna raise the corporate tax rate from 9% to 11.5%. And then he's creating an additional. Okay, but let's just talk about that for a second. Yeah. Here's what people don't understand. Okay, they hear that. They say from 9% to 11%. And what do they think most people say? Oh, fuck yeah. No, they say, even if they're resistant, they say, that's reasonable, that's 2%. Most companies don't have 2% of error in the way that they operate their business. So for a company to adjust to a 2% increase in taxes, you're talking about major adjustments in the way that that company operates. It's not just as simple as saying, oh, well, these guys are making so much money. Most of these big companies, they're not making, they're making it work just the way that it's set up. They're running on a razor thin line. So when you say 2%, you're talking about a major adjustment, which is probably going to force more implementation of AI and cost people their fucking jobs. So, cause that's what this is on the surface. No, because here's the conversation that happens on the inside that people don't think about. All right, they're gonna raise us tax 2%, we got to free up 2% revenue to pay it. That means we got to fire those guys. We could just rewrite that with AI. And now you got 100 people that don't have fucking jobs or 1,000 or 2,000 or 10,000, depending on the size of the operation. So even the $30 minimum wage, okay. It's the same. Cool. AI, there you go. Yeah, it's the same. Listen, and they're promising people, promises that can't be effectively implemented in reality that they, and by the way, they understand that. A communist understands what he understands exactly what he's doing. What he's doing is he is making, he is selling people ideas that sound good. They sound like they will work. They sound like it'll benefit the people. But the result of that is actually people becoming unemployed. And when these people become unemployed, they are more likely to vote for communism because they don't have shit. And the idea of communism is we're going to give you a bunch of free shit. We're going to take care of your rent. We're going to take care of your food. We're going to take care of everything that you need. But because of the inefficiencies and the greed and the theft and the immorality of these people, that money never makes it to them. And they end up fucking starving. And this has happened over and over and over and over and over again in history. But people are too fucking stupid and lazy to educate themselves about what this actually is. That motherfucker knows exactly what he's doing. And if you are so stupid to fall for that and think that that can be actually implemented, then you can't pass a basic fucking math course because that's all it is. It's math. It's a crazy thing too. Explain it to like that, Andy. When you look at it, he's telling you exactly the play. He's going to have to have free the rent and fucking government on grocery stores because nobody's going to be able to afford this shit. No, because they're not going to have jobs. They're not going to have jobs, right? They're not going to be any of that. And dude, you gotta understand the idea that they sell these people is not, hey, we're going to give you all your shit for free and you're going to live like a fucking peasant and you're going to be eating gruel and your life is going to be terrible. You're going to have cockroaches on the floor. You're not going to be able to do shit. That's not what they're selling them. Here's what they're selling them. Jeff Bezos just paid $53 million for, we're going to take some of his money and we're going to make your life look more like his. That is not what happens. It never has happened. It has never happened. And then the communists say the same shit every time. Well, that's not real communism. They just didn't do it all the way. Yeah, they didn't do it right. That's right. No shit, they didn't do it right. Everybody died. He's also adding an additional 2% income tax for anyone making more than a million dollars annually. In addition to what they're already paying. Yeah. I get it. Any going to work, man? Any going to work, man? Any going to work? Guys, tell us what you guys think down in the comments. Let us know what that being said. Third and final highlight. Is that too already? No, that was too. All right. Yeah. Headline number three. That fucking hate communist, bro. No, communist. Everybody, you guys should all hate communists. You should hate them. Like they will fucking kill you. They're whole fucking play. It's not, this isn't like, oh, they're nice people. They're flawed. No, they pretend to be flawed so they could take everything from you. And then when you cannot do anything for them, just like we talked about in the middle and the beginning of the show, it's human nature. When you no longer provide value, people will ignore you. Except in this case, they don't ignore you. They fucking kill you. So the only way that these people get empowers by lying to people and then making their life so hard that these people are basically completely dependent on the government. And then when they figure out, well, fuck, these people can't really do anything for us. Then they figure out how to kill them. They starve them, they execute them, they create a plague. And dude, this is not me being conspiratorial. This is history. All you gotta do is fucking read it. When people want, go to chat GPT and ask about fucking mal and ask about polpot and ask about what happened to the Christians and the Bolshevik Revolution or the Red Famine or the Holodomores. Nobody talks about that. They only talk about one genocide ever, which is the Holocaust. There's lots more and they were much bigger and they don't talk about them for a fucking reason. And that's exactly why you should go read about them. That's real man, guys, jumping on this conversation, down in the comments. Let's know what you guys think. Yeah. Well, that being so let's get to our third. You guys don't hate communist enough, bro. They fucking hate you. Gotta be that. Let's get to our final headline. We got to have them three. Let's go back to the WMBA. Shall we? Oh, women's best. Got the NBA. Yeah. Now we talked about Sophie Cunney-Han. Yeah, bro, she's awesome. Yeah, she's awesome. The fucking enforcer. She's the Bob Probert of the WMBA. Who's that? The baddest dude ever played in NHL, Bob Probert. You wouldn't know. Sorry. He's in the solid. He's dead now. He's solid generation. Yeah. But sorry. Let's generation ask. You ask anybody knows anything about hockey. You say who the baddest motherfucker ever played hockey. You kick your fucking ass. It's Bob Probert. He played for the Red Wings and the Black Hawks. Look him up, dude. Look up as fucking. Look it up right now. You don't care. He's ready for a LeBron story right now. You don't care. Look up as fucking face. Bob Probert. Probert. Yeah, he was shit. Oh, this guy looks hot. He wasn't drinking grape soda. That motherfucker will kill you, bro. He was the most feared man that ever played in NHL. Geez. Yeah. I mean, he looks like a hogs player. He's tough, man. Yeah, this dude is a different level. Oh, yeah. And he was like fucking massive, too. Bro, anybody that's missing teeth like that, you don't fuck with. You don't fuck with. Cauliflower ears and guys with missing teeth like that, you don't fuck with. Yeah. Fuck how big was this guy? Big. Big, big. Six, four. I think at least he was big. Look up his six through what? 240. That's big on skates. That's like six, eight, six, five, six, eight. Yeah. That's so many inches on the skates. I don't know. I'm just making shit out. Six, eight sounds beastly though, you know? He was, he was seven eight. Yeah. 400. Yeah. I'm dreaming of the town. It's like a minute bowl. I don't know who that is either. That's crazy though. But yeah, let's go to the WNBA because we talked about Caitlin Clark a little bit and her enforcer, her enforcer, Sophie Cunningham, Harry Sander, yeah, we should sign there. As an enforcer, we should sign her for the blues. Yeah. Right. Lose got new unies, bro. Yeah, they do. The fucking Pimp. I don't see much difference. I, it was like, I'm not, I love the blues, right? I'm, you know, I'm not shitting on. How many hockey games you've been to? Two. Keep going with the headline. Yeah. Did the WNBA finally kill its golden goose after a year and a half of public beatings in a league full of women who despise her, Caitlin Clark may be finished. You seen this? How about this? Yeah. Let's dive into it. This is Gateway Pundit. It looks like the WNBA, the worst sports league in the history of mankind has, that's fucked up. Did they, they go hard on people some size, man? Who? Fucking gay, they should. They should. They go, they keep it real. Where, where is this from? Where's this article? This St. Louis, man. Yeah. All this is, you guys are reading from St. Louis? No, no, no. No, this media outlet is from St. Louis. Jim Hough, they're fucking savages. They're, they're hard. It's great. Yeah. That's it. Other people for sure. Andy's funding that shit for sure. Hey, no, I'm not. I'm not. I wish, maybe I should, though. Yeah, that should be a good investment for you. But yeah, the, the, they have finally killed its Golden Goose, Caitlin Clark. Farmer Iowa basketball player, Caitlin Clark, is the all-time greatest score in NCAA basketball along the way she also broke most of the NCAA assist records. Iowa's Caitlin Clark broke every record imaginable in women's and men's basketball in the 2023-24 season. She was the D1 scoring leader. She was the only D1 player with 3,500 points, 1,000 assists, 850 rebounds in a career, most points in a single season, most three pointers in a single season. I mean, she's fucking badass, right? You compare her to other, to the other 9,718 D1 college hoop players this season. This is where she ranks at. It's hard. If it's hard to see, she's that little green dot. Why do people, why are people shitting on her? Because she's good. That's it. That's literally, I mean, bro, she's been getting right. She's been getting her ass beat. Like she's been getting her ass beat. Oh, for what? Just being a good basketball player. No, being white. And that's real shit. Nobody wants to say it. That's fucking true. Nobody wants to say it. I'll fucking say it. She's getting her ass beat by a bunch of black girls because she's white and she's better than them. And that's the fucking fact. There's nothing else that she said or no. She doesn't say anything, bro. She just balls her ass out. Yeah. And they don't like it. So it is what it is. So what are they saying about her shitting on her? They're not dude. She's getting her ass beat in the game. Like she's losing. No, like they're beating us up. Oh, oh, oh. Like bro, like throwing to the ground, fucking like completely fucking like a legrant and then she's like, wow, it's like left. It's every game. And she's just quiet. She hasn't like fight back or anything. She just fucking scores a shit ton of points and whoops ass that way. But like dude, it's, listen, it's, it's, it's very blatant and very obvious and nobody fucking says it and it is what it is. And you know, whatever, man, I mean, she's the best thing that's happened to the league and fucking forever. So it's the only reason people are watching the fucking league and people hate it. It's, it's not, but people aren't watching her like thinking like, oh, I'm going to watch her because she's a white girl. That is not why the fuck they're watching. They're watching because when she shoots the ball, it goes into fucking hoop unlike everybody else. Like fuck, dude. That's the truth. Common sense. Yes. No, she's a baller, bro. You guys both watch her play. I dude. Yeah, she's amazing. I've seen a few of her games. Yeah, she's like, she's the female version of Steph Curry, bro. Like, like she's good. She's not like Duncan and she just had a crazy shot. Yeah, she's just good. Look, look, dude. Here's the thing about women. Here's the thing about women's basketball. When women are good at basketball, they're technically usually better than men because they can't dunk and they can't do these, these crazy things that like athletically that men can do. So they're fundamentals, they're free throws, they're, they're fucking, they're, they're dribbles. Everything is much cleaner and better. Yeah. And bodies that part of the game, Jackie styles was like that too. But like, they're just technically better and it's fun to watch them because they're so fucking good. And because, you know, unfortunately, you know, like white, only black people are only white people can be racist shit. She's taken a ton of abuse. Like that's not right. Yeah. Well, and I think that's, so I mean, that's what this, this article is kind of alluding to is that like, well, the problem is that people keep alluding. So instead of just saying for what it is, when I was alluding to the fact of like, that has taken a total. Yeah, fucking, bridge not playing the same, the Britney Griner who, who, who fucking might be a dude. Yeah, straight up in a game, what was videoed saying like fucking white bitch, like shit like that. And it's like, dude, if you, like if Caitlin Clark had said that, they'd kick her out of the league. She'd be canceled forever. And dude, it's just, it's a, it's disgusting. It's disgusting shit. It's a bad double stand. Yeah. Terrible. But yeah, I mean, I think, and like, I mean, this would be a good conversation just about, like, I mean, you played sports growing up at all? I played basketball a lot. Yeah. Okay, basketball. I know you've played sports. I played sports. And the mental part of the game is real. You know, I'm saying until like, as it taken a total, okay, Caitlin Clark, because like in the last like four games, her, her stats have like completely dropped completely. That's four games. Yeah, but like you look at the games prior to that. It's like, I mean, like, brother, there's a, there's an obvious difference here. Like her, her fucking could be that they're learning how to defend her a little bit. How are her, how are the teammates treating her on her team? Good. Now, for fucking for the last year and most of this year, she kind of, like, I'm going to say, she kind of just got her S beat and nobody said shit or did shit. Now the now her team's starting to like rally around her because they're realizing that like what's happening. So yes, she is getting protection a little bit now, but it's not, it's just, that's a recent thing. Yeah. Like, I think her three point completion was like four percent right now. Well, yeah, she's off injury. Well, you know, I don't know. I just, I mean, what's the mental, what's the mental point? I mean, because I mean, I said this last time, I do like at some point, like you would get tired of that shit, man. And like if nobody's stepping up for you, the raps aren't protecting you. Yeah. I'm not making a whole lot of money. You're like, what the fuck is I'm doing here? Yeah. What's the point? What's the fucking point? Listen, nobody wants to be where they're not wanted. And that goes for anybody doing anything. Like if you show up somewhere where everybody fucking hates you, every mother fucking day, eventually you're going to be like, bro, why am I doing this? What am I doing this for? And it's, it's not a justified hate. It's not like she's a, she's a character that thrives on hate. Like there's certain characters in sports that kind of thrive on the, on the shit talk, right? Like like Jake Paul, okay? Jake Paul thrives on the shit talk. Fucking, you know, Odo Beckham, he will, he'd be a star. People, they don't care. There's some people that really like that shit. They're kind of like in the fucking. Oh, again, Jake, all of the fucking, they do, they do almost, they, they almost do better off of it. Dude, a lot of people do, but a lot of people don't as well. And it's sad because she does lift the whole league. And if we were really trying, because WNBA is the most woke fucking league ever, if we were really trying to solve the problem of racism, then we would have an example of welcoming people of other races in our league and celebrating the diversity, right? All they talk about is fucking diversity. Well, what is, what does diversity mean in WNBA? Well, not that diversity. Hold on. Does diversity apply to the, to the NBA? Do we see a bunch of white dudes picking in saying diversity? Do we see it in laugh at that? It's a fucking joke. What is it? That's a joke. White people will laugh at it because they'd be like, well, fuck, I'm not good enough to be in the league. Yeah. Okay, don't fucking, but you don't see in WNBA either. But now, after all, the anti-racism shit and all the, the things that they've, they've said they stood for, they've got a white girl who happens to be the best player in the league, but they don't want her in the league and they reject her. So what does that say about your claims for diversity and, and, and anti-racism and all these things? It says, you're all full of shit. That's what it says. I think she should leave, man. Leave. No, I don't think she should. I don't think she should. I'm saying to prove a point. No, you're not proving anything. Watch her leave. Here's where ratings go down. Watch the ticky-sells go back down. You know what I'm saying? Like, all right, cool. No, I think she should continue to do exactly what she's doing. Yeah. You guys get to get on first form. Yeah. Well, look, dude, I, I don't listen. If we're going to talk about, if you want to be fucking racist, just say your racist. Well, at least I respect that. I'd be like, all right, well, they fucking hate white people, you know? Like, but don't fly this flag of like anti-racism or, you know, diversity because diversity and inclusion doesn't mean all black people. It means diversity. And that league promotes that message more than any other fucking organization, yet they are the least tolerant of it. So physically. Yeah. I mean, like it's yeah. And look, dude, I, I think it's a very bad example for society, you know, if we want society to get along, then we should get along. You know, if we want, if we want to not have racism, then we shouldn't act racist. And acting racist is not just exclusive to one race onto another race. It's back and forth. It's you judge somebody by the color of their skin and where they come from. That's racism, okay? And that's, that's not a good thing for the world. It's not a good thing for society. And if you claim that you're trying to stop that, then why are you so intolerant of someone coming in that is a different race and doing well? It's very hypocritical. Correct. I mean, it also blows up just this whole feminist argument too. Like, I mean, oh, women support each other, you know, I'm supposed to be women don't support each other. That's a lie. Women are the most fucking aggressive, mean creatures to each other in the face of the earth. Yeah. You know, I was, I was laugh about that because it's always like the girls that are like, oh my god, queen. But I'm every photo. And I see them out the next day and they're like, fuck that bitch. Yeah. And I'm like, what? Yeah. You're talking about you just talking shit to me and they're like the first one under the comments all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, bitch. Yeah. Yeah, dude. You know the ones that write that shit. The ones that write that shit are the biggest haters. No. Bro, women or dude, let it do dress up as a chick. Uh, they're going to support that though. Most importantly. Yeah, for sure. Let's get LeBron James with the fucking skirt. Let's fucking put him in a league. Oh, I'm a bleep. And you mother fuckers would be clappin' for him and shit. You know, like, bro, the world's fucked up and, you know, women are mean to each other. They're not nice to each other. At least men like to be straight up. Yeah. Like you suck. Yeah. And then afterwards you're like getting a beer with the deer. Yeah. Like, fuck it. We're cool. Yeah. You know, women fucking hate other women, dude, especially when other women are better than them at something. Yeah. You know, oh, she's not, she only got that because of this or she did that because look at that fucking hoe. No, no, no, no. While they're being a hoe too, you know. I'm a bigger hoe than you. Yeah, right. I do that better. You know, it's like damn girls, calm down. Here we all just get along. Bro, no, they can't. They can. They can't. And they go along. Yeah, I don't, I'm just, I'm friends with more males that I just get along with more males. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's 24 pack of hot dogs. You know, I'm saying, yeah, I don't really get a long blue girl. They just hang, I just all I have is friends are guys. All I have. Yeah. I know what that means. I don't really get along with. All right, Bonnie blue. Oh, man. Oh, man. Guys, let us know down to the comments. What you guys think, man, should Caitlin stay or should she go? No, she should stay and keep being great and do what she's got to do. And you know what? I will say, I'm going to say this too. There's a lot of black women in a league that are pissed off about what's happening to Caitlin Clark. And those women should come up and say, this is bullshit. That's what needs to happen. Everyone's too scared to talk though. Well, they're scared because they don't get yelled at like he gets yelled at. He gets fucking more shit from the own, not really anymore though, but when George Floyd was going on, we did. Yeah, they were giving him shit. Oh, Uncle Tom tap dancer, all the shit. All of it. Like, and dude, there's so many, there's so many black women in the league that fucking hate what's happening to Caitlin Clark. They're saying shit. They're not saying anything because they don't want to be on the same, they don't want to be on the receiving end of the abuse that she fucking takes. Cause they don't get it too. Yeah. And it's dude, it's fucked up. Like bro, these people are bullying her. Why don't there's more good people in that league than there are bad people. Stay in the fuck up and tell these people to fuck off. Yeah, man, guys, let us know down in the comments, man. Let us know what you guys think. That being said, our final segment of the show got thumbs up or dumb as fuck. For bringing headline in, we talk about it and we vote on it. We give it one of two options. So Eli, we have a thing here. We like bears. You like bears? Like bears. You like bears? Never been attacked by one scene amount there while I run. I've seen a lot of bears. Everyone, I think it won't race. I don't know if I was hallucinating or not, but I mean, are you more scared? Would you be more scared of black bears or brown bears or any polar bears? Where do you feel more safe around? Polar bell will kind of like, you know, fuck me up. Oh, so you're you're you're you feel more unsafe around the polar bears? Do you do the black? I feel pretty safe with all of them though, but you know, if you had a true one, you know, it's got to be the polar bear. We lost Andy on that one. Yeah, we lost Andy on that one. He was he was trying to get a grape first. I was ordering some great. I said, what do you feel were unsafe around polar bears or brown bears? I said polar bears. Definitely that's the black bearers. The ones get me. But we like we like bears here. So that's what that thumbs up is about today. Our thumbs up were I think the polar bears literally are the dangerous. No, they are. That's what I said. That's what I said. I wasn't. That's all I meant by what I think they're the most dangerous. No, they are. I don't know where the guys's head was at, but I was just thinking like, if I was like really cold, I was just saying. Yeah. I don't know where my head was either. You're ordering grape soda. It was a gut reaction. But they always get the black ones on the cameras and shit still in the vending machines. Oh, you're saying it's it's unfair. Yeah, I'm just it's optics is what it is. Because like those white polar bears, bro, maybe doing some shit. Maybe they'd be doing some shit, man. All right. But they're not season in their seals. You know, saying they're eating all those seals with no fucking seasoning on it. Bro, I'm just saying bro. Yeah, I'm just saying how did the polar bear get the Coca-Cola deal? That's what I want to know. That's what I want to know. I like fair. I'm curious. Why didn't the fucking black bear get it? I'm just I'm curious. Yeah. Or the grizzly bear or the grizzly bear, bro, make sense. I'm just listen. I never thought about that. It's an observation. That's white privilege. Because I never even had to think about it. I never thought about it. Yeah, just saying. Just saying. Yeah, and the polar bears get away with all their crimes. All of it. Yeah. How sweet and innocent. Yeah, they assassinate those brown ones whenever they do bad shit. Trincolyze. Yeah, and they say, oh, we're endangered. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Thumbs up or down. Special treatment. Was this the question for thumbs up or down? No, no, no. We going into something. DJ's just trying to make everything racist. No, I got it. I'm like actually, I actually think the polar bear is a from, I don't know where your head's at. Yeah, let's get to his thumbs up or dumb as well. I get it. I get it. Yeah, thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads. And a Laskin brown bear has a new shiny smile after getting a huge metal crown for a K-92. You got a grill. Wow. Brown bear got a grill. Yeah. I mean, that might be a thumbs up, then. I don't know. He's doing it for the culture. Yeah. Oh, I got a video. Oh, yeah. The Laskin brown bear at the Lake Superior Zoo in northeastern Minnesota has a gleaming new silver colored K-92 in a first of its kind procedure for a bear. The 800 pound tundra was put under sedation Monday and fit it with a new crown. The largest dental crown ever created according to the zoo. He's got a little glint in his smile now. Zoo marketing manager Caroline Routley said Wednesday. It was an hour long procedure done by Dr. Grace Brown, a board certified veterinarian dentists who performed a root canal on the same tooth two years ago. When tundra re-injured the tooth, the decision was made to give him a new stronger crown. The titanium alloy crown made by creature crowns of post-false Idaho was great if a tundra from a wax cast of his tooth. It's the largest crown in the world. Let's check this clip out. Oh, shit, that's just his head. Yeah. That's what I look like at altres when I'm trying to get warm. They put one of those foils on you. Yeah, I'm in the middle of nowhere. You have to take out of your bag yourself putting on you. Does it work? Yeah. Be freezing as fuck and those things keep you warm. It'll be like, holy shit. Look at that. That shit's lit. Brought thumbs up. Yeah. It does look pretty. If he wakes up, they are fucked. Look at that guy. Mm-hmm. Bro, it's crazy bears look so cuddly and so injured. Just fucking kill you. Kill you. Especially this one. Yeah. Well, he must be from St. Louis. This one's special. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Let me see your grill. Yeah. Wanna see my what? Yeah, I mean, why do they do that? Why did they put the foil on them? I guess keeping warm. But why do they give them the, the, it gives me warm. Why do they give them that? Yes, yeah. Yeah, because he injured it. He injured it. So they just get, so they just, we're gonna have to replace it anyway, so put the silver one in. Yeah, just give him, give him. Yeah, man, it looks badass. It does. Yeah, it does it really dope. They said I had some like diamond studs and kind of something new. Yeah, I've linked it out. Yeah. All he's missing is a great smash. Warm energy. Mm-hmm. There's somewhere on with you. Yeah, man.

I think that was a four, huh? That was a four and a half just crazy. Bro, how do you not look at a bear and want to like, hug them? Yeah, man. It's too bad. They kill you. The cubs look weird to me. You ever seen those guys in Russia? They have like, they have a very excellent, I think they've known them, like they raised them so like, that'd be cool. Yeah, yeah.

What do you think he's feeding them? Yeah, we got double thumbs up over here. What about cereal? Uh-huh. What kind of cereal is he getting? I don't know. I've always liked fruit loops. Fruit loops are good. That was my favorite ones. You know, they said those are the worst. That's the worst cereal for you. Well, I mean, to be fair though, we never did the actual fruit loops.
