What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate goodbye to the lies, the fakeness and delusions. A modern society and welcome to Motherfucking Reality guys. Today we have a very special CTI. We have Andy and DJ and not Matt Graham cruise the mother fucking internet. That's what we're going to do. And that's right. I got not Matt Graham here. What's up bro? How's it going? Thanks for having me. Yeah, actually is Matt Graham, but that's your IG handle correct. Right. There is no Matt Graham. There's only an absence of one. That's right. That this content is so good that when it's not there, you feel like something is missing. It's poetic. Exactly. That's right. It's intentional. That's right. So what's up, man? Not much man. Just flew in today. Fluent today. Here excited to do the podcast. I visualized myself in this room for the past year. So for anyone that thinks that visualization is some bullshit. It's not. Yeah. So Matt is a, I would say a newer friend of mine. I found his content through one of our mutual friends and I became an instant fan. I really appreciate what he's doing. And then I found out that he is a 75 harder. And has, you know, had great success with that. And we figure we just, you know, we're going to stop doing so many full lengths. You know, we're just going to bring people in and let them sit on CTI. And then like for those of you guys that don't want to sit on CTI, you just don't get to be on the show. Like it's that simple. So that's what we're going to do. You know, like, like when these guys, they're like, go go on the show, but I don't really want to talk. Well, fucking go to somebody else's show. It's very simple. Anyway, I'm glad to have you here, bro. Appreciate it. So how did you now, let's run through this story. We'll get into that. We're going to the CTI real quick, but just for background. How did you end up here? Well, I basically spent a number of years becoming what I call a product of the modern world, which is basically probably your average 18 to 24 year old guy here in the, in Western civilization. You know, being addicted to playing video games on anti depressant smoking weed. No offense. Yeah. Yeah. But hey, you know, I'll say that there's a difference between, you know, it being something that controls you and something that you do as a, as a, as something you enjoy after the work is done. That's a, that's a separate subject. But yeah. So, you know, went down this deep dark place for a few years and, and 2020 really woke me up to what I was doing. I felt was actually going on in the world. And obviously the pandemic and all the, in the summer of love and all the things that took place then a lot of things started rise into the surface. And I started seeing that we might have been lied to about a few things. And so, of course, that starts the rabbit hole. You go down the rabbit hole and you, and you learn about what's actually going on. And one of the things that I realized we relied to about was what we should be prioritizing, especially as men in the West. And, you know, the West or modern society will want to tell you that you should prioritize comfort and convenience and being happy, whatever that means. And I went down that road and it made me absolutely miserable. So, I had to try something else. And I started listening some different people, people more in the, you could call it the right wing side of things. And they were preaching a much different message message than I had heard previously. And I started adopting more of the mindset of of those people and doing what they told me to do. And one of those things was 75 hard. So, you know, what, that guys have fucking far right wing. Yeah, all the way. You didn't use. Yeah, major conspiracy theorists. Absolutely. You do supplement solar. That's right. That's right. And ice cream ice cream tycoon. That's right. Future ice cream. That's a fucking fact. Yeah. That's happening. I haven't happened. But, uh, so when people ask me like, okay, what was the thing that got you from there to here? The answer is 75 hard. Like that was, that was the protocol. Um, you know, I don't think, you know, I tell people like there's not a reason there's a reason why I don't sell my own program because I don't believe there's a better one because the magic of 75 hard is that it teaches you to do the things that you that you need to do in order to make. And I believe that that is fundamentally what people lack. They just can't take action for whatever reason or they get distracted, which obviously like we live in a world with endless amounts of distractions. So I can empathize with that. But, uh, you know, for anyone listening to this, like if you want to make any sort of progress, it's going to boil down to what are you doing when you wake up every single morning. So 75 hard, uh, uniquely does this for you because you have to take not only consistent action, but consecutive action. And you really start to understand how momentum works and how the process actually works. And you understand what the term falling in love with the process means because by the end of it, you see, you see the result. You're so focused on your tasks every single day. Like that's the program, right? You're not thinking about like, how do I look today? How do I feel mentally today? You're just like, I got to get these tasks done. And that's it. Like that's, that's, that's making progress in life. Like if you want to, yeah, if you want to get anywhere. Right. Everything that you learn by completing 75 hard, live hard will map to everything else you want to do. Take it in, you know, fitness, business, creating content. That's it. People, you know, they see my growth over the last year, making content. And they're like, how did you do it? I'm like, I've made over 700 videos in the last year. That's how you get, you get good enough at doing it. If you do it. That's right. And that's right. And not just consistently, but consecutively. Right. So that's, that's kind of my, that's kind of the foundation of my message in terms of, you know, what I believe about the world is that it boils down to action. You got to do stuff in order to make stuff happen. And, um, right. Yeah. Believe it or not. Wait, so I can't just sit on my couch or like super glue my hands with Starbucks counter and ship will change. Make difference. That's right. It's amazing. It's amazing. Believe it or not. The needle does not move by merely thinking about it. Oh, man. Dude, I would definitely like to see people off today. Yeah. Well, we fucking, that's nothing new. That's fine. Um, you know, I think the power of the program, dude. First of all, you, you, what I think is cool is like you are a, uh, you are making a tremendous difference with your message and with the people that are, you're reaching with your message, your young man who's, who's amongst a generation of people that aren't quite in tune with the reality of how things work and you're showing that message day in and day out. I personally think you're one of the best examples for someone, uh, for anyone to follow, but especially if you're under 30 years old, you guys should be following not Matt Graham. I believe that you're handling everyone's. Okay. Um, and listen to what he's having, what he has to say. It's amazing. He lives it. He lives it every single day. Um, and it's an honor to have you here, bro. Real talk. It's not to be here. And, um, yeah, I mean, I think the thing that I would say separates me from a lot of the other people that make quote unquote self improvement content on the internet is the fact that I have lived on both sides of the fence. I've experienced what it's like to live the lifestyle of the depressed overweight. You know, he'd anist and the opposite of that. And 100 times out of 100, I would, I would like to take the hard path and live the life that I'm living now because I've never had more peace, more success, more. Everything that I've ever wanted and it's by getting up every day and doing the shit that I do not want to do. Yeah, it's amazing how that works. You know, I think the main power. And by the way, if you're here in this and you just heard a 75 hard. If you go, it's a free program. Okay, we don't charge for it. It's episode 208. Uh, it's on audio platforms only. Okay, so you won't find it on YouTube. It'll give you the exact program. Uh, you follow it. And it'll give you exactly what he's talking about. There is a book. If you, if you're one of these people that has to know all the ins and outs of why things are the way they are. The book will be helpful for you. I'm one of those people. I'm a person that has to know every single detail. Um, so I did write a book about it. It's available on my website. Andy for sell it.com. It's definitely not required. Uh, but I think it's a worthy investment. If if it's someone that's, you know, that you need to know these things. Um, but you can go to episode 208. It's free program. And I think the magic and the power of it, dude. Um, I think, you know, you, you touched on it when you said it teaches you how momentum works and, you know, uh, compounding and consecutive and consistent actions over the course of time. But I also think that the main skill set of discipline and, and the ability to adhere to a plan of any sort is the skill set that most people are missing. You know, we all have ideas. We all have goals. We all have things we want to do. And I was no different. I was one of those people that had all these things to and I could never figure it out. My main problem was is I couldn't stick anything. I just couldn't stick anything for more than, you know, three or four or five days. If I got past six or seven days, I was killing it. And the reality is in life, that's just not long enough. And so the program, what this does, it's a year long program called Live Heart 75 Heart is the beginning of that program. And then there's three 30 day phases that are done over the 12 month period. And it's designed to be repeated over and over again through the course of your life. And the reason it's designed to be repeated over and over again over the course of your life is because it actually helps compound the skill set and you get better and better and better as you go. And I believe that my life is an example of that. I've gotten better every single year. I just turned 44 years old. And then the best shape in my life. I thought I was wealthy. When before I started this shit and I was wrong. And it all comes down to the ability to just adhere 100% with no compromise, no deviation, no substitution to what you say you're going to do. And when you can do that and you live that way and you look at yourself in the mirror every single night. You say, did I give it my all? You have nothing to feel bad about, which raises your confidence, raises your belief. It raises all the things that we all say we want and need and lack. And unfortunately, guys, I wish there was, but there's no affirmation. There's no pill. There's no routine. And in the morning of meditation, it's going to give you confidence. Confidence is earned. Confidence is built. And it's built by doing the things you say you're going to do. And once you develop the skill set of being able to adhere. Aka a discipline. What can you not do? That's the thing you should be thinking about. What could you achieve if you had the ability to adhere to any plan that you set out in front of your path. The answer is anything. So it's the ultimate superpower. And most people just don't put in enough work over the course of time and develop it. I used to look at it. I'm sure you did as well. Like some people were just gifted it. You know, like it was this trait that somebody was born with. Like they just got the discipline trait. And I didn't get it. So I'm fucked. Right. And You know becoming aware that that's actually a skill set that you develop is very empowering because now you realize, whoa, wait a minute. I'm actually really am in control of my life. I actually do have the power to build this skill set that allows me to continue down the path. On the path that I want to be on. And dude, you know, the result speak for itself. You know, when we first brought it out five years ago, it was a trend. Well, it's five years old and it's getting bigger and bigger. So trends don't do that. Yeah, I love a trend. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. And I would say that that one of the things that I like about it the most to is that the the objective of the program is not to lose any amount of weight, not to make a certain amount of money, not to feel a certain way. It is to just do these things. Yeah. And if that's your that's your objective, Alex Formosi says it like you don't commit to the goal. You commit to the actions that are conducive to the goal. That's right. Right. And 75 hard is the only program. I believe that's out there that the only thing you have to think about doing are these controllable actions every single day, every single day. And dude, that's that's how that's how winning and anything works in life, whether it's building a business, whether it's building, you know, an organization or or building up your your physique or a relationship. You know, if we looked at our life, if we took our lives, instead of looking at it like, you know, 85 years or whatever you think a lifespan is. And we just said, okay, we're only going to focus on today, today is our life. And we won that day. And we had the attitude that like, okay, to win, we have to accomplish. You know, we have the list. Because if you really did that, most people will say, well, fuck, I'm going to live it up. I'm going to go get fucking drunk and we're going to party. But if you could just shrink down your focus to the day in front of you and execute today, an execute tomorrow, an execute the next day, those, that's the that's the fastest way to get from where you are to where you want to be is by focusing on winning the day, which by the way, I have a whole another program built around that. You can find that in episode 16 on the audio feed. It's called win the day. It's my powerless productivity system. But I mean, dude, I think that if you could just, if people would just stop thinking about it in any other terms than today, like it's today, because then when you wake up, dude, the best thing in the, I think the best thing that comes from living that live hard lifestyle, at least for me, is when I wake up in the morning. And I don't have the anxiety I used to have. And the reason I don't have the anxiety I used to have was because I know that the day before I did everything that I could have done. So I wake up in the morning and I'm like, okay, all I got to do is do that again. Whereas in the past, when I was not living that way and I was living, you know, the same lifestyle that you were talking about, the pleasure, the comfort, the drugs, the alcohol, the fucking fatness, laziness, all the sins, you know what I'm saying? And I would wake up every day with regret and anxiety and I'm like, shit, you know, I'm 100 pounds overweight at 350 pounds, right? And I'm thinking like, shit, dude, I got this mountain of climb, like, you know, and like it becomes this insurmountable, like, weight that you have to address and you know you have to address, but you keep putting it off because it's so big. And then because you keep putting it off, it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. And so one of the things I'm thankful for, man, of living that lifestyle and I know a lot of people don't get it. It's not for everybody. Okay, it's cool. Like none of my shit is for everybody. If you're listening to this, I'm for people who are for that want more that are high achieving that are ambitious that are driven. I'm not for you lazy fucks that want to sit in your couch and be a fat fuck. I'm never going to you everything I should unfollow me because everything I say is going to make you angry. Okay, I'm not for you. I'm for the 2% of people that are driven and willing to do whatever the fuck it takes to build a life they want. That's what I'm for. So like if you want to feel good about being a fat lazy piece of shit, I'm not the guy for you, bro. But if you do actually want to change, I can show you how to change. And this is how we do it. We focus on one day to time. We do that over and over and over and over again and a very short amount of time because we didn't waste any time during the process your whole life changes. And one of the things that I love the most, bro, is I get to wake up with a clear conscience. You get to wake up knowing I do I gave like for this year, I've given almost literally every single day this year. I've been on the program. So because I've had to reset it. I've had to restart a couple times. I wake up every day and I'm like, you know what? Like yesterday, like actually yesterday was my birthday. I did all my stuff. I woke up today. I didn't have a hangover from party in. I didn't feel back. I ate a bunch of bad food. I woke up. I looked at the mirror. I'm like still ripped. Still handsome. I'm gonna go kick some more ass and it feels good. You don't wake up feeling like, oh, I've got this massive weight to fucking address. And dude, you can address this can happen for you very quickly. I don't know. There's there's a lot that comes with it. But I just wish I wish more people would start understanding that what you need is not what you think you need. What you need is actually the discipline to adhere because the discipline to adhere. This goes into the freedom concept. The discipline to adhere actually gives you the freedom that you're searching for. This is what you're you guys have a misunderstanding of freedom. This is why you're confused about the idea of personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion. Confuses you because you think that laws and politicians and the media dictate your own freedom and that's not true. You dictate your own freedom. And the reason that we don't have a free society right now in the laws and in the politicians is because we don't have enough individual freedom happening at the ground level. An individual freedom is created by creating this plan which allows you to become disassociated with all the tentacles of the dependency machine, which is our our system right. They want you fat. You're not fat anymore. They want you broke. Oh, you're not broke anymore because now you can actually follow through on what you said you're going to do. They want you. They want you stupid and consuming all their stuff. Well, it's hard to consume all their data when you're busy getting after it right. You're putting good stuff in your brain every day. They want you hanging around in the cesspool of social media all day so that you can get your brain flooded. Well, if you make an intentional to hang around people who consume content like my man's content right here to get better every single day. Those things change you you become independent. You become free your neighbor sees it. They become free. So like this is this is all all of the problems that we have. I'm not saying 75 heart can solve the world's fucking problems when I'm saying it's a good fucking start. I would say that. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, because when people think about America and I'll just piggyback off of what you were saying. When people talk about freedom and I believe this at one point too, freedom means doing whatever you want. Yeah. Yeah. And what people fail to understand is that human beings are flawed creatures and they must be governed by something. And that governance is either going to come from you or your wife or your parents or the government. And you get to choose. And I would advise everyone here to start by doing 75 heart develops some discipline and learn what self governance actually looks like. And that's how we facilitate an actually free society because we are completely independent from any other force that wants to govern us and control our behavior because we control ourselves. That's right. We ready to get to cruising. We're going to get cruising. Let's do it. I see belt on gentlemen. Yeah. Guys, make sure you're following that. Okay. It's not Matt Graham. It's on all platforms Instagram. TikTok. I believe your YouTube is well right. Yep. Yeah. Make sure you're following this dude. He's going to do some badass shit. Yeah. I mean, for his looks, you know, what he's a guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like Zach F. Rimes at vibes. Well, before the surgery or after. I even know that what was the surgery? Oh, he got like some crazy chin surgery that I'm talking about. Yeah. Okay. Well, I appreciate that high school musical. All right. That's that fire a little bit older, a little bit older. What's wrong with you? All right. Let's fucking be a show. God dang man. I'm getting uncomfortable in here. Guys, don't forget to pay the fee. Is there something you need to tell us for real? No, no, man. I'm just saying. Yeah. All right. Don't forget to pay the fee. Yeah. No. No. No. No. All right. All right. Let's get into it. Guys, remember, if you want to see any of these pictures articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You can find them link there. And you can also drop down in YouTube below. Now check the description. And you can find these link there. But first before we get to head on number one, I like, I like bringing this up because I feel like it's like, like the war of the nerds from from hack of a better word. This Elon Musk Zuckerberg ship man. Oh man. This he know. Yes. So you got seen this. This is a this have a reads Elon Musk 52. High sauces challenges Mark Zuckerberg to dick measuring contest as Twitter users flock to threads. Yes. Yes. So you see this. No, he said, I thought this was fake. No, it's real. I got to tweet. I was real. Oh yeah. He said he said, Zuck is a cut on Twitter the other day. Oh, man. It's great. I thought it was the parody page when I thought it was too. I thought because he said, I am what's a tweet? He said literal dick measuring. He wants to unroll his shit. Lay it out. But he is from Africa. He is. Oh, bro. So let's dive into this. All right. So this article. This is a New York post article reading you like guys. You have. That's great. Yeah. Order the man of trophy. That was great. And true. So the article reads it says this feud has come to a head. Elon Musk stooped to a new low end. They're little zingers. They write. We're all great. But it says Elon Musk stooped to a new low Sunday as he challenged Mark Zuckerberg to a dick measuring contest. And it was our tweet. The Twitter owner a 52 year old adult father of change made the proposition complete with an emoji of a ruler because of course hours after calling the Facebook co founder a cut. So this is this is the the thread. Okay. So this was not like a one off tweet. It was a response to this tweet. The tweet was shared by data hazard on Twitter. And it says Elon protects free speech. Zuck protects brand speech. And it shows a conversation between Wendy's the food chain and Mark Zuckerberg to which Elon Musk's first reply. He says quote this platform will protect a non for this reason. Particularly. Okay. But then he tweets out this. Zuck is a cuck. So for those of you who don't know. Part of the Oxford language dictionary. A cuck is a weak or servile man often used as a contemptuous term for a man with moderate or progressive political views. Or a man whose wife is sexually unfaithful a cuckold. I don't think he means the first one. Yeah. I don't think he means it. Yeah. But he could be using both. I don't know. But yeah. So so that's what that means. And so he tweeted he tweeted. Zuck is a cuck. Right. And then a couple of hours later he tweets out this. I propose a literal dick measuring contest ruler emoji. Now this is this is a battle that's been going on between these two. The article continues saying the Tesla CEO's tantrum is also involved illegal threat against meta the tech conglomerate that owns and operates Facebook Instagram and now threats among other social media. So Musk lawyer Alex Spiro fired off a letter to Zuckerberg last Wednesday accusing meta of engaging in quote systematic willful and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property. Which a company spokesperson had the nice Spiro also called threads a quote copycat of Twitter. And so they've been they've been rambling on so far. I think threads have has a mast over about a hundred million users. But let's be honest. We don't know how many of those are actually real. Well, they're they basically are kind of making you do it. Right. So like I didn't I didn't realize this but Emily came in. She's like, did you get your so that here's what they did. They fucking make they put out a bunch of posts saying, hey, and they use a bunch of social media influencers. I actually know some of them did this. Make sure you go to threads and get your names secured. Okay. So everybody's like, you know, fuck. All right. So that makes sense because like dude, for me, I couldn't get my own fucking name on these platforms because I'm not on them and other people sit on them. So I go, I download threads just so I can secure my name like because I'm like, I don't fucking know what's going to happen. And then I look at him like I'm not doing a shit. I want to delete the shit. Can't delete it. Can't delete it. What happens if you delete it? You delete your whole Instagram, which you know what I might just do that. I mean, I think it's time to fight. I'm here for it. I want to see it. I think it's time to fight. Man, I think I think people should think very long and hard. And about one person who is clearly compromised by the FBI who talks about it on Joe Rogan. Okay. I'm not saying this isn't me saying. Like he talks about it on Joe Rogan about how the FBI was leaning on him to do certain things. And now that's come out at a mass level through this lawsuit that Eric Schmidt filed that we talked about a last CTI that has basically shown that our three letter agencies are completely complicit and aggressively censoring these social media platforms. And so we have a guy here. We have two guys. We have one guy who spent his own money that he made doing other things to buy a platform to protect supposedly protects free speech. The reason I say supposedly is because there's still a lot of people having problems on there with free speech. But you have this independent guy who came in. So I'm spending money to fucking buy this shit. And he buys it. And then you have this other guy who owns Facebook, Instagram. And now this new one who admits in public that they censor based upon what the government tells them to do. And here we have everybody jumping onto this because they it's this new hot thing. That's the thing to blew my mind, man. Like why so many people just, oh, okay, I'm on that. Well, because they read social media campaign through the influencers on their own platforms on Facebook and Instagram saying you need to go secure name. Yeah. Like they were very smart about how they did it. And then they made it so you couldn't delete. And they did that intentionally too. So like we have to evaluate who's fucking who? Because this motherfucker has openly admitted that he's just going to do with the government tells him. And then not only that, he's given hundreds of millions of dollars away to these questionable election causes that, you know, appear to have had a drastic impact on our lecture processes. So we have this one single individual who is controlling speech. Okay, and he's passing the buck. No, it's you, bro. Like if you want everybody to respect you and you want to be cool, it's going to take more than you do and fucking MMA. Okay, you should stand up and say, no, fuck these people. I'm not going to fucking do what they say. This is my company. I built it. If you did actually built it. Right. Okay, because there's that life log program that everybody talks about. Now, where you know, the CIN and the life log and then the next day Facebook came about. So what's the truth, bro? What's the true. And I don't expect them to ever say it either. But the truth is is like we as consumers should be a little bit smarter than that, don't you think? Like should we actually be utilizing platforms over and over and over by the same people who have shown how authoritarian they will become in a situation where control is deemed appropriate. Look what they did during COVID. Look what they did to us. You see what I'm saying? I don't know, man. What do you think? Yeah, I mean, the character of Mark Zuckerberg aside, which obviously there are a million red flags lining the streets. I think that at the very least people should just look at the principle of contributing to the monopoly of speech on the internet. Yeah. I don't think that people think in general, but generally about the consequences of adopting certain technologies right away. And we've seen this time and time and time again. And this is a weird tangent. But this is something that I actually appreciate about the omnis. Because obviously we all know the horse and buggy omnis, but there's also like the other type of omnis. And one of the things that I think is cool about them is they as a community analyze every single piece of new technology that comes out and decides as a community if it is beneficial to their community or not. And if it is, they adopt it. If it's not, they don't. And that's something that I think that people can learn from in modern society, because we're so we're so we have shiny objects syndrome. We see new shiny thing. We're like, oh, I got to gravitate towards that. And we want to be the first exactly exactly. And I think that that has obviously massive consequences, especially in this scenario, because of who Mark Zuckerberg is because of the fact that he is trying to gain a monopoly. And trying to gain a monopoly on speech online. Yeah, I think that before we start jumping the gun and abandoning Twitter and other platforms, we have to consider what are the consequences of this even again, even if he was like the best guy in the world, you know, no, as Kanye says, no one man should have all that power. So dude, I think it's I think that's exactly correct the whole entire thing. You know, the problem I see with it too, though, dude is like. Like he's already shown that he's fucking doing this shit like it's not like we're like putting our faith in somebody who hasn't stepped over the line like he's already stepped over the line. These people have already shown the willingness to censor like literal life saving information. You know, we can look back to what they do with Ivermectin. Ivermectin is a proven therapeutic for COVID. We said this on the show from day fucking one. I had experts on the show to talk about it. And they what they do, they censored the message. They they de platform people. They ran a whole hit campaign on Joe Rogan for fucking two weeks, top making them look yellow and shit like dude, these people will do whatever the fuck they have to do, even if it causes people to die, which that did. And there's still needs to be accountability for that. That's a whole different topic. You know, people have forgotten. Oh, man, you know, you mean we actually had all these therapeutics the whole time code was going on. Yes, the whole entire time. Then not only that. So that means you didn't even need a vaccine. Right. So then they created this thing to make all this money and post all this control. And these people have already shown the willing to do it. And yet every knucklehead on the internet is over there using it now because of what you said, DJ, it's new. And people feel like, oh, man, I missed the boat with tiktok. I missed the boat with Instagram. I miss this one. Yeah, right. Exactly. It's all my fuck. It is. And it's it's it's really what it is. It's a greed. It's praying on people's greed for attention. Because we live in an intention economy. Yeah. Well, guys, let's get into our headlines. We got a. I thought we I thought that was a headline. That was just a little intro. I was just talking shit. Huh? Yeah, just. Yeah, we are. War of the nerds. All right. Worming up. Just talk some real shit. Yeah. Here we go. Headline number one. This is a very interesting article. I wanted to bring this out just to show some contrast. So headline number one reads Trump special prosecutor probe spent over $9 million. So far. Okay. Now this is a political article article. That's typically more a sinner left more left leaning. I would I would say. But this is a very, very interesting article. So let's dive into it. Right. The special prosecutor pressing a criminal case against former president Donald Trump over sensitive national security documents kept it as full of home incurred over $9 million in cost since being handed the assignment late last year newly released report shows a special counsel Jack Smith tallied about $5.4 million in personnel rent and other expenses on his own budget and prompted about $3.8 million in spending by other justice department agencies in the roughly four months after he was tapped by attorney general Merrick Garland last November to lead the classified documents probe as well as investigations related to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. According to figures the OJ released Friday so in four months $9 million he spent on this Trump special counsel. How that's $9 million of our money. Yeah, that's your man. Oh, it gets better. And of the $3.8 million in the off budget expenses more than half were almost $2 million was spending by the US Marshall service the DOJ spokesperson said the agency provides a security detail for the special prosecutor who has been seen flanked by deputy marshals as he commutes to and from his Washington office. So $2 million just on security again that we pay for all right now so so just to be clear we're paying our tax dollars. We're paying for them to investigate Donald Trump and then also their private security to investigate Donald Trump correct. Yeah, yeah, how do y'all feel about that? Let's know that in the comments. Well, so so this is what I like about this this article here is because they also know there's been a couple of special special prosecutors right. And political did an amazing job of bringing those other numbers into into the article so for example by contrast a special counsel reported in January to look into president Joe Biden's handling of classified documents discovered in his Delaware home. Spend $615,000 through March and let other parts of DOJ to incur about $572,000. So little bit over a million dollars and roughly the same amount of time to investigate Joe Biden but $9 million roughly the same amount of time to investigate Donald Trump. However, special counsel Robert heard didn't officially assume it's post until January providing a limited window into his initial activity before the semi annual spending reports. There's another example you have a third special counsel, John Durham, he spent $1.1 million in the six months preceding March 31st as he wrapped up his report on the FBI's handling of the Trump Russia probe that loomed over Trump's administration for much of his term. As Durham's probe wound down DOJ incurred few expenses for his probe during that period totaling only about $59,000. All right now there was another special prosecutor that was put in really, really big big case but special counsel Robert Mueller you guys remember that one named in 2017 to investigate allegations of Russia influence of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. Yeah, $31.45 million. Now we should say as you're reading this that they spent $31.45 million investigating a document that has since been found to have been manufactured by Adam Schiff and Hillary Clinton. So do we see the trend here? Do you see the trim you know what a remind me of Andy reminding me of our good friend Eric Brightens and how they don't $30 million in the matter a couple of weeks in the last 30 days. Okay, he was leaving all now by the way, I'll say this we got Eric Schmidt. I like Eric Schmidt a lot as a great friend of mine. Eric Ryan's also a great friend of mine. These dudes are both friends of mine. They happen to be running against each other. It is what the fuck it is. I'm sure they'll kiss and make up one day. But what they did they haven't yet. But I love you guys both. You know, yeah, I saw that. Fight on the undercard. But dude, the gritons has a real gripe. Yeah. Okay, because they spent $30 million against gritons in the last 30 fucking days of the of the primary cycle for the Republican candidate for US Senate here Missouri. And he was running against Eric Schmidt and a couple other people. And the ads that they ran against this man were promoting him to be a child abuser, a child beater, which is all bullshit has since been proven to be bullshit. In fact, it was proven to be bullshit like four fucking days after the fucking primary. And they were handing out propaganda at the polls talking about this man who has never laid a fucking hand on his own kids. Yeah, he was some sort of child abusing like fuckhead. Okay. And this is one of the smartest, most intelligent people that I've ever met. He's got a PhD from fucking Oxford. He's a Navy seal. He's a fucking Rhodes scholar. This dude is he's a good dude. Solid dude. Yeah. And like they ruin this dude's reputation with the 30 million to do it. To me, it still makes me fucking sick. Oh, dude, it pisses me off so bad. This just reminded me of it's like, you know, whoever their enemy is, look at the amount of money that they dump in to try and attack over 30 million in the robbermola shit. Right. But then you look at who they need to be attacking. They spend less, less than two million dollars. Well, what does that tell you? I know what it tells me in. What's it tell you? What? Should be, is it to the world? No, it's not even Tim Foyle, bro. It's just real shit. Yeah. We have a completely biased weaponized legal system against anyone who's coming in and threatening it at all. You know why they spent 30 millions on grind and could grind to one to fire everybody and burn the government down and build a new one. Which is exactly what the fuck needs to happen. Okay. That's why Trump gets the shitty gets. That's why any single American patriot that stands up and says the things that we say on this show every single day, they spend money to fuck with. This is why they run articles in the New York Post about 75 hard saying that I'm fucking hurting people with 75 hard. This is why they do this shit. So anybody that threatens their fucking matrix of power is villainized. And you guys, you know, like we can look across the board. But do you think it's a coincidence that anybody that stands remotely against these people gets this treatment? It's fucking hammered. Come on, man. This is this is the way they do it. This is why it's important to stand up against it. What you think? Yeah, I mean, I think that if you're, if you're not making enemies with these people, then you're probably not on the target enough. Yeah. I think that if you look at some of the people that are the most villainized and attacked by quote unquote the matrix, then that's a good indicator that they're on the right path. I think it's important for people to like we have to get smarter, you know, like I see, you know why the left always wins and the right fucking always loses besides the cheating. Could we play the high game? No, they stick together and the right doesn't like dude, like we have to quit looking for perfection from the people who are standing up against this evil shit. Like we're the people, and when I say we, I mean common sense America, I'm talking center and right. I'm not talking to far left. I'm talking even classic Democrats, okay, reasonable Democrats, the 80% of common sense, not crazy fucking humans. I'm talking to all of them. If we continue to judge people that we are trying to elect to do a job on areas of life that are not really related to the job, and we expect perfection from human beings in order to be qualified to do that job, we will never have the most qualified people available to do the job because every single fucking human you, me, everybody else has done some shit in the past. That makes them look fucking in a negative light, okay, that's the reality. That's what's so until we smarten up and wise up and start like not attacking each other for these personal issues like dude, like what I see going on between the Trumpers and the desantis people, like that's not productive. That's not productive, okay, we, we have adopted the, we the common sense have adopted the weapons that have been used by the left that have been introduced intentionally to divide us. We have now adopted that inside of ourselves in our own culture. So like for the last 10 years up until the last, you know, year maybe we had a far progressive left cancel culture, right, like if you said anything that they deemed any of the things the is massaging is racist, fucking anything, no matter if it was true or not true, they fucking canceled your shit with fake traffic and fake bots, which is why cancel culture is not good. Cancel culture never really affected any real businesses. It was just a threat to intimidated people in the silence, but now we have this thing going on with the 80% of people, which is real numbers. This is why when people cancel Bud Light, it goes down billions and billions and billions of dollars because the numbers are over here in the common sense. But what needs to happen is in the common sense is that people stop canceling each other and critiquing each other and holding each other accountable to this level of perfection that is unobtainable by any human being in order to qualify to do a job that we need to have done. And that's something that we need to all leave behind like bro, like if you dig deep enough, you're going to find some skeletons and everybody's causing yours included. So, you know, that's so real man because the left will have a candidate that let's say there's 10. If you got a motherfucker operating on you, do you give a fuck if he fucking cheat on his girlfriend fucking seven years ago? No, you care? Just don't kill me bro. Do you care as long as he's the, if you got a pilot who's the best fucking pilot in the world and he happens to have, you know, fucking, I don't know. And like the funny thing is is like the shit these motherfuckers have done is like real evil shit. Like we got videos of Joe Biden sniffing little kids all over the fucking internet. We got videos of, we've got his own daughter talking about him showering with her and it traumatizing her. We have them denying the fact that there's a little girl in Arkansas that belongs to their family that they're not saying belongs to it. Like dude, these people are shitty people, but yeah, you guys all look to all these leftists all look the other way and let those people do all this shitty stuff. And then you get what I'm saying. That's a lot of hypocrisy. The left will have a person. Let's say there's 10 things right. Nine out of 10 of those things could be fucking devastating fucked up shit, but they still hold on to them. Whereas on the right, we can have a person. Let's say nine out of those 10 things are great because they're one thing it's fucking yeah, terrible culture. Yeah, the far the far conservative culture is unwinnable because you have to be so perfect. And by the way, none of them are perfect. You know what I'm saying? Like bro, I've grown up and conservative America. All you motherfuckers out there saying, oh fucking totally live my life straight narrow blah blah blah. All right, let's dig into this shit. Let's put you under the fucking spotlight. Let's find the fuck out. All right, but it won't happen because you don't put yourself out there. But the reality is is that we have a lot of hypocrites in this fucking country that are keeping the country from moving forward based upon unreal realistic expectations of a human being. And like dude, I don't know about you, but when I want a job done, I'm having my fucking do the job. That's what I, that's all I care about. That's all it should be about. Yeah, the left uses this tack, the both the left and the right use this tacked but the difference between the two is that the left is in power right now. Yeah, that's the difference. Yeah, it's kind of like if all the cool kids are at the lunch table and they're saying, no, you have to fit this certain criteria to sit at the lunch table. Then one person gets excluded, another person gets excluded, another person gets excluded until you have an entirely new lunch table that they're like, fuck these guys. I'm just going to sit at this lunch table. I think that's where we're at. That's exactly where we're at. Exactly where we're at. And this is a little bit of a metaphor, but you know, when you're extremely overweight, I often tell people like the further you are from your goals, the simpler the remedy is, the simpler the solution is if you're completely overweight, you just need to eat fewer calories and move your body. If you're trying to get from 10% body fat to 7% body fat, the minutiae matters a lot more. Right. And where we're at currently, and I'm in a lot of these conservative sort of circles and they're the types that you're describing. If you don't believe, if you're not in this section of Christianity, then you're, then you are our enemy. You're out. Exactly. You're out. No matter if all the rest of the stuff you say or do is good. Right. Exactly. So we're, we have to understand where we're at. And the question is, like, do you want to enforce your version of reality on the world? Or do you actually want to win? That's the operative question. So we are, as a country, the overweight, the morbid Leo beast person that just has to consume fewer calories and walk a little bit to start making progress. So we have to start asking ourselves, okay, who aligns with us on the most basic, fundamental issues? Okay. Let's not have kids mutilating their genitals. That's a good, we all agree there. That's a good start. All right. Let's operate from that perspective. Yeah. And then let's find more what we have in common. And then as we gain more ground, then we can start worrying about the minutiae and these little issues and that little, those little issues. And I think that's the approach we have to take, which is why, you know, I have beliefs about the world. I believe very specific things that probably you disagree with and you disagree with, but that doesn't matter right now. We're not in a position where we're so far away from even having that discussion, bro, it's not even worth having. If you don't worry about this shit right here, we're all gonna be dead. Right. Yeah. We'll never get to that shit. We have to set our priorities straight. I love that, man. And so if we actually want to make progress, if we actually want to, you know, get the country back, then that's how we're going to have to start thinking about things. Yeah. Otherwise, we've lost it. 100% dude. I love that. I think you're 100% spot on with that. Yep. We're over here arguing about the ins and outs of the fucking pinnacle of potential of where we're fucking sitting on the couch and having to move the enemy. You know what I'm saying? Like dude, this is real shit. It's soup, dude. It's soup. This should be really simple. It should be like this. Hey, we're about to lose our fucking country forever. And to communism. We're about to really lose it to communism. We're about to lose the ability to be free. We're about to become complete subjects of a ruling class forever. And that hurts all of us. And those of you who are Democrats, I hurt you too. And those of you who are ultra far right wing, you know, ultra mega whatever they call them, you know, it hurts you guys too. And like dude, we have to and like that's why it like it's so. I think of it like above the line and below the line issues, right? The media matrix and the power matrix is really good at getting us all to argue about the below the line issues. The minutiae. Right. Yeah, they want us to argue about abortion. They want us to argue about, you know, race. They want us to argue about gender. They want us to argue about all these things. When in reality, bro, we're we're above the line issues, right? The economy, right? Our actual freedom. What's being taught in our schools, you know, and really. Their experts at getting us to fucking hate each other over the shit that is like you said, it's it's it's not relevant right now. What's relevant is is that we come together and stop the tyranny from fully materializing. Yeah, and I don't think any of us will sit here and say that topics like abortion, topics like gender topics that topics like race aren't important. No, they are. Yeah, they're just not important right now. Yeah. Well, I think there's an argument too. I think when we when I think when I think the abortion argument is becoming more of a of a more of a problem, not because of the ethical argument, which everybody loves to argue about, but actually from the population argument. We're flooding this country with people that are not from this country that come from all over the place intentionally and the people who actually are from this country are not reproducing at a rate. And what does that mean for the next 50 years and that's something to talk about. I mean, we want to really talk about abortion. Let's talk about that because that's a real thing. That's not just the ethical argument. That is the argument that matters to the sustainability of an actual civilization. Right. And no one ever talks about that part of it. You know, and as I, you know, you guys know, I've been talked about this and a lot of people disagree and that's fine. I've always been a pro choice person, but as I start to recognize the implications over the course of the next 50 or 100 years, I'm starting to lean more and more towards like pro life. And we need to come up with better solutions for these kids that nobody wants. So, yeah, we have to, we have to incentivize having children. And I think that if you are a relatively intelligent person that has good morals that wants to see good happen in the world that you actually have an obligation to have children. And if you can't, that's one thing not everyone's called to have children. But if you are changing from making that point because nobody ever says that. Yeah, of course, people say that shit because we don't have, we can't have kids. People say that shit to all the time. Like, they'll hit me up. They'll be like, bro, when you're going to have kids, I'm like, I'm 40 fucking four. She's 41, bro. Do you not take a hit? Like, you know, it ain't like we didn't try. You know, we practice every day. Like, you know, well, I just appreciate you hitting on that. Well, yeah, of course, like people don't think about that. Some of the closest people to me in my life, some of the most influential people to me in my life don't have kids. They played that parental role in my life. And I think that the role that you're playing. And I talked to Gina on tempo about this recently. You know, like she's great. Yeah. Yeah. The impact that you're having on the world is arguably far greater than you would if you had kids. Because that would allocate your time to other places. And you're instead of raising one or two or three children, you're raising an entire generation of people. And how you've done them. I mean, it's legit. Like you're one of the most influential people in my life. And I know that a lot of people listening to this can say the same thing. And I don't think you would have been able to make the same level of impact if your attention was other places. So no, not everyone's called to have children. And some people have greater purposes in the world. But if you are somebody who is thinking about it, is considering it can have children. I think that you absolutely should and you have a duty to. Yeah. I agree with that. 100% dude. And that's not something I felt for your four years ago. That's something that I felt recently. Yeah. Well, the population issue is obviously part of it. But just from a culture perspective, right? Like the only way because the argument that a lot of people have is like, well, the world's going to shit. So I don't want to bring children into this world. And I say to them, like, the only way to not guarantee that the world goes to shit is to put good people in it. Yeah. Because they're going to be the ones that if you teach them the right things, we'll change the course of the ship. Yeah. That's the only way. Yeah, it is. You know, like we think that we can do. And we can do a lot in our lifetime, right? But if we actually get the job done, it's not going to happen in our lifetime. It's going to happen in our kids and grandkids lifetime. Yeah. You know, we're planting the seed, but we're never going to sit under the tree. Yeah. That's for sure. That's fucking great perspective, damn. Guys, tell us what you think. That was headline number one. Let's keep prudent. I appreciate all that stuff you said to you real talk. A headline number two. A headline number two reads, The US will provide cluster bombs so Ukraine and the fends delivery of controversial weapon. You got to see this? The, the, the Dems are having a hard time handling this route right now. Yeah. Yeah, because they, they talked so much shit on cluster bombs. And how bad they are now. The number one. I don't know. Oh, yeah. I'll do cluster bombs like cluster bombs. All their nasty, bro. They're nasty. They're nasty. So as supposed to be in it, I mean, yeah, but I mean, they're, they're, they're bad. Like it's up there. It's actually on, it's, it's actually like in the international community, kind of agreed upon. They were not using these no more. So this is a AP news article. It reads, President Joe Biden on Friday defended what he said was a, difficult decision to provide cluster munitions to Ukraine. They moved the administration said was key to the fight and the trust by Ukraine's promise to use the controversial bombs carefully. The decision comes on the eve of the NATO summit in Lithuania, where Biden is likely to face questions from allies on why the US would send a weapon into Ukraine that more than two thirds of alliance members have banned because it has a track record for causing many civilian casualties. Quote, It took me a while to be convinced to do it said Biden on a scene in an interview. He added that he ultimately took the defense department's recommendation to provide the munitions and discussed the matter with allies and with lawmakers on the hill. He said, quote, the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition and the cluster bombs will provide a temporary fix to help stop Russian tanks. Now, I thought they were whooping everybody's ass. I thought they were. Yeah. But here's the thing. Let's point out some some political bias here with AP news because they left out a big deal. This headline circulating Biden lets American military info slip during live interview. So during that same interview, that same scene in an interview with President Biden, he didn't just leave it at the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition. Biden said, quote, This is a war relating to munitions and they're running out of that ammunition and we're low on it. He let it slipped. He let it slip and people broke people a bash on this tweet by Logan Dopson. He says quote, love when the president of America goes on CNN to tell everyone we're low on ammo. Great optics. He's asking for it. Listen, dude. This. All right. If at this point in time, you still do not understand that what they're doing is the intentional destruction of the United States of America. This should be the final thing that wakes you up. The strategic oil reserves are in all time. Love. Okay. We have open border with the southern border. We have millions of undocumented immigrants, quote unquote migrants that are actually criminals from these third world places coming across. We have our economy is fucked. Our fucking inner cities are intentionally being destroyed by letting the violent criminals out with things like they're doing in L.A. With no bail and shit like that. Okay. They're becoming unlivable. All right. We have all of our weapons being sent. By the way, a whole bunch of them got left in Afghanistan. And then now, because all you guys put this flag in your bio and got behind it the same way you wore a fucking mask and didn't think about it. Okay. Now we're in a situation where they're gotten the green light to send all of our fucking military resources are equipment, not our men are equipment, which is equally as important. I think anybody would argue to this place to do a fucking war that really has nothing to do with anything here. Other than protecting their interests and the crimes that they've committed. All right. And if you don't think that are real enemies, China. Okay. If you don't understand that, which has been shown that Biden is on the fucking receiving end of money from China for policies, decisions. And you can't connect the fact that they're doing this all intentionally because China is making these people do it. Why would they be making those people do it? Do you think it's just to. I don't know for fun. Yeah. No laugh at America. They're doing it because they want to take our shit. And you guys don't realize that like you live in your little bubble and you think everything is going to be cool because you get to go to fucking McDonald's and all this shit. And bro, we're like the most vulnerable we've ever been ever in the history of this country because of this guy that they put in power who is shown to be taking money from these and then presented as some sort of senile incapable pants sheeting elderly man. Okay. And then everybody said while they're doing this the whole time everybody saying, dude, he's just old. He's just seen how these guys are so stupid. Look how stupid they are. They're not stupid. This is intentional. And the mistake you're making is that you think this is an accident and this guy's just incapable when in reality they're putting us on a silver platter for enemies to literally take our fucking country away. And that's your shit. That's your house. That's your neighborhood. That's your life. That's your kids. That's your future. All being put on a silver platter and then you call me a fucking conspiracy theory is for fucking putting the shit together for you to see. Like what else would it take to convince you that this is what's happening because that is what's happening. That's what's happening. I like do am I 100% sure I don't think I can be 100% sure but I'm fucking 99.99% sure. COVID survival rate. Yes. I'm at least that sure. Like holy fuck guys. Oh man. Yeah. If you think that Joe Biden is making these decisions, you don't understand what's going on. Joe Biden hasn't made a decision in three years. I agree. And so it's funny. He makes at least one decision in the morning. Well, which which which color diaper to wear? Or like raise and brand crunch versus regular raise and brand with extra raise. And I'm sure he makes at least like goes one sniff or two sniffs. Right. That's right. That's right. That's right. And it's funny because if you look at if you operate under the assumption that these people are trying to intentionally destroy a country, what are the things that they're focusing on? They're focusing on depleting the military. They're focusing on opening the border and they're focusing on destroying the economy. These are the three things they focus on, which also happen to be the very same issues that Donald Trump excelled at the most. His crowning achievements in every single area of his presidency was trade, immigration and the military. So if you're thinking about who is the best option for 2024, it's probably the person that's the best on those issues. Dude. No matter what else. That's it. And then oh, I don't like him. Well, he's the one that they gave us to choose from, dude. I don't know what to tell you. Like we're going to not vote because you don't like the way to do fucking tweets. You know what I'm saying? Right. Exactly. And for a multitude of reasons, but you know, to me, the massive reason that Trump is the guys because he has a proven track record of being excellent at these things. He rebuilt the military. He shut down the border and he revitalized the economy. Those are the three things that matter right now. When you talk about what actually matters is it, you know, the way, like you said, the way he tweets, the way he talks, whether or not he had classified information at the, no, none of that matters. What actually matters is what fundamental pieces that make up a strong country are being catered to. And he does that better than anyone else. And we know that he does that better than anyone else. Because he's already done it. Right. So sure. I can appreciate Ron DeSantis. I, because I live in Florida. I can appreciate guys like RFK Jr. And that's a whole attention. I actually like that he's having conversations that nobody else is having, you know, in terms of like, you know, vaccines and, you know, poison in the water, poison in the food supply. Or hormones, all that other stuff. I think that's going to be very interesting to see how those conversations play out in 2024. But, you know, to me, it's not a question who the guy is because where our country is bleeding is where he excels the most. Yeah. And so that's my, that's my take on it. Dude, it's hard for me to, it's really hard for me to, I don't know, to really understand how people cannot connect these dots that this is actually happening. Like, I almost think that it's so bad that people are like, this can't really be what's happening. No, this is what the fuck has been going on. And this is why I do this show. Do you think that I'm going to do? Do you know how much? Oh man, do you know how much I gave up monetarily to do this show? Dude, the MFCO project was number one fucking entrepreneur project and the fucking world, bro. Okay, do you know how much extra money I'd be making right now had just continued to do that? Like, dude, do you think I would do that if I didn't believe this was actually happening? Like, we're in danger. Our country's in fucking danger. You're in danger. You're fucking families in danger. And the more that you continue to give this guy a pass, the more you're denying that reality and putting yourself in more danger. And if we lived in any other time, like any other time, any other time, according to the Constitution of the United States, this man would be already arrested by our military. They would be arrested and removed from power. And in my opinion, the fact that that hasn't happened is treasonous in itself. That's my opinion. Like, how fucking much further is this going to be allowed to go? And all of you guys up on Capitol Hill and new senators and Congress people and you say you're making change. How much longer are you going to wait to start calling for these actions to happen? Because, dude, the guy saying it himself, we're low on ammo. Well, we're also low on all this other shit. We've got all this other shit lining up to the fact of putting us as like this fat juicy Thanksgiving dinner for China to come in and fucking eat. And by the way, if you think this is just like cultural destruction, which a lot of people say that they're like, China's not interested in our land. The fuck you talking about, bro, we have the most natural resource rich land on the fucking planet. That's why everybody wants our shit. Okay, and we don't even use it. So, dude, this is denial. Like, you guys are in denial that don't believe this. And we have to start calling for actual drastic accountability by the people who are in power that do have some sort of patriotic responsibility. But the reality is, dude, if this was happening in any other time with any other person, this motherfucker being jailed. And we're continuing to allow it. Dude, it's frustrating. Like, I don't understand how you guys who are in that in the three letter agencies or in the military, like how you could sit by and just fucking allow this to happen. Like, dude, this is gonna be fair. No, bro, this is gonna kill you too. This is gonna get your family too. Your kids too. Like, why the fuck are you guys not working together to solve this? This is why it goes back to personal excellence because when you call for accountability and the only people that are in power, and the only people that are in a position to hold people accountable are weak, you have to be the type of person that can hold people accountable and enforce good in the world. Dude, think about this. You wanna think about something scary? In five more years, who's gonna be in the military? Exactly. They've already eroded all of the things required to be an effective soldier out of these young kids. They removed their competitive nature. They've rounded off all the corners. They've made everything easy. They've made being an alpha male toxic. Being manly is no longer something that these kids are actually taught. They are in China. Dude, they got fucking summer camps where these kids go and shoot fucking RPGs at eight years old. That's a fucking rocket launcher for those of you that don't understand. Okay, their kids are shooting rocket launchers. Our kids are cutting their dicks off. Do you not understand what it's just fucking going? Like, we are in danger. And it's going to require every single person to step to fuck up, to stop it. Okay, and that means using your fucking voice. That means also making commitments in, like Matt said, personal development, personal excellence, because we're going to have to somehow raise a generation of people that can actually do the jobs required to run this country. And protect it. And right now we have a gap. There's a gap of people right now that are going to be ill-equipped to do so. And they are between the ages of fucking 10 and 20 years old. So in 10 more years, those are going to be the people that are supposed to fucking run the power lines and do the construction and PR protection for our military. How effective do you think they're really going to be? We have a lot to correct here. And if you're a parent, this means your job as a parent becomes the most fucking important thing ever, ever. Okay, for you to raise a high skill level, high drive, high functioning, quality, American human being, from the ground up. You have to be that yourself first. 100% dude. And that's another way that we can fix it. Because we can transform some of the softness into that into ourselves so that trickles down. Yep. Real shit. That's very shit. It's fucking scary. Yeah. Here we go. Headline number three. Guys, starting to final headline. Headline number three reads. Sound of freedom exceeds expectations with $40 million box office opening. So this is a big deal, man. It's making a lot of noise. So Sound of Freedom's opening weekend earned $18 million and took the number three spot at the box office. The film, which is distributed by Angel Studios, details the true story of how Tim Ballard, a former federal agent with the Department of Homeland Security, quit his job and risked his life to journey into the jungles of Columbia in an effort to save children from selects slavery. Quote. As with our July 4th numbers, today's numbers exceed our expectations and we're going to continue this momentum. Sound of freedom has taken on a life of its own. So we're getting messages from all over the country telling us about pack theaters, sold out theaters and spontaneous standing ovation for the film and numerous locations. So to date, the true life thriller has grossed more than $40 million according to box office reports. The film opened in 2,800 theaters and earned an A plus rating from cinema score. The film features Jim Cavizel from the Passion of the Christ Academy Award winner Mira Sorvino from Mighty Aphrodite and Bill Camp from 12 Years of Slate. The film was produced by Eduardo Varistigui and was written and directed by Alejandro Monteverde. Here is the film's trailer. How the fuck? I don't know. Those names, but because I practice those, those are some tough names. Yeah, I practice those really well. I mean, those are a couple of times for sure. Where's it? Can we get like a Stan Smith over here or something? Yeah, Steve. Yeah. Yeah, you fucked that up though. You get Steve Smith fucked up, but you'll say Alejandro Monteverde all day long, bro. Guys, let's see the trailer, man. Let's see the trailer. Here's the trailer for you. The trailer. Now that make you feel... ...giving a child is freedom. Tell him, come in. You have been at this for 12 years. My country is of thee. Why are you doing it? And I'm liberty. This God's children are not for sale. It is the fastest growing international crime that worked out the world has ever seen. For Homeland Security, you know we can't go off rescuing Honduran kids in Colombia. This job tears you to pieces. And this is my one chest, but those pieces back together. Yes, now you have failed to bring me one real-worldly. It's over 10. Close up and come back home. So you quit your job and you go and rescue those kids. So, I've left that to a woman. This all revolts every time. No one goes in. And if this is your daughter. So, she's gone. You're that? That's the sound of freedom. Guys, you can't show it on YouTube, but we will link the trailer for the video for Sound of Freedom. If you guys haven't seen it just yet, we'll link it down in the description. Super moving, right? Now, a couple of people online, mainstream media is picking it up. But here's the thing, it's getting trash. So this is a Fox News headline. Human trafficking films Sound of Freedom, trashed by liberal outlets as QAnon adjacent. So, multiple liberal outlets have trashed the new film Sound of Freedom as QAnon adjacent and fit for QAnon in recent days. Descriptions that relegate the film about human trafficking to fodder for conspiracy theories. Now, you guys remember a couple of years ago that movie that came out on Netflix, Cuties. Right? You guys remember all the controversy around that? These little girls, they dressed up in belly shirts and it was fucking disgusting, right? Now, I want to show some comparison here, okay? The leads into this major talk. So, like this article from the Guardian, okay, it was written for this Cuties news review or a movie review. The headline reads Cuties Review. Netflix's controversial child exploitation film is bold, flawed and misunderstood. Right? But look what they have to say about Sound of Freedom. Same news they just see the Guardian reading Sound of Freedom, the QAnon adjacent thriller seducing America. Rolling Stone. Cuties review. A coming-of-age movie caught in the culture wars. And then in the minor description it says it's actually a sensitive portrait of growing pains that deserves to be seen. Sound of Freedom? Rolling Stone says it's a superhero movie for dads with brain worms. The QAnon-Tinge thriller about child trafficking is designed to appeal to the conscious of a conspiracy-adult boomer. I mean, this is Forbes. The controversy over Netflix's Cuties is totally ridiculous. Guys, it goes on and it's fucking disgusting, right? But CNN, you know, we talk about why, why wouldn't people want this movie? It's based on a true story, right? Why wouldn't they like it? Is it because, you know, CNN, one of their producers was arrested for attempting to persuade minors to engage in unlawful sexual activities? Or could it be the BBC having to suspend one of the top presenters who's accused for paying teen for explicit images? I just don't understand why certain people are trashing the movie and don't want to talk about it at all. They don't want human trafficking to be a part of the public consciousness because they're going to find out who the customers are. It's great, I mean, that's a great point. It makes sense to me. I don't know how it can be like this is another thing like we just talked about in the last topic where, you know, Biden talking about us not having ammunition should be a wake up call to people to understand what's actually happening on the geopolitical front. This should serve as a wake up call that all of this shit that you have been told was bullshit is actually somewhat true and the mainstream media outlets that a lot of you have. You know, put your trust in. And then you're actually part of this problem in reality. Why would you, Rolling Stone or anybody, why would you trash a film for any reason that brought some sort of awareness to this issue with children at all? What doesn't matter at all why why why would you be against a film that shows a true story about human trafficking so that people can understand this is a real thing that's actually going on. There's only one actual reason the Matt said it right away. One reason that they would blatantly rip this shit in public and it's because they don't want you to look at it because once you look at it and you realize that it's a potential real thing and it's not potential real thing. It's a real thing that you're going to realize when I met was you're going to start thinking of it as a potential because right now a lot of people are like, oh, two and a lot of fucking bullshit. And a lot of Q and on is bullshit but the reality is is that we're dealing with people in power at the highest level who don't want you to think that this could potentially be going on. Now why would they not want you to think what's potentially going on? Well, it's because of what Matt said because those people are the fucking customers of that. And do the more evidence that plays out and the more evidence that rolls out, you know, with the Epstein shit and the way these people are normalizing pedophilia. They're making it okay for grown men dressed as women to go into schools and do dances in front of kids. Shit that would be bro, if you would have done that 10 years ago, the fucking neighborhood would have killed you. They're starting normalize pedophilia. They're denying that this is a real thing. Now if you just had to like deduce a conclusion from those things, what would you come to? Well, I can't speak for everybody, but what it comes, what my conclusion comes to is that we're dealing with fucking legitimately a bunch of elite fucks that have a lot of money and a lot of power and like the molasses little fucking kids. And we don't even know if it ends at molestation. Apparently, I don't see the movie, you've seen it. Apparently these kids end up in all kinds of different situations. It could be just sex. It could be, you know, they kill them. It could be they use them in sacrifice rituals. And they don't want you to think about those things. They want to they want to discount those things and say, oh, well, that's, that's, you know, not true. Well, it is fucking true. So who the fuck is doing it? And why is Galein Maxwell been the only person that's ever been convicted of human trafficking without any people that she's actually trafficked it to? And so we're dealing with like some like seriously evil shit going along in the world that a lot of you guys just aren't willing to address this reality. And it's fucked up dude. These are fucking kids. Like you're you're really not going to get vocal and stand up and speak up for fucking kids. You're going to let grown man shake their balls in front of kids. You're going to let teachers tell their kids that they should get transition surgeries and shit. Like what the fuck is wrong with you? Like what the fuck is wrong with the people in this country right now? This is fucking unacceptable shit. The people that are making articles like this and bashing the movie, they do what they often do a lot, which is they associate different terms with different things. So like they'll take human trafficking and associate with QAnon and associate with Jim Kovizel. Right. And they'll they'll associate these things together so that when you think of human trafficking, you automatically associate it with a conspiracy theory. Right. But the fact of the matter is like that is incredibly real. And the actual statistics in the movie that they showed where there are more slaves in the world right now than any other time in human history, even when it was legal. Half of them are sex slaves. And there are millions of sex slaves that are children. That is actually happening in real life. But they want you to associate that reality with a conspiracy theory for the and for those that don't know what QAnon is, it's basically the conspiracy theory that there are as Andy alluded to elites in society that that either malice children themselves or what they often do is use them as a tool in order to blackmail people. Right. And that's why that's where you see all these celebrities, you know, going and promoting the ideas that they want perpetuated in society is because they go to these parties, they snap a photo, they got blackmail and correct. And that that is how that is how they maintain control over people that have power and influence. That's that's my take on it too, bro. Like that's what I think this whole things about. Like, you know, a lot of people make it to be this satanic or it's, you know, these people are just perverts or drink a chrome. Yeah, a dream of chrome. Like there's all these things that people say it's for, but actually what I think it's for. I think it's for it. I think there is a fucking huge underground network of pedophilia. I think it's an elite thing kind of like, you know, those movies we used to watch as kids were like, all to rich people go hunt like actual people and shit. I think they really do stuff like that. And. And so I see this in my mind, this is my fucking observations and what I have decided I think is going on is that these elite people are all involved in some sort of fetish with kids where they molest kids and it's accepted amongst that level. And to get into that level, you have to be a part of that. And the way that you be a part of that is you do it and they have evidence. And then that way everybody's leverage. So nobody tells your right and check that's right. And then they use these things like Epstein. Like if you think Epstein is the only place in the world where they've been doing this. You're insane. This is, this is how they control every country, not just this country. Okay, so this is a global phenomenon in my opinion that's been going on for a long time that they have used like you're saying Matt to leverage society and doing exactly what they want. And this is why you don't see any whistleblowers for it because the whistleblowers are also guilty. So there's nobody coming out and blowing the whistle because they've got some sort of evidence that they participated in this at one point in time. And so knowingly or unknowingly because remember. This doesn't have to be like an eight year old kid, you know, or fucking five year old kid or an infant like the crazy shit that we think of when you think of like molesting children, right. This could be a 16 year old girl that looks 25 that they bring some rich dude to an island and they got like 20 of these and then you fucking party for a weekend and you end up fucking one of them. And that's what the fuck this could be. And so they get that shit on film and they fucking own you forever dude. They own you forever and this is what I think is actually going on. I think that's what's happening. I think all these people are guilty. So nobody tells and that's how they maintain the secrecy of the network. And you know to sit here and say, oh, that's conspiracy theory after all of this evidence that exists has come out in the open bro, you're putting your head in the sand just like you're putting your head in the sand about what Biden's doing in this country intentionally. I don't think it's a coincidence that Ashton Kutcher who is once one of the hottest rising stars in Hollywood, all of a sudden left the spotlight and is now running an organization that helps kids that are being trafficked. I don't think that's a coincidence. How about Mark Wahlberg leaving Hollywood and relocating the Nevada because he doesn't want to be around that environment. How about Mel Gibson being blackballed from every single fucking movie ever. He's lucky enough that he's rich to do rich enough to do whatever he wants because he did brave heart and fucking Patriot and all this bad ass shit. And now he happens to be one of the real life guys kind of doing that in his own way, which is cool as fuck. But like, you know, anybody who stands up against his automatically blackball. You know what I'm saying? So like these, these, you know, this is why we don't see more of it. Like you can't see more of it because everybody who knows about it is in it. Yeah, it's it's that's my take at least for sure. And I think it's very important just in general, you know, if you want to know what, what ideas you should subscribe to, I would, I would observe the things that people get the most hate for. So for example, if you want to know whether something is true or not, well, can you, for example, if you think that China doesn't own Biden, well, can, can Biden mock China? No. If you think that human trafficking isn't real, well, look what happens to every single person that talks about human trafficking. That's in that's in the public eye. The public eye, they're completely wiped out of relevancy as far as those people are concerned to even mention it. Like think of, so like, think of like how aggressive of a response that is to someone that's just saying, hey man, these kids are getting fucking stolen and used in this. And then the automatic response by all the other people in their little genre is to like blackball them. Like, doesn't that scream like holy shit these dudes are like guilty as fuck. It does me. Yeah, you can't, you can't sit there and say that Mel Gibson got blackball from Hollywood because he's objectively a bad filmmaker. He's one of the best filmmakers of all time. He has, he has films that have shaped culture. And you can't say it's because of that. So it's got to be something else and I, no, they say it's because of that traffic stop that he had a number of years ago where he used the N word. That's what the people say it is, but that ain't it either because there's all kinds of motherfuckers that use the N word, including the entire population, not the entire, but the majority of the population that happens to be black uses every fucking day. So we're not like, that's not it either. This is because of this shit that we're talking about. It's just dude, it bothers me that so many people are so closed off to like admitting that the shit is actually going on. Not just this, this human trafficking stuff, but like the stuff that we talked about in the last half, like what the fuck do you guys think is going on? Like we think this is normal political environment. Like you think this is just the ebbs and flip. Like I'm trying to figure out what you think. Tell me what you think. Like tell me in a fucking comments. Like what, what are you, what do you think the alternative is here? Like because I'm sitting here trying to deduce all the things and what they mean. And I don't know, like this is where we end up in. Listen bro, the real world doesn't tell me I'm an idiot. The real world says that I actually am pretty good at analyzing things and making decisions. I've been effective. Okay. So I'm using my skill set to analyze this and this is what I'm coming up with. What are you guys coming up with? Because if it ain't that I'd like to know what it is. You think this is just normal political ebbs and flows. If you think that bro, you haven't been alive long enough to understand what those look like and how they feel. Yeah, I was, I mean, I'm 26 so I don't I wasn't around for a lot of the, you know, stuff in the 80s and 90s, but you know, just looking back the issues that were being argued back then versus the issues that are being argued now are in completely different. We are, we are, we, they used to argue about well, is this fiscal policy a good idea should should should should this be be passed or no, no, it is like what is real and what is not like that is that is what we're arguing now. We are arguing fundamental ideas of good and evil. That is what we're arguing. We're arguing over what a woman is. If you can get people to think that a man is a woman and a woman is a man, what the fuck can you not get them to believe exactly right like it's very, it's very easy like you're born with certain chromosomes and a certain part most of the time. Okay, like no matter how big or small and that's it and I want to say another thing too while we're on this fucking topic. This fucking chest feeding bullshit. Well, that is sexual fucking molestation. Okay, allowing the CDC fucking said that physicians should accommodate men who claim to be women that want to breastfeed their child to take a drug to chemically basically ejaculate some sort of fluid from their fucking nipple. So that their kid can fucking suck on their nipple and drink it. That like what are we doing here playing house no, no bro, this is where past the point like when are we going to fucking do something about this. Like when is everybody going to rise up in unison and say no, this is fucking unacceptable. I'm not going to stand by and allow a grown fucking man to let an infant suck on his nipple while he takes a drug that's going to excrete some sort of toxic bullshit into this child's mouth for his own fucking validation as being a woman. I'm not accepting that. That's not acceptable. And then you have them this I saw an article this weekend where literally at the end of the article about this chest feeding this dude writes and it kind of it kind of got me off a little bit. I'm not going to lie. Don't judge. No, I am judge a motherfucker. We should all be judging like bro, how the fucking you guys live with yourself being quiet about shit like that. I can't do. I don't care what happens to me that shit's fucking wrong. All this shit's wrong. And I don't know what it is that I have that not everybody else has it ain't balls bro because I think what it is is faith. Because I know I'm going to have to fucking answer for it. I know I'm going to have to answer for what the fuck I did during this time did I stay for the right shit or that keep my mouth shut. I say that's fucking wrong or did I just fucking say tolerance because bro you're gonna have to answer for that shit and it's real shit. Yeah, most people most people can't conceptualize a reality where that is worse than being uncomfortable or inconveniencing yourself or even death because you have to in order to fight the fight in order to actually be somebody that that moves the needle in society. You have to conceptualize a reality worse than death because it exists. Yeah, it absolutely exists. Yeah, you should be more scared of living a life that where you were a coward where you are afraid to say what you actually think where you were afraid to make sure good things happen in the world that you just sat there on your phone digging into your bag of Doritos and and you know finding the next thing to the next dope. The next dope a piece of dopamine charged content to pull you away from the reality that we live in. If you want to actually see things change you have to immerse yourself in this reality. You have to look at the world and be like, yep, this is what it is and we're actually going to do something about it, which means sacrificing a lot. You have to sacrifice your comfort, you have to sacrifice your convenience, you might have to sacrifice your job, you might have to sacrifice a lot but the reward of doing so if we all do it far outweighs the cost. More importantly, the consequence of not doing it. Dude, I'm not willing to accept that. I'm sorry, dude. I'm not, I don't even if those people get their way and they win and they kill me, I'd be okay with that. Like fuck you. I'm not fucking doing it and I'm not standing with it. I'm not standing for it. I'm not standing for it. I'm not going to fucking shut the fuck up. This is bullshit. We got grown men taking drugs to street fucking chemicals and the infants mouth that have no idea what the fuck is going on and then writing on the internet saying that it turned them on. No. Like this is fucking bullshit and the fact that it's gotten this far is absurd. Like it's totally changed my understanding of what the people of this country actually are. Like I grew up thinking we are the baddest motherfuckers on the planet. No, we can fuck with us and now I'm like, we're not doing anything about this dude selling our country to another country. Nor are we protecting these kids from grown men shaking their fucking nuts, acts and their faces. Nor are we saying anything about promoting the idea that these kids should somehow have a surgery to affect their genitals that they can never reverse ever. Like, nor are we doing anything about the idea of a grown man taking chemical to fucking a chemical into a kid's mouth because they want to be accepted as a woman. We're not doing fucking anything. It's easier to ignore it. And we're the fucking baddest motherfuckers ever. Like, bro, that's a fucking pipe dream illusion bro. We better find our shit. Otherwise, we're going to get conquered like every other week civilization in the history of fucking humankind does. That's what's going to happen. We're going to be fucking conquered. Yeah, and you have to stop kidding yourself because there's a lot of these people like call them a bunch of people. Like, a lot of these people like call them gravy seals that are like, oh, if a war breaks out, it's on. It's like, dude, you can't even put your mountain dew down. You can't even get off your phone. Yeah. Like, if you think that you're going to, if a civil war breaks out and you're going to, you're going to, you're going to say yes, sir, in Chinese. 100%. That's the fuck you're going to say. You think you're going to, you think you're going to clear the streets with your AR 15, even though you, you can't stop watching porn. Like, yeah, right. Bro, up until this all this to do not remember, like you guys should all remember, do you remember the amount of fucking pro to a bad asses on the internet prior to 2020? Do you not remember that? Where the go? Every motherfucker on the planet was fucking three percent or fucking revolutionary. Don't tread on me. I got my guns and my land and my freedom and fucking all this shit and bro, when that shit happened and there started to be some real controversy in the world and some real pushback, they fucking ghosted. They disappeared. Now, I'm not saying all of them. There's still some real motherfuckers out there like Mike Glover, Sean Ryan, these dudes who, you know, and a number of other ones I'm forgetting. Okay, but what I'm talking about is the amateur fucking revolutionary that made their whole identity around this fucking ideals that they have not even set a fucking word for three and a half fucking years. They're wearing a costume. Bro, no shit. It ain't no different than any of these other fake motherfuckers on the internet. Yeah, it's the people that are dressing up as a woman like they're doing the same exact thing. They're playing pretend. You know, I commend somebody who goes on the internet and says what they actually think is true and tries to wake people up to the reality of what's going on. Dude, it's not like it hasn't cost me a lot. People don't understand that. It's not like people are like, oh, you could fucking do whatever because he's wealthy. No, dude, it's cost me a whole lot. I can't even go anywhere. I have people come to my house. I've had people break in my house. I have to pay them fucking over a million dollars a year for security. Like this shit doesn't stop fucking free. Oh, well, you could afford it. Well, dude, it's not that cool. I'll be real with you. Like I walk out my front yard and I just fucking two dudes at my house every fucking day. I don't fucking like it. It's not fun. It's not fucking cool. It's not a cool Instagram flex. Otherwise, I'd be flexing it. I don't fucking like it. Okay, there's sacrifices that people have to make. I get fucking attacked nonstop by everybody on the fucking internet. 50% of the time I open my fucking phone. 50% of the people fucking hate me like bro, I don't give a fuck because we got grown man letting kids suck on their tits, dude. We got to do it in our fucking government office selling our country to fucking China. We got fucking crime in every city like where people can't even live. We can't do. Dude, I don't know man. Like the more more I see people just fucking go along with it the more more I'm like, dude, this ain't gonna this ain't gonna happen. Yeah, yeah. And that's dangerous dude because before we're quote unquote fucked, all the people who propagated this shit will be fucked first. You know what I'm saying? Because when civility breaks down and because right now we have the law enforced for one side and not the other side. And when that fucking stops, there's gonna be fucking problems. In fact, man, guys, tell us what you think in the comments. Let us know where you guys stand on this. But all that being said, we have our final segment of show as always. We have thumbs up for dumbest fuckers where we bring a headline up. We dive in and talk about it and give it one of those two titles. So that makes it a thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads. Why are so many people throwing objects at pop stars on stage? Maybe styles becomes latest victim of dangerous craze for music fans, hurl projectiles at singers, including a Dale and pink as they perform. Have you guys been seeing this trending? No, because I'm gonna fuck by any of those people. You see that stuff on threads. Yeah. Fucking I don't even understand why any of you go fuck a pay money. Listen to any of that shit. Well, like I don't know what I do like a bill. That's right. Right. I'm with you there. Yeah. She's good. I don't fucking know. Pink. Yeah. Don't listen to that. I don't listen to shit. I can. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. It's my work. I listen to young Dolph. Brother probably throws some shit at him too. You're still here. So article goes and says a dangerous craze has seen artist on stage. Getting pelting with objects during their performances, including a phone, a teddy bear, a bunch of flowers, and a fans dead mother's ashes. Blassy. The trend which dates back decades, but appears to have seen a recent spurts saw Harry Styles shockingly hitting the face by a flying object while he was on stage during his love on tour concert in Vienna, Austria on Saturday. Unfortunately, such occurrences seem to be taking place more frequently with the fan throwing her mother's ashes on stage at pink's concert at bebe Rex's last month being hit with the phone to the face. A Dale also paused her recent Las Vegas show to slam the X as she jokingly dared the audience to throw something at her. So here's a little short compilation of all this going on. Who's that? That's lady guy guy. Who's that Jason? Who's that? Who? He walk out stage? Good. Who's that? Oh, who are they? Harry Styles. What about bleww туда? Oh, I don't see the 𝘈� jóëm on? I don't see.' I don't see.'ine stop right there. Yuri Plus says that she might see she lost the accles. Oh man!! Who's that? Is that the ashes? No, hold on, you went ahead a person to stay. Bird who's that people Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Imagine thinking this is a problem. Yeah, imagine imagine giving a fuck. Like for real, dude.
