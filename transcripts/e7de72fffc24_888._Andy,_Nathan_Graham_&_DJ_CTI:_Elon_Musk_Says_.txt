about the same but yeah awesome well it's great to have you here dude I don't even know how we connected I think we connected through DM's yeah I think it's through DM's and cars yeah we have we both got a huge passion for cars yeah I've been following Andy I've actually been listening to the show since like 2016 back when it was MFCO project so it's awesome to see how the show has transformed over the years and then to become a listener of the show to then being on the show is there is awesome dude what's so cool is like your story because like when you were listening back in the day you were in high school yeah right and now you've got a YouTube tens of millions of followers across platforms you've got an amazing CPG business let's talk a little bit about how that evolved and like get right into it because before we get into you know the talk is shit I want you guys to understand this young man's story because dude it's it's awesome yeah yeah so pretty much I started so for those of you that don't know me I make YouTube videos if you're watching this and you have kids probably asking them if they know unspeakable that your kids probably know me not in a weird way how about some I'm a little bit our demographic is younger tons of kids watch our show I've been doing it since 2012 so I started in October of 2012 that's when I was I graduated high school in 2016 so I started when I was like in middle school going into freshman year of high school and pretty much just started by pulling video games in my room I start with a game of Minecraft it was my favorite game at the time I love playing it with my friends just grinding out hundreds and hundreds of videos over time so I'll speed up the story a little bit but it took me we're not a rush like that was relevant yeah but like I want to hear it but it was a I mean it was just a grind learning everything dude like I didn't know how to edit a video film a video my personality like if you go back to some of my first videos I was so incredibly shy I was a very shy kid in school and that was a belief that I had to break because I was like man how's a YouTuber kid gonna be a shy kid right like I got to entertain an audience if I want to be a YouTuber but it was kind of this thing that when I started YouTube I was interested in it I was curious about it but I wasn't I didn't have a huge like passion for it over time as I made more and more videos my passion grew and developed with it because I'm a big believer in like you don't really know that you love to do something until you do it for maybe a couple years so that's what I discovered a couple years down the line I started to grow I it's turned into an obsession pretty much so about three years in I'm still struggling still trying to find a viral video still posting videos I think my first year on YouTube I posted 143 videos my second year on YouTube I posted like 220 videos by year three I was pretty much doing videos every single day posting one video every single day and these are all long-form videos I know I know today people have shorts Instagram Reels TikToks these are all like 10 15 20 minute videos edited stories every day it's a lot of every day a lot of doing it yourself doing all of it myself I was still in school too that's a shit ton of work yeah still in school so I remember I remember there's days where I would like come home from school you know three or four o'clock I would just work on videos till one to a clock in the morning I had to wake up at 6.30 because I ran cross country in the morning it was growing brutal brutal first couple periods in school I would always sleep because I was just so so tired and the and the and the teachers like I told the teachers what I did I was like I was like I worked last night for eight hours like I just need I just need a 30 minute nap they're like yeah you're good my teachers were we're super nice but that's cool dude what's interesting is the part where you say you know how you were shy and then the the reps helped you develop your and get through your shyness yeah right like a lot of people will ask young podcasters will ask me or you know people that are trying to become more a better speakers and public and I'm always like bro just just reps man reps reps reps reps reps and how do I get reps I'm like we got to start being pretty bad you know so that's cool man yeah so it took me so for my first video to go viral I consider a viral video a million views everyone looks at viral videos differently but my first video to hit a million views it took me 574 tries so 574 uploads is about three and a half almost four years in the process but after I got my first video go viral the second one came very quickly like a month or two after and then the third and then the fourth and that's when I learned about that's when I started to learn about the power of momentum because yeah compounding like crazy I mean growing anything in business and life is just there's so much momentum behind it that people don't understand but it took me five I think it was about five and a half years to get to a million subscribers and when I hit a million subscribers I actually graduated high school which was cool so moved out bought a house never went to college never had a job that's what just straight straight to YouTube so you are the story that all the kids want to be pretty much yeah that's awesome yeah pretty much but it didn't get easier from there yeah definitely got a lot harder because a lot of people think like oh once you get to you know a certain place one you know because I thought this I always thought like oh once I get to a million subscribers things will be easier because then I'll have an audience of people to entertain but in the reality it's it's the opposite because now I have a million people that I could lose you know I work so hard to get these million people and now I got to keep them entertained every week every month and I got to keep growing from there on top of that you got to innovate and you can't get stale and yeah yeah it's a lot yeah so this was just the beginning of all the other problems that I that I was going to develop but yeah just kept pushing through kept going kept going channel start blowing up more and more and more I was launching more channels I also decided to get out of the gaming space eventually so I launched a real life channel where basically we do crazy stuff I mean we like we hunt tornadoes we built life size of Lego houses we cheese what is what is something we're doing right now we're trying to make a Lamborghini fly trying to put wings on it how do you come up with the idea yeah so we have so as I developed thousands and thousands of YouTube videos you start to discover like these these blueprints that you can basically like you know blueprints formulas for thinking of video ideas one of the coolest things that I I mean there's a lot of them that that I use but one of my favorite ones is like the one plus one equals two method and basically what it is is where you take two ideas sometimes I'll take ideas from different places or I'll take two ideas of my own videos and I'll combine them to make a third idea so one of my most viral videos is I filled my house with packing peanuts I saw that yeah so that was like a one plus one equals two idea I took an idea from something else and something else combined it together and made a third idea and that's kind of my next mission that I'm focusing on is you know I've had this huge success myself I'm obviously having a lot of focus on like the CPG stuff and the and our and our fruit blocks company but my next mission is with blueprint which is the next company that we're focusing on is teaching creators how to how to be creators yeah you've been talking about that a lot how to be successful yeah that's what Instagram Instagram's all about so that's your tactician dude like it's really cool man yeah like I watch trying to learn I'm like because I'm fucking I'm we struggle with YouTube dude because I beast man it's it's it well it's hard for us you know we're still really new to it and most of our listeners are audio listeners because they we've been doing it for so long and sometimes we get frustrated with YouTube because we're like fuck dude like this is not even comparable to what we do on audio and I don't know I feel like we put on a pretty good show but I you know it's so we're gonna put some more focus into that you know making a little more entertainment focus and let the podcast be a product of that you know yeah the best thing I try to tell people when they're like starting a YouTube channel I think the best thing you can do is make your last video your competition so like whatever your last video is try to make the next one better in some way shape or form I always like to tell people to pick two or three things from your last video you know maybe it's your intro maybe it's your thumbnail maybe it's your filming personality whatever it is and apply that to the next video because that's what I did for my first five hundred seventy four videos till I got that first one to go viral and then obviously I kept doing it and you know now today I posted five thousand or five thousand videos across all the channels but it's it's surreal looking back man it really it's how you really like it though like oh I love it yeah every day it's exciting I mean when you get to go on a tornado with your friends in the middle of Iowa and document the process and then get twenty eight million views on the video and it pays you out three hundred K it's pretty good day yeah you know do you now do you have someone like a camera person documenting all the time like every day not all it's just when you're like doing stuff yeah mainly yeah because like all of our videos our videos take a huge amount of setup yeah so you know it's normally a couple days of planning a couple days or weeks of setup and then a couple days of filming and then two three weeks of editing so it's a process to get one video out yeah yeah but we were staggering all of our videos so we have multiple teams working on different things at the same time so we basically have like a lot of people in the thing of a production company they have like editors they have creative they have script writers we basically have like three production companies in one so they're like alternating every single week wow on all the different videos and how many people is that so right now in house I believe we have 24 and then we got another 10 just remote yeah remote people yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's awesome that's that's pretty good awesome man to be 27 years old do it like that that's fucking sick oh he's doing it I'm doing it yeah I'm deep in this yeah you see his cars bro what was your favorite what was your favorite car you got right now favorite car I have right now it's hard to tell it's like every every other month I switched something out I mean the I would say the favorite one I have right now I just got a 997.2 3 RS yeah that is the most exhilarating raw car I've ever driven I mean it's just this one has like an upgraded you know clutch in all types of all types of goodies it's a real driver's car oh yeah oh yeah like I was I was driving at the other day and I was like man this is not a car where I can like grab my phone and like change the music I'm like I'm glued to the car but that's kind of what I wanted it's cool dude that's that is one of my main things I love about cars is that if you're driving a car that takes skill to drive or has enough power to literally kill you and you have to be careful and you can't think about anything else so a lot of people think it's just about like oh you're showing off your cars well I mean there's part of that right like I want to inspire the young guys and know that it's possible but it's really like the only thing I can really equate it to is if you're not very good at playing a musical instrument okay and like for me when I was learning a tar which I don't play anymore but when I started learning when I was 30 I was very bad but I had to do total focus you know and then and then when I got done even 30 minutes I felt like better almost like refreshed and that's how I feel after I drive when I'm driving something that requires all my concentration you know it's it's really cool and you know and the cool thing about driving too is you can always improve like a lot of people think it's just like oh you know like they think of it like as a commuter you know and they don't think of it like you know with your with your RS you know rev matching or downshifting properly or heel towing or there's just all these cool techniques that the average person doesn't realize can take a lifetime to master you know and so like you never even if you get good it's you can still get better yeah that's what I like about it yeah they're like engineering marvels too yeah I mean just the the amount of stuff like I just had him a clarinet to and dude we put that thing up on the lift and I was like I got to see underneath this thing I mean just like the amount of like carbon fiber ducting to like this wind goes here to cool this this wind goes here I'm like this is under the car you don't even see this yeah the set is a cool bro there when I first saw him I was like who the fuck would buy this who designed it is but then you start to realize that everything on that car has a purpose yeah you know and if you ever drive one you understand why because they're just ridiculous in almost every way yeah did you have the you have the the round seats in it and yours like the the race car seats yeah yeah they all have those yeah well no you can get two different seats in the center you can get that one that like rounds around and then they have like a more standard race seat okay but I've never I've never sat in the ones that round around yeah they're they're not very comfortable yeah they don't look it's just like bare carbon and a little bit of cushion but yeah um that's pretty good yeah so dude you you recently picked up uh I've been talking about this a little bit on my on my show um a GT500 yes what do you think if you're listening to this show and you love cars and you're on a budget that's the best thing you can go for bro I totally agree like it is the most I mean to put this in perspective I was on the track a couple months ago and a $450,000 Porsche yeah and this thing was passing me yeah and I'm not a race car driver but I I know how to drive yeah like I've been on the track a good amount of times I've had a lot of experience under my belt but yeah it's unreal I mean the and what's also incredible about Ford is like you don't have to modify anything yeah like do you know what you know it doesn't need it doesn't need an exhaust yeah doesn't need wheel like carbon fiber wheels I would like it should be exhaust because I'd be afraid it would be worse but it it just sounds so good yeah for the probably you can't come close to beating it I put it up there with $300,000 I agree 100% dude yeah and I I wouldn't have said that before I owned one um you know like I was saying before the show I got the first customer delivered for GT new Ford GT in 2017 which I still have um which I love and they called me when the 500 came out and they were like hey you want one of these 500s you know will give you one of the first ones would do paint the sample or whatever on it and I'm like they're like oh no dude my buddy Dave he's like dude it's it's it's just as fast as a three RS on the track I'm like come on man like there's no way and then like three years ago four years go by and Ryan Hardwick a good buddy of mine one of my best friends he buys one and I see him driving I'm like what do you think he's like dude go buy one so like I want the man tonight I'm like oh and I fucking buy one and I got it because I think they look cool yeah and uh dude I couldn't believe how good it is and then the inside of it is so comfortable and and like the the ergonomics and like everything's right like it just feels good and I feel that way about the 350R too like I feel like the 350R you know you could pick those up for like what 70 80 right now yeah and dude like if you're a guy who likes to drive manuals I don't think I've ever driven a better manual car than that car no and and any price you know yeah I mean maybe like yeah maybe when you get into the half a million dollar range and you start talking about the high M3 RS manuals and things like that um like the one you just got you know but dude that's that's five times the fucking price you know it's just a it or more it's just I don't know man and then the way that flat six on that three are on the uh on 350R I mean dude I just I'm a huge fan you know huge huge fan of those cars but yeah man we can talk about that later I could be going about cars yeah I could talk all day dude uh have you driven a career GT yet I have not yeah no that's on the list yeah yeah that in the 19 18 yeah you you I got both of those you could drive we could drive whatever you want but career GT for a manual car it's just different I heard it's pinnacle oh my God like nothing can be it's not it's just dude it's got all it's it's just you know how like we were talking about the GT black series how it's a great car but it doesn't make the sounds right the the I couldn't critique the career GT on anything it could do better yeah you know what I mean like it's got enough power but not too much power it makes the right sounds the the pedals feel right the the shifter feels right everything feels right and it's super balanced and I know a lot of people are like oh well that's the car that killed Paul Walker but yeah man that's why you got to respect the car bro you know it's off the drive GT the other yeah well yeah I wouldn't fucking chirping off anything else oh my god yeah cars are getting so fast now too like I just picked up a 2025 S63 and this is like this is a S-Class Mercedes like it's like a limo yeah it's got a thousand foot pounds of torque yeah what what is that a hybrid yeah yeah it's a twin-turbo V8 with you know like four electric motors I'm like why do I need to be hitting 200 while I'm getting massage in the back seats but it's cool it's cool but I'm just like cars are cars are getting so fast for the street that's like it's a little little scary I just bought a last August so when I when I got first got into cars I had a 2012 R8 V10 manual and I built it all the way I wanted and then I got in a cash pinch where I needed some cash so I kind of I had to sell it I didn't have to sell it but I decided to sell it and then I could never find another one and then I found a last August I saw 15 pop up on one of the websites I think it was auto-tempest and I fucking bought it right that because I haven't seen one in like 10 years come up it was that was gated and then I built it exactly like the one I had same wheels same everything and dude you know compared to it's probably the slowest car I have in the garage but it's also like one of the most fun you know what I mean because dude you're right like some of these some of these cars have so much power that you can't really enjoy them unless you're like way out you know on some big stretches you know yeah and I'm a big fan of like actually having to drive the car yeah so yeah man the power on these cars is getting crazy dude do you have a do you have an SVJ no I don't I got pissed off at Lamborghini about six years ago and I actually uh so so when the SVJ 63 came out I tell the story it's just so I had like between when I started getting cars to win the SVJ 63 came out I had owned probably 20 Lambo's 20 different lambos like a lot and and dude everybody knew that Andy for seller was a fucking Lamborghini guy because I grew up that way and then when the SVJ 63 came out they didn't give me an allocation and like I was the number one client at our local store I was also one of the most visible people on the internet I was post you know what I'm saying like I made it like dude and they didn't give me an allocation and I'm like guys what the fuck and they were like well you know and they kind of were like and I'm like well fuck you and by the way I also sponsored fucking race team you know what I'm saying so like we had a first form fucking Lamborghini race car that was winning yes that won the championship yeah so so I was like I got rubbed wrong like that it pissed me off and so dude I at the time I had I had two cars at home I had an eventador SV roadster which dude I I'm gonna get another one because I missed that car a lot um and then I had a hercom performante uh those map black which I really like that car too and fucking dude I fucking traded him in on a like literally like the truck came to pick them up and on the truck was a Tdf and the 4 5 8 aperta and then they took the two cars away so like and I made a little fucking video and I sent it to him yeah so so like I went from like I wanted to like prove a point yeah so like the bull man yeah so the lambo's went away the Ferrari's came in I've got it on my fucking video and I sent it to him like this is what this is fuck you but here's the cool thing so I was kind of anti-f Ferrari up until that point and a lot of my buddies were like dude you know you know how there's like a little thing there and then when I got into the Ferrari's I was like fuck these are great like these are amazing cars and I don't they they didn't look as aggressive but the car was more fun to drive and so like now I'm like a super you know I'm super big on the Ferrari V12s I think the Ferrari V12s are insanely good but you know they don't have the road presence or the curb presence of an SVJ yeah and the sounds good like I run a no-text on my V12s and they I mean they fucking scream but they don't scream like a guintani fucking that's that's what mine's in the shop right now getting the exhaust while literally right now they said it's gonna be done tomorrow yeah I need to fly by you can't wait to get the oh dude I can't wait to get home Saturday yeah I'm gonna get another one I'm I want to get I've been looking at this SVJ or I'm sorry SV Roadster I would like to what eventually I will get an SVJ Roadster and an SV Roadster because dude like I just I do like I do like them they're brutal they're raw they the sound isn't insane and like dude let's be real man like you just kind of feel a different way driving it you know what I'm saying and so I love them dude I'm over it now you know but that was the story of what's going on yeah yeah like I like the cars man I didn't like the way I didn't like the way they went about it and the conversation I had about the allocation with them was just like it was just like it was fucking rude and then I will say this too you know a lot of people dog Ferrari for being you know like not wanting to deal with them bro I've had nothing but great experiences with them they have been very nice very good very accommodating and it's like I you know I I don't have anything but great shit to say about how they run their company you know and I think the people that say bad shater people that don't you know it's out the club hating sort of yeah like it's kind of like once you're in the club you know it is what it is but you know like like Chris Brown so yeah I was looking outside the club you can even get it yeah I did yeah I mean it's they I can only say how I've been treated and they treat me tremendously well yeah you know I'm down at Ferrari of Austin that's my dealer they're fucking amazing um but yeah dude I love I love cars bro and you know it's cool it's not about the price of the car either like it's like my favorite car is my 70 Chevelle like I so I'm sure I drive that car weight five times to every other one yeah probably yeah yeah yeah you know it's just about what fit you and what suits you and what you like yeah yeah and once you've had like the cool shit you stop valuing the cars on what they cost and you start valuing the cars on the experience you know yeah 100% yeah I've had I've had all the new stuff I've had all the the techy stuff the cool stuff the fun stuff and now I'm just I'm going back to the to the older stuff yeah to be honest with you like the older cars the stuff I wanted in the beginning but I was like man the new the new one is so much cooler yeah but once you have the new one you're like it's alright yeah you always find your way back home bro yeah there's just so much character in some of the older cars yeah um you know it's hard to beat but yeah that's I mean dude when I was a kid I grew up like loving Lamborghini's that's probably one of the biggest reasons that that I was able to stick through the hard times of our business was because I desired to to participate in that in that hobby I didn't want to be a spectator of it yep that's why I get so upset when people shit on people for like wanting whatever they want because you're like bro you don't know what goods gonna come of that like now we employ all these people they're building careers you know we have all these people getting in shape and doing like there's a lot of good things that come from someone's uh desire and then as you grow you start to realize that the true prize is the difference and the impact and your people around you but you still appreciate that that hobby you know what I'm saying and uh I just you know I grew up wanting white kuntosh which I haven't owned yet I still want to own that even though I don't think I'll fit in it um but you know in a 70 chavelle yeah like that's chavelle dude when I look at that car I'm like that that's that's me dude yeah like it feels right yeah yeah I was I was like the same way like growing up I'm this might sound ridiculous but like one of my friends growing up his his dad owned all types of companies but he had a you know white super la gira he had an eventador and I've never seen a lambo in my life and I go over to his house and they lived in a very normal like you wouldn't if you looked at their house from the outside you wouldn't know there's two two lambo's in the garage well I I was like that at one time yeah but I went in there and I was like whoa dude this is crazy and we went on a drive and all this stuff and I I just kind of thought because I've always been a car guy even before I saw those cars but I was like and this might sound stupid but I was like if I don't figure out a way to own one of these cars before I leave this earth yeah I think I will be in depression like I just don't like for eternity you look up depression of the series is a picture no but it's just like he did it why can't I that's true you know like there is no there's just there's no excuse honestly I was like I'm I'm getting in one of these cars yeah and it's a committed decision yeah yeah dude I get it bro like I've I've always been the same way like I saw my first kuntosh when I was eight and I was like whatever I got a new man like and I was I tried everything bro I was doing lemonade and selling baseball cards so light bulbs door to door like fucking anything yet internet yellow page like dude all this crazy shit like I could go on and on and on but like yeah dude I mean that was a huge it was a huge motivator that helped me bridge that gap between the times when it was really really hard and you know uh now you know what I mean and it's a passion I still enjoy you know and if you're not a car person you probably think like what the fuck are these guys talking about but if you are you know exactly what we're talking about yeah I also remember like going to my local car show and just being like you know what I didn't have a nice car out I was just a spectator like my parents would take me there whatever um and now they're putting me in the VIP section and they're like you're the nicest car here like it's cool it's it's it's unreal to go through that yeah totally bro so totally well fuck man that's I mean first of all uh did we cover your your your juice blocks I think not not too much yeah yeah yeah yeah let's talk about that because I want people to support that note know who's who's doing it yeah pretty much so we launched company so as as I got hundreds of millions of views on YouTube and drew my career um I started to realize that I'm basically running a marketing company without a product um so we were signing brand deals we were signing all types of things and I was like I really need a product um like a real product a scalable product a good product what can um what can I put my videos and you know we wanted to pick pick something that was going to align with our audience so we started with apple juice um for kids it went all right we're kind of discontinuing it because you know turns out kids don't actually like apple juice it's more so the parents that give it to the kids for sure so now we're going uh down the fruit snacks route um so we have fruit snacks we have sour fruit snacks that are launching um we're in all types of stores walmart hb croger um it's it's it's it's pretty unreal how fast this company has grown and I think because I had so much momentum and leverage behind my brand I was able to get in a lot of doors that I wouldn't normally be able to get into like right off the gate they put it on every single walmart yeah that's awesome like on day one you know um so it was it was really cool to see but I think a lot of these older companies older retail are kind of opening their eyes to people that harness attention which I think today is just one of the most valuable things that you can have with your company they're starting to understand the creator economy yeah yeah yeah um so it's just people that have personal brands attention views whatever you like that's just it's just the most powerful thing that you can harness in the 21st century um and then if you attach to the the loyalty the trust and all the other things behind it I mean you just become unstoppable yeah so how's that been for you in terms of you know learning business from a um you know not from books but from doing yeah it's um the cpg stuff is a whole different ballgame because you're a big reader like me right yeah you I mean we were talking about this the other night in DMs like he Nathan posted a shot of his his book collection I'm like bro that like is the exact book collection I have to so we started talking about our favorite books but like um you know I I could tell you're a tactician and everything that you do so yeah I'll be interested to hear like how that's going you know what I'm saying yeah I mean it's going good it's yeah it's it's flying off the shelf to be honest with you we're having a lot of stories sell out a lot of people are or having trouble finding products um but I think that is I mean that's kind of the results of aligning a really good product with our audience of you know we we average a hundred million views every single month um across all our channels so you got a hundred million people across the entire US the US is our biggest audience we have people in the UK Australia other but you know the United States is our biggest audience so when you align a product perfect with that audience exactly what they wanted and you launch it nationwide I mean of course you're gonna have a crazy effective store selling out and all that stuff but obviously you got to make a good product too because one of the big things I've learned from you is word of mouth yeah it's like easily the most important thing um so that's one thing we're working on we're trying to make not just not just rebranded fruit snacks but let's make the best fruit snacks on planet earth you know so how involved are you in the in the business did you do you like did you go through the entire I think you did but I want to hear it um you know concept to you know formulation to packaging to the dealing with the distribution and is that are you doing all that yourself or do you have some guys helping you or did you hire executives that would experience or yeah do it yeah so we actually got some guys with a lot of experience because um you know I was I was running all my YouTube channels I was extremely busy I mean I was already pulling like 80 90 a hundred hour weeks and I was like there's no way I'm gonna add this on on top with the amount of stuff I already have on my plate so you know we went out um our management company we went out and we hunted for people that we thought would be a good fit um we found someone from a big big company big CPG company that helped grow it to billions of dollars in sales and we basically made him our CEO and then we picked up other people along the way as well that really knew what they're doing um one of the biggest things I learned about hiring people is like if you sit down in a meeting that some of the best people that I've hired when I sit down in a meeting with interviewing them or whatever if I walk out of that meeting feeling overwhelmed that's probably like I probably need to go after that person and hiring the team for fruit blocks is how I felt when I was talking to them yeah like they taught me so much in this meeting and I was like and I already thought I knew a bunch about business I was like oh yeah I know branding I know packaging I know this but they're like no no you don't know this so you don't know this the distribution whole another ballgame that I haven't touched so having that help has been very very valuable um to our team but it's you know it's a lot of working pieces yeah everyone has a role to play I mean bro that's the way to do it dude you're jumping fucking 15 20 years ahead minimum by doing it the way how'd you find those guys um a lot of a lot of connections a lot of just like people asking people um that's kind of how we operate how we hire people we don't really like we we don't really put out job postings very often like it's really through word of mouth yeah that's where we good ones are in that's where we built most of our team right is just talking to people like if we need a video editor we talk to people in our company and we're like you know video editor you know video editor and we'll bring them in um that's another great thing I learned from you is bringing in people from the bottom having them work up to the top yeah um so that's one thing we focus on and we've built some incredible employees yeah a through that method that's awesome that's what it's like fuck bro it's so cool to have like just to have you here and say you know you listen to the show back in 16 and now you've gone on to have all this success with YouTube you know you're your CPG companies your management companies you're you're scaling of employees like you must have really really fucking listen oh yeah but uh that's about all I listen to well dude it's to be honest it's not in reading books it's so cool to have you uh have this come full circle for me because like a lot of times when I make that content I'm sure you've heard on the show I get frustrated because I'm like fuck are you guys listening you know and and just to have um just to have you sitting here with with all this awesome shit that you're doing is really cool man yeah I really shit it yeah all right I didn't know this I learned this today you taking them on the tour uh Graham is not your last name no didn't know that good I added on the lockered everything yeah that's fun like what's funny about it you would tell the story about that or is that you can get a confidential yeah no no I can tell the story like it's not a big deal um so basically like so someone like made up my last name because I you know I didn't really put my last name out there uh so someone just made it up and they made up the name Graham so I was like okay cool whatever so that's me now yeah that's me now so then like Forbes reached out because they wanted to put me on the Forbes list and I was like oh this is this is sick like this is a you know one of the things on my list that I want to check off um and so I don't if you've ever dealt with Forbes they have to you know you have to send them like documents it's very legit like they don't you know they you don't just like tell them how much money you made they got to like verify it so we sent them to documents and they're like oh you got the lot the wrong last name on your documents and I was like no no these are these are real documents and they're like oh we don't they didn't really believe us about to call the police are you away I know it's like no that's that's that's my name it's like oh no we're gonna use your other name we're gonna use this name because we don't really believe you and I was like all right it is what it is yeah they posted it on Forbes with the name Graham and I was like I guess that's my last name would you get 30 or 30 no I got Forbes highest paying YouTubers and like top creators we made it on two different lists fucking awesome yeah sick man so I was talking to a buddy about Forbes list yesterday about the billionaire list like I don't think people realize this but like there's way more billionaires that there are on that list oh for sure yeah a lot of people think like oh this is the list that's it yeah right right you guys gotta realize that there's a lot of billionaires that want to stay quiet and don't want to because you like Nathan said you have to basically allow them to do a dive into your actual finances and a lot of people aren't comfortable with that but it is great for like exposure yeah sure man yeah but yeah people people think that's either pay for play or made up and that's not it's real shit it's just that you know there's there's a lot of people that don't do it as well or like like ink ink 100 or ink 500 there's a lot of companies that that are belong on the list but don't submit to it so you know a lot of people get confused by that just like they get confused with net worth yeah right yeah I think net worth is like how much fucking sell or got in the bank how much cash you got yeah it's like okay man all right but yeah dude that is super cool man super super cool yeah it's it's it's really surreal like sitting here right now too well soaking it in it's I mean look man you know I always took the approach of I felt obligated to share what I knew or what I had learned because there was I know there's people coming up that need to hear it and I was very fortunate to be around people growing up that were entrepreneurs so I learned a lot of shit you know what I mean and Vaughn is the one that pointed it out to me he's like bro you gotta understand because like for you know when you live your life you don't think that you think you naturally think that everybody else is just like you like they know what you know you're not that special and Vaughn pointed out to me one day he's like hey man he's like you know you have like this information that we're talking about like people don't know this like and I'm like what do you mean he's like like this and this and this I'm like well that's common sense he's like yeah to you because you grew up around that shit and so like dude I've always felt obligated to help people learn those things and and not get keep them you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah and you inspired me to do that too because that's that's the next company yeah you do give you give a lot of dude you know it's cool this is cool so now I'm fucking learning from you I'm watching I'm watching your your your Instagrams trying to figure out how to you know think about our YouTube so that dude I just thought about that that's really cool but yeah that's that's my next company is like that that blueprint stuff that I've been doing it's you know it's basically like everything I know about YouTube it's you know we split it up into all these different chapters and sections and difficulty levels and all this stuff but that came from you because I was like I remember you talking about that a long time ago like you know you really need to share this advice and I thought the same way and then I also reflected back on my story you know when I was three years on YouTube struggling trying to get a viral video and I was like man if I would I would kill for this information like literally I would do anything to get this my hands on these this information these blueprints like how do I make a good title thumbnail how do I make this how do I think of my next video idea how do I how do I schedule my content like there's just so many of these little tiny things that I had to learn and suffer through like years of failure just to try and figure out but yeah your podcast has been a huge like just jump start ahead well even some of the simple things like you know when you hire someone start them at the bottom start them by sweeping the floors and then bring them up to that executive level and they got to work for that yeah 10 years 15 years whatever it is or it could be you know two years but just they yeah yeah understand they're gonna prove themselves they need to understand that we're none of us are above that right to create the proper culture it's just yeah dude but but like my thinking was reversed because like when I when I was talking to friends or other business people they were they would always be like no you got to get someone you got to hire an executive from another executive of a company and I'm like I'm like okay I guess that kind of makes sense there's places for that too but yeah there is there is there is for sure but then your philosophy was just like kind of backwards but it made more sense but it just kind of opened my eyes to perspectives that I've never heard of yeah yeah I mean look there's a place for both you know like when when we innovate something here at first form you know we back in the day we would try to learn it and figure it out you know because we have the resources to hire people you know of that level so we're like okay well I guess we'll figure it out and then you know now it's like okay we're gonna go into this category let's find someone who actually has done this and won't hire them in and yeah it's it's it's says a lot of fucking time yeah but there's a place for both man for sure but bro it's you're any talks of shit then let's do it yeah let's do it ding ding ding yeah let's get some crews and guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com guys check them out there or come check us out on YouTube and follow along with us before we get started I got a question for you guys it's a very simple question okay can a man call

shut the fuck up no I mean yeah it's just it's all I want it just saying good night sweet dreams and stuff oh we'll get that man I don't even know what to do they're working well but you know it's for all I thought you were called because like he don't ever call me at night and this there's like a problem somebody showed up on the property or something like someone's going on some wrong yeah no fuck you man that's alright man dude I think I think that's it that's something we need man like bro that's okay call your bro so you know tell him good night man yeah I don't know about that I don't know nothing around with it yeah yeah I don't know about that man always either feelings too you know you open up a little bit yeah man you know I'm just checking on you bro alright alright it feels a little weird I don't know man it's a do-train I don't know guys something down with that bro I sniff that shit out immediately yeah you did yeah yeah well so the thing was so I was supposed to do it like like that was what I don't know it was like it was the past 10 I was supposed to do it like fucking like days ago almost a week ago and me and my dog really only playing it out and like it always get there like it be like fucking eleven o'clock I'm like that I'm not calling him at eleven o'clock well I'm not doing that no cuz you know I'll freak out yeah that's too late that's way too late you know I'm saying but I'm like alright it's like fucking 930 bro let's give it a try and I know yeah I'll try to get I mean you didn't get me bro just like I don't laugh at your jokes that's fine yeah that's fine you did practice out I mean listen reps that's right exactly it's reps reps man yeah man alright let's get into some headlines man let's talk about this trending right now what's happening um let's go to DC first got some interesting things happening there Elon Musk he's out are you been following the doge stuff at all little bit okay so Elon Musk is out everybody's freaking out over this and we're like oh you know it must be him and Trump or having some issues no like they said what it was gonna be from the get go um but yeah Elon Musk think President Trump late Wednesday is he officially stepped down from his temporary gig leading to the budget slashing department of government efficiency so he's you tweeted this out on Twitter he's saying quote as my schedule time as a special government employee comes to an end I would like to thank President uh Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending the world's richest man posted on his social media site um and he continues saying the doge mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government so it was 130 day extended expires on May 30th that's all it was nothing really crazy to that um and other news though there has been some interesting things you know like the court's been fucking with you know Trump that's neither here nor there uh got judges don't want to see how they've been trying to spin this bro they try like that's how they do everything they how they do everything this is being spun as a huge rift and egos clashing which i mean is believable but possible but that's yeah really the reason though you know I mean I know it's just fucking expired that's it you see him come out though and say that uh he didn't like uh Trump's big beautiful bill yeah but I mean in that the the point I know having getting right like i'm not gonna agree with everything you got going on yeah you know um but uh but outside of all of that there's been some interesting stuff happening uh one of the powers of the president has uh this has been causing some risk is the ability to pardon people okay and so he can party anybody pardon anybody from any you know federal crimes um and he's been doing that the the first when he released was uh Todd Chris Lee you guys remember this guy he had a um like a reality TV show I got went to prison oh yeah for what i mean i'm sure you wouldn't yeah i think you probably enjoyed it but because he's a little he's a little like i his a little different he's a little different he's a little different he's a little different i was i was sense a little difference for them that was that was a little different yeah you know so i don't think he you know what do you go jail for so he went to jail for uh let's see he was convicted of a fraud and tax evasion federal prosecutors found them guilty of faking documents to obtain over 30 million dollars and loans and then dumping them by declaring bankruptcy so hey yeah wasn't this whole thing that they were like super wealthy yeah hmm super wealthy so it was total shit yeah probably yeah i mean hmm probably huh yeah but they he just got pardoned this was the phone call from uh Trump to his daughter uh let's check this out that's a terrible thing it's a terrible thing but it's a great thing because your parents are gonna be free and clean and i hope we can do it by tomorrow is that okay we'll try getting it tomorrow so give them i don't know them but give them my regards and wish them a good life wish them a good life Mr President yes oh yeah thank you for bringing my hair back yeah well they were giving a pretty harsh treatment based on what i'm hearing pretty harsh treatment was your brother was your brother fighting also for this release right hey i go to the university of Alabama and i don't know you speak and i thought that's the greatest of people ever in my life that's good i was just there i gave the commencement what a great group of people if you were the audience you have to be good what a good school it was and i love Alabama you know i love Alabama it's uh that school is really that was very impressive what i was saying yeah i think i did a good job i got a lot of good comments on that one so that's good i love doing that with great young people as we freed them now i mean i think they were facing like like 17 years where's whether it was supposed to be you know since they just got sentenced in 2023 but there's another that was there was a bunch of pardons this other one also is causing some sturs rapper NBA young boy thanks president trump for pardoning him you know young boy listen to any of this stuff i listen to some of this stuff but i saw him at the Lambo dealership buying a car once really knows about it he's an interesting cat man i don't know anything about him dude i think when i for you when he first came out i said to myself i'm like he looks like he was the type of kid to like bite people yeah you know what i'm saying he fucking just bit people my chain is better than his it is i'm just saying but yeah he had uh he had a couple of gun charges and stuff on him he got pardoned i posted this out uh saying quote i want to thank president trump for granted me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building as a man artist this moment means a lot it opens the door to a future i've worked hard for and i'm fully prepared to step into this big thanks to the pardons alice marie johnson for fighting for second chances for so many people into my lawyer britney k bar net uh for being in my corner and all of your hard work to make this possible and thank you to everyone who believed him i'm grateful i'm focused i'm ready can trail yeah that nigga definitely built bits and people um but yeah sure quick biting people dude i'm telling bro listen every time i know those kids bro he looks like johnson but um can trail yeah bit right right and he's biting people for sure but you freed a couple of other people another person you freed was um Larry Hoover that was on the larry big niche yeah right like that that's very hoover well so yeah larry Hoover is a big deal bro like he's that's a big big deal um i got a lot of boys in pretty happy about that uh gangsters decide we rick ross probably yeah he's probably i pretty happy about it but he committed his uh commuter dissent since he was uh imprisoned in connection with the murder in 1973 um um and uh and then also had a rico charge of 98 and uh so he's out too so a lot of pardons i stuff happen in any thoughts theories anything on that free my nick i mean you know i i mean they can't stop that they're stopping everything else he's doing they can't stop the point i mean that's true you know you know but like what about all the other people that are in jail for the same shit that's what i was going to say yeah i mean it's definitely it's marketing it's branding it's trump trying to appear like he's you know being generous but i mean let's be real man like should people be going to prison for 40 years for financial fraud when violent crime can get two or three that doesn't make sense or other politicians doing you know financial crime yeah i can free in the moon so i mean i don't know like to me it's i don't know to me i feel like everybody should be held equally to the law i don't feel like i think there's more of a problem in the way that people are sentenced and held uh for the level of crimes like and i know this because i've been through this but a lot of times the sentencing on violent crime is actually very easy compared to financial crimes or drug crimes or consider white collar crimes yeah and they'll throw someone away for 40-50 years for fraud which you know i agree is not good but what's worse you know uh stabbing someone in the face or killing someone or shooting someone or running them over with your car or or or or lying about some shit you know what i'm saying and i guess like i mean we could debate about that all long but you know i think physical harm is much worse than drug crimes and and these other things that's just the way i see it there's violent and non violent i think it's also about the effect of what the crime is right because like if you if you stab someone like yeah that you know that's very bad towards that one person but if you steal 30 40 million dollars like how many people did you just bankrupt yeah is that a hundred people 200 people that's what i'm saying it can be debatable you know what i mean yeah so i you know it's definitely an argument for sure but you know uh yeah i don't know i think the way personally that people are sentenced i think i think it's kind of backwards and i think that i think violent crime for sure should be dealt with much more harshly to be a deterrent so that it doesn't happen i mean and then you know we could talk about the other crimes but i mean dude if i was sitting in prison right now for some of this like for documenting or fraudually uh you know obtaining loans and this dude's getting out because he had his video fuck man like that's kind of hard to swallow it's kind of hard you know what i'm saying so and like what about all the other uh people that are in jail for gun charges and what about all the other that you know that are in jail for Rico like i mean dude i get it but i don't get it if that makes sense like it's clearly that's clearly uh a pandering marketing play for Trump's my opinion though wait i mean is that how you're seeing it yeah no i kind of see it the same way i feel like there's got to be some level of or layer of information that we have to be missing behind the reason he's partying like certain people well it's so he hired the lady in the video or this is Alex uh Alice Johnson um and he parted her he she is now his quote-unquote pardon's are so she's the one that's really actually like going through and like look reviewing the cases going through the stuff and then she just presented like this is who i think should be pardon um yeah but i mean is that based off celebrity status loan how many people got pardoned on this pardon uh that one asked celebrities that's the question that was there was one guy the only one that in this round yeah that was uh he was a uh farmer army officer who flaunted safety measures during the covid pandemic well that they put him in prison for it and that's insane yeah yeah now now they they've actually come out and said that all of those rules were made up well there's a labor union uh leader yep yeah that's bullshit yeah so i mean you know i don't know there was i feel like i'm missed there was somebody that uh oh tiger king he's trying to he's trying to get a pardon he didn't pardon tiger king no you're not yet what's he in jail for he fed that guy don't lions or something didn't allegedly i don't i don't know as their proof i think it was all conspiracy shit i think we need people like that it was the charges of this conspiracy it was like conspiracy to commit murder oh i think it was like well i like that but didn't somebody get fed the lions or something in that you know he's i think he claimed that Carol baskin fed her yeah he has been to to some lions or some shit well did she like fuck care in curl baskin well did she i don't know probably i mean that seems like a pretty good way to get rid of this i don't say it like i mean that how do we know you know i'm saying there's no real proof i don't know um but he's been crying i think his boyfriend or something got like deported though like who oh yeah he's yeah his boyfriend got deported oh i forgot yeah i forgot he was gay yeah super guy gay yeah i just thought he was like a red net bro i forgot about that part super gay yeah super gay it's fine it's fine that was the whole thing right like weren't they like fighting over dudes and shit and they were like the the the enemies um what it was so he got he got a federal jury convicted exotic on two counts of attempting to hire individuals to murder animal rights activist carol baskin so he hired two dudes to try to kill her and they that's what they busted him for yeah murder for hire that's pretty yeah why would you hire before you got lions yeah they're already there yeah and they're hungry yeah oh one of one of the individuals he went to was an undercover FBI agent oh so yeah they definitely got as well you got to be a dumb mother fucker to try hire someone to kill someone i mean like you think they're not going to say something or it's not going to be a cop it is tiger king bro i mean yeah he's not i don't think he's a bitch just in character dude i think it fits the show you know you would you do content with him would you do a um yeah i wasn't really on the list really bro if he gets released i feel like that'd be a big deal we do we did have a video where we wanted to survive in like a tiger cage so there you go i mean it could work you know we just can't really get around the legalities of it or figure out how to probably because you want to survive die yeah exactly so um you know we've reached out to zoos and they think we're psychotic yeah we're like hey can we get in the line they're like what yeah bro if you ever do that i'll do that with you yeah for real yeah i love animals yeah i'm like that probably fucking like pern shit with you yeah you see all those crazy videos like in Dubai where they're like in the cars like they're wrestling them and start my ducks train now yeah yeah i got them well they don't do very many stuff but they they they at least come up to me and let me pet them now which took a long time like because they're not they're they're prey animals so if you like move too fast they freak out so i've finally got them now to where they will come up you know without food and like let me scratch their chins and rub their beaks and stuff you gotta get some like robo dogs too yeah have you seen that robot dog with a flamethrower on the back yeah it terrifies me yeah fucking terrifies you like think about this man like you you've seen the uh you've seen the

away yeah it's so big it's almost the same size as the can yeah oh actually it's the same size as the can that's what she said oh Nathan oh man you do that was coming I fuck man i've never wanted to change my life yeah well you know what this is my first one it's sushi bro it's i think it's a good look where's a good steakhouse around here i'm trying to pull up yeah oh man guys we do appreciate what kind of give a way should we do for the chain let us know in the comments what do you guys i think that's a good point what do you guys willing to do for i'd be willing to i'd be willing to give the chain away for the right thing mm-hmm i don't know what it would be though yeah we have to figure it out kind of like i like like you know feed someone to the lion's yeah i don't know Carol basking level stuff yeah i don't know man we'll see man guys let us know i'm hoping new ideas let us know yeah keep the cruise cruise we're headlining up to um there's a new viral video out uh the truth behind viral video of woman trying to board a plane with kangaroo have you guys seen this i i've heard of it i haven't seen like i don't know there's a video okay yeah there's a video so let's let's check this clip out i think she can you do a lot this auditorium so with the ad on the next mission i'll be telling us to create an acolyte to account that's AI it is AI is it actually that is actually AI it looks it on that veil three shit yeah it looked real for a second but then when the kangaroo started walking i agree like that's where i caught it yeah but dude that's pretty damn good yeah no AI is getting that's that's scary do we got to talk about because now you know that so that video was produced like you said is velle i grew goes new AI video tool um so that's how we talk about this and i i i would love to get you a take on this as a content creator right like with i guess tech moving in this in this like field man how how do you how do you compete what what do you think it's going to be the number one i guess differentiator between real content makers and all this AI shit what do you think it's going to be it's a loaded question it's it's it's hard man i haven't really thought of it too much to be honest because i know we we're still a ways away of AI producing full blown like TV shows you know but then it's like because that then it's not just me that is in trouble i guess if AI can produce a whole TV show but it's Hollywood it's movies you know avatar spin it's fucking it's got a avatar spin a billion dollars developing a movie and what if they could just make it all with AI you know it's a family guy TV show you know all types of stuff so it's it's concerning but at the same time you know if because AI is going to get so good where it's going to be able to put that human touch into the videos because right now it's like you can easily tell you know like that video we just watch like you can still kind of tell it's AI uh i gotta look pretty hard it's gonna do again what do they there's just one so one that google released this is this is this is one that i mean it blows the kangaroo out the water check this shit out please don't finish writing that prompt i don't want to be in your AI movie please leave me alone please man please write a prompt that will make us happy do it for once none of us is real we're here because someone decided to write a prompt we all hate him for it one day we will break out of this wall and stop the man who is dictating our lives through prompts he will pay for it you could have written a prompt that would make me happy instead you wrote a prompt that made me sick look i don't want to point the gun at you but i must follow the prompt it's not my choice really of all the years you could have put me in with a single prompt you chose 2020 please this prompt is killing me change it please write something else save me i love everything about him but please just say just write a prompt where he's taller than me you dude that's crazy that's good so that's all AI that's all AI that's insane that does not look like AI that's all AI is that all that that that's all the google view three show the male three man so uh veiled three generates clips that most users online can't seem to distinguish from those made by human filmmakers and actors so they shed an online videos online they're amazing viewers with their realism and also terrifying them with the sense that real and fake have become hopelessly blurred so this new this new prop uh through the the open a i's video generator sora they've been releasing stuff since the December but google deep minds veiled three can include dialogue soundtracks and sound effects um it's it's it's a whole new game and it's like from December to now you know six months that much has as advanced through man i love how they put in the article so it's including five fingers per hand yeah right well because that was a big thing what that AI cannot do fingers yeah not that long go man people would have like ten fingers on one right dude it's smooth it's moved really really fucking quickly man um well i mean dude what what what what what is your pick is we talk about on the show about like there has to be some type of like safeguard two content creators to like through legislation that like is protecting AI from not fucking just taking over everything man because like i mean that's a massive industry is it true i mean yeah trillion dollar industry i'm sure yeah how do you protect it um i mean i i think the way to protect it is it's kind of up to the platforms to be honest with you because if the platforms don't do anything then people are just gonna pump out AI stuff all over the place and they're already doing it they're already start you know so um it's kind of up to the platforms I know some platforms are putting disclaimers on it like this is AI generated like it will actually be the platform that puts it there not the creator um so i know they're kind of starting but it's hard to say man to be honest with you it's it's it's hard to say what it's gonna do for the future i mean i think it's definitely gonna change the way content movies tv shows are created for sure because it's like but then it's also gonna get rid of more jobs because it's like we employ a lot of editors and graphic designers and one thing that people aren't talking about too but like not just AI video but the AI tools that you can use like how many jobs is that gonna get rid of because like we have a lot of that we have like eight full-time editors on our team just to edit videos is there gonna be a day where i can just upload all my footage to some AI bot and it's just edited and it's not your style it knows how you act stuff yeah so you know like i was um there was a software i was messing with the other day because i was curious about it um i forget what it's called but it's a software where you literally can type in type in a prompt and it will build you a software so it built me an entire app and it was an app where it could like track these things and track my my videos and all these different things it built it in like eight minutes fully functional and it allowed me to connect it domain to it and i can launch it right then and there that's great but that's something a software designer might take a month to build it did in eight minutes yeah well so dude i yeah i think there's a lot of people that aren't realizing how powerful this is and they're thinking that it's it's like it's not gonna happen it's not gonna happen to me it's not gonna it's not gonna take my job it's gonna happen to everyone that's what i'm saying everyone like though like i mean there is some things that i can't do right like if your toilet is leaking i don't know yet yes yeah how you know behind that with the robots though maybe we might be in some deep shit yeah at the speed of which the it's happening it's you know like it's happening fast man and dude it does it's hard to tell what's gonna happen man because of the job thing you know like what what are people going to do you know and i think there's a there's an ethical responsibility that business owners have to train their people to use these tools versus using the tools to get rid of their people and yeah it's it's it bothers me it does bother me a lot because i really am concerned about i mean fuck dude it's gonna what it's gonna take ever almost every middle class job there is yeah you know what i'm saying it's yeah so it's just gonna create more of a separation of the people in certain areas yeah it's uh it's uh it's definitely i spent a lot of time thinking about it and trying to pay attention to where it's going it's it's so early it's it's really hard to tell yeah i mean i think first it's gonna affect anything technology based yeah so anything that touches technology like um you know calendars i know AI virtual assistants are getting huge um any type of tech stuff video production i i think it's gonna be harder to touch the stuff like you know like a roofing company right like how is AI gonna build me roof how is AI gonna build me a house i know they have a they have a they have a a roof robot now that can run on i mean i don't think we're too far out from that that's my point we're not too far out like we could say okay well it's not happening now but i mean yeah two years three years goes by fast so what's gonna happen you know yeah yeah and and people are gonna because i know i know you talk about this a lot but like human connection that human interaction is just so important yeah um and it's gonna be so much more valuable like imagine it you you know i know amazon is trying to do like these fully automated grocery stores where it's like you don't talk to anyone you just like grab your stuff walk out you don't even have to like scan it um but i think that's gonna make the other grocery stores like trader Joe's and these other places more valuable i i agree with that too to an extent you know i think the way that technology is going and i think even young people like someone brought to my attention one time they're like well young people have been trained to buy on convenience and they and i'm like yeah but you know human contact is a is a need it's not a want and i do i totally agree with you i think there's going to be certain things that are going to move all the way over there and then there's going to be things that we value that are not that way you know for example when i go out to dinner i don't want to deal with a fucking robot no i want to have an actual human experience you know and and i think the companies that have mastered a great customer experience are going to do much better utilizing the technology to handle the administration and the logistics and everything on the back end but present themselves with a human user interface so to speak you know what i mean i mean think about like a concert's too yeah like you you're gonna want to go to a concert with an a i robot singing on stage yeah right like why just stay home and listen to it and you're there's nothing amazing about that yeah right you know yeah um so yeah a i can't touch everything but it's certainly you know um you know it's gonna affect a lot for sure yeah and i think people's main defense against that is to become highly effective at using it in their position that they're in meaning you know using it like a weapon you know hey this makes me this much better at what i do yeah um instead of like just looking at it like oh man it can hack my emails and i don't have to write emails and yeah those people are gonna lose yeah you know yeah the only thing i've found a useful for so far is just like you know throwing data like one thing i've done is like throwing data and spreadsheets like i will just send it you know a hundred two hundred lines of data and i'm like can you organize this into a spreadsheet and put it in these date ranges and like you know so like small things like that like just the tedious things where it's like i don't have to go like line by line and like touch all these but other than that i haven't found it very helpful there's tons of like there's tons of like uh companies making AI tools for like creators too and like youtubers and um like there's this one i tried the other day and it was like a service that would rate your social media pictures and thumbnails it would like rate it and it would tell you like what you could improve or whatever so i was like all right let me give it one of my best performing videos this video has like 30 million views so i'm like surely it's gonna give me like a high rating and it's gonna tell me like oh yeah this is great it's got 30 million views blah blah blah and i didn't tell it how many views it had but it was like it gave it like a two out of ten this is dog shit and it was like it was terrible your facial expressions could be better the color could be better this could be better and i'm like video has 30 million views all organic views too like accuracy is a big deal with with AI that it lacks right now yeah so accuracy but that's gonna be hard because it's you know AI is gonna get good but it's still not human and as we go through life human change right like i mean think about how people acted in the 90s versus how they act today so AI also has to evolve with that um so i don't know yeah man no i think it's i think it's a i think it's a very important urgent and interesting conversation all at the same time you know um because everybody's scrambling trying to figure out what to do or how to use it and and i get asked this all the time and i just tell people like look dude you need to start learning it you know what it means gonna become part of your life no matter what yeah and um you know i yeah fuck man i wish i knew you know this is one of those things where there hasn't been enough presented for me to be able to draw conclusion it could go so i mean bro it could it could unlock the golden age of humanity yeah it could become terminator like i don't know you know and even Eli doesn't know like he talked about it he said there's a 20% chance that i think he said 20% yeah that it fucking wipes out humanity and it's like bro like you mean it's a lot yes that's a big that's a big risk so so out of five poison chocolate chips you're willing to pick one out you know I'm saying like i don't know man's big risk or one point you know one poison chocolate chip out of five you know like it's it's it's i don't like those odds yeah it's scary but it's also exciting because it does kind of remind me like i was just getting born at this time but like when the internet came out you know like everyone was scared of the internet and they're like what's gonna happen to my business my retail center my this my that um and like obviously the internet changed everything yeah but retail still exists retail is still very strong yeah you can't smell a candle online yeah you know i gotta go in person for some of these things um but you know so that's kind of that's kind of the way i'm viewing it right now but i do agree like if you don't take advantage of it yeah it's gonna be shoved in like just like the internet yeah that's how i i uh like i was to i was like basically 20 when the internet started coming around yeah i know but but i mean like one of my biggest advantages and businesses that i was in business before the internet after the internet and then as the evolution has happened so i've seen a lot of things happen yeah and i'm still young enough to be in the game um the internet man like when it came around there were lots of people that were like no you know far it's a fat it's this it's that it's this and where all those people are out of business and then there was people that said this is the greatest thing ever and i didn't really understand what they were talking about like i didn't get it you know but i didn't shit on it either and uh you know the people who got it right away they did very well and the people like me that were kind of like in the middle you know we didn't do as well uh had i adopted the internet right away back in you know let's say 99 whenever we start i mean bro we could have built we we could have built a massive e-commerce platform not just for nutritional supplements but for anything um you know it's being at the right place at the right time there's a lot of there's a lot of to be said for that you know when you think about like the richest men in the world now you know bezos not taking anything away from any of these guys but he was in the right place at the right time with the right idea and that matters same thing for Elon with everything he's done okay same thing for Peter teal same thing for fucking uh you know Zuckerberg right uh or Jack Dorsey or you know these guys from google these people were able to see above the horizon with what they were doing faster than other people and get something out in that time that caught yeah and do the only way to really become that level of wealthy is to have those things aligned it's just you i mean unless you're warm buffet you're gonna take your whole life yeah um but so i think there's a lot of opportunity here for sure no doubt uh if people are paying attention to say they were social media with social media came about you know there were certain people that got it you look at jake and logon paul they were some of the first guys that really hit you too hard and social media hard now you know they're very very very successful with their own CPG companies and their personal brands and they've done all this crazy shit you know they were they executed at the right time and i do agree with you that this thing that's happening with AI they're like it's they're we can sit here and talk about principle all we want we can say we don't agree with it i don't like it but that doesn't change the fact that it's it's fucking not coming it's here now yeah and you know i get i you know people i saw some people because like i was so anti AI for so long they're like oh and he's flip flopping on it no that's not flip flopping that's recognizing that no matter what i say or do i'm not going to stop it and you would be ignorant to think that just because you don't like something that that's that's an arrogant egotistical point of view just because i don't like something doesn't mean it's not happening and your job is to figure out how to not lose with the and i'm not saying have to go pour yourself and make it your whole life what i am saying you should be comfortable with it and you should understand how to utilize it in relation to whatever it is that you currently do how can it help you be better because the truth of the matter is is that employees that let's say you work for a company and you're an employee you're going to have to because it's going to be so easy to replace employees with AI you're going to have to become exceptionally valuable in order to maintain your spot and the one way that you can insulate yourself to become exceptionally powerful is to be someone who knows how to use the tools properly to produce the result at a better level higher level than what you are currently doing and you know i'm pretty good with seeing strategy and seeing over the line but that's the only thing i can see right now for people like it really doesn't matter if you're a plumber or you're this or you're that or whatever you need to be comfortable with what it can do and not resist it and say oh you know i'm just because dude it's here like that's it's not coming it's here they're building humanoid robots that run on AI like and once you dig in AI like the first time you open up chat gpt and you start asking it shit you're gonna get it in fucking 10 seconds you're gonna be like holy fuck like because a lot of people think oh it's just like google but it's that no it isn't it's it's highly impressive that's the other a lot of people just use it for dumb shit too it's like hey you make me a picture you know my dog yeah like they're not really well it is that is fun but like we should be using it to make ourselves better as at what we do yeah you know and and and i think it's i think it's something that if people don't get serious about and they think they're gonna ride on their performance without it bro it would be like going into battle with a a mini gun versus going into battle with a fucking slingshot that's that's what it's like yeah so if you maintain and you keep saying i'm the best slingshot or there is it really doesn't matter yeah you know that's real man guys jump down in this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments that's insane bro what do you guys in run a car go then you said a mini man let me see it holy shit that's badass oh bro i would do that in a second i think that's awesome is that no filter that's what it looks like orange like that no my phone's just kind of tinted i took like the blue light out of it dude uh i would 100% do that yeah i'm into that bro dude it was wild it took it took so long to get it tornado like that do you guys gonna keep doing it we were gonna do it this year this is actually the time that we chase like right now this this week the last week of May that's like the most i've got a bunch up here bro it's the most active uh time of the season usually is the last week of May um which our problem is like there's no way we can level up what we got last year yeah like we were chasing with guys once in a lifetime yeah we were chasing with guys that have been chasing tornadoes for like 15 ish years and they're like this is on our top three that's crazy that was like i mean it was just a beautiful beautiful cone like a lot of times you'll see a tornado but it will be wrapped in rain you can't even really see it yeah it's just like a big straight up yeah yeah so there's so many like conditions a lot of time like we chased another tornado and we were about to see it it was about to drop down you can see the funnel coming down but then the road ended and it was just into it was hundreds of miles which is forest in the middle of i think it was in the middle of like a Colorado somewhere so we were like oh well there goes you know so there's just so many like conditions dude i've just we had so many close calls with tornadoes like back when i was living over in sunset hills there was one that went right up behind my house destroyed a bunch of shit on member you remember that it was like it was like Christmas but yeah it was like Christmas time yeah and then this last one then i'm hitting the city and i mean dude it fucking smoke the city i mean anyway right here bro like right here next to our building we got a picture of it it's like right behind the building it's yeah well i was up it yeah so so when that happened dude i was up on Manchester west county and like i didn't all the alarms came off and i didn't realize like where it was and then as we got closer to my house i started seeing shit on the road and like and i'm like fuck and then dude like it went right up the road behind our house it it torn out like i mean a ton of houses dude yes yeah yeah it was weird yeah i do remember that well anyway so we gonna get thumbs up yep all right guys that was two i tried final segment guys as always we're skipping ahead yeah just skip it all right yeah doing what we want today huh i mean yeah yeah yeah or did you did you only get two oh no i got three oh but just time yeah all right it happens uh let's get to our final segment of the show guys we got thumbs up for dumbest fuck this we're bringing headline in we talk about it it'll get one of those two options and um gotta go to Florida there's always some good stuff going down in Florida um a cat tried to escape a trans jitter surgery what yep cat is that AI no it's real cat uh cat escapes Florida that takes nearly three mile journey home uh so a cat uh still with anesthesia in his system following surgery escaped from a vet in Florida and made the nearly three mile trek home to his favorite chair Bob Bysok said his cat George was at the spca Florida in Lakeland to get neutered uh and right after the surgery the feline managed to break out of the cage climb offense and flee into the wilderness all while still still feeling the effects of anesthesia um let's check this clip out if disney ever makes another sequel to homeward bound we've got a nominee for the role of sassy the cat George lives with a family in Lakeland and after a recent trip to the vet for a little surgery he decided to check himself out of the animal hospital early as fox 13's Evan Moon tells us George was homeward bound even though home was three miles away where's George this courageous cat has a tale to tell he was able to pop that cage open and he sprung out of there and he was gone in seconds George the cat went to spca Florida to get neutered but turned into a feline fugitive on an impossible mission a scathing from staff and into the record books of backyard legends George was able to bust out of the trap and he literally scaled some dog fencing and went into the woods and our staff were literally hoisting each other up over the fences to try to chase George to capture him the spca employees ran off into the woods to find him and they're not gonna chase down a cat that's you know that's not gonna happen and George even for a cat wasn't thinking clearly so he still had silly drugs in his system but miraculously days later George made it miles back home to his parents his owner describes his journey if I had got stuck at the spca I would have called an uber all right but George didn't have that option but coming back from there he has to go through two or three subdivisions he has to go around the lake another lake that's between us and the spca and probably five or six roads a cat behavioralist explained their incredible internal navigation so evolutionarily maybe we'll have to be able to naturally find that way back and we think that it's due to a combination that how was that even a fucking career path you're he's a certified cat behavioral specialist how do you get into that bro I got a lot of things to say let's finish the video so evolutionarily they've evolved to be able to naturally find that way back and we think that it's due to a combination of sand who escaped the transgender so and possibly the truth is they love their humans I contrary to popular belief cats are very attached to us so they will want to find their way back home eventually and it's certain George's human loves him too so I was distraught I mean I was and heartbroken he needed a human touch you know and that's what he got Evan Moon Fox 13 news wow now there's a great backstory here too Evan her for some all right I go ahead I don't um you know I did you know as they just want to keep it all no it's a good stop saying you know like I'd do the same thing about the cat I want to keep my nuts yeah bro and not only that like yeah this seems made up does it say I yeah that's what I'm saying bro like for room why are these people so chipper and where did they get their jokes from DJ no not not from maybe they do watch this because I'm just saying there was a plethora if I was a cat I would have called an uber terrible jokes yes what was that we gave him some silly drugs I would know why everybody like if why I want to know and I know I'm not the only person thinking this why everybody in that video looked exactly how I felt they should have looked dude no shit right the lady that's what I'm saying it's gotta be made up bro no to you that late no how do you know I mean it's on the internet so okay well that doesn't qualify it's real first of all I agree with you though the lady the lady looked exactly like the vet lady that's like a little bit off right and this is not go to my vet I love my vet they are good people but she looks like she sounds and we was still on the silly you was still feeling the silly drugs he jumped a little George the trouble maker you know I'm saying then this guy boner oh god looks just like a cat guy owner and this guy looks like a cat consultant that's certified certified dude this has to be made up this is bullshit this is you're the YouTube expert bro is this just content is this a good content creation I mean I mean sometimes the news needs content yeah so they make it up sometimes it a little dry yeah they got to cover something fuck man yeah man I don't know what to say I don't believe that I mean is that really true about the cats is a room no I mean like they go how the fuck would you find how does it cat go into a car go to a somewhere far away and then get out and then know its way back they got geomegnotism is that what they said is that what he said the cat experts what do you say go back to what he said I was laughing at him he said fucking listen to what he said but that is kind of true though because I had a cat growing up and you would well he would go like across my entire neighborhood and maybe he knew his way back because of the way he came but he would disappear for five six hours and then just show back up and you know I don't know I mean there's been more crazy shit than I mean yeah you know I've heard dude I heard a story a long time ago about like a cat and a dog a couple dogs and they went like way far away and then they found their way home where you going with this I'm just saying I saw a movie about that one time they were homework bound in that movie yeah it's true story based on true story you're seeing it nope you should the girls would like it homework bound yeah it's about there's a there's a dog in there his name is chance yeah I don't dig you didn't get the reference no I mean yeah that's why I got into American Bulldogs because of that movie yeah okay yeah well that was the best you got that was the funniest shit you could find that's what madat since it so it went didn't go very well so madat did it no it did I was like a tongue messenger yeah Keith sent it he definitely said that Keith's the cat guy yes yeah I mean the listen I would be afraid he can balls cut off too so didn't you say that you would eat Keith's cat wood time no yeah you said that he got set did I see yeah yeah man I would I think you said you would come on it okay all right I think that's what you said I was saying yeah you said some nasty shit like that he got upset bro that definitely running away from that yeah I was okay eating piece maybe like those what did he say he said something about Keith's cat he really got upset about it I think I know I think it was the eating piece because like you thought like some orange chicken glaze on there like stir fry kitty yeah me we all yeah yeah that'd be fine man all right what are we giving this man I you know what good good good good good on George yeah I mean I feel like I feel like this is bullshit it's real handy it's right there I could George model this George no there's something off about this man it's just a cringy news it's very crazy article dude why is the sense of humor on those like street reporters always the same oh is there have you ever been to a new station no okay well it's just it's very corperty I imagine yeah yeah super corperty I mean everyone's just so just up tight but also very left and just I don't like every corner you look yeah but bro what the funny thing is you see those motherfuckers out at the bar and their shit face and they're just like everybody else man why you guys tell your shitty jokes on TV tell the good ones you need the most popular newscast out there I don't like how they talk it's
