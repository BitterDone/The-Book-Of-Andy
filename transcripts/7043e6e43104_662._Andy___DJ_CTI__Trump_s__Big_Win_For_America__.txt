What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and the series to show for the real estate goodbye to the lies, the fitness and delusions of modern society and welcome. Motherfucking reality guys today we have Andy and DJ crews the mother fucking internet as we're gonna do that's what CTI stands for stands for crews the internet put up topics on the screen right over here. Talk about what's going on in the world we speculate on what the truth is and what we think is not so true or completely made up and then we talk about how we the people have to be the solution to the problems going on in the world. Now other times you tune in there's your first time listening we have shows within the show we're gonna have Q and A F that's where you can ask questions and we give you the answers Q and A F the questions can be about anything but typically they're about business entrepreneurship personal development how to win how to get better. In business and life so you can ask your questions a couple different ways the first way is guys you can email your questions into ask Andy at Andy for Stella dot com or you go on YouTube on the Q and A F episodes which is. Right up there on thumbnail it's Q and A F CTI real talk whatever it is you drop your question in the comments section will pick some from there as well other times we're going to have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes of exactly what it sounds like real talk. Just something I think you need to hear and then we have 75 hard versus that's where someone who's completed the 75 hard program comes in talks about how their life was before how their life is now and how they use the 75 hard program to improve their existence. 75 hard is the initial phase of live hard program it's available for free an episode 208 on the audio feed that episode is not on YouTube because we just started YouTube not too long ago so. Pretty new to this still. If you like there's a book available it's called the book on mental toughness which talks the entire live hard program through every single nut and bolt detail and also has 10 plus chapters on mental toughness why it's important how you can use it and what it's going to mean to your existence for the rest of your life if you don't have it. There's also a bunch of case studies in the book now the book is not required but for people who want to know the ins and outs it's probably the best option for you. So we're going to put it on the website Andy for so calm and then sometimes we have full length like we have this past Saturday with James Lawrence the I'm a cowboy we got a new concept for full length we're breaking out here this year that you guys are going to really like that's why I haven't mentioned on the intro but anyway.

So don't be a hell try the show alright hey what's up how's it going good you know how was the weekend it's good yeah what else we got going on this is a few days old but I thought this was interesting I know I saw a few people posting this online I don't know how much you were into the news over the weekend do you see this headline oh yeah it's official we can pretty much treat COVID like the flu now here's a guide. You see this shit yeah I did yeah you know after they intentionally destroyed the world and divided everybody from their family and friends and cause people to have to watch their loved ones die on a on zoom put people on remdesivir and ventilators and fucking killed them. You know denied effective therapeutics and called anybody who said that I've remectin or hydroxylorcan were effective at all they banned those people they actually put some of those doctors in jail they dis they remove their medical licenses let's see what else they did oh they closed your business and they told you that you weren't essential and while your business was closed they let all their buddies businesses stay open the biggest businesses in the world that aren't hurting for money. They let those places take up all the sales and move all the customers over to their businesses and you went out of business and then what they do they closed all the restaurants they kept your kids out of school for a year and a half two years depending on where you lived they called you a big it they called you a grandma killer they try to get you fired from your job then they tried to force you with a experimental medication and told you if you didn't do it you were going to lose your career and you know they threatened companies with five six seven hundred thousand dollar fines per employee to force them to get this medication we go on and on and on you know they printed trillions of dollars to subsidize the closing of businesses which ended up inflating your dollar and making you far less wealthy and more poor what else did they do what else did they do fucking lied to yeah they lied the entire time they knew this the entire time and the flu remember what happened to the flu during this time do you not remember us doing show after show after show go back because we got receipts all right nobody was out here fucking saying hey this was bullshit more than us that's real shit we had experts on we had doctors on we had fucking everybody on talking about what and you know there's something important when I saw this I you know I think what people what what I've seen a lot of people miss dude let's take a hold on hold on what about the the footage they should go see they knew this the entire time that's why the flu day to disappear off the radar report it okay it went zero and then they're digging graves in parks in New York City they're they're refrigerator trailers for corpses exactly they're showing videos of people fall over in the streets and I've seen a lot of people coming well in the beginning the covid was much stronger than it is now no fucking wasn't bro just a strong the medical protocols were killing people and the they needed to extend the emergency state so they fucking canceled and removed and fine and fired and and you know put people in jail legitimately the frontline doctors of America do we not remember these people standing on the front steps of the capital and saying hey there are treatments for this and they're not letting us talk about it and then they put the main woman in jail for 60 days do you got they knew all this this was all a play it was all propaganda and they got what they wanted they got the division they got the economy shifted they made you poor they told you to tell you do you don't remember Fauci saying to not let your family come over for fucking holidays tell on your neighbors that do tell on your neighbors that dude we had people saying where a mask is screaming in your faces we had fist fights in the grocery store this is everything that they plan they did because we are fucking stupid as a whole and a collective that's the truth bro it's real shit and I see this headline and I think what people are a film to realize what this is is that this is going to set up no we've we've talked about this a few times right like you know they're red button you know flip the the game board over plans right and the possibility and we've seen the them talk about this possibility of another new you know disease or problem or infection or virus whatever you want to call it what this is doing is setting up that comparison for them to use yeah right when that shit comes out you guys remember Kobe oh this is a hundred times worse yeah it's setting up the comparison for them to sit to use it you know and I think a lot of people are like a lot of people are missing that covid denier grandma killer your covid denier and now you know it's pretty much just like the flu yeah you mean it is the flu it is the flu yeah you mean you mean when we were doing let's talk about how they cycled up the PCR test to we had Dr. Syrasky on here explaining the PCR test okay we we fucking had been tapper on here talking about this exact same thing they fucking scammed all of us and half of you fell for it and you fucking villainized everybody that was trying to save you and we paid people like me were trying to keep you from getting taken by this bullshit and you you decided to attack us you still hang on to it you still attack us you still come at us you can't stop and realize bro I was the target of this and I fell for it and those people tried to help me from to see it and I didn't see it and you know what I should be mad at the people who propagated the play not the people who tried to keep me from falling for it that's what's going on here and then on top of it they threw in George Floyd just for extra division right right can you protest the mass but you can you know you can protest anything yeah you can go out with millions of people in the streets but you know or you know what you can go to a restaurant dude and you know as long as you're sitting down at the bar the covid doesn't get you so you can take a mask off right you check out in the grocery store as long as you got that screen there yeah do think of all the businesses they made put up all this crazy shit bro think here in the in St. Louis that fucking sand page turned who tried to ruin all of our economy here in St. Louis because he wanted to flex his fucking city council or county executive title man fuck you all these people belong in jail all the people who orchestrated this belong in jail they belong in fucking jail or worse at a minimum in jail they stole fucking trillions of dollars from the American fucking workforce and made us pay like that's all there's still paying for you want to know why you can't fucking pay your bills right now why your shit is tight because these people stole the fucking economy from you and it's also that nobody can fucking have any pal like bro look how they tax us they tax us with all this shit but yet they print as much money as they need so they take half a year money and then they print whatever else they need devaluing the rest of the money that you have you see that right but most people don't understand how that works so they're not up in arms about it if most people understood that these people are taxing us and and by the way we're all taxed when we add it all up equal or more than half of our income when we consider sales tax the cost of ownership property tax fucking tax when you buy shit tax when you sell shit income tax most people only think about income tax but when you added all together you're paying over 50% which means you're a slave to the government okay and then the money you're left with they are printing trillions of dollars on the backside which means the money you get to keep isn't worth as much and most people don't understand this basic reality of economics and because they don't they're okay with it you know on top of you know putting in executive orders to make the cost of goods go up on top of you know like everything's everything's literally do you remember whenever they do you remember when they kept all the ships from docking for three months COVID to draw to drive supply chain issues to fuck the economy bro these people are criminals they are criminals yeah this is like I mean listen I don't know I'll you know pre-loop the show with this you know we got plenty of wins in this episode to cover and talk about right but it's always important guys because we so easily forget about all that shit that happened I don't forget you know but like you know that's why I like to bring it up because we can't fucking forget listen we forget it's this crimes against humanity it's the it's the biggest crime against humanity that's ever been perpetrated ever and people still aren't aware that it is that they don't get it oh man that's how I just do these people have to be held accountable and for those people to be held accountable we have to have unity and we have to quit falling for the fake division tactics they put in the society the black white left right gay straight bullshit it's not about that they want you to think it's about that because they don't want us all coming together and noticing that it ain't about that and then figuring out what it's really about which is us versus them that's what they don't want to see they want us to think it's your neighbor or it's the guy down the street that voted Democrat or it's the the guy that wears the red mega hat or it's the black guy or the white guy or whoever the gay guy down the street they want you to think it's all that shit and they hope that we don't notice that it's actually them causing the problems that we have in society we're never getting that time back that's what people don't understand they took three years of our lives and made them legit hell we are not getting that back do you know how to get three years of your life back no I don't either bro and these people for their own greed their own power thirst and their own corruption ruined millions of lives because they wanted to make some money and have some control and make sure that they stayed in power these people are criminals bro and I'm talking about the people who orchestrated it I'm not talking about the the guy the people who yelled at us I'm not talking about the average person who fell for it these people are victims bro the people who are walking people who are walking around with the vaccine and their body scared shitless okay and it doesn't matter how mean they were three years ago these people are fucking like holy shit and these those people are still not able to recognize that they were the target of the propaganda and they fell for it until that happens there will be no accountability for this because you're neighbor down the street that resisted all this shit guys like me guys like you we're not your enemy bro we were trying to keep you from doing some dumb shit and fucking up your life and you wouldn't listen you called us domestic terrorists you called the police on us you caused all kinds of shit for us you canceled us you tried to fire us you tried to get us you know in trouble every way that we could bro and now you're the one that got played okay so recognize that those people you were trying to help you treated like shit you treated them like shit because the media told you to and now and you guys are the same people that say shit like well you know if the Holocaust happened when I was around I would have done something no you fucking wouldn't you would have been the mother fuckers putting them on the cars we're complied so live with that knowing that shit bro that's real shit that's enough that's enough to live with there yeah you guys got frenzied up you thought you were morally virtuous and you got your own ego and play and you and now hey you were wrong we got to have some forgiveness amongst the citizens and an actual recognition of who actually did this you not remembered that little fuck Fauci on TV every single day where's he been yeah he's in hiding I guarantee it bro people lost everything dude I'm surprised that guy is still fucking breathing real talk now let's listen bro if you lost everything you lost your family you lost your business you there's so many people that lost everything it's like dude I'm actually surprised that some of these people are still walking around you know what I mean no one that we what we know now that they made it all up dude the fucking orchestrated it in the government the world economic form key individuals in our politics the entire fucking media that's fucked up bro fuck all these people they all belong in jail dude yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us one down in the comments what you guys think uh without being said man let's get into our cruise I remember guys if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them links there with that being said let's go to headline number one hello more reads trump declares big win for america as Supreme Court orders express back on Colorado primary ballot ahead of super Tuesday it's a big big massive win big win uh in a lot of different ways let's dive into this uh the US Supreme Court ordered former president Donald Trump back on the 2024 primary ballot in Colorado on Monday the day before the sentennial state and 14 other other states picked the Republican nominees for president the unanimous ruling 9 to 0 also overturns disqualification orders handed down by officials and judges in Maine and Illinois in recent weeks which we just covered I believe the other day Illinois a judge in Illinois tried to throw them off the ballot or did actually so this reverses all of that uh the unsigned order found that only congress not individuals states can disqualify candidates for federal office under section three of the 14th amendment known colloquially as the insurrection clause or the disqualification clause quote the judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court cannot stand in quote the order red quote all nine members of the court agree with that result uh trump uh posted this on truth social uh very recently just says big win for america um let's dive into what CNN has to say about it uh this is their headline says takeaway uh takeaways from Trump's big win at the Supreme Court in the 14th amendment case uh the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that former president Donald Trump could not be removed from the ballot in Colorado or any state any other state a sweeping and historic ruling uh that brushed aside a lawsuit claim that he disqualified himself from office because of his actions on January 6th 2021 which they deleted off uh from the internet of what his actions actually work um the repudiation of the notion that Trump's actions left him and eligible under the 14th amendments in insurrection ban uh a unanimous court ruled uh that an individual state could not dump the former president from the ballot uh but the justices did not say if Trump was in fact an insurrectionist and split on technicalities of how the ban could be enforced a distinction with potentially broad consequences so they're over their crime bottom line guy uh Trump's gonna be on the ballots so they cannot kick him off the ballots uh it's not gonna work um now that leads me to this question we know we know they don't want them to run if they can't kick him off the ballots legally what do they do then well i think they're gonna do something else i already i sent you a clip earlier i don't know if you saw it i don't think so where they're already talking about how they're gonna create legislation that tries to work around the Supreme Court yeah i saw that one now if the Supreme Court the highest court in the country rules that he deserves on the ballot unanimously unanimous like it wasn't like that means uh Kenji Jackson is so do my or yeah says uh yes this needs to happen and the rest of these people continue to try to work them off the ballot or disqualify him who is the actual insurrectionist here just because they're doing it in the quote-unquote system doesn't mean that they're not the insurrectionist you see what i'm saying these people are way out of control bro and honestly in my opinion again we'll just keep this thing going they belong in fucking jail because they're trying to deny the American people what certain American people want all right a lot of America yeah a lot of America yeah that's why they're doing it so these people have such a grandiose sense of their own importance that they believe that it's okay for them to deny the rest of the American population the right to vote for who they want to vote for and if you think about that that is them saying the peasants don't know we know better than them so that's what we're dealing with here and dude these people are fucking insane and i suspect that they are going to move on to plan b and c and d because they have them and they're going to be totally disruptive to the rest of our year i think we're going to see mass chaos i think we're going to see mass disruption i think they're going to do whatever they can it doesn't matter what it is what it takes because they understand that if they lose their position of power that they are going to be dealt with and held accountable regardless of how much trump says you know the best win is success or the best revenge is success this motherfucker's going to go in there and clean it up and these motherfuckers are going to go to jail and they're fucking terrified of it yeah yeah so what what what will they do man that that's the that's the question what's going to be next could you imagine playing a game where the rules have been created already and because the other dudes beating your ass you decide that i'm going to create new rules to them like it's it's that's what all these people do that's a sur that's all they do it's absurd what what do you mean that's all they do bro they they create rules like no longer do we hire the best person regardless of the race or where they come from with the best skill set we have to make new rules so that women can get in there and people of other you know uh races can get in there and we got to even the playing field even if it means that the quality of whatever work is being done goes doesn't matter if they're airline pilots even if they're airline pilots we got to get some we got to make sure it's diverse doesn't matter if they know how to fly the fucking plane you see the tail is wagging the dog because the dog won't stand up and say hey shut the fuck up you bunch of idiots we're going to have a civilized society fuck you we are being bossed around by a very loud very weak very delusional minority of people who believe they have the power and the more that people stand up and use their voice and stand up to these people the more you will check them back into the role of a relevance which is where they belong did you see that guy try to step to Joe mansion the other day oh yeah he got his ass yes and the fucking bodyguard grabbed his ass and threw him on the ground like a little fucking empty soda can beautiful okay yeah that's what you do with these people fuck them they they they listen these people have never been fucking dealt with they've never been checked they they run around they stick their phone in your face and they say some shit well you don't have cancel culture anymore on your side canceling doesn't work anymore so stick your fucking phone in anybody's face you want it's not going to matter nobody cares that that guy got his ass fucking handed to him and it was on camera so you guys who run around sticking your fucking camera in everybody's face thinking it's going to make you immune from people reacting you're you're going to learn the hard way nobody cares anymore nobody cares especially I'm dude I'm tired of the bullying especially if you're void of protein these people the long round of the post sheet I'm just saying they're going to learn the lessons these people have been running around unchecked for years a little lighten that you don't think they're they're they're going to go yeah she don't think these people are going to go up to some dude in the grocery store because now they're empowered and they're going to get their fucking teeth knocked out like bro we're getting back to where America should be did you see the video we I don't know we did it on the show but where those guys beat that guy's ass for stealing all that shit from Home Depot did you see that video bro it was great they're pushing they're pushing a fucking this guy's trying to walk out of Home Depot and this dude gets out his phone and he's like hey piece of shit you're not stealing that shit starts yelling at him and then like you can hear the guy getting like mad because the guy's not stopping and then the guy goes over and fucking like grabs him and the guy's like don't don't touch me he's like I fucking touch you whatever I want and fucking flips his card up dude and then there were five other dudes came over beat this dude's ass yeah that's what needs to start happening comes up that's called being an American man that's called that's called holding the line in your community that's what we're missing we have to stop allowing these weak people to wag the dog because they scream and yell and throw fits we got to paint the line again man if you don't feel like the line if you like the line got eroded and washed off redraw it well line it back up you know I'm saying and hold it and hold it and go step on it bro then you get your fucking there's gonna be repercussions yeah I love to see these guys taking like doing the right thing well you know what's gonna happen is those little those little uh little squeaky wheels man they're gonna start seeing more of those videos and they're they should start shutting the fuck up they're gonna stop doing it that's how that's what happens that's how it works because they know they have those protein deficiencies bro they're listen they're afraid that they're gonna call the pull listen they use the fear of the internet and and and being arrested against people they run up they try but but it's funny because they'll yell you know a cab you know all cops are bad fuck the police to fund the police then they'll call for the cops and they're calling the police yeah just like because those cops are coming to help you that shit's done listen and I think these people I think their day and the sun is coming to an end and they don't what you they don't recognize yet which creates prime opportunity to like you know deer and headlights yeah they're gonna fucking learn bro yeah that's exactly what people are sick of your guys is shit yeah like you guys run around and you poke you put your phone in people's faces you try to pull noodles and trash people don't give a shit dude they're over it people people have lost money they've become their their lives have become less stable they're more agitated they're more stressed and these people still think they can run around on social issues and shove it down people's fucking faces you know what's done dude nobody gives a fuck about your environmental environmental issues when they can't fucking eat dumbass yeah but yeah so real quick speaking on ballots that's the little thing to cover round of applause from Nikki Haley oh yeah she won her first uh her first primary wow I'm really shocked that DC that she won Washington DC where everybody thinks Trump is like the anti-Christ exactly right he is the anti-Christ to them yeah he is because he's the guy it's gonna hold the power of reckoning for them if he does what he's supposed to if he does what he's what they're afraid of that's the that's the now whether he does it or not that's two different things because he should have done in his first fucking term yeah it's facts but yeah so she won she won the first primary on Sunday she won DC she had a 63% win yep it's a 33% broken down it's nearly 1300 voters cast a ballot for Haley and nearly 684 former president Trump what does I say about Haley when you win when you win the only place where they hate Donald Trump the most what's that say what's that say about her mm-hmm she's a Democrat she's a Democrat yeah yeah but uh my her talent she says I quote I've always uh I've always set this needs to be competitive as long as we are competitive as long as we are showing up there as a place for us I'm going to continue to fight there's always that's always been the case I'm good old Haley yeah I just thought that she knows something's gonna happen she knows mass chaos is gonna listen after this year when both that's a part listen does it with the supreme like brother with the supreme court ruling that today she should have been dropping out immediately fuck well they can't ruin the battle if if if she really cared about the country if she was really on our side the supreme court just solidify this ruling you should have been dropping out then well fuck they can't kick him out the ballot nowhere I'm I clearly don't have a fucking chance the only reason she's staying in bro is because she knows something yeah see what I agree with that she knows some shit's gonna happen they're assuring her she's gonna have her chance and show me the details why those guys are still right in checks for her they're not right nobody spends millions of dollars for no reason no bro and there are democrat donors spending millions of dollars to keep Haley going for a reason and the reason is they are in on the plan and you and I and everybody else are not in just in just four states and DC she spent 76 million dollars and that came from people that didn't come from that's not taxpayer money that came from actual human beings that gave her money to do it mm-hmm he'll know them rata what the fuck her name is yeah guys jump in on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think are that being said let's head over to Andy I got I got three good ones here oh really I just couldn't pick one okay all right so the first one comes from at Michael Todd in J he says what the fuck is Provel cheese oh it's apparently it's the best shit out there yeah it's you gotta come here yeah um you gotta I mean like they now have this other places no I don't they don't it's the same lowest thing yeah okay yeah it's really good yeah

shame they want to get better make more money kick ass become aware of the dumbass yeah yeah I bet I bet you're highly disappointed in them you know here's the thing about people like Jeanette she will be disappointed in them even if they win because her sons didn't do it her way yeah bro that's what these people think like that's so fucked up yeah well that's what that's the same people who scream and yell at you in the grocery store and think they're right even though they've been proven to be wrong they dig their heels in the sand they say you know they discount every single piece of data like it's bullshit bro all the shit was always there how do you think people like me and other people were able to say this is what it was the data was available the entire time the death rate was available the entire time the way they were presenting it was available the entire time that's from covid that's with covid the what they did with the test all of the shit was available people just didn't want to look at it the survival rate no it was available to be no they needed to have their emergency and they needed to show how great they were and they needed something to base their identity in which was I am more virtuous than you because I use all the precautions and you are a very selfish grammar killer and I'm better than you because and these people live for that shit so Jeanette we're both so listen to my mind listen Jeanette is exactly the kind of parent that her sons go out and become something and she'll dog them out their entire lives because they didn't become what she wanted to become it's fucking sad yeah yeah well guys we appreciate your comment yeah appreciate the support that we said jump right back into it we got headline number two uh another w yeah coming out of the good state of Texas uh this headline reads federal appeals court to allow controversial Texas immigration law to take effect if scotus doesn't intervene so we covered this I would say like a week ago two weeks ago or so um when the law was put in place in Texas to allow the local law enforcement officials to arrest and deport um on themselves right well a Texas court ruled that no you can't do that it's federal immigration well uh the Texas uh federal appeals court they just reversed it and said no they can and so that's in play this is a CNN uh headline uh CNN article reading a federal appeals court granted a temporary stay of a lower court's decision to block the enforcement of a controversial Texas immigration law paving the way for it to go into effect this week if the Supreme Court doesn't intervene last week a federal judge in Austin Texas blocked the state uh government from implementing senate bill four which would allow uh state law enforcement authorities to arrest and detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally uh judge David Allen Ezra wrote in his Thursday decision uh to halt the law that quote if allowed to proceed uh senate bill four could open the door to each state passing its own version of immigration laws uh Texas appealed the ruling which republican government Greg Abbott saying quote we will not back down in our fight to protect our state and our nation from president Biden's border crisis um over the weekend the fifth US circuit court of appeals granted a stay of Ezra's decision um but put its ruling on hold for seven days allowing time for the Biden administration to go to the Supreme Court um so the law remains blocked only until March 9th unless the Supreme Court keeps it on hold it was originally set to go into effect March 5th which is tomorrow um any anything on that? I mean look man I still say the same thing I said before why did it take Greg up Greg Abbott three years to do anything why did take people you know like I don't see this as a win I see this as common sense man like the win is going to be if all these people are removed and put back where they came from that's going to be the win all right I'll be real like I'm fucking tired of all these people like I am tired of them ruining our environment our country our society because they want to maintain their power structure and their connections and their ability to earn income and their ability to rule over the people of this country that is not what this country was founded upon this country was not founded upon the idea of a certain class of people ruling other people it was founded upon the idea of for the people of the people by the people and it's not that at all we don't live in anything that represents what this country supposed to be we live under constant focus of propaganda from our media we live under constant division constant anxiety constant stress intentional financial oppression to keep people from becoming too financially aware or financially capable to not have to fucking listen to these people they want you poor they want you fat they want you stupid they want you believing everything they say they want you to hate everybody that's out here in the real world and they never want you to blame them and our duty is to be the opposite of everything that they want we need to not be poor we need to not be fat we need to not be stupid we need to get along with the people out here and work together to solve the problem which is a bunch of tyrants who are ruining our actual life experience yeah okay to take four more years that's four more years we're not getting back we've are like you understand this not like you know I'll be a tilt 2019 it was okay like even though it was corrupt we didn't have it shove down our throats and shove down our face and brought to the forefront of our lives in every single capacity and now that's what's happened and we have this issue that we are literally being invaded across our border by people who should not be here they are illegal they are illegal people they should not be here they should be rounded up they should be collected they should be sent back to where they came from or dropped right back over the border in Mexico and their wall should be secure they could have finished the border wall for five billion dollars and now we've sent damn near 200 billion dollars to Ukraine over a border dispute I'm sick of it dude I'm sick of everybody thinking that these politicians on either side give a fuck about us very few of them are actual patriots in fact I don't I don't know if I can even name one these people exist to take from us they take from you they make our lives harder intentionally so that they can have a purpose in life and that's bullshit that is now what this country's founded upon and we need a complete American revival of what it means to be the United States of America and that is not coming from our current political class at all in fact they're the opposite they're doing everything that they have to do to make our lives hard to make our lives frustrating to keep us stressed and anxious and angry at everybody while they continue to reach into our pockets and take every fucking thing that we have these people are criminals dude and that's real shit that these are the people these are the people that are for our founding fathers wrote the constitution about these are the people that they warned us about these are them right now and we're dealing with them and half the people don't fuck three quarters of people don't want to address it that's real people don't want to fucking do anything they don't even want to take responsibility for their own lives they don't want to step up they don't want to be better they don't want to get involved they want someone to write in on a fucking white horse and fix all the problems when in reality the only way that this can be fixed is by the individual citizens rising to the occasion to speak and stand for the things that they believe are right and then to get engaged in their community to fix those problems and then on top of that to actually be the best version of yourself because America has a culture problem and the culture problem is that we don't have any examples of people that look and feel and talk and live like Americans are supposed to live and because of that we have very little progress in the country so we have all these people who are complaining about all this shit but they're unwilling to even take responsibility for their own existence and become the best version of themselves or speak the truth or stand on anything or get involved in their community and they wonder why it's not getting better it's extremely frustrating that's real shit man it's not going to get better until every individual in this country that wants it to get better takes serious we have to move away from this idea that we can vote ourselves into a better situation politics is downstream of culture culture determines politics not politics determines culture all right how they want it to be that that's how they have it right now yeah that's how they have it right now that's how the fuck they want it to be I don't know dude I'll be real with you you know I know a lot of people are doing their part and most of the people listen to this show doing their part but you know we still have people that are afraid to share the show bro they listen to the show religiously but they won't share it because they're afraid that there's somebody in their life is gonna fucking disapprove of it and they wonder why there's no so you don't even have the courage to have an opinion if you don't have the courage to have an opinion what makes you think you have fucking you're anything's gonna ever get better for you bro this is in people's careers like people will sit in their careers for three four or five years with the inability to have a conversation about what's bothering them or things they don't like or or things that they want to improve with their job and they'll just harbor these thoughts for years and years and years not realizing that unless you have the ability to actually have difficult conversations you lack the ability to progress okay so like we do we have an epidemic of weakness in this country that's really what it comes down to and we just accept it yeah and dude nobody's coming nobody's coming to save you I want the people of this country to wake the fuck up and start taking responsibility for their little piece in their area but they're still waiting for someone to start a movement or start a revolution you are the fucking revolution man you're just not doing your part the revolution is cultural it's not like what you think you're gonna ride into wash and DC and fucking do something with all these people right and what are we gonna have tomorrow we're gonna have a bunch of people who don't want to work hard who don't want to be healthy who don't want to be informed who want to scroll all day on the internet who want to fucking you know what I'm saying yeah like it's not gonna fix anything right back to the culture has to be fixed first yeah you know you got you guys you're okay with 10 million plus people on the low end to 20 something million people on the high end coming across the border and now we have exactly like dude you know how old it gets for me to come in here it's hey guys this is what's gonna happen then we just don't step in at home and then see everybody stepping in it like like did do we not have clips on this show from years ago talking about how migrants come to these areas and harass the women and rape the women and kill the women and then like this girl gets killed and everybody's like oh I can't believe it what the fuck do you mean you can't believe it these people don't have the same ethics or code that we have here they come from third world places where if they don't get what they want they just take it if they don't get what they want they just kill you with zero repercussion yeah and and now you're in a situation where you have these people in our country and you have literal psychopaths running the country who at any given time might shut down the grid and you're gonna have to compete with these people to survive and I'm gonna tell you right now most of you won't they will beat you they come from the hardest environments in the world you come from fucking fluffy couches in the view and fucking bond bonds and video games and Netflix and fucking door dash and you think that you're these people would just come take your shit and that's what's gonna happen bro oh my god I feel so bad for these people what do you mean we go back for what do you what do you mean they're not supposed to be here man you'll feel bad dude to have a functioning society we have to have standards and rules and lines in the sand that cannot be crossed I'm sorry for you bleeding heart people I yeah nobody likes to see what's happening but the reality is is do you want them to take your shit do you want them to take your neighborhood your community do you want them killing your fucking fellow citizen because you feel bad they should go back where they came from yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let's know what you guys think oh that is here it man I would think that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three I had a number three reads speaker Johnson changes mind on blurring J6 faces did you see this no yeah so so this was a big deal so when they were releasing some footage right there was you know quite a bit of faces of people in the crowd not the entire crowd themselves but just a few faces that were blared out why why well he's flipping that now so speaker Johnson announced today that he has released five thousand more hours of capital security footage after finally abandoning his efforts to blur out all the faces of the insurrectionists Johnson pledged to release quote all the footage when it became speaker however he's only released a tiny fraction of it before today he explained months ago that the delay was caused by the fact that he had hired a tech team at great expense to the taxpayers to come over the footage to blur out all the faces of the people who were there I said it was doing that to prevent them from being identified by quote internet sleuths and getting prosecuted now he's apparently realized that it's simply not practical it's going to release the remaining footage without faces being blurred the most incompetent speaker in history this is quite a role right now this is obviously a left leaning article whatever here's the here's the release I'm so sick of the media being written that way it's so it's so like I'm so exhausted by these leftists like having to throw their jabs in and like dude you know what I'm even more tired of than that the people who actually believe it yeah yeah well I mean here's the issue with this right so like the thing was like you can't you couldn't find any news articles reporting this this was literally the only one that was reporting it that had anything to say about it and yeah nobody else was talking about it but I think it is significant because again like who are those faces and why were they blurred and why are they no longer being blurred but are we not worried about them more there's still so many questions about the whole thing that you know yes there's been some light this shed on it right but there's still a lot happening there so in this official statement um speak of Johnson sick what house Republicans again command subcommittee chairman lot of milk and the entire committee on house administration for their ongoing commitment to ensuring that there is full transparency surrounding the events of January 6th this ongoing work is especially necessary considering the deeply flawed prior investigation conducted by the partisan January 6th select committee which instead of delivering transparency that's contributed to defendants public interest groups and the media having to rely upon the interpretation of a small group of government officials additionally upon extensive further consultation with the committee in my direction the committee will no longer plan to blur the faces of individuals and the footage giving the significant logistic hurdles involved in the importance of getting this work completed as responsibly and efficiently as possible another w anything on this all the footage should have been out this entire time and it should be unedited unblurred so that we can see what's actually happened yeah and the reason they don't you guys tell me why wouldn't they release all the footage why do they what do they not want you to see why what are you not allowed to see as a tax paying citizen of this country what are you not allowed to see and why and why are they allowed to decide what you're allowed to see when this is what happened and then they're using it to prosecute people they're using it to scare people they're using it to keep people from protesting or gathering or coming together that's what this is all about it's a big fear mongering campaign that says if you rise up we'll do this to you that's what they're doing yeah I mean if it was if it was so real and so you know damaging as they say it was why not release it all you yeah so that we could see how bad it was like show me everything yeah like if it was as bad as you say it is to where you're having on the year anniversary a candlelight visual on the steps of the capital talking about 9 11 in Pearl Harbor and all these other things that have happened in comparison why not let us see it oh because we'll see that it's not comparable to any of the shit that you say and we'll actually see that it was heavy propagation uh buy that actual three letter agencies that were involved in onsite you know fuck dude it's just total disgusting corruption dude at this point in time and we have people still sitting in jail over this still in sitting in jail over this not even charged for fucking years later man and that dude reading the comments on the internet just makes you like lose hope like the people are still like oh well they deserve it they're they were insurrection no they weren't and neither was Trump no now that's the biggest thing man that's the biggest issue well he inside of it how where do you like do you not know they delete it they don't know that they listen these people don't care they made up their mind but dude we need to move on without them we need to impose our will on this country without those people we're over here sitting trying to like convince them they're not ever going to agree with you because they want it to be their way and they are willing to lie steep steel cheat deny reality to get their way change the yes the Supreme Court rules 9 to 0 and the leftists in this country are now trying to come up with a new way to get them out bro how big and how inflated how delusional is your ego to think that you have the right as a human being to deny the population will of the people yeah the will what's what this country is founded upon man it's absurd shit and it doesn't matter what you think about Trump it doesn't matter if you like Trump or not bro and here's the thing this is the this is the dangerous part of this the dangerous part of this is that that pedal and like I've said through years is going to swing so hard back to the right that we're going to end up with a harder authoritarian authoritarianism on the right than we are on the left and and it ain't going to be Trump it's going to be who's ever after Trump yeah that's where the real danger comes well I mean you call it dangerous they some people can call it no but the president says been sent they're really fucking themselves by making Trump out to be this villain because what it's going to cause is the rise of an actual villain yeah that's against them yeah because they're they're they're actually radicalizing people because they're ignoring their will and they're making them feel like peasants and they're disrespecting them and they're they're putting them in danger and they're doing all of this shit they're making their lives harder and dude if you think Trump is an extremist you're insane bro the extremists are going to come from the people who you are fucking with relentlessly those are the people where the extremists is going to rise from not some New York City billionaire who's 79 years old that's not going to happen so like the next guy in line because it could be me I'm going to tell you right now I'll crack the fucking hammer on these people I want to see it dude I would I wouldn't even hesitate listen bro go read the story of Sulla all right go read it Sulla S U L L A go read it go read what he did the guy grew up joined the military went on crusades for Rome fucking Rome started getting corrupt he came back he killed all the fucking corruption they said hey dictator for life man Rome is yours we love you you're the best you're the best thing ever said no thank you he left is I'm gonna go home I set this in motion it's all good I'm gonna go home and I live my life that's what I would do yeah but it sounds great no sounds too bad I'm what you think dude on which part on all of that yeah I mean listen like the those blurred faces those blurred individuals their performance they're either undercover agents working the crowd whatever the case is they're protecting dude that's that's treasonous shit yeah this is crap man dude listen man it's a good minimum it's against the interest of the American people the dude our government and our agencies are legit manipulating reality so that they can get their way like this is a fucking ant farm and they're like oh let's put them to go on left no yes flip this shit upside down yes that's what's happening shake it a little bit get them fighting yes so they can go right that's what's happening and it's being done by the 600 people in Washington DC combined with the media combined with the biggest companies in the world these these people are insane dude they're all bought in on the world economic agenda the world economic forum agenda the 2030 agenda the green agenda the new world order yes they're all in on it dude and these people are fucking legitimately ruining your life because of it and if we don't wake up now it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse and it's going to become so bad that there's nothing we can do to resist it because we won't have anything they tell you that you're on nothing and you'll be happy I'll be happy and they'll have that so so if you own nothing and you'll be happy does that mean that they have everything and they'll be miserable no that's not what it means it means they'll have everything that'll be happy you won't have shit but fuck what you think because it doesn't matter anymore because you don't have any resources there's nothing you can do are they really saying that you'll own nothing and you'll be quiet yeah yeah well there's a scene in catashak you're saying catashak there's there's a scene in catashak where the spoil grandson is at the concession stand and he's like I'll have a hamburger I'll have a hot dog I'll have a candy bar I'll have a soda and his grandpa looks at him he says you'll have nothing and like it and and fucking tells him sit the fuck down and bro that's that's what they're doing us we're promised this a big American dream dude we're promised this opportunity to build the life of our dreams we're promised all this shit and these people take it it's disturbing dude and it's critical that everybody wake up it's not it's not violence that's gonna solve it it's not violence you guys you guys I see in the comments well then fucking do something motherfucker I've been doing something I tell you to play the whole time I've been telling you for years what the play is you don't want to control your own fucking life and because you don't want to control your own fucking life things continue to get worse it starts with each individual it spreads from individual to individual to individual to individual it goes from the parents to the kids of the neighborhood to the community to the fucking state to the fucking country like holy shit man this isn't that hard to understand but until you get your own shit together that like me saying personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion is not some fucking bullshit that is the actual solution yeah well guys let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this was where we uh very hell I'm talking about it again one of those two options so with that being said uh our thumbs thumbs up where dumb as fuck hell I reach burglary suspect confronted by Colorado police while on the toilet I'm on the shitter bud so this alleged burglar went from the crapper to the clink the Colorado police department released yuck worthy footage of officers
