So keep an eye out for that as well Now you're gonna notice something we don't run ads on the show, okay? I pass up on eight figures a year of ad revenue Because I don't want to answer to anybody about what I can and can't say all right So I ask very simply one thing because we finance the show ourselves it cost me money to do the show I ask one thing man Supporters by at least share in the show, you know support the companies that I own that were a part of but and we appreciate that but you know share the show Okay, the message is constantly getting throttled. We're constantly dealing with traffic issues If you guys don't share it it doesn't really get out. So don't be a hoe show all right What's up, man? What's going on brother? Oh, not much. Yeah, you know, it's something we talk about quite a bit Like we're definitely starting to see culture change right and we're seeing these these moments these like little sprinkles of I don't even know how to describe it, but but shit's changing right and I thought this was interesting I got I got this topic that I just saw is when I was putting this out line together and This may be the end all be all of the bullshit So I want to get your thoughts on it. Let's see it guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures headlines videos go to Endings for seller.com you can find them linked there and if you're watching on YouTube check down in the description Intro topic man headline reads billionaire Bill Ackman claims Harvard president was hired because of DEI initiative Yeah, it doesn't get you know it gets better than that But no shit. Yeah, right But yeah, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has accused Harvard of hiring president Claudine Gay solely Because of its diversity equity and inclusion of initiative instead of quote identifying the best leaders for our prestigious universities The fit it's dude is weird man. I got a lot to say just keep going man. I'm trying to be better I'm trying to be better Yeah, so the article continues is New York Post a contingent says the 57 year old who has made a name for himself by publicly announcing that he would refuse to hire Students who express anti-Israel views made the claim as he blasted gay As well as the presidents of University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT For refusing to condemn calls for genocide on their campuses at a congressional hearing quote I've learned from someone with first-person knowledge of the Harvard president search that the committee would not consider a candidate who did not meet the DEI offices criteria Ackman wrote in a post on next Thursday of the University president who is black Quote the same was likely true for other elite universities doing searches at the same time creating an even more limited universe of DEI eligible presidential candidates Quote shrinking the pool of candidates based on required race, gender and or sexual orientation in criteria Is not the right approach to identifying the best leaders for our most prestigious universities Ackman argued and it is also not good for those awarded the office of president who find themselves in a role That they would likely not have obtained were not for a fat finger on the scale No shit no shit man, but it's just is weird It's the implying is he is listen now. I don't want to make any accusations because I would never do that Right, I would never do that. I would never I would never ever make an accusation, but it's It sounds like He's saying That we should put the best most qualified people in the positions Of power and influence and success So it sounds like like meritocracy. It's sound it's now hold on don't take that's too far That's not good too crazy. Listen. Yeah, I don't want to say meritocracy, uh-huh But it sounds like it just does sound acquired a bit like that though. It does and do this is coming from left field man Because this is the same guy We begin yellow dude the whole world's big it yell that by this motherfucker and his buddies for the last 20 motherfucking years about this bullshit and now all the sudden he's saying it now bro come on man That's what I'm saying. It's these guys are all exposing themselves is the emperor has no clothes and they're eating their own Yes, that's a beautiful crazy thing man because I mean dude just a couple of years ago I mean he was all about it hiring only minority own investment banks to lead a four billion dollar deal. I mean It's just it's so out of league. So I'm like I'm okay. Well, who is this guy like who who's Bill Ackman? Right and he's a democratic political donor. He's a massive investor hedge fund manager He short stocks makes insane money on it. I mean very successful if you look at it in that that sense He's a staunch critic of Trump weirdly enough though. He did support the Kyle Rittenhouse stuff He felt that Rittenhouse was also not guilty and believe in his innocence He why don't think there's zero critical thought I just I think there's Look, it's not that it's not that these people of immense power and and financial wealth and control and influence can't think They think very well. They're very smart. That's why they are who they are They just are very selective and don't care if you notice when they're being hypocritical They pick and choose what they get to say when they get to say it Because they're elite and it's the same reason they can all fly to Egypt or Davos on their private jets And then lecture us about eating meat and you know not farting too much right you know I'm saying like this is this is what we're dealing with all right so we're dealing with a class of humans Who believe they're so powerful and so strong that it doesn't matter if they're hypocritical and it doesn't matter if we notice because there's nothing We're gonna do about it and so it's no it's so surprised to me. He's selectively, you know Picks and chooses, you know these people have spent the last 20 years trying to convince everybody that their Anti-racist and you know so virtuous with all of this D.I. ESG green energy fucking bullshit in the removal of meritocracy and You know they've profited greatly from it, you know what I'm saying when when they force companies and the green scheme of things Yes, absolutely, bro, and you know what here's the flip side of that coin The flip side of that coin is is that the companies that never bought into the shit are at a tremendous advantage because they've been operating the entire time with the best people and the best seats and the best places to win All right, so if you run a small business, we're gonna cross over here into business if you run a small business and you're an entrepreneur and you've been following these people at the I don't know you've ignored my advice, okay about not doing this Now you're gonna now you see why okay, so you fucked yourself dude I have conferences and I talked to entrepreneurs and they're like I heard this person because of this or I hired that person because of that and if it's not because they're the best You're a dumbass because you just handicapped your company and you hand it kept everybody that relies on you and every family that relies on you and It's not the right thing to do. It's not moral. It's not right. It's not okay And it's hilarious to see the people who actually put these policies in place to shut out suffer from them now dude Dude, he's not wrong. He's not fucking wrong and not wrong at all But it's just like I would like to go back and see his tweets around June of 2020 and the previous 10 years regarding you know his Palaces on that like the idea the whole idea bro to take some Listen No, nobody I mean people are talking about it now finally, but for 20 years nobody talked about it All right, nobody talked about the reality that is this the only people in this country that can be racially discriminated against legally are actually white men Okay, if a white man is qualified for a job and a black man is qualified for a job and an Asian is qualified for the job The white man is not getting the job because of these DEI regulations that are People don't understand they're they're enforced through the financial institutions because the financial institutions will not lend unless you have this certain policies in place Okay, so it's not about having the best and all correct. Yeah, so We we have been told this lie that you cannot be racist Uh, you know if you're if you are discriminating against white people. It's not racism That's bullshit judging anybody by any uh Characteristic of their race their skin tone their eye differences their facial features different that's fucking racism And it goes to every single fucking category of human being we're all human beings bro It's content of character it's quality of skill and this is a beautiful thing. Okay, this is a beautiful thing because what this means is that What I've been telling you guys for a number of years regarding how the pendulum is swinging back The pendulum is swinging back and we're gonna get back to the real world the natural order where There it's everybody recognizes. It's a natural competition and everybody recognizes that you have to have actual skills and produce high uh, high Quality result to be the person who calls the shots or gets paid or gets the spot on the team or whatever The best most skilled that helps the team win the best deserve the highest pay and playing time in any scenario business sports What fucking life anything and we're getting back to that and it's cool to see Now I don't like this guy. I'm not a fan of him But I'm glad to see that the people who created this nonsense are now saying well, this is wrong And it's interesting that it took literally racism against themselves To create that you know saying like You know what I'm saying right like I can understand I can understand how a Jewish person right now would Feel very uncomfortable about the sediments of of a lot of people in the world um But you know They're not immune from criticism and the reality is is and this is unfortunate is that The people at the top of the food chain like we've been saying for years and years and years are putting regular life Good normal our friends that are Jewish everybody at risk by operating unethically at the top Okay, and then saying You guys are all with me at most of these regular good Jewish people have no idea What some of the shit going on at the world economic form and things like that are even happening You see what I'm saying so there has to be like some tolerance Like people have to be smarter bro. We have to stop thinking that Like you're every day You know, there's broad yeah, bro like you're every day white guy is the fucking KKK member you're every day black guy is a criminal you're every day Here I why you laughing Shut the fuck up The year every day Jewish person is something up right we can't we gotta stop this shit Because we're dude. We're all regular people out here man We're all out here trying to do the best we can and the truth is is we have a bunch of criminal tyrants And it doesn't matter if they're black white or Jewish or anything that are manipulating the fucking world And they're a favor against ours and it's making life hard for us And because they're experts at what they do they've created the scenario where we all argue Back and forth and blame each other as as humans when in reality bro We're all on the same team and they know we're on the same team And they only win by convincing us that we're not on the same team And so we have to stop with this You know Jews whites blacks identity shit like bro We're all human beings man and most of us are fucking good and we want the same thing We want to be left to fuck alone. We want to have a good life. We want to make some money When have the opportunity to excel if we choose to go down that path unencumbered by uh You know ridiculous amounts of tax and financial oppression like these are the things we all want you know what I mean? and The more that we argue with each other and say it's the blacks. It's the whites. It's the Jews. It's the Fucking Mexicans. It's everybody Bro the further away we are from achieving that that's reality man And so like we have to chill the fuck out on this shit. Well, and the more we do that the The longer the actual people who are committing these um You know abuses against humanity hide. Yeah, you know, I'm saying the longer we can make some invisible They are hidden away roads. We're so busy out here now look dude Look man. I understand you guys understand I've done well in my life So but when I say we I'm it's we okay we work our brother any day I come in here and don't work my fucking ass off You know, this is what I do is very hard and what you guys do is very hard when everybody does is very hard And it's so hard that we if they make it so hard intentionally So that we can't pay attention to the amount of fucking bullshit. They're putting down on us You know like dude, I'm so sick of seeing this fucking argument in society Around low-level points like your race like or you know like the shit this shit stupid and it's stupid from anybody Like you know dude real talk like I know like there's a lot of guys out here now saying like It's okay. It's good. It's good to have white pride All right, look man. Hold on real talk They make a real case. It's a real case hold on there's a real case and it's not It doesn't sound right because it's been marketed wrong for so many years, right? But it's okay to have pride to be black. It's okay to have pride to be Mexican It's okay to have pride to be a Jewish person. It's okay to be Proud to be you know really anything I wish or anything outside of a white American and And the truth of the matter is as while I agree with the argument that it is okay if you want to have pride in being that That doesn't mean you think less of other people first of all and second of all The reality is is I actually think the answer to that is that everybody should lose the the pride in the racial identity Like you didn't do anything to be black bro You didn't do anything to be Latina. Oh you didn't do anything to be Jewish like what the fuck you're you're deriving your identity Based upon something that you were born with which makes no sense and honestly it's anti-American Okay, it's like an anti-American type concept so when we talk about like Having okay to be white. I actually think white people are doing it right because most white people don't give a fuck that They're white. You know what I'm saying? They're like I don't give a fuck I'm gonna value myself on what I achieve or what I do or how I Contribute or what I build okay. I the kind of person I am like That's what I think and I think that if we all thought like that instead of thinking like instead of saying okay Well, just because everybody else says I'm proud to be this Like I actually think all of us should just say we're proud to be American And we represent these kind of values in America, you know what I mean? Right and because I dude I had a guy yesterday. Tell me and this has really bothered me He said something to the effect of uh You know, you're like leading the the Republican side of the conversation. No, I'm not I'm not Republican I am fucking pro freedom and there's a big difference. I'm pro everybody. I'm pro fucking human. I'm anti tyranny I'm anti-oppression. I'm not I'm not Republican or Democrat like or fucking like we have to stop attaching our identities to these things so we can have an actual conversation It's productive. Yep.

No He did not appear to fat shame or he did he fucking fat shame. He did and it's okay. Yeah, cuz he's fat Listen, it's the truth All right the moment occurred during a discussion about foreign policy when Chris Christie pounced on Rama Swami calling him the most quote obnoxious blowhard in America Both for for knocking Nikki Haley's more interventionist stance. So here's the video of the exchange Never put Ukraine in Russia and then trust Putin not to have a relationship with China. Let me tell you something That's not my deal.

It's gonna cost you your life at this point in time. You're older man You're not healthy. You don't sound healthy. You don't look healthy You're not healthy and bro. There's no fucking chance of the United States from America at this point in time and culture Is ever voting for someone like that Ever like you're fucking dead in the water, bro If you were a fit How old is late 50s 60s like if you were a fit man that that bro your career would be completely different 61 Good guys 50 60s His if he if he was in shape right now people would be listening to what he said. Yeah, that's a fact it more than he is There's a rfk's is what 70 yeah, the motherfuckers fit. Yeah, people listen to what he says. Yeah Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. All right. Here's the rest of the video This is the fourth debate the fourth debate that you would be voted in the first 20 minutes as the most obnoxious blowhard in America No Want to say something else We're now 25 minutes into this debate And he hasn't salted Nikki Haley's basic intelligence good Not her positions her basic intelligence. She doesn't know region. She wouldn't be able to find something on a map that his three year old She got her way out of the kitchen That's fine and Nikki and I disagree on some issues, but I'll tell you this I've known her for 12 years which is longer than he's even started to vote in a Republican primary How's that the green girl? We disagree about some issues and we disagree about who should be president of the United States Well, we don't disagree on this. This is a smart accomplished woman. You should stop insulting. I'm gonna take this What a what a gentleman. Yeah, what a gentleman But then about this rose to you. Yeah, right here. Here's the best comeback of it all We had three things right there. First of all Chris Christy also doesn't know what provinces in eastern Ukraine He actually want us to fight for Christian version of foreign policy experience was closing a bridge from New Jersey to New York So do everybody a favor just walk yourself off that stage enjoy a nice meal. Yeah, and get the hell out of this That sounds good Well, I didn't know man apparently in that interview post the debate. Chris Christie called him a jackass Uh in an interview with Megan Kelly here's the or with one of the CNN correspondence with the video I mean look I'm a truth teller Dana and I look Nikki and I disagree I don't think Nikki should be president of the United States, but I'll tell you this she's a smart woman And she's an accomplished woman and she's worked incredibly hard both in South Carolina and in the U.N And I think Vivek does have a woman problem I do think he insults women's basic intelligence. He's done it over and over and over again And I guess tonight I just had had enough I had enough of listening to his garbage and as I said his smart ass Harvard mouth Because that's what it is when he's dictating to me and Nikki Elliott who have committed ourselves to public service Well, he's been off stealing from seniors to make his fortune Yeah, I'm not gonna put up with him anymore So you call yourself a truth teller but you're also a very savvy politician. Thank you. You're welcome And I The wind up there is about New Hampshire And it was very interesting to watch you and Nikki Haley certainly as you said you disagree about a lot of things But it seemed as though you were forming a bit of an alliance with her. No, no, no Look, I'm a truth teller Dana And I'm gonna tell the truth if someone's insulting Nikki Haley in a way that was personal It was nothing about issues He was saying she's not smart enough to know where things are on the map that somehow his three-year-old son is smarter than a woman who served as a two-term Stop for her and a U.N. Ambassador She did not know what she didn't she didn't know the map she didn't so it like like He wait what Vivek said is factually accurate Not a personal attack. No, no, he he asked her You're you're trying to vote and advocate for sending hundreds of billions of dollars to a location Do you have the puzzles of miles away and you don't even know where the fuck it is on the map? Yes, and you want to send our young men to die there. You don't even know what the fucking name of the neighborhood is name three like like the Do we have that part where he destroyed her on that? I think so. Yeah, I think you skipped past it There might not be in this video, but he He annihilated her dude on that question basically he said I think this is it here. Okay That's him getting destroyed So Vivek had a Do we have the clip I can pull it up. It's fucking great I Mean he did not he absolutely did not He asked her very simply what the provinces were in eastern Ukraine and That we were gonna fight for and defend she did not know the answer that's You should know that if you're gonna need to send billions of dollars and more importantly our young men and women to die and fight On a foreign land. I think you should know what you're doing I think that's a reasonable response and honestly I think he fucking destroyed her like I think she's done after that video if we can find it I got it. Yeah Here's the video So foreign policy experience is not the same as foreign policy wisdom I want everybody at home to know that I was the first person to say we need a reasonable piece deal in Ukraine Now a lot of the neocons are quietly coming along to that position with the exceptions of Niki Haley and Joba And who still support this what I believe is pointless war in Ukraine And I think those with foreign policy experience one thing the Joe Biden and Niki Haley have in common is that neither of them could even state for you Three provinces in eastern Ukraine that they want to send our troops to actually fight for Look at that. This is what I want people to understand these people have I mean she has no idea What the hell the names of those provinces are but you wants to send our sons and daughters and our They can hard military equipment to go fight now. She's a very legit this myth that they've been selling you that somebody had a cup of coffee Stint at the U.N. And then makes eight million bucks after has real foreign policy experience It takes an outsider to see this through look at the blank expression. She doesn't know the names of the provinces So That's what Christy's talking about. He's talking about that exchange saying that Vivek is making her seem unintelligent No, she is not intelligent enough to know the provinces that we are sending our resources and our Personnel our American citizens are young next generation leaders Okay of our citizenship to die for I think that is a Relative point especially for the families of those soldiers Okay, so Vivek listen man. Here's what I think of a vape everybody's like oh Vivek's not winning dude, okay, Trump's gonna win the nomination. That's the reality 4% right now. Yeah, the sand it's not the santa's it's not fucking this guy Hey, Chris Christie. It's not Nikki Haley. Okay, it's it's not Vivek. It's it's fucking Donald Trump. Yeah, period I'm not gonna even been there. Okay, not by a little by a lot All right, it's Donald Trump everybody everybody with the critical thinking brain Know that yeah, all right So what's going on here? Well, what I think is going on is that we are seeing Jockeying for the relevancy maybe the next election um And I think you know you guys can argue and say whatever you want about Vivek. This is not an endorsement um But he is saying all the shit that All the real people in this country believe and see and observe And he is gaining a fan base because of it. No, I don't see that's my thing I don't know if he understands like how important what he's doing is no He's doing he's very smart. What he's doing is really really important. No, he's for the public narrative He's a very smart man and there might be some weird shit in his background. I don't fucking know It's like there's so much. I mean bro, honestly And I don't know this you know, I don't know the details of whatever But I mean We have to stop expecting Our leaders to have a perfect past Because what's happening is There being such thing there is no such thing and and this is this is how we cancel culture was intentionally invented so that They could remove any relative threat to the system in any way shape or form whether it be in media Whether it be in politics whether it be in culture They could remove the most powerful people At their will by just examining their past And canceling them, you know, okay? So if you don't fall in the right social norm It's just a way to flex power and control who's in influence and who's not and for this to actually change We the people consuming the content have to stop Destroying people because they made some fucking mistakes in their past. We have to stop that Okay, because that eliminates anybody of quality getting any traction because that's how they attack those people. So We have to come to terms that everybody's going to have something right an imperfect nation needs an imperfect leader Well, that's just how I look at it. Well, it's just trying to find a perfect leader We won't never we won't know and what we're left with is a bunch of fake perfect leaders that are on the payroll of all these big people So it's it's very It's it's something culture controls. It's very controllable if we as people in culture um Would stop reacting to it. Mm-hmm the way that we have in the past and I think that's happening now I think people are recognizing it like like you know Russell brand that shit a few months ago or whatever like nobody Gives a fuck. I'm doing alright. Yeah, right like the people are starting to realize that like this This is all orchestrated bullshit and I see the the whole Propaganda machine the media these corrupt people losing power at a very quick rate um And and I don't know that's what I am observing. Yeah, and like you said at the beginning of the show. I think there's a lot of honest indicators of of that You got Elon Musk saying You know fuck you to everybody right you got Donald the rise of Donald Trump right you got Conor McGregor talking shit You got Dana White talking shit you got a bunch of other people talking now You know, I talk a lot of shit, but I'm not on the level of those people those people are on a different level They get more attention But there's a more of the bigger the biggest kind of guys doing this now and and I think People are observing that it's like the the way things are going And that means more people are gonna trickle in and trickle in and trickle in This is what we've been talk you and I have been talking about this for years We need some big influential people To tell the truth and stop fucking with this cancel culture nonsense And the people I name and a few other people have led the way to that Matt rife has done a really cool thing recently You know, and you can agree or disagree with what he said or not you have the right to do that But the guy's funny as fuck he got called out for some cancel culture shit And basically say you know what fuck off if you don't like it. No, and guess what he made him bigger So people are starting it's only a matter of time now I want to note this I've been this way for my whole life, okay? This is not a marketing strategy for me. Yeah, yeah, but what's going to happen is People are going to recognize that by being that way They actually become more popular and we need that to happen. Yep. Okay. I've talked about this on the show many of times like the pro freedom America Fuck you kid rock type shit. That's gonna become the the shit that people support In business and in personal brands and so By them doing this they're kind of starting that process with like the I guess I would say like the the normal people, right? So it's a really beautiful thing. I think it's awesome. It's long overdue Guys tell us what you guys think jumping on this conversation down in the comments Let's don't you guys think hashtag. I know you are, but what am I? I think it's important to you guys like and this is real shit You know, I think it's important that we support those people that are behaving that way with our money You know, like if we're gonna spend money with With companies it should be with companies that are willing you know to to not bow to this cancel culture Either way, okay, meaning from the right as well And I think that's important because of the next big thing we see too. Yes Well, it's already happening because if you don't bow to the conservatives and you say you're pro-America They fucking get all over you man, and that's not good either Okay, and I can understand the knee jerk reaction because like the conservatives have been on the receiving end of that so long That now they have a power that they never had before Um, it feels good like you're like fuck. Okay, they can't fuck with me anymore. Now it like there's this Fuck with now. Yes, so there's this like yeah New power that has formed that's that people are not yet responsible with because what we really need to happen is we need it to end we need to stop We need to go back to the thing where I support who the fuck I want to support for the reason I want to support them and whatever else I don't fucking care okay, and this attaching Uh cancellation to someone you know Using a certain product or driving a certain this or doing a certain that or you know drinking a certain drink whatever Bro that shit has to stop we have to stop it because eventually what that ends up equating to is one side kills the other side All right, that's how it escalates so You know, I think that the people You know like if you were a beat okay like look dude real talk like if you were a fucking abused person Let's say you came home from work every day and you beat You got your ass beat for 10 years. Okay, every work every day your wife abused you or your husband abused you 10 fucking years, okay You you get out of that relationship and now you're in a relationship with someone new You don't just start beating them because you got beat Right, you see what I'm saying like you just don't start beating their ass because someone beat your ass for the last 10 years How the fuck you do it? Okay, you've used the opportunity to break the cycle and be a better human And I think that's very important now I think there's some lessons that needed to be learned for example The what happened to Bud Light as unfortunate as it is and I hate that it was Bud Light because I fucking love and has her bush And they've been they're from St. Louis where we're from here They've been an iconic brand and in our eyes for our whole lives It's sucked Seeing it happen, but that sent a very clear message to a lot of people like hey, man people are done And what's happened to target what's happening in Disney? These are things that kind of had to happen to show people but Now people are starting to learn and come when come when those companies start to stop just because They don't have to come all the way bro. We have to get back to the center place where it's like yeah That's what it is man, and you don't have to go there. You don't have to do this You know what I'm saying just because we have this power doesn't necessarily mean we should always you It's very important bro. Yeah, it's very important otherwise we can't heal the culture And we can't have unity and only way for us to win what we're trying to do here is through unity You know absolutely, man Absolutely guys, it was our first headline.

So you guys see when the next episode is coming So that being said, let's keep this cruise moving. We got a headline number two headline number two reads Anthony Polito 67 who killed three staff at UNLV before being shot dead by cops had 15 page Zodiac killer theory on website that also listed powerful organizations bent on global domination Hmm, I think they got one of us. I think I think this might have been one You know, they don't fit it. There's a little some weird shit out of this. Everybody's seen it You know, you're saying God one of us who actually you're saying this time he actually aligns and not just Like how they try to make it that way and even still there's still some some some issues that first of all anybody that just goes and shoots innocent people Ain't one of us. Yeah, that's fact. Okay, so let's let's clarify that as a fact. Yeah, yeah, you know But I mean we have to shoot people. It's gonna be because they deserve it. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Just saying if it happens You got a qualify But uh, yeah, man, so I mean everybody's been seeing it's a big big headline out there Um a professor who was shot dead Who shot dead three workers at the University of Nevada lost Vegas wrote a 15 page theory on the zodiac killer and posted about powerful organizations bent on global domination So Anthony Palito this gentleman here um Who is 67 died in a confrontation with police after he opened fired on the fourth floor of the Lee business school at 11.45 a.m Prompting a massive response from law enforcement Officials are still looking into the motive but said Palito was rejected from a teaching position at the school Uh, at some point but not recently however he may have known someone there Police are currently searching Palito's home in Henderson, Nevada Uh, Palito who used a handgun in the massacre had connections to the school in other states And was on staff at East Carolina University in North Carolina between 2001 and 2017 Um, so in addition to the three staff members killed in the rampage another person was wounded remains and critical Um, a lot of interesting things about this um You know, there's uh, he had a section on this website called powerful organizations bent on global domination Um, so among the organizations listed are the Roth the child family the bill deburg group and the international money fund and economics department of MIT Um, some interesting organizations I've heard of the first two but not the second two Yeah And so then you know in that section Palito posted a link to a website created by far right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Oh, it's Alex Jones fault. Yep There it goes. That's it Um, but he also listed his musical tastes which range from cruners such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin to folk musicians such as Willie Nelson and John Johnny Mitchell Um, in a section dedicated to his favorite movies um, Palito states that each selected film quote argues a truth with powerful eloquence Some of the movies are including Michael Moore's Roger and me Oliver Stoam's conspiracy latent JFK And the film version of Anne Rance conservative epic the fountainhead she wrote Atlas shrugged. Yeah. Okay. Got you. Yeah Um, and he also lists some of which is accurate by the way. Yeah, some of some you also list the quote The great minds of the 20th century and he lists Nikola Tesla Tesla Albert Einstein and George Soros. Oh, well, he's no So that's where it gets weird man. It gets it gets weird. Well hold on if you're actually okay All right Some people are gonna get upset with all of us say. Mm-hmm. If you're actually a critical thinker. Mm-hmm. Okay And you take your emotional feelings out of how you may feel about George Soros The reality is when it says great minds of the 20th century he is a very intelligent calculated human being To be able to do the things that he's done Okay, so it could be under he could be stating that under that context right under that context I would agree he's a very intelligent strategic financially capable human being who in his ideas are very complicated and and that doesn't mean they're right right that just means he sees like He plays moral his moral compass is not there, but he's a very intelligent human being Yeah, so I mean, you know That's that man and like I said, there's loss of life here. Obviously it's sad But make make to no one's surprise of course Um another gun push, right? Yeah, Biden pushes a salt weapons ban after the you in LV hang gonna attack so yeah, there's that and like like I said, it's a sad situation He's dead. It is what it is, right? Mm-hmm But here is something That that that happened Did I don't know that like it just makes zero sense. Uh, have you seen this have you guys seen this? Uh, who is James you Man linked to Arlington House explosion in Virginia. No, that's James yo You said it wrong bro, where's David? Yo, that's it James yo yo yo James yo What that's not racist nice bad. No, it's not Yo motherfucker like that's not racist. That's how you fucking say it But like the inclination like the rise of how would you say yo? How would you say when someone text you on your phone and says Yo, how the fuck do you say it? What are you saying you all? No, I said yo yo, yeah Yo James yo yo, see what I'm saying. Well, I hit shake there. Yo You know, that's racist. That's right. Yeah. Okay But yeah, so so this is a crazy story man and I tried to get a decent amount of context here Let's dive into this a little bit so so a Virginia man With a history of rambling social media posts and quote-unquote frivolous lawsuits has been linked to the Arlington House that exploded Monday night after police Arrive to investigate claims that someone inside was shooting flares into the neighborhood Okay, public records show that James yo 56 lived in a duplex house on the block shown Exploding in eyewitness video police confirmed his identity at a news briefing Tuesday afternoon and said that human remains had been recovered from the site They are believed to belong to yo, but an autopsy was pending So police said There are only prior interactions with yo at the address where a pair of noise complaints in the past few years Now people are yelling yo So His LinkedIn has been disabled right? Yep, but yo did preserve some of this post on youtube page along with the silent video showing court Filing from some of his failed lawsuits Um, two of the video showing his recent LinkedIn post apparently have been removed Tuesday morning Police said that they were aware of his quote concerning social media post at the briefing now Uh, a lot of this stuff has been linked out on the internet Uh info links on James yo the white anti white Asian farmer fed Link to the organs in Virginia home explosion. So based on his online post this article reads it's clear That mr. Yo was a quote-unquote anti white racist who harbored a strong hatred and discuss uh distrust towards the US government His social media conveyed a definite sense of extreme paranoia Uh, here's what Colin Rudd co-founder of trending politics had to say about the suspect uh, and a post on x He says uh, here's what we know about James yo the man linked to Arlington for junior home explosion police responded after the reports of a flare gun being fired from the home James yo was listed on public records as living Uh, as the one that was living on the property yo was racist against white people in LinkedIn post claiming they had been stalking him since the 1990s Quote this is how white people operate hey when I tell you about white people you said that you did say that though. Yeah, you did Um, yo posted a wild LinkedIn post uh showed he hated the government police and thought his neighbors were spying on him Uh, yo covered his windows with aluminum foils. I don't know. I know about the hats. I didn't do do your windows I know but I might start Maybe he knows something we don't know some of them. Yeah, it's something to it Um Reynolds rapper like I mean with like we know fucking foil Reynolds rap is the clear shit. Oh, guys are yeah, but that's that shit's annoying So it's right. I cannot stand that cling wrap stuff. Yeah, I'm not master that life skill at all I cannot even fucking do it Really you have a problem with it too. All right good man because it makes me feel dumb as shit. I can't do it man. Yeah Yeah, so just regular aluminum foil. Yeah Yeah, aluminum foil. All right. Yeah, um man, bro, look like this Look at this thing. That's a work of art. That is the best 10 foil hat Ever it's pretty easy. Yeah, ever. There's not I got a one of one though. I know you do I do too though, but this is like this is the best There's not a better one. There's isn't yeah It's powerful got a little bit low and you guys I know someone out here is gonna go try to make a better one. Can't have him It's I know this is the best ever It is really nice. Yeah, one of you guys made this for me. Yeah, you know Tino made it for me. That's right and sent this to me This is amazing. We need to cost him We have full aluminum foil Anyway Yeah, but when we're in the video, I don't know if you guys see here here's the video for you Oh Holy fuck, dude, I saw I saw it kind of scrolling, but I didn't stop to watch it. Yeah, but that's why Arlington, Virginia, and this thing they felt that at the White House really I bet they did It was massive. They probably sent them. They were blown So I mean apparently as a history of mental illness as they always like to say Me called his neighbor spies Talked about his distrust in the government. I mean here's some of his post It's it's written very cryptically, right? Like one of these says my memory serves Jamie Rosemary attended Ohio University Jamie Rosemary in Lance and her two children are spies and actors buffers collecting my information and then delivering to their handlers Um, this is how the ruling class stays anonymous using buffers and handlers to absorb digital ID Um, just some wild This is how white people operate and have the luxury about numbering all other races by almost seven to one in America I mean just wild stuff man Well, if I'm being fucking honest Like where the fuck are you from buddy What you get to fuck out of here? Fuck you where you can't go nowhere now. Yeah But here but like listen, this is where the stuff gets weird right so you know seeing the end reporting on this FBI is assisting the investigation. That's great. Uh problem is FBI has known about that man for years. Yeah. Well, he's called in. He's written letters. I mean, he's probably why they blew him up You know, it's like Allegedly allegedly But it's just like how do we always get the the late jump on this shit? I can't see like I mean we're supposed to have a pretty decent Intelligence community. I mean, it would be a reasonable thought that Our intelligence community would be sophisticated enough to Stop people from doing things When they know and have been watching them and know their habits and the things that they do for literally years before the things happen Yeah, I think that's a really like I'm not being sarcastic. No, it's a reasonable Expectation of any confident Component organization of any kind You know, I just don't get it but instead you know they go after fucking Catholics The thing is is we don't really even know if this guy is who they're making him out to be we have no idea Yeah, this guy could be someone else he could be you know, we're talking about tin foil like This guy who who knows who this guy you don't know who the fuck this is this is these media. This is all corrupt These people are all corrupt. We don't know this guy. We don't even know if he got blown up Maybe they fuck maybe he was killed and then they blew it up Did you see yourself? I mean if we've learned anything over the last few years the like there's really no limitations What people are willing to do if someone is Some sort of threat maybe maybe he knew something that he wasn't supposed to know who knows But if he is who we they present him to be fuck that guy Yeah, guys, that's what you guys think jump in on this conversation another thing to say too Dude is like these like listen man Yeah, we know the world's fucked up, but any of you guys going thinking you're gonna go out and like just shoot random people That ain't the fucking way no like that stupid ass shit you're fucking hurting everybody by doing stuff like that And it's fucking disgusting Like absolutely, you know I could understand people being frustrated the point when I like fuck somebody's gonna do something I understand that but like that's where you have to be disciplined and thoughtful and you know Not do things like that do something not that we we need listen bro. We need unity We need fucking unity people have to organize We like-minded people and people have never been more like-minded than they are right now so this like This revenge type shit allegedly or any situation is not the way to fix what's going on. She's not Yeah, guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think hashtag. Who is you? And let us know what you guys think. It's like a one like that. I was a little bit a little rush hour. Sorry. I was drinking some of this I'm free to yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I feel more free. Yeah, it was a little rush hour. You know that this scene. Yeah, I am you. Yeah, he is me This is a great movie guys just keep this cruise movie. We got headline number three our third and final headline reads FBI director gets cornered on Epstein's sex trafficking check clientless Hmm Yeah, this one's heating up the internet right now. Is it oh it is is this today? This came out I believe wins Tuesday is when this came out um and and the interesting thing man, you know I searched in it there was only one uh There's literally this is the only article out there that's covering it Well, that could mean it's bullshit No, no, I got video. I mean, it's real shit. Okay. Oh, let's see. Yeah, yeah, it's real shit So uh republican senator marcha blackburn Quadred FBI director Christopher ray monday afternoon About the failure of the bureau to release the client list of convicted sex trafficker and abuser jeffrey Epstein Ray was also pressed about why the FBI ignored accounts of victims The exchange took place during a senate judiciary committee hearing on oversight of the FBI. Uh, here's the first video Hey and looking at some of the survivors from the Epstein Issues There are disturbing allegations that the FBI failed to investigate the sex trafficking allegations and indeed one survivor Says that the FBI even after she brought forward repeatedly content about his conduct that the FBI refused to investigate her claims even though she said The allegations were there on both the sex trafficking and the child sexual abuse material and I want to know Why or what you what awareness you have of the FBI's failure to investigate these claims and I Want to get you on the record since numerous survivors have said the FBI did not show up to help them uh What specifically Has the FBI done to investigate the claims that Epstein's and others participated in produced possessed and distributed C Sam Well, first let me say I Recall very well that you have a very specific and longstanding interest Not just in child sexual exploitation, but in human trafficking as a as a cousin of that Uh, and we appreciate your focus on it and your support of the importance of that part of our mission as to the Epstein case specifically I will tell you it's been a while since I looked at that case obviously we worked together with prosecutors to bring charges before he Yeah, I realize that yeah, but what we need from you is a complete investigation of Why the FBI did not take this up and then getting to the bottom of what is appearing to be an enormous sex trafficking ring and listening to these survivors, you know, and as I said I've tried to get the a subpoena on the flight logs Which I think is important to this I I think people need to know who were on who was on those Yeah, and how often they were on those planes I think people who invest in companies would want to know if they're people from their sea suite and as we go through this Should those logs be made public they've been heavily rejected Well, as I said, it's been a while since I looked at the specific case I can tell you that we've been increasing year over year Both the number of agents focus on these kinds of cases the number of victims we've rescued and I'm and so on to the specific case Let me offer to have my get let me get with my team and figure out if there's more information we can provide to that would be great We have never even through the julyne maxwell trial we never got to the bottom of this and we have these survivors who say oh there is so much more They swept it under the rug and that is wrong and you need to write that wrong She's very brave very very very yeah, I don't I'm unfamiliar with who who she is and what state she's from but um They've killed people for less than that. Yeah, no and what we live people. Yeah, we need we need allegedly We need people like that at scale up there. Mm-hmm. That's what we need Yeah, like I'm telling like when I searched this topic there was literally this is the only article that's out there They're allowing to be seen Um, she tweeted about it also in a couple of tweets Um, Senator Durbin blocked my request to subpoena jeffrey abstinence flight logs. What are democrats trying to hide That's interesting they bring up senator Durbin because what else is he doing? Hmm, I feel like We have a little bit of anti-domus happening Hmm I happen to catch a clip Do you have the clip that he said this thing the other day that that this guy I remember What's that guy's name? Randy Randy Randy Kancella Yeah, that guy Randy he said this before he talked about Something that was that Durbin was taught I can't remember though. Can you find a clip? Yep But we needed the labor we needed the workers. It's happened many times before What troubles me about the debate now about the southern border is it is one half of the immigration equation Yes, we need order at the border. Yes, we need to have changes in the laws that reflect the reality of the Overwhelming numbers from all over the world who are coming to our our shores and our border But there's also an incredible demand for legal immigration into this country even now The presiding officer my colleague from the state of Illinois has legislation which addresses one aspect to that Her bill and I hope I describe it accurately Says that if you're an undocumented person in this country And you can pass the physical and the required test background test the like you can serve in our military and if you do it honorably we will make you citizens of the United States Do we need that? Do you know what the recruiting numbers are at the army and the navy and the air force? They can't reach their quotas each month. They can't find enough people to join our military forces And they're those who are undocumented who want the chance to serve and risk their lives through this country Should we give them a chance? I think we should And let me tell you about others that we need in my state of Illinois In inner city in Chicago. So just to clarify That sounds a lot like he's saying The millions of military-aged migrants coming across the border right now Could join our military Be outfitted with weapons and serve our military honorably as he says what that means to him honorably We don't know And earn their citizens their citizenship through service so What does that sound like does that sound like something that maybe I said a while back where I talked about how You're gonna end up Losing all of your shit because you're allowing these people to come over here and that they're gonna actually end up Arming these people and then turn these people against the landowners and the people who are native of this country and basically let them know like Hey, if you handled this shit what happens in an uprising? What happens if there's a civil uprising and the military is packed full of Illegals people that shouldn't fucking be here and those people know that you know If they kill the real the actual Americans who are here that they're gonna take their place What happens what happens there you see what I'm saying? And they're already starting to do they're starting to with police officers in Illinois Yeah, how I read this is that the government Knows and recognizes very clearly that they are in deep fucking shit because everybody's waking up And their solution to this is to replenish the military stock Of people who have an incentive to legitimately remove the people who are already here In culture and society. Nope That's just that clip right there should scare the shit out of everybody in my opinion scary to me That's why oh man And it's a confusing clip for people to watch because in the beginning of it He says legal immigration so people I've seen this clip online and people were um, he's not talking about it That's right. They're getting confused what he's actually saying is All the military age Chinese all the military age Middle Eastern's the thousands of thousands that have come in a million's in millions Millions it's like seven eight million. Okay That they are eligible to gain legal citizenship through service in the military. Mm-hmm think about that And if you don't I mean here's just add take that one more step further. Hold on take take that five steps further. Yeah Who's been caught contributing all this money to the Biden family? China okay now if they were going to conquer the United States Do you think they could legitimately conquer it by flying airplanes over here or flying boats up to the short no they would get fucking destroyed Okay, we have the best strategic operating Location on the planet for defense for geographically. Yes So how would you do it from the inside? Okay, and how would you get your people in you were let them come in unabated and the next step would be we arm them Is on that and I take that you know when you look at the fact that they've stripped our military Overmost patriotic strongest men by the vaccine kicking the amount of the military for that You know our numbers are absolutely low right now.

You're getting asshole shit That's the reality, you know like if you're nice to be listening I go out of my listen. This is a good rule for everybody Go out of your way to be extra courteous and nice to the people who handle your food. Yeah It's a good policy in life life lesson. Yeah, you should never fuck with people who first of all It's not it's hard work. It takes it's you're constantly being Fucking complained to or yell that You're not treated with respect. You're not paid well. Okay, and It's a hard job to do. I've done it for a long time. That's how I financed the first few years of the business um I think if people you know had a little more respect for everybody they would these kind of things wouldn't happen as much That's personally my opinion. I make it a point dude like you've been to eat with me a million times man I am very very nice to the people in the restaurant. No for sure Overly nice for sure because like bro like these people are working hard And if they think that you're overly nice bro, you'll come out you get a nice meal. That's why I really think that yeah It's been my case. Yeah, I mean yeah people have fucked up your food but fuck ups happen man Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Just don't do it again. That's right Yeah Hey, look dude. I'm just being real. I'm just keeping it real man like I think Well, the younger a quit she quit she quit a job too really.

That's where talking about that stumps up We need more of that shit. Yeah, people should be humbled right. Yeah Stop treating people like one of my biggest pet peeves dude is something that like I will legitimately stop fucking doing business with people or Relate having any sort of relationship with them is how they treat weight staff Because I worked in an environment for so long and I witnessed so much bullshit That like dude, I just I it tells a lot about a person. Yeah, like you can tell a lot about a person How they act and how they behave and how courteous they are to the people that do Waiting type jobs tables drinks Service jobs. Yes. Yeah, yeah, you can tell a lot man and actually I think you could tell all you need to know by the way That those people are treated 100% and maybe if we treated them better maybe We wouldn't have such a problem getting people to do the work I think if we all do better everything gets better. I think that's the bottom line. Yeah, so 100% man Guys, Andy It's all got all right guys. That's the show.
