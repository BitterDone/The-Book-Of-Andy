there can you see the inside of my mouth from there yeah no shit no i can but i got 20 20 vision i have fucking surgical lacy i don't give a fuck how 2020 your vision i can't see the inside of your throat that's not a game let's move on from that yeah man i'm dealing with that it's fucking annoying though yeah everything's good man what's going on with you i don't feel a little uncomfortable over here yeah why because you want to see the inside of my throat i didn't want to yeah you asked me gave you what you asked for anything else i can do for you shut the fuck up you can start there all right man let's get into it yeah what we got going on today let's get into the real news i wanted to uh to pull up something first stop stop talking about Andy's throat yeah throat goat i got the i got the throat coat i know i got my throat coat right here too bro no but worth bringing up something this is a lot of people crying right now oh really yeah apparently yeah this is a big deal and it's coming from a very interesting demographic there's the young people and then anybody apparently over the age of 65 and the younger crying and the older crying about the same thing okay what's that tick tock oh yeah so congress explores new build a force a sale or band of tick tock in America and their users are crying about it not just crying they're getting pretty pissed a new bill that could ban tick tock from all us phones and tablets is set for a vote by a key house committee on Thursday reflecting renewed bipartisan efforts to respond to national security concerns linked to the popular app the draft legislation were prohibit tick tock from US app stores unless the social media platform used by roughly 170 million Americans is quickly spun off from its China link parent company bite dance the house energy and commerce committee reviewing the bill so basically once that goes in they got 165 days that's about five months or so to sell it or it's going to close down that's essentially the ultimatum that they're giving them now like I said there's a lot of people that are getting pretty pissed about this and so I think they sent out an alert or something yesterday I heard about that so the seven out alerts push notifications as soon as you open up the app that is that's telling you to contact your local congressman they don't do shit well yeah what's that going to do well apparently like some congressman has been talking about it because their phones are off the hook oh really that's what they're saying notice how they didn't make them contact the congressman when they were shut in the entire country down because of bullshit bullshit right right right let's shut the country down let's not let's not contact our congressman because we're feeding our kids hormones and cutting off their dicks let's not let's contact them because they're about to lead our ability to propagate that I think that's honest I think that's what's at the heart of it right because you look at all the other social media companies and you peel back that curtain of how our federal government had access to make calls when it came to censorship and those certain conversations and take talk was kind of unaffected by that right and so I think that's what a lot of this is this is more of like hey if we can't control you we'll just you just won't be able to to be able to exist I think that's what that is but yeah I mean so they were getting these pop-ups and you got a couple of congresspeople talking about it so this is like one example you would walk in and it would give you a push notification not just saying contact your congressman but which one and it gives you the direct number like you push a button and it says call now so that's kind of like I mean do this pretty amazing now that's I think that's more likely to get them banned than anything you're exon for being honest was that well because dude these people they're gonna get pissed the congresspeople look man when someone really needs you and you're working on shit that is like something not that and they continue to hit you up over and over and over again do you get more likely to help them or less likely oh less likely yeah these are people too I see that I see that yeah one of the congressmen said the congressman the one house GOP staffer tells me quote it's so bad our phones have not stopped ringing their teenagers and old people saying they spend their whole day on the app and we can't take it away why they should take it away I mean this is probably probably necessary so in the statement TikTok response is I statement on the latest TikTok legislation this bill is an outright ban of TikTok no matter how much the authors try to disguise it this legislation will trample the first amendment rights of 170 million Americans and to provide five million small businesses of the platform that they continue to say they should be I'll be pushing to silence so anyway we got on this I say good riddance I think all social media should be banned yeah that's the things I want not the other ones well because those ones are connected to the federal government the federal government tells them and dictates them exactly what to allow and what not to allow and TikTok doesn't allow them to do that because TikTok is owned by an international company they have must be based in China right so I mean look I've been very vocal about this you know and I don't think if you don't have if you haven't lived pre-social media and post social media as a full grown adult your opinion on this is invalid but I can tell you from my experience and I think anybody who lived pre and post social media will tell you that social media has been a net negative for society as a whole and as much as the opportunities that it's created and the successes that it's created even for myself I would trade it all if we could go back to having real life all the time seriously so I think it's ruined it's ruined culture it's ruined family values it's made people's attention span go to nothing it's propagated cancel culture it's it's brought bullying to the forefront of people's faces I mean when you think about like the kids who have to deal with this shit you know growing up is pretty hard anyway and now they got a read on the internet all their classmates making fun of them or talking shit you know it's just not it's not cool in the beginning it was cool like when people actually shared their lives but let's be real dude social media has become just one giant commercial you know what I mean and we're not even connected no more that's be real you know I'm so like I see those like pictures and videos like you know you look at like the New Year's Eve ball drop right and you look in the crowd and all you see is fucking phones and people's faces you know what I'm saying it's like nobody's even experiencing the real fucking thing yeah that's that's real shit yeah so like in my opinion you know I think social media in general and I think all platforms I don't think just Instagram but I think they've all had a detrimental effect on culture and society and and that's my opinion and a lot of people will attack me when I say that because they'll say well you own company yeah no shit that's the environment bro I'm an entrepreneur I'm going to work in the environment the soil that I'm given I'm going to work though however I can work the soil without social media because I actually grew businesses before social media so comfortable with that too I just think it's better for people I think people are you know more human and more real and more like better without it and I think it just brings so much I think there's good things too I think it brings a lot of opportunity I think there is a great entertainment aspect there's lots of things that I like to watch and look at I'm not saying it's all bad but I'm saying when we say like I tend to look at things as negative or net positive right like I look at people that way you know there's a lot of people that you know I don't agree with everything they say I don't I don't you know and that's something that social media has brought to the forefront of culture you have to agree with it everything that everybody says all the time otherwise you're a fake or you're a fraud or you're wishy washy or you're not loyal and that's just not reality like I can be friends with someone I can vote for someone I can be around someone that I don't necessarily agree with everything they say I don't agree with everything they do but I look at them and the people I surround myself will be a net positive and if they're a net negative I won't surround myself with them and that's how I look at everything I look at everything is it a net positive or net negative and when I'm being honest about social media and technology and we think about what it's done to culture and how it's handicapped people from literally connecting and being capable and being able to do things and be intelligent it's a net negative man you know that's my opinion yeah that's real shit man guys tell us what you guys think down in comments and that means like dude if I were if they were to shut the internet off and I were to disappear that's okay with me because I was just a thing like I mean because we've been trying it right we had the internet blackout we just had a social media blackout a few days ago I was cool yeah I was alright when the cell phones went dude I think this extends in the cell phones too you know it's not just social media it's cell phones as well you know the way business is right now like when I talk to my dad about business or guys that are older than me about business you know they can't fully comprehend what it's like now to do a business because back in their day you know when when they got done with work bro they lock the door they went home man that's what I'm gonna call that's not how it works anyway it's nothing like that and we as human beings are not designed to be bombarded with stimuli 24 hours a day like that like if you're an entrepreneur now because the competitive landscape has gotten so competitive if you're not putting in that kind of work you're gonna you're gonna lose man you know and so like dude I don't know that that's good for people like it would be a lot better if we went back to the way it used to be where businesses were open from seven to you know 530 or 6 or whatever or maybe you had a night shift or whatever you did but it didn't you know consume people's entire existence and unfortunately that's what it takes to build things that are relevant now and you know it takes away from other things because we only have so much time so much energy and so much ability to live our life when we're consumed with this whole other world and when we think about the purpose of social media it's designed that way you know it's designed for us to be sucked in become addicted and force other companies to fight for the attention. Yeah it's you know and I think I don't know I think it's bad I don't think it's good and yeah you know you well then every time I say this I get these fucking idiots say shit like well then lead the way and leave social media and well well well hey guess what dumb fuck I'm trying to win the environment that I'm presented with I can't control the environment yeah that's not something you could be innovator let me let me fucking quit and let these you know 500 people that I employ here in this building and thousands that I employ outside the building starve. Yeah good idea yeah I know like it's just no the environment is just not ready for that yet it's not there yet you know I think social media real talk eventually will be looked at as cigarettes will look at after people found out that they're not there yet after people found out that they made you sick. I think people are going to start looking at it like you you you still use social media you fucking I think eventually it will get to that point culture will get to that point I read a stat I don't know if it was true or not the Instagram was the most deleted app last year and if they delete tick tock that's going to change because I believe that the traffic will float right back over to Instagram or you know could be a new platform to you but I doubt that yeah I don't trust them and guys let us know well you want you ready to do some some cruises yeah let's do it let's get into a guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures headlines articles links videos go to any for thought that you guys can find them links there let me say headline number one it's big day today got the so to the what state of the union all the items are going to fuck it up let's talk to this you got your president Biden's 2024 state of the union address now this is I'm watching these little kids man these are always like that big deal you know you're watching the world's leader country's leader you know strong up there speaking and this would be this would be interesting because they're already not off to a good start so let's dive into this a little bit you got a OG press poo poo pants did you see that their initial post that they put out on Twitter under the official president Biden account gave the wrong date no no I didn't this was the original post turning at 9pm eastern time tomorrow evening for my plan on how we get it done live February 7th state of the union 2023 yeah they don't want people watching it that's quickly deleted it they're supposed to do with this I'm headed to the capital night deliver my state of the union address join us at 9pm eastern time to hear how far we've come and building the economy from the middle out the bottom up in the work we have left to lower cost and protect our freedoms against maga attacks yeah that's a total lie isn't though remember like I mean oh you know he's doing exactly what he's supposed to do it yeah no no but I'm saying the you know we're building the economy from the middle out in the bottom up do you think that people that are in the middle class and in the under the neat the middle class so I'm not going to say lower class but people who are below that class financially do you think that they do you think that they're going to believe someone whenever they know what their finances are every single week and then they know that they're not going as far as they are like what do you like what do these people think I do you think you're going to convince people and gaslight people into believing that that's the truth when they clearly are having a harder time you know like I saw a headline that they put out I don't know it wasn't the Atlantic I don't think but it was the Atlantic I can't remember I could be wrong on this but the headline said inflation is your fault oh yeah the article was about yes oh man like bro the remember how they started saying inflation was made up not real and then there was inflation was transitory then it was you know you're imagining it you know like now it's your fault yeah yeah dude and these people you know these are ship eggs I mean that's the thing you guys have to understand these people are pieces of shit yeah he posted this picture this is apparently him he said prepping for tonight and the only other notice that was how big that thought well I know you got laced again stuff and I might be able to see it but I can see that good evening my fellow Americans Mr. Speaker Madam Vice President members of Congress and the cabinet military leaders distinguished guests how about what you stay home man you know I'm saying like you're not our fellow American now you're you're the anti-American that's real and yeah I mean so you got pushed on these note cards the shit that he's been prepping where did you see the KGB response to him yeah I got the clip here's clip oh yeah what were if I may the president I noticed that I had no cards at the border when he's just a piece briefing there you also had no cards last Friday with the Italian Prime Minister why does the president realize we'll have the new card you're set because the president has no cards you're you're asking me a question about the president having no cards yes why president who has had a probably one of the most successful first three years of an image of administration than any modern day president he's done more in the first three years then most president who had two terms you're asking me about no cards I don't think that's I don't think I don't wait I'm not speaking to you right now James I'm talking to I'm talking to your friend over your head so thank you so much but thank you so much for interjecting get it I think what's important here and what the American people care about is how this president is delivering for for them and that's what he's doing and that's what's the most important thing here how how do these people come up there like look at look at her face look at that smug ass shit these people think they're better than everybody they think we are fucking stupid yeah well you go get her face dude look at her fucking face yeah KGB good old KGB yeah yeah well she's a piece of shit she is now here's the good news guys you know if you guys have been affected by Biden flation there's a chance you guys can make some money tonight because apparently there is a during the Biden state of the union Americans can place prop bets on gaps mix ups and even a brain freeze so this is legit thing so so bet online has created a plethora of money making opportunities around Thursday's important speech as the 81 year old president hopes to quail national concerns about its cognitive abilities and mental fitness so you go there and you can actually put bets in on how bad he's gonna fuck this up and you can make some money off of your off of the effects of his his doings I thought that was interesting now most mentions okay what's he gonna have here the what's he gonna mention the most democracy maga putin or January 6th yeah you got you got maga and j6 at 400 percent Putin's at 500 or 500 plus I think maga's gonna win that maga's gonna win yeah yeah over I say he's probably gonna say it like a fucking conservatively I'm gonna say a thousand on the top one it says what is gonna get the most mentions the border security Ukraine or guns I'm gonna say guns we'll say guns I'm just gonna he's gonna go up there he's gonna talk about how good the economy is and nobody's gonna believe it he's gonna talk about how maga is the problem and then he's gonna talk about how we need to get rid of guns because of the mass shootings how many brainfarts are been I don't know do you think do you think that he I'm sure quite a few I don't think it's gonna be zero I mean look we gotta be we gotta be fair too like let's be real you know if you watch Fox news all they show is him looking like really bad and if you watch him speak other times I mean he can put a few sentences together a few of yeah yeah I mean look the guy's not as bad as the right makes him out to be in terms of how bad he fucks up they just show his fuck ups exclusively right so right let you know same-tack to see him in there but he's pretty bad yeah I mean I'm not saying he's good um but yeah I'm going with guns and maga that's what I think yeah check back and see yeah see what the hell see what the two that comes out you know what's interesting though is I think these people are such I think there's I think they're very much so misreading the tip yeah very much I think what are they though because there's my thing are they because uh you know last night they built a security fence around the entire capital yeah I saw that and that kind of weird yeah right like they built an entire construct like constructed an entire wall that's surrounded the entire US capital building it's like fucking ten feet tall um think that was that's interesting you know so are they out of touch with the tip or are they just pretending to be out of touch with them they don't care I I think they are out of touch with it I think they I think they don't comprehend the fact that their numbers are legitimately like in the basement and I don't think they're understanding that the more that they continue to talk about maga and trump the more at this point they're pushing people that way you know people don't want to hear about your trash talk on maga and trump when they were paying their bills and had a decent life under trump they don't really don't give a shit bro people care about themselves they care they say okay that was my life better than it was my life better now and most people are saying my life was better than and so the more he talks and the more he blames this shit on trump which is clearly their strategy I actually think the more he's pushing people towards trump at this point in time so that is the data is important yeah so I think he's his own worst enemy at this point they don't talk about anything that's actually relevant to people they lie to people they gaslight people just like I said a minute ago when they say you know hey uh you know inflation is not real or work the economy is doing great and people can't pay their shit that pisses people off bro because they know better and then you know people are starting to talk again right right after the pandemic people were a little less social and they didn't communicate and so this gas lighting worked a little better than because people weren't talking they were thinking we're fuck man maybe it's just me maybe I'm the only one that's hurting maybe but now they're talking to their friends they're talking to their neighbors they understand that times are a little bit tougher than what are a lot tougher than what they were in the past and it's not just them so every time you know KGP gets up there and says this stupid ass shit lies to people every time Biden goes up there and lies about the economy and then blames it on trump and all this like bro it's just it's lifting the veil more and more to show who these people really are so I imagine that whatever he says tonight is just gonna push more people to Donald Trump yeah yeah so guys let us know what you guys think make sure you guys join in on February 7th 2023 at 9 p.m. Eastern yeah you guys don't miss it yeah yeah no shit it's crazy to me it's crazy to me it's just crazy to me how old and elderly these people are that are running the country making decisions for the rest of us yeah like we're suffering because of the decisions of a bunch of decrepit old people that are gonna be dead in a few years because they're trying to pad their bank accounts for their own families well being for the next hundred years on their way out the door you know Biden knows he's gonna be dead soon you don't think he fucking knows that they all know that so that's why they don't care about stealing all the money and doing all this shit because it's gonna benefit the people coming behind them right they're all in on it man they're all in on the destruction of what you and I know as America a hundred percent and the evidence shows that the evidence does not show you know when KGP says he's done more in three years than any other president she hasn't finished the thought the rest of the thought is to destroy America right and that's the that's a true sex that is a true statement yeah he has done more in three years to destroy America than any other president that has ever been president including Jimmy Carter which was pretty fucking bad so in East LaLive yeah apparently it's like 102 or so yeah well it's because he's a fucking lizard yeah I mean we might as well go all the way in yeah yeah it wasn't gonna do where I get yeah no shit yeah guys tell us what you guys think jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know and that means let's go ahead over to one yeah this is I saw this comment I thought it was pretty cool we talk about temperature changes all the time yeah yeah this is a perfect example of that this comment comes from at Marco Trulio 56 2080 says I'm an American boring citizen my mom was born here my dad was born in Mexico he's a permanent resident we are taught as a culture to vote Democrat we are taught our Republicans are racist in general over the last five to ten years let me tell you the amount of Hispanics we're now leaning towards the right is astounding even my mom says she's voting Trump and she's a lifelong Democrat voter she's had enough Mexican Americans are waking up in massive numbers we work for our shit we work hard we have traditional family conservative values we believe in Christ and became here to contribute not to take just like 90% of all the family lineages we're here today that's a major shift there's a major shift happening yeah dude hey look this is why I always try to clarify you know if you come here under legal methods and honestly if you come here from Mexico I don't really care how you came here for being honest I feel like you guys are our people and you know there's a great sharing of culture between Mexico and the United States and there always has been and the Mexican culture here in the United States I think is generally appreciated by the other cultures I think they're one of the most welcoming wholesome cultures that we have in the United States and that's not the people I'm talking about when I talk about sending them all back where they came from I'm talking about these people from Africa I'm talking about these people from Eastern Europe I'm talking about these people from China that are all military age males that don't belong here right okay so you know I I love this I you know this is Marco you're the fucking man for saying this shit and and and it's refreshing to hear because the the idea that Republicans are all racist that's a Democrat lie that's a lie that they used because they don't have any real policy to stand on so what they do is they stir people's emotions around identity as opposed to around the issues and when we look at how the Democrats do that and you step back and you unemotionally detach yourself from their techniques it's very easy to see what's happening it's very manipulative it's full of bullshit and if they had anything that was a benefit they would talk about those things you know it's kind of like when someone's trying to sell something and all they do is talk shit about the competitor that means that their product has no value you see what I'm saying so like it's that's what they do that's what they do they all they do is talk shit on the Republicans they say everything is their fault everything is this guy's fault or that guy's fault because he votes this way or he's this race and then in reality they go up to Washington DC and they make rules and regulations that hurt the very people that vote for him so that they can get richer and more powerful and it's nice to see people waking up to that yeah this beautiful man yeah it's beautiful I appreciate the comment Marco yeah um appreciate all you guys yeah yeah all you guys commenting you guys all real ass fans real ass fans what's up yeah we're gonna make a shirt for that let's do it like if like if people get their comment mentioned on the show we should send them a real ass fan shirt like a ceiling fan yeah it's like yeah we put a ceiling ceiling on it like a little desk clean yeah yeah or furnace that works in reverse this motherfucker calls me this morning fucking pissed off dude fucking hot and let me tell you something bro DJs about his calm as it gets dude he don't get fucking worked up and he's like these motherfuckers came to clean my ducks and they fucked me dude they told me it was gonna be 200 bucks

Jake Paul a YouTube star turned boxer I love their their classification of him we'll take on the former heavyweight boxing champion on July 20th at the Dallas Cowboys home AT&T stadium in a match that will be streamed exclusively on Netflix quote it's crazy to think that in my second profile I went viral for knocking out Nate Robinson on Mike Tyson's undercard now less than four years later I'm stepping up to face Tyson myself to see if I have what it takes to beat one of boxing's most notorious fighters and biggest icons Paul said in the statement released by Netflix and most valuable promotions quote my sights are set on becoming a world champion and now I have a chance to prove myself against the greatest heavyweight champion ever the baddest man on the planet and the most dangerous boxer of all time this will be the fight of a lifetime now the fight will mark Paul's second bout of the year in Tyson's first since his exhibition match with Roy Jones junior in 2020 quote he's grown significantly as a boxer over the years so it will be a lot of fun to see what the will and the ambition of a kid can do with the experience and aptitude of a goat Tyson statement red now just for reference I have a video here of Mike Tyson at 55 years old doing just a little spar yeah let's let's watch it ain't no fucking chance bro ain't no chance here's the thing okay Jake Paul's a real athlete he's a real fucking boxer too at this point undoubtedly I don't give a fuck when anybody says a lot of people like to hate on that dude Jake is a Jake Trains harder he's smartest fuck he works harder than fucking probably anybody in the sport right now the dude super driven he's he's a real thing okay and a lot of people trash talk him because he's he's fighting these guys who are not like boxers his age at the top level will do he ain't there yet okay he just started boxing three years ago so I think for what he's done so far is super impressive super fucking impressive however Mike Tyson is a different kind of human being yeah and here's the thing that the concern I have for the fight real talk when when he fought Roy Jones you could tell that Mike Tyson was holding back the baby was being very nice he was going 30% bro dude he could have killed that guy yeah real talk and people are going to be able to see if Mike Tyson comes out and fucking does that same shit with Jake and they're gonna call it out because because Jake has that's the that's the narrative right now he's not fighting big enough people he's not he's fighting has beens he's doing that's what people like to say I think it's great that he's doing it because I think this is eventually going to lead to him being a legitimate boxing champion however if Mike Tyson goes in there and fucks off and then Jake somehow wins bro I think it'll be bad I think it's be bad for the brand that's my opinion and here's the other thing if Mike Tyson goes in there and they're having an exhibition and Jake happens to clip that dude like let's say a little too hard or pisses him off all that talk of how this is going to go before the fight is going out the window and this dude is going to try to fucking kill him so it's going to be interesting no that's what I'm saying like this is a different kind of dude yeah like he can he he might Tyson do you understand what I'm saying we can make all switch that happens yes yes and if Jake goes in there and fucking cracks this dude in a way that like maybe stuns him or like hit them too hard and they talked about listen there's going to be a fucking problem yeah because this guy still moves like he's 30 years old and yeah I know a video bro he's 55 years old I know but hey guess what he said hey you gonna watch it fuck yeah everybody's watching it we'll watch it it's a brilliant move all right I am a Jake Paul fan a lot of people get fucking no I like Jake Paul yeah I like I like I think even Mike Tyson's story bro Mike Tyson fan to where he started where he's at I mean the demons that he's battled bro like I mean I he's a great fucking I think he's a great man yeah you know but like he will still get down bro and like I watch those interviews but he goes interviews where he's like he's talkers like bro I tried like I don't want that part of me no more I tried yeah bro that piece comes out bro like it's it's gonna be interesting dude I mean it really is I think you know I I don't know I don't know what they got planned it their their statements are respectful of each other very respectful yeah and uh I think that would be intelligent on Jake's part to keep it respectful because the last thing you want is a fucking super like legit Mike Tyson walking into that ring because bro that guy ain't playing around like like listen do this guy went to fucking prison he beat both fuckers asses and print like this is a real fucking dude this is not this guy ain't playing no and he might be a professional at this point in his life and he might have zined out a little bit you know he's eating some mushrooms right fucking he's got some good life advice but you slap that guy the wrong way and that guy fucking kill you so like if you don't kill you in a ring you might kill you out of the ring it's very possible like dude like so you know it's a fucking uh it's gonna be awesome and I can't wait to watch that's the truth yeah that's the truth I can't wait to fucking watch and dude this is just a testament to Jake's ability to market himself and personal brand himself he's one of the best in the fucking world at doing it so I think it's I think it's awesome uh you know you're gonna see Jake Paul eventually become a multi billionaire because he's gonna leverage this all in a business uh you know obviously same for Logan because what they're doing with prime and the other things they got going on and uh it's exciting to see young men kick ass I like that shit and you know these are two regular dudes from Ohio that aren't afraid to be polarizing and aren't afraid to be who the fuck they are and they go out and they kick ass and build cool shit and I think it's awesome I'm rooting for him but if you if Mike Tyson said hey we're gonna go fucking 80% and you decide to stick them you go 81 listen run you know put them off the way yeah bro I'm fucking excited about it I think it's gonna be badass yeah guys what do you guys think let us know now I listen I'll say this this is what I'm gonna say Mike Tyson goes hard Jake goes hard they go hard like let's say it's a real match and they go hard as fuck I think Mike Tyson's probably gonna do some real damage yeah that's that's my opinion yeah the guy's been doing it his whole life he's still in shape he's still fucking moves moves fast as fuck you know this might been too big of a I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know man I don't know Jake Jake's a winner dude like he has the ability to win I'm just saying you know it might be my it might be because of my age bro I will grew up watching Mike Tyson fucking destroy people dude over and over and over and over and over and over and when I see him move now he looks the same you gotta look like an old man no man you know so I don't I don't know man it's gonna be fucking awesome though I can't fucking wait hey guys put down in the comments who you guys think guys this has this fight let's let's get a pole going bro speaking of boxing did you see that video did you see the Ryan Garcia shit bro I looked at a little bit of it I didn't go deep in it bro did you see that video I sent you no they were like making him apologize for what he said and shit or I'll get it up yeah that's right here yeah yeah yeah that's what I sent you here to an alpha never turn back to Instagram oh one of these past couple days you guys have seen some pretty intense things I understand what they are and I don't understand what they look like but I'll come me back to announce I'm not gonna speak on any other topic of an unboxing sports and my fight that's the only thing I'm gonna be talking about and I'm training for this fight I want everybody know this fight still on 4 20 5 weeks of super focus I have PBD helping me in this camp and many other warriors so I thank you guys for the support and I'll see you guys on 4 20 now now what's the backstory because didn't he get like a well dude he he I mean look man Wang Garcia is one of the best boxers out there right he's very famous and very good very very good and he's very popular on social and about I don't know a week ago two weeks ago he started talking about all this like illuminati like the shit we talk about right and he got on this live on twitter with tape and did this he started tape was like so what's going on and he's like bro they fucking took me to the woods and they tied me up and they made me watch them rape kids and like start talking about all this shit he claims to be have been adopted and seen aliens dude dude dude all like super out of character stuff for him and there was a lot of theories you know that somebody stole his phone or you got hacked but he didn't and uh and then all of a sudden this crazy video shows up where they're making him sit and check I mean I'm saying they making him but that's what it looks like to me I mean did that look like that was something that he came up with the old force that look like some dudes were standing on the other side of the camera some fucking guns and some car say this shit exactly I mean exactly what he was maintaining and I kind of see his eyes yeah yeah I got the the original clip here when he was talking about I mean yeah like I mean dude he was tweeting stuff out please help please send help pray send prayers I'm calling all prayer warriors if they kill me it wasn't me or the people going to get behind me or let them kill me that's the real question let Ryan die or help me um fuck man that's some deep stuff yeah this was uh I think this is one of the clips from uh from the thing that's what it says yo Andrew hey bro all right talk to us bro I don't give a fuck bro they help me down they made me watch little kids get raped I don't give a fuck anymore where bro they fucking took me to the fucking woods bro and they fucking tight I'm not fucking joking bro I have fucking proof bro I don't give a fuck bro I fucking will show you every fucking video you could ever fucking believe bohemium grove is real they fucking tied me down and they made me fucking watch dog I absolutely don't give a fuck anymore yes I fucking lost it they're raping little kids bro yeah so you didn't hear that until just now yeah so that's been going on for a while now shit and dude ever like John rich do you know John rich a country guy from bigger rich yeah he came out and he's like bro I got invited to be he me and grove you know by a bunch of high power country executives I always said no like dude there's a bunch of people coming out now saying yeah they got to ask to go and this and that and uh it's just interesting because you know they denied denied denied denied denied denied and then all of a sudden you got this guy who's saying all the shit looking like he just spent the last three days crying his eyes out apologize and saying I'm not talking about any like that was the most posed fucking apology or whatever you want to call that possible and it makes you wonder like what the fuck are they doing in this guy yeah you know I mean fuck his eyes man like it's all right and people people always dismiss these guys is crazy they say oh dude he's on drugs or he's on this or he's on that who knows what the fuck they're doing to this guy right like look at Kanye bro you know what I'm saying like Kanye like look at what they do to these people look at Michael Jackson look at Prince look at what they do to these motherfucking people when they start to speak out bro they make them look crazy and then one day they're dead you know so yeah bro this this makes me nervous for him you know what I mean because clearly he's in over his fucking head with something because he doesn't got to him bro huh somebody got to him yeah I know but that's what it would be nice of all these people that it would be nice if all the people who know about this would just come out so they couldn't get everybody at once you know well that's the only way you can fix it I know but you know that what they do is they terrorize the one or two people to do it to the point where the rest of the guys won't come out this is all intimidation bro fuck man right that's why guys have you seen this let us know what you guys think down in the comments yeah I don't know man I hope he's good though guys let's get you out third and final headline headline number three I know we talked about uh social media a little earlier on the show um and it is a net negative I think that's what the conclusion was let's talk about what could potentially be a good positive all right um so this headline reads soon grok will summarize us laws before they are passed says elan musk um so this is the big one coming out of uh twitter so grok this new AI tools coming out you know we talk about how these bills they get presented in congress these 3000 page bills with 5000 different initiatives get all lumped in and nobody's reading the whole that shit um and so elan musk is now proposing that's their technique right that's how these are taking me for sure right um all the little buddy deals all the little you know backdoor handshake deals are all in those pages but nobody's reading that yeah um and so they don't give you enough time to read it no they put it out and you got 16 hours later it's fucking you got a sign of a vote on that's how they get this shit through people don't understand that dude yeah and it was and if you don't think that's how it's done when it was proposed to not do it that way and it was proposed to do single bill fucking issue passes it was all rejected yeah almost unanimously yeah you know so that's exactly how they do yeah and that should be illegal absolutely every law that's passed by our congress should be clearly stated and summarized law by law on one sheet of paper that's how it should be very simple every single human being should know exactly what laws these people are passing they should not be able to say border security bill and then send 200 billion dollars to a foreign country yeah that's not that that's for gender studies yes that's how they do it that's absurd shit except for the place that it's going to you know your brother-in-law's nephew has a company that's set up over there that's awesome yeah you don't seem like it's fucked up shit yeah that's how they do it yeah um so this might be a fix let's dive into it so tech titan Elon Musk took to twitter on friday to unveil grocks latest tech titan Elon Musk took to x formally twitter i still i do you not remember me saying this when he took over and it going happen i said it will never take it's bad branding yeah you know what do you call it what do you call a tweet now yeah it's an act you call it an x right do you remember me saying that you're exiting do you remember the people being like oh you're fool can order to here we are years later and people still got to say this yeah so just chalk that up to another motherfucking thing i'm right about i'm gonna start rubbing this shit in your fucking faces till you guys just go out in the world and be like no yeah he's right i always get nervous like when i'm cruising i gotta go to twitter i always get nervous because you got type in the the website you know i always get nervous i don't get it because i don't want no because dj watched a lot of porn no it's not no i'm just but like it's x.com x.com you know like that you know there might be not not on my i'm just saying like i feel like i heard yeah not yeah me yeah yeah me but other guys you know they might they might accidentally click on them boobies you know what i'm saying but not me because i would never do that i don't like boot dj dj doesn't like boobies yeah so um so yeah he's so i'm Friday he unveiled Grox latest asking for a friend the latest feed is decoding mammoth laws before they before their passage through congress so grox the chatbot developed by mussels startup xai will reportedly simplify complex legislation by summarizing it for the public eye in the coming weeks or here's the here was the tweet in the coming weeks grox will summarize these mammoth laws before they are passed by congress so you know what the real purpose is um and it's been received overwhelmingly positive by a vast majority of people so originally introducing november 2023 grok boasts unique capabilities a set of departments peers musk emphasized grox real-time access to information via x and it's internet browsing prowess enabling it to fetch up-to-date data from the web on specific topics it was launched as a direct competitor to open a i's chat gpt um yeah so like chat gpt grok also possesses internet browsing capabilities allowing it to provide users with comprehensive and timely information so that's a difference of set it out so this is this grok is from Elon correct be interested and see what kind of programming they put into that AI you know as far as i think it's like well white people see it black yeah black George Washington right you know come on you know i'm saying it bro they're listen these these progressive liberals they're right that code and you know listen bro these people are insane yeah insane they put that what was that comment that guy made the other day about i was making broad statements about progressives or something yeah something like that yeah that's because they're accurate right that's because i can say broad statements because you're all the fucking same exactly you don't think for yourselves you think you are part of the resistance when you are part of the machine if you start to think for yourselves and show a little bit of diversity of thought over there maybe i would delineate that but since you don't i generalize yeah so thanks for your comment fuck off yeah be as I mean so so we talk about benefits right i mean like is this a net positive as far as this a i shit goes yeah i mean this is this is how it could be used for good but it's gonna be interesting to see how it's not used for good i mean like look dude we're eliminating the ability for people to actually know things and if you talk to the people who are writing this a i they will tell you that's the point the like dude if you go listen to the to the main people behind these a i platforms they all have this this vision for the future which you know they make it sound real good right like they make it sound like hey look we don't we don't want someone to have to we want the computer to do everything we want the computer to like you tell the computer what it what it wants what you want and it just does it and so that even is the playing field because you're going to have to think to put the creative inputs into the computer that sounds good right because it's like okay well now we can just teach people how to critically think and they can use the tools available to create that sounds does that sound good yeah that sounds fun great the problem is is that common sense knowledge and how to operate in the real world how to do things how to know skills these things go out the window the more that we depend on these devices and so what we end up with is a bunch of people who think they're real smart but are incapable in reality so you know this go generally I think AI is the most dangerous threat that we are facing as humans especially when you look to combine it with robotics which is what Elon Musk is talking about doing what happens you know a lot of blue collar people listen to the show by the way I love you guys as part of the reason I do this shit I come from family of blue collar people you know my aunts my uncles all my families these are hard working fucking people bro and my friends and like we're in Missouri that's you know you know I'm saying what we are like and these guys will tell me well you know like I got to I'm gonna have job security because I do this or I'm gonna have job security because like no you're not you don't understand they're gonna combine this with robotic and make the labor force completely irrelevant they're going to put this in the machines the machines are gonna run themselves bulldozers dump trucks all that shit you're not gonna have a fucking job dude and your alternative here is going to be to accept a universal basic income which is predetermined by our government do you think they're going to overpay you do you think they're going to give you this life of luxury and when have they done anything to benefit you when have they made a decision that overly benefits you in the history of your life they are going to pay you the least amount possible and they're gonna keep the most amount possible for themselves and they're gonna tell you that you will be happy and you will own nothing and you won't have to work and you won't have but you'll be eating fucking crickets man because that's all you can afford and that's what people don't understand we put this idea in their head that they're gonna be able to live this utopian life when in reality bro it's gonna be just like every other communist revolution that's existed and people are gonna starve so it's very dangerous where we're going in my opinion the AI platforms are highly biased we can all see that when they're pumping out pictures of black George Washington and saying you know tell me something good about white people it won't answer the question these are major problems in our culture yeah that has been intentionally in yes and they're trying to force that narrative into culture and society for the purpose of division like we talk about all the time because if we're fighting over you being black and me being white are you being gay and me being straight are you be yeah I know you are it's okay yeah you're the one talking about my fucking throat bro you're talking about my throat and shit that's fucking that it is what it is bro I still love you like we're gonna talk about you know left or right what hold on I'm making response of that no because it's true but here's the thing we we have to get to a point where we have we understand what the fuck they're actually trying to do and they're trying to do with technology now and the reason they want us fighting over all this identity identity politics nonsense is because they don't want us to notice what they're doing to us so you know I don't believe in any of this stuff I think it's all terrible and I don't know I don't know there's anything we can do about it because a lot of people think it's great and the most greedy people on earth who haven't made any money yet and by the way I understand why they think this way I'm not saying I when I didn't have shit in my life I was using every single I have the luxury at this point in my life to think like okay well this is ethical this is not ethical this is the right way this is not good for people when I was young and I didn't have any choice you did whatever the fuck you had to do and everybody does that so when they look at the technology all they see is the opportunity and because people are you know our system is set up in such a way where it's hard for people to get ahead they're willing to adopt these tools regardless of what the consequences are so that's my take on this stuff man and I'm not saying you know it's not going to become the way of the world I'm not saying we're going to be able to stop it I hope we can there should be some regulations about AI it should be I think it personally should be illegal globally how are you going to get every country to do that you see what I'm saying so like there's there's we're coming to a different era in a different crossroads and it's going to be important for people to support companies with their dollars more than ever that actually do business the way that they think it's more like correct to do for humanity and that's going to be creating real jobs that's going to be you know doing the best you can to maintain opportunity for your community it's going to be the companies that actually support your community it's getting back to supporting small businesses and not being the funders of all of this drastic change by us continuing to support these companies because it's convenient for us that's my take you know um but I don't know what's going to happen and I don't have enough social cloud and I don't think a single person on this earth has enough social cloud to actually stop this I think it's going to take a collective rejection and when you see people running down the street what goggles on is shit don't go buy them when you see companies that use AI and don't you know uh employ any human beings and they've got all completely automated functions uh you shouldn't buy from those companies you should be buying from companies who are using the least amount of technology possible to create as much value possible in their communities for actual humans which are your neighbor whether they live in St. Louis or whether they live in Chicago or whether they live in Florida or whether they live in California we are still neighbors we have to still look out for each other and we have to look out for each other in this country or we're going to be a lot of us are going to be in deep shit yeah you know yeah it's real shipment guys jump in on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you think uh with that being said man let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where we bring the headline in we talk about it and we'll get one of those two options with that being said a thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads Texas mom is charged after sending
