appreciate you yeah all right man enough fucking around trying to be serious today put on your game face we're mixing people better that's the same face that's the same face bro I got tagged in a story today I thought it was pretty good this guy this guy tag tag he follows me in you and I don't follow him I never saw him before but it showed up in my tag stories and he wrote you know I disagree with about half of what these guys say but I believe they're trying to do the right thing and they're super entertaining I love it and he shared the show love it I thought that was cool that's cool you're wrong but you're cool yeah you are wrong yeah but you know what I love dude I love that our listeners are they're not like typical you know oh he said one thing fuck him unfollow like they're reasonable people that critically think and have disagreements and you know say hey you know I understand we're coming from here but what about here and I like that you know that's what that's what this is supposed to be yeah you gotta be out of the box thing yeah and as long as people are cool about it you know cool in respect yeah I agree man it's cool but you still wrong yeah definitely okay yeah man well let's make some people better today let's let's do that let's see what we can get done here I got three goons for you yeah let's not use out shocked guys Andy question number one Andy is being a quote unquote hard worker a skill or a trait I'm always felt like I've always took my time and took the slow and steady approach to deliver quality work I feel like the I'm a hard worker gets overused a lot and it's associated with like balls to the wall and it's or speed and quickness so can you give us some insight what is the proper definition of a hard worker what does that really mean and how do you not fuck it up well do you think Michelangelo worked hard on the sculpture of David do you think you think he worked hard when you worked hard and long okay did do you think that he worked hard to paint the ceiling of the cysteine chapel do you think that was hard work yeah do you think he did it fast no no he was just diligent he showed up every day he did what he needed to do he did it at a high level and he's highly skilled okay so you have to understand hard work doesn't mean speed it also doesn't mean slow it means I'm showing up I'm relentlessly giving my best effort to produce my best product all right and there is a speed factor there right like if you're a hard worker and you produce a good product but other people produce as good of a product in half the time they're better than you that's a higher skill set all right so hard is the prerequisite it is the foundation you will never find a successful person that doesn't have that as their foundation they show up every single day they give it everything they have they do diligent work which means they put in the massive amounts of effort at a high level they are consistent with that now there's lots of people that work hard that never ever ever become successful financially because they don't apply an in demand skill to the hard work all right there's lots of people that work really hard digging ditches every day and then are digging ditches when they're 70 years old there's lots of people who work really really hard for a long time and never make it and that's because working hard is just part of the puzzle the other part of the puzzle is how high your skill set is how developed your skill set is and so we have these people that say these things like work smart not hard all right well you're a fucking moron all right i'm just tell you that right now because it takes both it takes hard work and it takes smart work so while you have to be putting in the work and you have to be showing up and you have to be giving it all you have you have to consistently be aware and conscious of the intentional skill set that you are building along the way if you do not have the skill set and you just work hard you're going to get paid a fraction of what you could get paid if you actually intentionally built skills to go along with it and so because people usually learn most of what they learn from their parents from their teachers from their aunts from their uncles and because most people grow up in a very you know regular environment they're not surrounded by successful people they're not surrounded by people who have actually built things they don't really even know anybody in real life that is actually built things it's very hard for them to understand that their parents and their aunts and their uncles who haven't done anything don't know that much about how to become successful doing things because they haven't done that all right so we end up listening to our family and our and our immediate circle our immediate network of people about what it actually takes and what usually comes out of those conversations from the old people is oh man you know you can work as hard as you want but the system's still going to be the system and you're not going to get ahead they don't care about you blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and the reality is is those people probably gave it their all for a little bit five ten years maybe but they didn't work on developing their skillset they weren't intentional I'll be coming better they believe that if they just show up and they give it their effort that eventually things will materialize and when those things don't materialize they get bitter and they get pissed off and they start blaming other people they blame their job they blame their situation they blame capitalism they make up all these excuses why they're not getting where they want to get when in reality they're just missing part of the equation and the reason that they don't know about the part of the equation about gaining skill as you put in the hard work is because nobody around them ever did that all right so how do you know something that nobody around you knows it's very difficult so we have to like reframe our thinking about these statements it's not just hard work and it's not just smart work it's both and if you lack both you're going to be paid very little and if you have both you're eventually going to be able to write your own check in life but where you want to go you know it's interesting man because I think you know when you were talking about this it's like I have this image in my head of just somebody that's just spinning their wheels like the wheels are fucking moving there is an output of sometimes like you're not going anywhere right and I feel like most people like that's an innate fear that they have is like I'm gonna do this and not do the work but then we're dishonest about the actual work that we're putting in yeah oh yeah you know I'm thinking we talk a little bit about that yeah I mean like that's a honest fear most people look man most people drastically overestimate the amount of work that they do that's just the way it is you know this is a cultural phenomenon all right everybody wants to brag about how hard they work everybody wants to brag about how busy they are but the reality is is that success doesn't give a shit how busy you are it cares about how effective you are okay and if you're effective at a lot of shit because you work hard and you have high skill you're gonna get further in life this shouldn't take much logic to figure out you're working hard you have a a C plus skill set okay you're gonna get somewhere you're working hard you have a plus skill set you're gonna get 10 times further and half the time all right this is what people don't understand so yeah you have to be honest about what you're putting in which most people aren't honest with themselves about anything most people look in the mirror and they're you know 350 pounds and I know this because this was me and they say they don't say hey you're a fat fucking need to change they say you know they suck in their gut and they look from the side and look I look all right I'm good I just wore this black shirt you know it'll cover me up you know and then they live their life that way they live their life lying telling them themselves that they're good when they aren't good and then they get mad about the results that they fail to produce and this is a big problem dude and another thing is I noticed this with especially young people and really it's not even it's not a fair I guess it's not a fair thing to say especially young people because I think it's all people most people have very tough time understanding that success and winning is something that you have to seize you have to take it it's not something that is going to come to you all right like if you want to raise you think you're worth more you have to figure out how to prove that to the people above you and go sell yourself and have a conversation hey Steve I did this I did this I did this I did this I did this I I feel like I'm worth a little bit more money or this is what I think is fair like you have to and people don't even do that right like people won't even have that conversation because they don't have the evidence and what they end up doing is they end up quitting places and they say oh that place sucked no motherfucker you sucked you fucking sucked that place didn't suck at all you didn't even have the courage to go up and ask how you could get better you didn't have the courage to go up and say hey what do I need to do to get here because this is where I'd like to be you didn't even have that you just fucking stop whatever you're doing you go on the internet you type up some bullshit victim pussy shit about oh we'll go fucked by this place or you know another place blah blah blah taking a bro fuck off okay there's millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of tens of millions of people who have accomplished what it is that you're trying to accomplish who come from harder places worse places more difficult places than you and we have a society and the truth is people don't want to hear this but it is true we have a society of completely soft marshmallow motherfuckers okay they're not successful in any area of their life they're not fit they're not mentally fit they're not good at their work they're not good in relationships but somehow it's everybody else's fault that they suck bro look at the mirror bro look at your life look at the decisions you're making look at the work you're putting in tell yourself the truth and the answer will become apparent and once you tell yourself the truth you are now free to change the situation but people are so afraid of the truth and they're so afraid of confronting themselves with things that might hurt their ego that they continue to lie they continue to tell fairy tales and at the end of their life nothing has materialized and they can't figure out why so I got screwed or just didn't work out for me or it was God's plan for me to be a loser no it wasn't that was your plan that's a result of your actions I love it man guys any question number two hey Andy I am 25 and I am building my insurance book for business from scratch I feel like I have glimpses of when I am hyper focused on my goals and then days and even weeks when I feel like I am not even when I am doing my power list I still feel that I am not 100% focused and feel like every little thing distracts me and gets me off path is this a discipline problem or do I need to do a better job at eliminating things that knock me off path thank you for all you're doing how do you maintain that focus is that is that discipline or do you need to be trying to figure out what's happening around you well look first of all you have to understand that discipline doesn't imply that it's going to be easy discipline implies that it's going to get done even when you don't feel like it so there's a lot of times when you're exercising high levels of discipline that you're like fuck I don't want to be doing this it's extremely hard I'd rather be doing other things I'm not really focused on this but the thing gets done regardless because of the discipline so just because it's hard doesn't mean you don't have discipline discipline is required to do the things that are hard when you don't feel like doing them that doesn't mean they're going to feel less hard it just means they're still going to get done and if you take inventory of your life and everything you ever told yourself you wanted to be and you go back in time and you say what if I had been able to adhere to the plan I laid out in front of my path for me to get where I wanted to go and I'd stuck to that no matter what what would my life look like now what would my life look like if every single time I told myself I was going to get in great shape I actually follow through the first time what would my life look like if all the time that I told myself I was going to take my career more seriously I just did that the first time where would I be now right it's a life changing skill set being able to have high discipline that does not mean that it's easy you can't look at someone who is constantly it's almost insulting to look at someone who is constantly working hard and think that it's easy for them to work hard it's not easy bro I struggle every day I'm so dude I am so physically sore every day like I don't want to fucking lift weights I don't want to do I can barely I'm dude I'm I'm like a lot older than you mother fuckers most of you okay like I'm sore you think I want to go train with weights you saw me going to train with weights today the first thing I said when I got up is I'm like fuck don't get old you know what I'm saying like my back stiff my knees are stiff my elbows are stiff I'm fucking it's not fun yeah it hurts I'm in pain when I train and don't fucking message me all this fucking bullshit about touching the grass Joe's got some green tea I know I know what I'm doing okay like I'm gonna get all these messages from dudes have been training I've been training for 30 fucking years okay I'm gonna get all these people who are new fitness influencers telling me I need to fucking do butthole stretches or some shit see me a video let me let me check your phone yeah right yeah I'll come over and stretch out your anus I bet you will so so dude anyway my point is is that don't message me some dumb shit all right my point my point is is don't look at people who are doing all these hard things and insult them by thinking that it's easy just because they're doing it there's a lot of shit I do every single day I don't fucking feel like doing a lot in fact most of the shit that I do every day I don't want to do all right it's hard what I do is very very hard it's very very stressful it's very very there's a lot of weight to carry it's hard it never gets easy and you've seen that firsthand you know bro DJs around me as much as almost anybody and I mean dude just honestly there's days you know that it crushes me dude like fucking straight up but does the shit get done on the days of crush it gets fucking done and that's what matters about discipline so just because you think it's hard and just because you think that you don't feel it or you're not catching it and you're gonna have off days doesn't mean that's something that's that's it that's how it's supposed to be bro you're mistaking it thinking that once you develop a strong discipline the things are just easy that's not the way it is right I love that yeah so didn't you have another part of his question is just maintaining the focus so with that so is this a focus issue right like he's he feel like he has issues maintaining his focus on things that he knows you're supposed to be doing yeah well if you're having one of those days dude it's always a good thing to sit down and you know remember why it is you're doing it you know what I mean and usually if you can remember that what you're doing is not really for you it's for everybody else then you have more of a you have more ability to sort of harness that internal energy the internal focus to get shit done right like yeah I don't have kids at home but I look at all these people here as my kids I look at all these people here as my little brothers and my little sisters that I got to fucking do my shit or they're gonna fucking starve okay so there's a lot of pressure when you think like that and if I didn't think like that I probably wouldn't be as effective because I would just be doing things for me I seriously doubt I'd be here six seven days a week working if I was doing it just for me at this point in my life you see what I'm saying so we got to find external motivations and external causes and take a minute when we're not focused and say okay well this is why I'm doing this just take five minutes and reflect and say hey why am I doing this yeah what who's benefiting from this who's depending on this and that will help get you focused and then also I think another thing is um is that you know you could always manufacture the momentum you know when you when you force yourself through three or four days that are hard eventually that momentum kicks back in and it starts to get easy again and yeah after a while it's gonna get monotonous but if you force yourself for another three or four days it starts to get easy again so it's just it's ebbs and flows and I would I would really caution everybody to not make the mistake of thinking that just because someone is disciplined and just because it looks easy from the outside that doesn't mean it's easy it just means they're just doing what they need to do and as long as you do what you need to do um you know how you feel about it really is a relevant like when you're at when you're in the place you want to be and you've built the business you want to build or the life you want to build it should be very easy for you to look back and say I'm proud of that you're not going to remember all the times you didn't feel like it like I don't look back at like where I'm at now and think like you know fuck dude I remember all those days in 2006 where I didn't feel like no I don't even think about it it's like going on a trip dude like you never remember the fucking airplane ride you remember being on the trip you know what I mean and so that's that's how it is like so you're gonna have hard times I love that's because and I feel like I've seen this and worked too man with you because it's like what you're saying is like in those hard times kind of realign your intent yeah right like like you for example like I know you're calm and bro you'll you'll go from this meeting that's tailored for this specific department in this company and you'll walk right into another office in a completely different business yeah you know I'm saying it's so like maintaining you realign that intent in that meeting how does that work for you I mean that's that is a that's a difficult skill develop yeah it's still difficult for me at 25 years of doing this because if I'm focusing all my intent all my energy all my thoughts all my creativity all my problem solving solutions which is really my biggest thing in this one area and then I have to walk into this completely different area and do the same thing it takes and then do it in a snap yeah it's a skill dude it's you just do it over and over and over again but I could tell you out of all the skills that I've had to learn to be an effective CEO that's probably the hardest one being able to switch my focus from this one to that one on the fly and you know it I don't really have a plan for it other than it's just one of those things you have to do yeah I love it yeah love it interesting thought provoking yeah there you go mixing up guys it's lovely lovely answer yeah lovely um guys Andy are third and final question question number three uh hey Andy and DJ I want to say thank you Andy for your spirit of giving and courage to be vocal uh and hashtag really if my question is how do you maintain a high level of hunger I consider myself a discipline person I don't drink I don't party or go out I just started 75 hard I work a competitive sales job I just find myself looking back in certain periods of my life and thinking to myself I wanted it a lot more back then um or I was making way more sacrifices there and way more discipline and hunger there I know I'm doing okay for myself but I also am still on a journey away from my angles and can be definitely be doing a lot better I'm looking for that same drive and hunger I know I'm capable of um and I'm not really sure what the answer is to getting to that level and maintaining it how do you stay hungry um you got to set bigger goals okay you got to put yourself in an intentional position that you're extremely far away from where you want to be so that you understand every day I have to get up and go at it as if it's day one right so in the and by the way this is for this advice I'm about to give is now for everybody this is for here on this show we are speaking to the most driven the most hungry the most ambitious people on the planet or you wouldn't listen straight up you go listen all these other guys they're way softer than me they're way less intense they they want to work so they can live their life I want to work so I can fucking win okay and there's a big difference I'm talking to the people who want to win there's lots of people to get to a certain point and they do the math and they figure out I got enough money to go live my life totally cool bro totally get it I'm not wired that way I'm wired to be the best I'm trying to be the best ever all right and I know that's unrealistic like you might hear that and say oh haha but you ask why I fucking cut why I wake up every day and go hard because I'm so far away from where I want to be that I I have to I don't have a choice and I'm serious about getting there like when I say we're going to build first form into the next quote unquote iconic American brand like the night keys and the underarmors and shit like that I'm serious and we're very far away from that and so I wake up every day and I go hard as fuck when I when I wake up every day and I say hey I want to be in the top point zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent of men my age I'm serious about that and I know there's other dudes that are my age that are kicking my fucking ass I'm serious about that not many but I'm they're they're they're out there but I don't want to be kind of the best I want to be the best and so for me this is about setting bigger goals all right and I learned this lesson a number of times because over the 25 years that I've been in business there's a lot of times where I felt the way that this person is describing where I was I got a little bit soft I got a little bit comfortable I got a little bit complacent and that's easy to do when you've got a decent house and you're driving a nice car and you got a few bucks in the bank it's really easy to tell yourself man I'm doing good I can just relax the problem is is that eventually you're not going to be doing so good because the whole flow of success and the whole flow of society and progress is like a river it's always moving all right now if you get off the river and you say fuck I'm good I'm I'm kind of tired of swimming you know even though you're swimming down the stream I'm going to take a break and you get off on the river bank all the mother fuckers that were up the river a mile up the road they're gonna fucking pass by you okay so you have to stop and say what do I really want to be how far away am I from that and be honest with yourself and then take the appropriate action so I can't tell someone who is where they want to be and comfortable by design that they need to go expand their vision because this is their vision their vision is that but there's things to be cognizant of if you stop and get out of the river and and that's this you think you have a lot of money now but what about 15 years from now what about 20 years from now what about 40 years from now do you have 40 years worth of money living at your lifestyle and does that consider inflation and the devaluation of dollar or emergencies or economic collapse we need a lot more money than what we think we need we need a lot more success than what we think we need and I think it's very very dangerous as a man considering that is our job to build and provide and inspire and show the way for us to think that we haven't made at any point in our lives because you don't you never know what's gonna happen and at the end of the day if you keep going you'll be in a position where you can do all kinds of really good stuff for people so to sum this up you have to expand your vision you have to say all right I'm here and where I really want to be is here and I'm a gazillion miles away from that and so I have to work hard just like you had to work very hard on the real day one to get where you are now you see what I'm saying so it's about expanding vision expanding potential and I would challenge anybody you know that thinks like oh man I'm in a really good spot and and I okay well if you're you know a lot of a lot most of our people I think believe in God that listen to show if you're the product of God and God gave you all this potential and you only decide to squeeze out half the potential do you think you're honoring God or do you think you're failing God something about okay so I think about that so I think it's our job and I think success is ultimately defined by us making a commitment to the pursuit of our own true potential understanding that our own true potential can never be realized because eventually we run out of time but and by the way as we gain skills along the journey the potential on the backside of it expands if you were to take someone who was 90 years old with that whole life experience and put him back at 30 think what they could achieve because of what they know you see what I'm saying but they eventually run out of time and they die but if you commit to that and you squeeze all the juice out when you're gonna die you could at least look at yourself and say well I did it you know what I say and I squeezed all the juice out of what I had you could feel good about it and um you know everybody has a different path of how they want to live and I'm not here to tell people how to live but you asked how to get hungry again uh you should probably realize that that you ain't shit that's what you should realize and and and dude you know that's why when people and you hear this because you're around me all the time they come up to me and they say Andy congrats on everything you done man thank you for everything you done congratulations it's amazing what you've done and I'm like bro I'm just getting fucking started I this is day one because I mean that that's legit I just legitimately mean that like bit with one of the coolest things about an entrepreneurship as in business is that it's one of the only games that you can play over the course of your whole life and the older you get the better you get right because like for me to compete against a 30-year-old guy I've got 15 years more real experience in that guy like what he's gonna have to figure out I already figured figured out so if I continue to go I could scale up my success of a much faster rate in my 40s that I could in my 30s because of the experience that I have all right so I set my goals big bro like in real big like you know people like to say well comparison is the thief of joy well it's also the driver of realizing your ultimate potential all right I love it man I love it that was three man yeah it's a mid-weed drop yep yep all right guys CTI tomorrow again we're gonna start hitting
