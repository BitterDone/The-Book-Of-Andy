Yeah, let's do it. Thanks feel yeah Yeah Guys, let's get into this remember if you want to see any of these articles links pictures videos go to Andy for cello.com You guys can find them there and uh, let's get into this hose headline number one Hell on the morning reads meta's Zuckerberg apologizes to child abuse victims an emotional Senate hearing Been tracking these you've been seeing the child and shit going. Yes, all that's been pretty cool Pretty pretty interesting stuff. So sinners have like getting blasted. Oh, he's getting hammered He didn't look healthy either. He looks and he looked like he's been getting blasted. He's getting it. Yeah, he's getting it Um senators bad battered the CEOs of five major tech companies with accusations that they did not stem a rising tide of child abuse On their platforms and a contentious hearing on Wednesday Liking the companies to big tobacco and the unbattled plain manufacturer of Boeing The lawmakers invoked the stories of online child abuse victims many of whom set directly behind the tech leaders To issue a rebuke to met a CEO mark Zuckerberg and other executives quote you have blood on your hands senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said here's a clip uh, where Zuckerberg Uh, was Basically told to get up in apologize. Here's a clip of it Who did you fire? Yeah, I said you mischaracterized 37% of teenage girls between 13 and 15 were exposed to unwanted nudity in a week on Instagram. You knew about it. Who did you fire? Senator, this is why we're building all those tools Senator, that's I don't think that that's who did you fire? I'm not gonna answer that That's I mean, this is fire anybody right you didn't take any significant action. It's appropriate to talk about It's not appropriate decisions. Didn't put do you know who's sitting behind you? On pause it So what he's saying because the full context of this I just want to fill it in Josh howley is asking him about the sexual predators on his platforms He's asking about uh child pornography on his platforms to ramp it and he's asking him What he's done to control it and who he's held accountable for it Because a number of the and also online bullying okay cyberbool which is a real problem a real issue Okay, it's a real problem half the internet is fucking bullies. Yeah, half the internet makes their content based upon upon just tearing other people up and fucking trying to ruin them and The and there's a difference between accountability and bullying. I'll just say that But there is a lot of bullying on the internet and it doesn't just go towards children It goes towards fucking everybody everybody's felt it in some way or four And they don't so he's asking about all these things and there's a number of family members behind him who have had Children commit suicide because of online bullying correct So that's where we're picking this up at got families from across the nation whose children are either severely harmed or gone And you don't think it's appropriate to take up talk about steps that you took the fact that you didn't fire a single person Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this. Have you compensated any of the victims? Sorry, have you compensated any of the victims These girls have you compensated them? I don't believe so Why not that empower parents so you didn't take any action you didn't take any action You didn't fire anybody you haven't compensated a single victim. Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this There's families of victims here today. Have you apologized to the victims? I Would you like to do so now? Well, they're here. You're on national television Would you like now to apologize to the victims who have been harmed by your friends show them the pictures? Would you like to apologize for what you've done to these good people? I Know The things that your families have suffered and this is why we invested so much You doing these three big efforts to make sure that Don't want us to go through the things that your families have touched on Yeah, I mean This is it's an issue man Well, dude, I first of all This is not me is that like I just gonna say this because it's hard for me to tell Where this dude really is you know, I'm saying yeah, like sometimes I see him And look dude. This is this is really after like I'm not I'm not just gonna pile on people just because everybody else's Piling on it Sometimes I see Zuckerberg and I think Damn dude. This guy is caught up. He's 23 years old He created something new that went crazy. He became this very wealthy dude And all these people like got in got their hooks into him young And he's got himself twisted up in a in a whole ordeal that like bro. There's just not a lot he can do and He sometimes he comes across As a real guy who who just Invented some tech who fucking I mean bro, he's an uncharted waters. Let's be real. You know, I'm saying like how Many of you all could imagine being a billionaire 23 years old. See what I'm saying. That's a different thing And I don't know enough about him to know all the stuff. I'm sure everybody in the comments is gonna Gonna say well, he did this for that. I'm sure all of you guys knew him personally. Yeah, right. That's what I'm saying so So sometimes when I read him I'm like dude This guy I could I could sort of empathize with where he's at right Like when he went on Rogan and he said hey man The FBI is fucking doing this and he kind of told the truth about what was going on with social media But then I see him donate $400 million in blue and yeah in these a hundred million dollar bunker Correct, you know, yeah, then I see him promoting all this global is shit And I don't know if that's because he believes that or because he got in with these people and they got something on or what the What's going on? Yeah, so But like bro real talk like Zuckerberg like you got to you got to be more of a human bro Like you got to be more like that that apology You you could have done something from the heart and it would have really boosted your score with people And instead you gave us Very yeah, and and I give him credit for trying but like bro You know, you guys aren't really trying that hard to stop this shit, you know like you say you are But everybody out here knows you aren't and we all use your products like we all have a choice of the one Yeah, we don't because the narrative and the public discourse is on his platforms And we appreciate the fact that you know, we've been able to build companies and you know, we understand the value that he's brought We do everybody does Um the man's responsible for a lot of success and a lot of good things real talk really is But he's also responsible for a lot of things that should be handled You know like these child pornography like one of the questions that one of the senators asked him was Do because they put up a warning that says when the child If the image means saying like part not like you see that part yeah, yeah, yeah, and they said it said Uh report it or report image or see anyway And the senator who asked I forgot what it was I think it was Ted Cruz. I don't remember who it was But they said Do you do you report the people who say to see the poor the child porn anyway And they don't Why don't you right you see what I'm saying like these are obvious things And you're at the base level and like if you're able to put that fucking morning on that picture How is that picture like why don't you report the picture to be taken down How is that even allowed to be sure well bro? We can't even talk about who's being elected as Who's running in office? Okay on this show otherwise they censor our show like we talk about the president if we talk about The orange guy if we talk about any of these guys we get a show fucking censored But they can allow child pornography all over the internet and just give you a warning and do nothing about it You see what I'm saying so they're asking him why don't you report the people who search for these things Which is a reasonable request that they do not do so like Where are you bro like are you with the people or are you with the globalist Disgusting criminals because the reality is is there's a line being drawn in the sand right now and Mark Zuckerberg sort of Trying to walk the line and you can't walk that line You're either with what's right or you're with the fucking ship bags and bro You've made more money than most people Most people who've ever lived in the history of earth ever you know like this shouldn't be about money to you anymore Bro, this should be about doing the right thing. They just did their stock dividends today They paid a 50 billion dollar. Yeah, but dude. That's what this is what I'm saying like learning is not an issue Elon stands up and spends his own money to try to protect free speech And you could say whatever you want about Elon blah blah blah But the dude fucking bucked up and he said this is what I believe in and whether you believe in his Tech like his tech initiative which I don't I don't think they're good for people I know they're not good for people and I know in 10 years from now just like I've predicted everything else for the last four or five years 10 years from now you guys are all gonna wish that you had fucking Spoken up against AI spoken up against robotics spoken up against this shit because none of you are gonna be relevant And they are gonna depopulate the planet. That's what they're gonna do because people are standing up Instead, they're taking the technology and they're running with it and they're saying I can make money with it or it's This or it's that or it's good. It's the bro And it's gonna force billions of people in the absolute devastating poverty and So I don't agree with Elon's business initiatives in a lot of ways, but I respect him for standing up for free speech At least somewhat with this platform, right? And and Zuckerberg is like I feel like trying to figure out who's gonna win the battle and then and then just pick a side And dude, I don't think that's gonna be good enough, bro Because we all see what happens on the internet most people like people are not they're they're starting to reject technology They're starting to reject the idea of living their lives on a phone Just like we talked about earlier on my phone like what I was thinking about yesterday was man You know what maybe I should just live my life in real life like we used to you know like that's an appealing thought to a lot of people And a lot of people are opting out of social media and living in this fucking tech, you know Virtual space, you know what I'm saying like look what happened with metaverse got announced and everybody said It's gonna be the next thing and people rejected it, but now what's happening is people are rejecting The actual way social media is and so dude like It's gonna be interesting to see but it would be cool to see Zuckerberg like come out and just fucking do the right thing, bro Yeah, you know what I mean? I don't know what's gonna happen though because dude greed is a powerful thing and You know, I don't know what drives that dude. I can't figure him out. It's you know like what the motivation I try to give people the benefit of it out man like I try to look at people As a net positive like there's things I there's a lot of things. I don't like about a lot of people There's a lot of things. I don't approve of of people who you know have even been on my show before You know what I'm saying, but then I look at the net positive. I say all right What's the net possible the guy like Zuckerberg? Well, he's created Millions of fucking business opportunities that didn't exist before he's Created some really cool things, you know the way the internet existed in 2012 2014 is completely different than it exists now. It was cool there now. It's become this politicized shit storm of bots and trolls and bullshit And it's no longer people sharing their lives or you know, it's a it's a commercial. It's a it's an endless commercial for stuff. Mm-hmm and um You know, I don't think people I think the way they're driving it. I think people are gonna disengage as a whole I think people are gonna opt out for a real existence in real life They're gonna want to talk to real people have real community and I don't think the internet stuff is gonna continue to be For the regular person the center of their shit. I think you know, I think it's the center of Entrepreneurs stuff and business people stuff because there's there's opportunity there You know gary v says this thing all the time he says marketers ruin everything and he's right And they've ruined social media, you know what I mean? Because like dude when I scroll through social media How much percentage of what we see is like an ad? You know, I'm not even saying like an ad like a sponsor dad. I'm talking about like a brand like your branding or it's advertising Or it's it and it's like pluck dude. It used to be like People just sharing their lives like hey, man. This is what's going on with me. This is my dog These are my kids. This is where we went on vacation And now it's become this thing of I'm trying to like secretly get you to sell shit You know, this is one of the reason I don't run ads on the show, bro This is what I don't like I want you to buy my shit like I would look like by the way By my shit, you know, I'm saying I got like right here at first form by it, you know We work really hard. We're a american-focused company. We provide real jobs I assume that you guys will take the value that I provide and turn it back into you know supporting us Which a lot of you do a lot of people don't connect those dots, but I appreciate the ones that do it means a lot But I don't want to jam it down people's throats and I don't I don't think that people I think people are tired of that I think people are tired of the internet being a big fucking cesspool of Disgusting immorality and advertising No, you know, that dude is just an authentic bullshit, man. Stim 30 right here, baby Yeah, guys, tell us what you guys think on this topic. Let us know down in the comments what you guys Yeah, and have it on bias view like like look like If you're gonna comment on it, don't just pile on to people like You know, what I would like to see from our community is like when people deserve to be blasted fucking blasted Like when people steal 75 hard and start fucking try blast those people. Yeah, but like when people When people have a difference of opinion or a criticism, you know Way it out. Is this good? Is this bad? Is this is this where? You know, is this a net positive? Is this person helping more people or are they hurting more people? Are they causing more good or they causing more bad? And I would like to see that discussion, you know, like Because I personally think the internet is crossing over from providing more value To taking away from the human experience. That's my personal opinion and I truly believe that We would be better office human beings if we went back to the way and I don't think this is gonna happen Obviously, I'm not saying this is gonna happen But I'm saying if we were to go back to the old way where we did business with people in person we We did things with people in person we didn't just focus on ourselves and content creation We focused on becoming an actual You know productive good and human being that enjoys their life and helps other people enjoy their lives Um being a member of the community and all these things that are healthy I feel like the world will be just so much better dude. Yeah, you know Yeah, guys tell us your thoughts. Let's go down in the comments Uh, without being said, let's go over and cruise them. We got uh cruise the comments This uh comment comes from at Joseph Wilson 746 Says did you guys give up on the Buffalo merch question mark? I have up Fuck bro. I've had two drops. We sold it out in less than four minutes both times We sold 90% of the gear in less than four minutes both times with odd sizes like you know extra small or triple acts or double acts Taking up to 12 minutes by 12 minutes every fucking thing was gone off the site and by the way Thank you guys, but no we didn't give up you guys just buying it all So uh, I just had to today for those of you waiting uh, I had to do all the science skate decks I just got those done today because I've been so sick.

It doesn't serve our country. It doesn't serve our community. It doesn't serve our culture and That's what that means. So no dude. We didn't give up on it We just can't keep it in stock.

They didn't see any movement right they decided I mean there are articles about it They decided well, hey, I want the DOJ. I want House ethics, you know, I want all of these different entities to To investigate now so they did it at one time just ask all of these different, you know If different entities to investigate so these agencies are obligating a complaint and yes Let's talk about your husband your husband. His name is Courtney Maritz. Yeah, he's a military veteran Military veteran Why was he the choice that you made in terms of your personal security? So what was happening? There were a lot of issues with us retaining just good good Fav what was happening we had You know, we couldn't pay the the big cost for security like some of my colleagues are able to do And so we went with what we could afford it worked out for a while, but then we started having call loss You know people just just not showing up to work people sleeping on the job And so it was very hard for me to have security when it was unreliable And so what was happening was He would volunteer and sometimes he would even you know even when he was there and they were working He would say hey, you should be standing over here, right? Should be doing that and so he was volunteering a lot of his time And then we had someone who was kind of leading the group leading the team who Couldn't could no longer do it one day just calling and said I won't be back for three months right it left me in a position There was no way I could manage a security team Plus the work that I was doing and so he was able to pick up that slack and And not only was he able to pick it up he could handle all of it I mean he was the air assault soldier in a 101st airborn He had already worked for other other companies working security even as a supervisor So this was in his this was in his house and obviously he's somebody you trust I mean you're you're someone who has had a lot of threats obviously Oh Jesus.

Fuck these people and the thing is Who are these people just be clear These people that are fucking stealing stealing the shit and I'm not talking about black people But if they just corrupt into these corrupt politicians. Yeah, okay, corrupt houses. I mean, I'll say this to bro Like listen at the end of the day this shit even you know at this point We're almost two million dollars in how much this bitch is stolen right that's still low hanging fruit Compared to you know, I'm saying the what the big dogs all these motherfuckers are fucking doing Yeah, they're still in the thing. You know, it's just we're not saying all black people right we're saying all these elected officials Yeah, you know, I want to say this too because I think this is another interesting point because we also we talked about this plenty of time Don't see T.I. Where you know, they will use you they will bring in they'll get you all the deals you want and they'll let all that shit slide While they're able to use you in the moment that you go against a narrative for the moment that you go Yeah, your house at the complaints coming out. That's right or your lover boy who you've been screwing for the past year That finally comes out right like if you're not if you're if you don't stay in line There's I thought I want to say it's Japan. There's a saying it's like you know the nail that sticks up We'll get hammered down. That's how these people move you go against the grain. No fucking though. They'll take care of it Yeah, you know, so as they should but I want to I don't want the low-hanging fruit But I want the whole fucking tree bring it all down. Yeah, I agree Get him I mean it doesn't take a fucking rocket scientist to figure out that these people are all crooks all criminals and they all go to serve in our government To steal you know and take and get what they can for themselves and they turn around and look at us and Whoever us is that's all of us, okay? That's not white people or black people or gay people or straight people or left or right These people look at all of us and they say we're here for you We're gonna take care of you we care about you We're gonna fix this and we're gonna fix that and you're not gonna have any problems Once you elect us and then what do they do they go into office? Fuck us. They fuck us. They steal all of our tax dollars. They send it to these causes the none of us give a shit about And then they tax us at over 50% all in when you add it all up and and make it hard for the average American to even get by like it's insane bro like dude a house In 1960 was like $5,000. It was like 20. You know, it's like The fact like what they've done to America Through inflating the dollars and stealing the money decade after decade after decade after decade has created the That has created this place where and lusk and this is why you have to go out and try to get really fucking rich bro You have to make you have to make so much more money than you think you have to make Because that what they're willing to give you And how they pigeonhole the privately held companies and It's it's it doesn't the math doesn't math for people You know what I'm saying and dude, we're we're accustomed to it because most of us have been born into this system When you're born into the matrix, you don't know that you're in the matrix You know you're born and they tell you you're free and then they tell you this is what we do here. We work until August For the government and then after August you get to keep the rest of that money And then they tell us that's freedom and we say okay because we were born into it We said well this must be the way that it's always been and it's not the way it's always been And it's also not the way that it is and some of the most productive richest countries in the world All right, so we have to wake up as American citizens to stop fighting Over black and white gay straight Democrat Republican and all this identity bullshit that they want is fighting over and start realizing what's actually happening What's actually happening is that we are born into a system of slavery Financial oppression that we are made and conditioned to be thought as normal and free That is nothing of the sort That's reality that's where we're at and until we wake up to that fact as a whole and stop fighting over things like the pigment in our skin Or who we want to live our lives with or whatever We're going to continue to be oppressed bro And this is going to be a big problem for everybody and it's getting worse and worse and worse And the in the reality is is if we shrunk the government and reduce the taxes and actually serve the people with the taxes Our entire world will look completely different every single one of you listening Your entire financial situation would be completely different What if you took the 50% tax you pay all in okay, and I'm assuming that you're in the lowest tax bracket when I say that because when you're in the highest You're paying more like 70 All right, and you add because what I'm talking about is not just income tax I'm talking about all the tax that is collected property tax tax when you buy shit tax when you own shit We could go on and on and on and on and and When you add up all the tax the average person who pays tax is paying more than half of their income and tax and What would you do if you were paying only 10% tax all in what would your life look like what kind of house could you for what would you look like if If housing prices weren't artificially inflated because the biggest Economic bohemus in the world are buying up all the supply and creating a false supply demand matrix You see what I'm saying So like do we have a lot of issues that people are sleeping on because they're divided over these bullshit Low-level issues like racism. Oh, we're your fucking racist. So you're a you're a Democrat You're a Republican you love Trump you love Biden fuck you You're gay you're straight like all this shit outside the like The pedophile stuff that's being normalized is is all Shit that like we need to get over and start working together on so that we can identify who's actually making our life hard Because it's not your neighbor. It's not the white guy walking down the street or the black guy walking down the street Or the gay person trying to live there a lot. It's not dude. That's not who it is It's these corrupt officials colluding with the media matrix creating a System that propagates division through identity politics that gets us distracted and then takes all of our shit That's what we're dealing with here and it's wrong and we have to get smarter and Cory Bush and Joy-read and this fanny willis and all these people they know the game they're playing They go into their communities every two years to say vote for me because I look like you That's not enough anymore bro. That can't be enough. That cannot be enough And it's great to see the culture shifting to where people are realizing that you got stoop dog realizing that You got you know a bunch of the other influencers in the black community saying that you got people are starting to wake up and it's gonna trickle down And we're gonna have a decision to make like how much are we gonna tolerate of these people anymore? Fuck these people how much longer? I'm gonna tell you this is my here's my stance. Fuck them That's my stance. Yeah guys, let us know down in the comments what you guys think With that being said, I wanted to bring this up here It's under the just leaving this here, but I would actually like to hear your thoughts on this I think it's very very interesting. We also covered on the last show. We talked about how You know, we we we supply our enemies financially with the means to harm us to then justify Action on them. Yes, which then stimulates the Military industrial complex matrix that makes all these people in the government rich And then sends our strongest most resistant men to war to die and removes the likelihood of them losing control over the population. They've done this for for a hundred over over a hundred years Right, okay, World War One World War Two Vietnam Korea Desert Storm all of these things were about money and they were about getting rid of the strongest men in these countries And it's not just in America. It's not just you. Yes, they this is why when you go to Europe and no offense to you guys in Europe I know we have a lot of listeners in Europe, but this is why the men are much smaller Okay, and they're much they're much more frail and they're little men because all the big men and all the warriors Were their dad those people were killed and were all these wars Okay, yeah, like now you go to some of these European countries like where you're from in Bosnia or Ukraine now And they're fucking aren't even any men because they've all been fucking killed, bro So like This is real thing. Yes, it's people you're not think on that level these people Think we're in power How do we remove the people who are likely to revolt from Are Being a threat for us and and they're their their responses. Oh, we could get them into a war And then we can make a bunch of money too while we're at it and we have to quit being so stupid Yeah, yeah, I mean and so just leaving this here. Let's connect some dots here This headline reads corn pop admin sent millions to Hamas linked you in rwa after October 7 attacks Before halting funding This administration sent millions of dollars To the terrorists to mosque linked organization after October 7 attacks After after now How many how many millions are we talking right? Oh, it says right here. I think I mean I'm a little older than you I think I can make out a 51 million dollars, right. That's just a one deal though That was does it before oh, I'm glad you asked yeah From 2009 to 2024 a little under four billion dollars of your money of our money It says taxpayer dollars. That's your money was given to you in all that time that you worked all those hours All that shit that you did all those years that you were working All that four billion of that of your effort your blood sweat and tears went to these fuckers Now and that's that's that's the same for the hundred billion that's gone to Ukraine And and it's been going on for decades, dude When are we in the u.s going to finally realize that we are the fucking slaves of the entire military complex of not just this country, but the global Iron fist right like when there's a problem globally who goes and fucking doesn't you know I'm supposed to go for freedom and democracy And that's not true To on the inside of this country just like the people of North Korea are lied to it's really not that much different Okay, they're just allowed to go other places and and we're just allowed to go other places and they aren't yeah, so When you think about and you see this crazy shit Think about all those hours you put in think about all that time you put in think about all those jobs you work Think about all those early early mornings and late nights and things that you had to miss to what and what it went to pay for Because not a single fucking dollar of this country's money from its taxpayer should be going to shit like that ever Should never should never be leaving this country until this country is a motherfucking utopia. No Now four billion until this whole country looks like fucking Dubai And every single person listening to this is able to afford a great life We should not be sending a single fucking dollar anywhere Yeah, how can how can someone disagree with that How could anyone disagree with that you can't how could know they do because these clips go viral on the internet Well, we got to save the homeless people hold on my the fuck you how can you disagree with that you can how can you fucking say That a single dollar that you bled for that you sweated for that you got up early for that you worked late for that You miss your kids game for Should be sent overseas for any reason at all When we have the problems that we have here in this country When our country looks like a fucking ghetto in most of the big cities And then we have places like Dubai where they don't pay shit in taxes and it looks like the it's it's fucking amazing Okay, it's zero crime Until our country looks like that We have no business sending a single dollar to anything outside the borders of this country How can that not be the thought of every single one of you that works for a living in contributes your money to the tax system How can that I don't you know what I'm saying? I'll do it Like we have to start putting America first for real and not just saying it. Hey, I'm America first I'm talking about legit Changing everything about this country so that we could fucking make it into a place where we take care of our own people and it becomes the amazing free fertile ground for a successful fruitful fulfilling existence that we all want you know until that is the way it is We have zero fucking business sending our dollars anywhere. That's the thing and bro How can anyone disagree with that? That's the thing. It's not it's America first. Not America only they only get our shit together first Okay, they only disagree if they don't pay into the tax system Yeah, which is why people who don't pay into the tax system shouldn't be allowed to fucking vote I guarantee you bro if they if they put all of our foreign aid efforts right if they put those that shit out to a poll Right now if all Americans were pulled Like would you want to continue to support this cause or not Majority are gonna say no and whatever the point if they say yes, all right cool. No, dude They're not even doing they're not even They're not asking a shit. They're no they don't care. No, they don't care Do we have a tyrannical government that is completely detached from the interest of the American people that is a fact man, that is a fact and it's not just one or two people It's a it's the whole entire fucking system and the way it is right now These people are selfish. They lie to our faces. They take our money They miss you's it and they figure out a funnel it back into their own fucking pockets That's the thing dude because you got people like Cory Bush right like she'll go up there She'll vote on that bill But then at the same time we'll go and tell you that oh, I'm representing my constituents in St. Louis St Louis thing got shit to do with my terrorist organizations Thousands of miles away. Yeah, it's not representing us and bro Let's drive through St. Louis with Cory Bush and let's have this conversation that we're having right now about how much like to do How can you represent this neighborhood when this neighborhood looks like this? But you're out here supporting these things over here in some other country The you think these people that are dude you and I we've driven through the neighborhoods You're from the fucking worst part of this what we're talking about here like you grew up there There's these guys are out on the co-solent They're not trying dude It's like like and that's the problem like a lot of people from the outside who have never been in one of these areas St. Louis has one of the poorest Black community areas and in the whole country, okay? It's crime-ridden It's it's all black people for the most part And if you go through it It's like people from the outside will say oh those people are just lazy no, they're fucking not Because if you drive through it, they're out on the fucking corner trying to sell shit that they put together Like barbecue pits or we do like they're doing what they can to get by bro And it's a hopeless situation for a lot of the people and then you throw the crime on top of it And then these people have the nerve to go to wash and DC and instead of representing those people continue to steal their money That is fucking wrong bro Fuck that man. That's what you guys think Let us know down in the comments that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads Farmer CIA officers sentenced to 40 years for largest data leak in agencies history heinous crimes Stiving to this a former CIA software engineer has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for the largest data breach in the agency's history Joshua Schultz E 35 was sentenced and a man hat in federal court on Thursday according to a press release from the US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York His crimes included espionage computer hacking contempt of court making false statements to the FBI and child pornography Shultz E leaked huge amounts of stolen information to wiki leats In what federal prosecutors called quote one of the largest unauthorized disclosures of classified information in the history of the United States Wiki leats began publishing the classified data from the stolen CIA files in March 2017 Which Shultz E transmitted from his home computer in 2016 the US Attorney office for the Southern District of New York states Prosecutors said Shultz E quote wiped and reformatted his home computers internal hard drives after the transmission Quote Joshua Schultz E betrayed his country by committing some of the most brazen heinous crimes of espionage and US in American history US Attorney Damian Williams said in the release quote He caused untold damage to our national security in this quest for revenge against the CIA force response to Shultz E security breaches while employed there Quote we will likely never know the full extent of the damage, but I have no doubt it was massive judge Jesse M. Firman said as he announced Shultz E sentence according to the associated press Per the outlet the leak revealed that the CIA hacked smart phones and overseas spying operations along with their efforts to turn internet connected televisions into listening devices Uh Shultz E sentencing came after convictions at trials that concluded in 2020 2022 and 2023 Um he was convicted of possessing child pornography in that uh in the trial that ended last September Um which is I personally think it's kind of weird potentially maybe even BS. I don't know. It just doesn't make sense to me You know, but um who knows um wait wait wait So you're telling me That a guy Who was a technological intelligent asset for the CIA who had access to all these operations. Yep You're telling me that this guy who Released all this data the largest in history all right and and who's Accused of being a spy for whom who is he spying for did they say won't say okay? So because he released what they deemed to be classified data meaning the truth To the American people to the American people he is now a spy And you're telling me that this guy who had all this access to all this information Was so fucking stupid that he had child pornography on his computer Hmm the child became years after they incident happened wow that you know That sort of sounds like what they do to people when people step out of line Do you think that the CIA has the ability to insert such things onto someone's computer and then say look what they got on their computer I don't put it past them. Hmm. I don't put it past them I mean, I mean you would have to be a pretty big dumbass how how did I hold on how did that go on? How did that happen if he if he formatted and wiped all of his hard drives Did they say that yeah? Okay, so so you're telling me where's it hold on hold on hold on hold on Prolight did formatted his home computers internal hard drives after transmission of classified data So then so after he did it then he uploaded So this fucking guy Does that make sense this guy deleted all the classified shit that he did but then kept the child porn on his computer No, no, he wiped it and then we uploaded it. Oh got it for a personal satisfaction. That makes more sense. Of course it makes sense. Don't question it Bro What the fuck Yeah, I William says now that now we all know what we think that people who mess with kids shit We all agree no doubt we those people deserve death. Yeah, okay. They deserve the woodchipper feet first extra slow on TV Pay-per-view Money go into the victims when thousand percent Forsella 2028 that's my fucking pitch, okay, so nobody believes that more than me But I do find it a little bit weird That a guy who is is with the CIA Who's exposing all this information who wiped his data of classified all the sudden no thinks that And by the way, let's keep in mind. He knows what he's doing He knows that he's in deep shit with the CIA and then he puts child porn on his computer. Why would you delete that shit? You know, I'm saying like Hmm Sounds a little weird to me bro And this is why you don't have People who know what the fuck is going on saying shit They blackmail and threaten their own mother fucking employees. This is they're making an example of this man So that no one else steps out and fucking says that what's going on? Yeah That's fucked up. It's fucked. It's fucked. Oh, the good there's good people in the agencies for sure Okay, but you guys better start standing the fuck up. This is absurd shit. This is absurd shit. You guys got it. You guys got to figure it out, man He was a spy for the American people. Yeah That's the first of all. Why is any information classified if we're paying for this we're Arm we're paying for the CIA our money funds this shit. Yes So we're paying for them to lie to us about what the fuck is actually going on. How does that make sense? Bro, we got to start connecting the dots here as a community let that sink in And I'm not the trade so we pay them They get to decide what we get to see or not see and then When we point out what is the truth It puts you in jail to your 75 years old and then stall some fucked up shit on your computer So that when you go to jail all the fucking all the homies fuck you up Because that's what they do to child predators and they do So this fucking guy is gonna go to fucking jail as a quote unquote now If he really is oh, yeah, if we're chaper bro. Yeah, he can be fucking candidate number one Appreciate the leak though. Yeah, do appreciate the leak But I would I would for in this scenario. I would have to hear the whole story here because this This isn't adding up for me man Doesn't it just doesn't make sense It does not make sense That's not make sense guys tell us what you guys think I just went down in the comments and Yeah, man, that makes sense But uh with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumbest fuck and speaking of spianosh Thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads flight risk suspected spy pigeon released after eight months in detention in India What They arrested a pigeon they fucking locked up a pigeon bro.
