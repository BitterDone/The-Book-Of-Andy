What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about it lies the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today we have a real talk alright and I'm gonna try to do these more regularly because I think they're important and I think you guys like them I'm gonna get right into it okay I'm gonna spare you the normal long intro we're gonna get right into this you know I was thinking about what kind of value I could provide for you guys and what I wanted to talk about and the idea was floated to me of one of the top three things I wish I knew before starting on my entrepreneurship journey and I'm gonna cover that with you guys today because entrepreneurship has become this glorified solution to everybody's life and everybody wants to be an entrepreneur and everybody's talking about entrepreneurship and there's just some things that you should know and I think the first one is this if you decide to be an entrepreneur and I'm talking about a real entrepreneur and I'm not talking about one of these people on Instagram's that pretends to be an entrepreneur and puts it in their fucking bio I'm talking about building a real company with real people and creating a solution to a problem for a consumer and making money doing so the first thing that you have to understand is that you are picking literally one of the hardest paths that you could possibly pick over the course of one's life all right statistics show that less than 8% of people become entrepreneurs and less than 1% of those people become quote unquote successful entrepreneurs all right but here's the thing aside from those statistics it's still possible but you should know what to expect and what you can expect is a life of waking up and getting your fucking ass beat day after day after day after day and having some wins in between that's the reality of entrepreneurship it is not this shit that we see on the internet it is not always nice cars and fat watches and that's not what the fucking is bro entrepreneurship is a lot of loneliness a lot of getting your ass beat a lot of questioning yourself a lot of doubt a lot of pain a lot of mistakes a lot of expensive mistakes all your friends and family telling you that you're crazy everybody you've ever known telling you need to grow up and get realistic until you actually build something and then they're like holy shit I always believed in you and they didn't okay you're gonna move from friend group to friend group to friend group to friend group over the course of your life because every time you level up the current friend group is gonna take it personal and they're gonna say you're forgetting about us remember where you came from you're too good for us now and and bro that's gonna happen over and over again okay like you're gonna live a very different kind of life than literally every one of your friends all of your friends are gonna be able to go out on the weekends go to parties go on vacations and do all this shit travel the world in the van or whatever is popular now okay and you can't understand because you're at the beginning of the journey that those very people that say all those things to you and live this different life that you're having like massive uh a photo about are gonna pay a price later when they're working at fucking this local cell phone store because they have to because they have to because they have to provide for themselves all right a lot of these people in the beginning that are doubting you talking shit you know laughing at you making fun of you saying all this shit that pisses you off these people in fifteen or twenty years are gonna be working a fucking KFC bro taking your mother fucking order okay that's the price they're gonna pay you're paying a different price you're paying a price of paying frustration investment of time and energy skipping out on other things that you could be doing with your life and eventually the price the reward that you get back is you don't have to worry about things other people have to worry about that doesn't mean you'll have a carefree life it doesn't mean life's gonna be easy it doesn't mean things are just gonna come to you it doesn't mean that you know you're gonna have freedom bro you never have freedom and that's gonna lead into my second point okay but here's the point it's hardest fuck and it takes a long time and nobody's gonna understand you and you're gonna feel alone most of the time but if you keep going it's possible okay and if you keep going for long enough it's probable but the ultimate thing I need you to understand is this it is not what the internet makes it out to be it is not free it is not easy it is not for everybody and it quite honestly is the opposite and anybody who has built anything real and real life will tell you this all of them they will say bro it's the hardest fucking thing I ever did the hardest fucking thing you ever did that's what that's what you should expect instead of wishing and wanting and hoping and complaining about how hard it is you should recognize this on day one because I'm telling you dude I've been doing this now for 25 years that's the way it is and anybody else that tells you anything else is full of shit and I'd be happy to have them sit here and debate me on it okay and I'll I'll end them all right reality it's hard so what's the best thing that you could do as a young entrepreneur it's to accept this okay and the reason that you need to accept that it's going to be hard is because if you think that it's going to be easy you're going to constantly feel extra frustrated and victimized by the circumstances in your life if you assume that it's going to be easy you're going to spend your life saying why is it so hard for me and that's the problem of what's going on in the internet we have a lot of fake motherfuckers presenting themselves as experts telling you how easy and quick and fast this journey is and you get out there on the playing field you can your ass kick you can't figure out why and eventually you blame yourself and say I just don't have what it takes and that's what I'm trying to get you to avoid it's not that you don't have what it takes is that the expectations were wrong from the beginning okay so understand this it's hard the second thing to understand about point one is this what's the best thing you can do if you know that you're on a hard journey well it's to prepare yourself for a hard journey you wouldn't go on a hundred day hike through the forest with no fucking supplies and no training and no understanding of what the fuck you needed to do would you that would be stupid it would also be stupid to go on to this incredibly hard journey and not understanding that you have to do things to make yourself capable of enduring this journey and that comes into things like live hard and 75 hard where you're getting your mind right you're getting your body right this is your weapons these these are your tools your mind your heart your soul your body get those to the highest possible level that you can have now I'm not saying you have to go out here and be David Goggins I'm not trying to be David Goggins a lot of you guys say to me what are you trying to do be James Lawrence or no motherfucker I'm trying to be the best me so I can do what my main priority is which is to grow and be successful in business and life that's the goal you should look at your situation the same you don't have to go out and run a hundred fucking miles bro but you got to have your mind right and be focused on the right shit putting the right shit in your brain all the time you've got to be physically capable meaning you have to have high confidence you have to be fit you have to carry yourself well all of these things are skill sets you know confidence self esteem self belief the ability to to endure fortitude grit mental toughness discipline our skills that are required for this journey so if you are going to go on this journey wouldn't it make sense for you to sharpen those skills first I think it would okay and I don't think it would I know it would okay so stop thinking it's gonna be easy understand it's gonna be hard understand that's the reality and then build yourself into someone who can tolerate that journey that's point number one I wish I would have known that on day one it would have saved me a lot of frustration a lot of time a lot of anger a lot of bitterness and I probably would have gotten a lot further in a lot faster time frame had I understand that now point number two okay I talked about freedom in the first point this shit ain't about you and guess what and ain't ever gonna be about you because in order for you to succeed what you have to understand is that you have to serve other human beings whether they be your customer or whether they be your employees you as the leader have to contribute to them in different but absolutely certain ways when it comes to your customer it's not about getting what they're going to give you it's about what can you give and what do they decide that's worth and are willing to give you in return okay so your question should be not how much money can I take but how much value can I provide and if I can provide exponentially more value I will make exponentially more money that means it's not about what you can get it's not about you it's about them all the time okay a lot of people like to say well I'm free on my own boss I'm gonna fuck you hate the boss of shit your customers are the fucking boss and that's reality okay so this whole idea that it's about you and it's about this and it's about that lose that shit I spent a decade of my business life believing that I could sell shit and take money and the most amount of money from people and I was somehow making I didn't even figure this out until I was at least 10 or 11 years into business when I finally figured out what I loved about our business and what I loved about our business was I loved when someone would come in who was very unfit very unhappy and over the course of six or seven months they would become a new person and they would come back in the store and they would give you a hug and they would be crying shit and they be thanking you and at my lowest of lows in business where I had to assume that I would never make any money in business I had to really think about what I wanted to do if money wasn't an option I fucking love that I loved helping people get better okay I loved it and so I flipped my perspective from hey I'm gonna take money from these people and I went into this perspective of hey I'm just gonna try to replicate this level of result every single time with every single customer you know what happened a company grew a hundred percent you know what happened for the last for the next five years after that we grew a hundred percent every fucking year you know why because I stopped focusing on me I started focusing what I could do for other people the same goes for your employees once you get to a point where you have employees the intent of having employees should be that I give a fuck about that employee I care about their career I care about where they're going and yes I'm going to be hard but I'm gonna also be their friend and real friends give a fuck about those people's futures and once your employees start to understand that they start to perform okay so it's not hey motherfucker you work for me do this shit so I can make money it's hey man you fucking are holding the line on yourself you aren't doing what you need to do to be great and if you did these things you'd be great and guess what happens when they have that respect and they have the understanding that you are trustworthy as an entrepreneur as a leader and they believe that you have their interests in mind not because you made them believe you have their interests in mind but because you actually do what do you think happens oh you create a tremendous team culture where people want to win and people are motivated and people want to build shit and it becomes amazing but it's still ain't about you it's about them okay this will never be about you this will never if you want to be a successful entrepreneur this will never ever be about you there's a famous saying that Stuart Scott the deceased ESPN announcer said one time and I'll never forget I was watching a sports center and he said this he said great leaders take responsibility and give the credit okay never make it about you you know what your reward is bro your reward is you get to make some money your reward is you get to you get the public praise but you have to remember it ain't really you it's them okay it's them and then beyond them your employees it's them the customers who built you it's not you okay it'll never be about you your reward is the financial gain and the success and your job is to make it about everybody else and if you make it about everybody else and you focus on everybody else you will never have a problem making fucking money in business that's reality okay so that's the second thing I wish I would have known because had I changed my perspective from it's about them not about me before 10 years in business I would be 10 years ahead of where I am right now so that's a 10 year lesson make it about them focus on what you can provide do what you can and make their lives better how can you over deliver with your product how can you over deliver with your leadership how can you make your employees better humans how can you do everything to contribute to everybody around you and make them fucking win how can you do that and if you do that to the best of your abilities you will be rewarded okay and that cost me 11 years to learn that lesson that's a multi million billion dollar lesson depending on how far you want to go with all right important number three is this shit takes time okay I have this concept called aggressive patience that I've talked about for years and years and years people hear certain personalities talk about patience when it comes to entrepreneurship when we have all these different we have all these different people saying different things when people hear patients typically what do they think they think wait okay and they think wait around and eventually it'll happen and this is why most people fail in life they think that when they turn 30 the finances are going to turn on or when they get to be 35 the finances are going to turn on and it never happens it doesn't happen because you're missing the aggressive part all right what you have to understand is yes it takes time yes it takes a lot of time and during that time do you know what you should be doing every single day every mother fucking thing that you can fucking do on that day to win then on the next day every single thing you can do and then on the next day every thing you can do all day long aggressive patience has nothing to do with sitting on your hands and has everything to do with doing everything you can and still understanding that it's going to take a long time that's what patience means in business and you should be impatient you should take impatient action on a day by day basis but you should understand for the sense of your own sanity that is still going to take time no matter what you want no matter how fast you want it you it's no different than a recipe on a fucking cake bro okay if you do not allow time to do its part nothing will happen okay you could get the best recipe in the entire world from the most famous baker and you could take all the ingredients and you could mix them up in a bowl all right and you say I got the best recipe and and then you pour it in the cake pan and then you say well fuck dude the recipe calls for 400 degrees for 45 minutes and you say why won't this and I want this in 20 minutes so what do you do you turn the fucking heat up and the oven 800 degrees and you cook for 20 minutes what the fuck you got now you got a burnt piece of shit okay nobody's eating that shit it's fucking disgusting and then half of you have the nerve to blame the person that gave you the fucking recipe okay the reality is the reason it calls for 45 minutes because that's the fucking takes it takes time and it takes a long time okay and you can't out for a little time you can't there's nothing you can do there's not now what you can do as you can do everything you can day by day by day by day by day you can be aggressive on a daily basis and still exercise patience over the long term I didn't know this when I first started I thought like a lot of you guys think that eventually my life would just materialize into a materialize into a success story because I was doing it that's not true you have to in the patient time over the course of time if you're not executing aggressively the result never happens okay so let me break this down summarize for you okay first thing entrepreneurship is the hardest motherfucking thing you could do if it's not the hardest it's one of the hardest all right it's hard it's hardest fuck take the time to become someone who is capable and equipped of going on a difficult journey for a long period of time build your mind build your heart build your body build your resilience and become someone that can tolerate that that's the first thing the second thing is the quicker you can understand it's not about you and it's about service it's about everybody else the more successful the more money you're gonna make quicker all right so don't waste time thinking you're gonna scam people don't waste time thinking you're gonna trick people people with fucking smart take the time to figure out how I'm going to over deliver how I'm going to create so much value and I'm going to create so much value for my customers and so much for my employees that they love to do and be customers of and support and work for and build what it is you're building okay it's about them it's never about you and the third thing is aggressive patience it doesn't matter how hard you work time is still going to exist it's still going to be a component of success you cannot cheat your way around it all these people online they're telling you they could save you this or that yes there's value in learning from someone who has legitimately been on the path that you're on and has done the things that you do if I were to talk to 19 year old Andy now 19 year old Andy would say 15 years off this journey by learning from 44 year old Andy okay but I could promise you these knuckle fucks on the internet who post these reels all day long talking all this shit cannot do that for you so understand this all right you have to realize that this is going to be hard you have to act with urgency you have to act with impatience on a daily basis and still recognize that it's going to take a long time okay aggressive patience if you can get those three things in on day one bro you're in a much better spot than I was all right so go out there kicks a fucking ass take these things to heart listen to this a few times let this sink in it'll save you a lot of time a lot of money a lot of frustration and greatly increase the chances of you getting to where you want to go close
