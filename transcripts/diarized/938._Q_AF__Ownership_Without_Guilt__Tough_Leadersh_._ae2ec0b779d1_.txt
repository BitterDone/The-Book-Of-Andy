[0:00:00 - 0:00:06] SPEAKER_00: You as a leader in a manager need to understand that when your team Understands that someone's fucking off and you don't handle it.
[0:00:00 - 0:00:21] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, who loves what he does and loves this this whole thing and the content that we make is going to be very Cape Cod ish feeling all right premium You know the northeastern feel

[0:00:22 - 0:00:28] SPEAKER_03: And then what we're going to do is we're going to create an amazing social strategy that's going to tell this amazing story.
[0:00:24 - 0:00:27] SPEAKER_03: I don't know why he would do that.
[0:00:24 - 0:00:39] SPEAKER_03: If I knew that answer to get a hundred percent compliance, I'd be worth a trillion dollars Look, you know, here's the reality of being successful in life
[0:00:26 - 0:00:29] SPEAKER_03: Guys, today we have Q&AF.
[0:00:26 - 0:00:29] SPEAKER_03: And I actually had a black eye at the time.
[0:00:34 - 0:00:37] SPEAKER_03: Marty's Marty's gourmet seafood.
[0:00:37 - 0:00:39] SPEAKER_03: Um, just the added pressure, right?
[0:00:40 - 0:00:46] SPEAKER_04: if you are going to be successful, leadership is a required skill.
[0:00:46 - 0:00:51] SPEAKER_04: Big way, guys, is you can click that link in the description and submit your questions for live call-ins.
[0:00:53 - 0:01:00] SPEAKER_03: What are you training that person to believe about their job there and also their job anywhere?
[0:00:54 - 0:00:55] SPEAKER_03: That's awesome, bro.
[0:01:04 - 0:01:07] SPEAKER_03: Let's see throughout the week.
[0:01:04 - 0:01:19] SPEAKER_03: will start to create an operation where you can sell to individuals wealthy, high class, high demand, high standard individuals at a high price point throughout the country.
[0:01:05 - 0:01:07] SPEAKER_03: A week ago at this point.
[0:01:08 - 0:01:25] SPEAKER_03: aware that this is a different skill and it's one that you need to pay attention to is a huge deal because a lot of people think that leadership is just like a promotion or you get a title and you just show up and continue to do the same thing when in reality it's a completely different thing.
[0:01:15 - 0:01:25] SPEAKER_03: Uh, in the past couple of years, she's taken, uh, like a, a one 80, uh, she got divorced, bought a house and then got remarried and she's in nursing school right now.
[0:01:17 - 0:01:20] SPEAKER_03: that it's okay to do these things and there won't be any repercussions.
[0:01:28 - 0:01:34] SPEAKER_03: Most of the reason that most people can't scale their business is because they don't make enough margin and they race to the bottom.
[0:01:32 - 0:01:33] SPEAKER_03: Sir, I appreciate that.
[0:01:33 - 0:01:42] SPEAKER_03: Then we have 75 hard versus we just had an awesome 75 hard versus if you didn't get to check that out of 75 hard versus Lexi Johnson.
[0:01:34 - 0:01:39] SPEAKER_03: And so, you know, that's something that no one talks about or believes.
[0:01:38 - 0:01:42] SPEAKER_03: and you are going to have some fall off.
[0:01:45 - 0:01:52] SPEAKER_03: And my question is, is I'm going to be getting a loan from my father-in-law for the business.
[0:01:47 - 0:01:56] SPEAKER_03: So this is basically what I would do with, you know, with Marty's gourmet seafood.
[0:01:52 - 0:01:53] SPEAKER_03: So what should you do?
[0:01:56 - 0:02:07] SPEAKER_03: If you're unfamiliar with 75 Hard is the initial phase of the Live Hard program, which is the world's most popular mental toughness program ever created.
[0:01:57 - 0:01:58] SPEAKER_03: Go out there and do it, bro.
[0:02:00 - 0:02:23] SPEAKER_03: But you shouldn't allow them to exceed it because your shit should be so high So the first thing is, you know, you got to live the standard which the fact that you asked I'm worried that they don't have the same level of commitment To personal excellence that I do, you know that shows me that you're you're probably already living a pretty high standard the second thing that you have to do is you have to realize that
[0:02:05 - 0:02:10] SPEAKER_03: from my father-in-law to me it feels like almost like a hand out, not a hand up.
[0:02:07 - 0:02:09] SPEAKER_03: All right.
[0:02:10 - 0:02:13] SPEAKER_03: that you're allowing her to fucking get away with special shit.
[0:02:13 - 0:02:18] SPEAKER_03: Get the whole program for free, episode 208 on the audio feed only.
[0:02:13 - 0:02:37] SPEAKER_03: keep the retail to where it is and then what happens is dude is the retail will eventually become this like this landmark where people who come to long island they gotta go to marty's because because this is where i get all my fish for my program or for my parties and my events and i and i gotta meet jake dude you see what i'm saying like
[0:02:17 - 0:02:19] SPEAKER_03: Okay, this is very easy.
[0:02:23 - 0:02:27] SPEAKER_03: Leadership is not just about the job at hand.
[0:02:35 - 0:02:53] SPEAKER_03: not working there you know like I would I would have already decide personally when I walk in the room that I might walk out of the room and not work here anymore but I'm gonna say what I think I'm gonna say the truth and hopefully they respect it and if they don't then I'm gonna move on to something different that
[0:02:37 - 0:02:44] SPEAKER_03: This is how I would scale that business out in a very general way.
[0:02:37 - 0:02:42] SPEAKER_03: What matters is, is are you good at transferring that skill into your people and helping them develop?
[0:02:41 - 0:02:51] SPEAKER_03: But have the intention, which I can tell you already do, of not just paying the loan back, but also making it a strong financial investment for him.
[0:02:43 - 0:02:44] SPEAKER_03: Get the book.
[0:02:50 - 0:03:02] SPEAKER_03: Basically set a standard inside the workplace and then let that standard be and then never really Teach them or coach them or make them understand
[0:02:54 - 0:02:58] SPEAKER_03: is more representative of a place that I believe in and wanna work at.
[0:02:59 - 0:03:02] SPEAKER_03: And yeah, that's the goal.
[0:03:02 - 0:03:06] SPEAKER_03: And Bailey, the truth is, man, a lot of people do not understand.
[0:03:05 - 0:03:07] SPEAKER_03: And it sounds like you understand the business.
[0:03:05 - 0:03:07] SPEAKER_03: You know, as an entrepreneur, you gotta do it every day.
[0:03:07 - 0:03:09] SPEAKER_03: Do us a favor and don't be a ho.
[0:03:14 - 0:03:24] SPEAKER_03: I understand that that's tough for people, but if they never learn the skill of confrontation or standing up for themselves, then you're gonna get walked on your whole life.
[0:03:21 - 0:03:21] SPEAKER_04: It's been hot.
[0:03:26 - 0:03:31] SPEAKER_04: it's very hard for them to understand that they can also have those things.
[0:03:29 - 0:03:49] SPEAKER_04: That's that's that's how I've always done shit and while it's cost me money and you know, it's not really it's an investment in the right thing and when you do good things good things come back and Exactly, you know, I believe that I I've seen it a hundred percent a hundred percent, you know, I always tell people I'm like, oh I
[0:03:30 - 0:03:35] SPEAKER_04: Um, so right now I have, uh, we're getting contracts and everything, um, written out.
[0:03:33 - 0:03:52] SPEAKER_04: Nuance, you know cutting someone slack versus teaching them a lesson that they need to fucking learn or it's going to cost them later You know, um, I used to be someone who protected my people meaning like I would they would make a mistake and I would say I would kind of stand in the way of Of them what I realized is dude.
[0:03:34 - 0:03:58] SPEAKER_04: is to make sure that one, you're holding the standard, two, you're setting the standard for the job, three, you are becoming their personal mentor in terms of how you're going to help them improve in all of their areas, and the fourth one is that you have to get them to care about improving, and that's the tricky part.
[0:03:41 - 0:03:46] SPEAKER_03: And I'm going to invest in that right now by handling this situation the best way.
[0:03:43 - 0:03:44] SPEAKER_03: Do you say food ball?
[0:03:49 - 0:03:55] SPEAKER_03: Give the homeless guy $5, tip the guy at the gas station pumping your gas a couple bucks, buy somebody coffee and donuts.
[0:03:59 - 0:04:04] SPEAKER_04: because he's one of those guys that I just got the contract from the lawyer and everything.
[0:04:01 - 0:04:08] SPEAKER_04: Results of their actions affect them so they felt that pain and didn't allow it to happen again.
[0:04:02 - 0:04:09] SPEAKER_04: on a consistent basis when you get your team is to sit down and paint out the big mission.
[0:04:09 - 0:04:19] SPEAKER_04: a thousand percent and people with bad karma will look at that guy on the fucking corner and they'll say You just gave that guy a hundred bucks and he's just gonna go drink with it.
[0:04:10 - 0:04:16] SPEAKER_04: that is not bias to either way is some of the most valuable shit that you can have inside of a company.
[0:04:11 - 0:04:18] SPEAKER_04: And yesterday, I caught two cramps in my quads on the first play.
[0:04:26 - 0:04:38] SPEAKER_04: you know, it's hard because, you know, 90% of the time people value very heavily that you care about them.
[0:04:26 - 0:04:56] SPEAKER_04: Then you have to make good on those on those situations when they earn them so doing those things bro, you'd be surprised at who will step up and Want to be led and want to be coached a lot of people have never had anybody taken interest in them at all not at home not in school not at their job never and so when we have people who Sort of you know, I have this saying
[0:04:29 - 0:04:33] SPEAKER_04: I'm going to take the salary I take now, which isn't great.
[0:04:30 - 0:04:34] SPEAKER_04: they're not valuable because they take contrarian viewpoints no matter what.
[0:04:33 - 0:04:35] SPEAKER_04: Once he saw you running.
[0:04:38 - 0:04:39] SPEAKER_04: Let's fucking do this together.
[0:04:53 - 0:05:02] SPEAKER_04: Um, in terms of like, you know, it's a couple hundred thousand dollars, but I really think that just grinding it out for a couple of years, I can pay back that loan in full.
[0:04:53 - 0:04:54] SPEAKER_04: And you've just got to deal with that.
[0:04:55 - 0:05:14] SPEAKER_04: and the most valuable people in my organizations are those people the people who come to me and they say hey here's what's going on and it's the truth and the facts and then if they want to be even more valuable you know what you know what happens they come to me and they say here's what's going on here's how i handled it
[0:04:57 - 0:05:03] SPEAKER_04: that you gotta be brave enough to go after what you really want and you gotta be strong enough to pull people with you.
[0:04:59 - 0:05:01] SPEAKER_04: I'll do the junior high game.
[0:05:06 - 0:05:08] SPEAKER_04: Hey, look, dude, you're in a good spot.
[0:05:08 - 0:05:09] SPEAKER_04: Your product or is it walking?
[0:05:10 - 0:05:12] SPEAKER_04: I think leading people is the hardest fucking job.
[0:05:15 - 0:05:17] SPEAKER_04: and I don't even have to fucking touch it.
[0:05:22 - 0:05:28] SPEAKER_04: But the truth of the matter is, man, is that we're all human, we're all capable, and what one man can do, another can do.
[0:05:24 - 0:05:32] SPEAKER_04: Um, that I look at the seafood, the frozen seafood selection in, you know, supermarkets and things like that are pretty trash.
[0:05:26 - 0:05:28] SPEAKER_04: It's been fun, but yeah, I caught two fucking cramps on the first play, man.
[0:05:28 - 0:05:34] SPEAKER_04: And so to be an effective leader, you have to embody these things that we just laid out.
[0:05:30 - 0:05:46] SPEAKER_04: Yep, so then you can go to the you know the you could start with the high-end groceries, and then you can go to the You know you can go to the big chains that and then and then the box and you can you can scale this out But here's the thing I want you to remember
[0:05:30 - 0:05:38] SPEAKER_04: to all the guys out there and girls out there, you know, moving into a leadership position, I would take the responsibility seriously.
[0:05:38 - 0:05:39] SPEAKER_04: Here's what's going on.
[0:05:46 - 0:05:52] SPEAKER_03: Because a few years from now, when this is a real conversation, this is what the fuck they're gonna tell you.
[0:05:48 - 0:05:50] SPEAKER_03: And it's not just about them, dude.
[0:05:51 - 0:05:55] SPEAKER_03: in supermarkets, Walmart, BJ's, Costco, things like that.
[0:05:54 - 0:05:56] SPEAKER_03: It would be for this amazing form energy.
[0:05:57 - 0:06:15] SPEAKER_03: When you get rid of the people who won't buy in and you bring new people in, the culture will vet those people, but your team, your winners, your ass kickers, they get this new guy in and within, you know, two weeks they're going to know if this guy is going to fit or not.
[0:06:05 - 0:06:14] SPEAKER_03: Is not effort or hard work or even skill set, but it's their inability to communicate honestly and directly.
[0:06:06 - 0:06:11] SPEAKER_03: shelves and stuff like that, that I can do different products and that would be the ultimate goal.
[0:06:08 - 0:06:09] SPEAKER_03: Look at you.
[0:06:14 - 0:06:15] SPEAKER_03: Definitely beautiful.
[0:06:18 - 0:06:20] SPEAKER_03: They're like, how do you get all these people to care and do?
[0:06:18 - 0:06:20] SPEAKER_03: Oh, it's a hundred percent helpful, Annie.
[0:06:18 - 0:06:22] SPEAKER_03: And yeah, man, I mean, that's pretty much it, dude.
[0:06:23 - 0:06:30] SPEAKER_03: of in regards to telling the leader something that's going to benefit the overall mission.
[0:06:24 - 0:06:37] SPEAKER_03: And I'm going to get the engine gutted out and have a metal fabricator come and we're going to install a metal bin inside the boat that I can bring to beaches, parties, people's mansions over here.
[0:06:36 - 0:06:38] SPEAKER_03: You know, I scored a bunch of touchdowns, so I'm a leader.
[0:06:41 - 0:06:44] SPEAKER_06: And that is fucking good, bro.
[0:06:45 - 0:06:49] SPEAKER_04: uh, put clams on it, oysters, king crab, lobster, and things like that.
[0:06:45 - 0:06:48] SPEAKER_04: Brother, there's nothing that I have that you don't fucking have.
[0:06:47 - 0:06:48] SPEAKER_04: Let's get out there.
[0:06:53 - 0:07:01] SPEAKER_03: In my career of 26 years, I have probably 10 people that I would say have developed that skill set.
[0:07:03 - 0:07:07] SPEAKER_03: It's far less to do with the title and far more to do with your behavior.
[0:07:08 - 0:07:09] SPEAKER_04: Case will be stolen, too.
[0:07:12 - 0:07:16] SPEAKER_03: That right there, you got a young dude who sees an opportunity.
[0:07:13 - 0:07:18] SPEAKER_04: from my bread and butter, which is retail seafood for sure.
[0:07:20 - 0:07:25] SPEAKER_04: From my experience, when I look back, there's not much difference between skill set.
[0:07:30 - 0:07:31] SPEAKER_04: They're not any good.
[0:07:30 - 0:07:33] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, the K. Cody?
[0:07:37 - 0:07:37] SPEAKER_03: I'm 27.
[0:07:37 - 0:07:39] SPEAKER_03: And it's not greed, it's just a game.
[0:07:40 - 0:07:41] SPEAKER_03: So yeah, that's real man.
[0:07:52 - 0:08:00] SPEAKER_03: There I've been doing this for a long time in business and there's still things that I mess up and there's still things I need to improve on and It never ends.
[0:07:57 - 0:08:01] SPEAKER_03: People don't realize how bad that fucks up their kid's life.
[0:07:58 - 0:08:06] SPEAKER_03: The real shit has to be communicated honestly, directly, without bias, in a factual manner, so that your leadership can make correct decisions.
[0:08:00 - 0:08:08] SPEAKER_03: I would, well, first of all, before I take the loan, I would sit down today and I would make a concrete plan of how we're going to scale this motherfucker out.
[0:08:06 - 0:08:08] SPEAKER_03: All right guys, Andy, here's another question for you.
[0:08:13 - 0:08:13] SPEAKER_03: That gotcha.
[0:08:18 - 0:08:20] SPEAKER_03: It's how hard is it to fucking pronounce bro?
[0:08:18 - 0:08:19] SPEAKER_03: Let's get a call in.
[0:08:22 - 0:08:24] SPEAKER_03: Um, so there is a social media for it.
[0:08:28 - 0:08:31] SPEAKER_03: My boss staked out the place to gather her proof for herself.
[0:08:42 - 0:08:48] SPEAKER_04: Um, but I do, um, and I just, I don't know, I can very conscious of that, you know?
[0:08:47 - 0:08:52] SPEAKER_04: And my boss knew that, and I can see the proof in the POS system.
[0:08:48 - 0:08:49] SPEAKER_04: and then we'll sell them weight loss stuff.
[0:08:49 - 0:08:50] SPEAKER_04: What's going on, Andy?
[0:08:53 - 0:08:54] SPEAKER_04: We're going to go out and get the loan.
[0:09:05 - 0:09:07] SPEAKER_04: Like, I have to fucking do these things.
[0:09:14 - 0:09:15] SPEAKER_04: I'm a little dog.
[0:09:15 - 0:09:22] SPEAKER_04: When you have someone who is doing something that is outside the realm of what is supposed to be allowed to do,
[0:09:18 - 0:09:20] SPEAKER_04: Cause you're playing in a premium market space.
[0:09:19 - 0:09:20] SPEAKER_03: I kind of felt into it, man.
[0:09:24 - 0:09:29] SPEAKER_03: and you allow them to continue doing that, you demoralize the rest of the team.
[0:09:36 - 0:09:39] SPEAKER_01: I will take a mile.
[0:09:39 - 0:09:41] SPEAKER_01: around the brand story.

[0:09:45 - 0:09:46] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, man.
[0:09:53 - 0:09:57] SPEAKER_01: there is no accountability for doing good or bad.
