[0:01:39 - 0:01:59] SPEAKER_04: I'm sorry, so what I'm able to say is, I addressed it partially earlier, is that the written note we believe did exist and we have evidence to show what was in that note, which is, and I'm going to summarize basically saying, the suspect wrote a note saying, I have the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it.
[0:01:41 - 0:01:51] SPEAKER_04: According to clips obtained by the outlet quote you're really arresting him for driving a kid's Jeep said summer Karen Who filmed Lincoln being cuffed?

[0:01:50 - 0:02:04] SPEAKER_04: So Secretary of State Marco Rubio stripped Turkish doctoral student Rumyaj Ortoz of her visa based on what a court later found was nothing more than her opinion piece critical of Israel.
[0:01:50 - 0:01:55] SPEAKER_04: fictional reality that doesn't obey any forms of how things actually work.
[0:01:56 - 0:01:58] SPEAKER_04: OK, three percent of the fucking six percent.
[0:01:59 - 0:02:06] SPEAKER_04: And there's a quote, I don't know where it came from, but it says, the government will never waste a good catastrophe.
[0:02:02 - 0:02:10] SPEAKER_04: Evidence of existence, we now have learned, existed before the shooting was in the location in the suspect and partner's home.
[0:02:02 - 0:02:06] SPEAKER_04: the people who think that's an unreasonable reaction, which it is.
[0:02:06 - 0:02:08] SPEAKER_04: or individual ideas and individual work ethics.
[0:02:09 - 0:02:10] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, like your own demise.

[0:02:24 - 0:02:25] SPEAKER_04: Okay.
[0:02:26 - 0:02:38] SPEAKER_04: completely abandoning their duty to protect and unify and call for, you know, rule of law to be enforced, because at the end of the day, that's what's causing this, all right?
[0:02:26 - 0:02:32] SPEAKER_04: So dude, you cannot generalize this whole idea that's going around from the far right extremists.
[0:02:27 - 0:02:33] SPEAKER_04: Like this this headline Washington Post column is fired over social media post, right?
[0:02:31 - 0:02:39] SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah beautiful day in the neighborhood Sure is mm-hmm.

[0:02:48 - 0:03:04] SPEAKER_05: Now, I know we covered on CTI, I think when this first came out, there was two individuals who were detained within minutes of the shooting, who had claimed responsibility, that we, I think we both kind of came to the conclusion these were, like, you know.
[0:02:55 - 0:02:56] SPEAKER_05: You know, like Daniel Penny.
[0:02:55 - 0:03:20] SPEAKER_05: as They've gotten people to cheer for anti free speech bro and encourage fucking bro It's the same thing I said the first that we did the first episode that we did about Charlie Kirk, bro When I said they're gonna they're gonna use this to rally the troops to bring in Palantir full full scale Yeah, and the way they're doing it is by saying we gotta catch everybody who's talking shit about Charlie get these motherfuckers

[0:03:15 - 0:03:18] SPEAKER_04: That's something that, like, a lot of people are asking about.
[0:03:19 - 0:03:25] SPEAKER_04: It can be true that we need to unify with like-minded, common-sense people, right?
[0:03:20 - 0:03:21] SPEAKER_04: to celebrate the shit, bro.
[0:03:23 - 0:03:24] SPEAKER_04: I don't plead fifth.

[0:03:35 - 0:03:37] SPEAKER_04: And in that order, that's the important piece.
[0:03:36 - 0:03:43] SPEAKER_04: Well, as it's now been publicly reported, some of these people were taking claims for this horrific act of violence, and they had nothing to do with it.
[0:03:37 - 0:03:39] SPEAKER_04: I'll say that to say this, this is still America.
[0:03:40 - 0:03:46] SPEAKER_04: dividing ourselves artificially because we have one or two issues we may not agree completely on.
[0:03:41 - 0:03:55] SPEAKER_04: And so this was kind of the layout from it US lawmakers push bill to strip passports over Israel criticism is basically the the nuts and bolts of this bill that just got put in The bill cites material support for terrorism.
[0:03:42 - 0:03:46] SPEAKER_04: Why would they be putting thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of bots on this?
[0:03:43 - 0:03:45] SPEAKER_04: Sure, it sounds good.

[0:03:58 - 0:04:00] SPEAKER_05: a bunch of the same exact comments.
[0:04:00 - 0:04:26] SPEAKER_05: to do so like it takes a certain amount of time for you to be able to see what's actually going on to be an effective operator of anything whether that's a business there's a reason guys that are in their 40s destroy the dudes that are in their 20s in business there's a reason the guys that are in their 60s will run circles around the guys in their 40s because the experience is cumulative it is unlike
[0:04:03 - 0:04:03] SPEAKER_05: Right?
[0:04:06 - 0:04:27] SPEAKER_05: We know the suspect was communicating with folks But as I've said that cell phone tower information you got to get it the right way with search warrants Which lawful authority so that our prosecutors can use it in court for whatever investigations they decide to provide So do you have it or do you not do you know or do you know I mean, how would you not have it?
[0:04:07 - 0:04:22] SPEAKER_04: Adjustments, but what it will come is a full fucking lockdown surveillance state and people will cheer for it because they're because like dude if you hear how they're trying to like String this together the term that cash use was daisy chain
[0:04:09 - 0:04:36] SPEAKER_04: reasonable people that identify as democrats are disgusted by what's going on and then you have these far left which normally they're really young and they've been told a lot of lies who are being fueled by people who are in the left media who can't necessarily say what they would normally say to inflame the situation because the the tension is so high so
[0:04:11 - 0:04:11] SPEAKER_04: Very polite.
[0:04:12 - 0:04:18] SPEAKER_04: people are saying that it will be expanded to that.

[0:04:41 - 0:04:43] SPEAKER_04: This is just a good law-abiding white man.
[0:04:42 - 0:04:49] SPEAKER_04: It just made me think like but like okay, like I know my algorithm is a little messed up DJ This is a psychological game.

[0:07:48 - 0:07:49] SPEAKER_05: Look at that.
[0:07:49 - 0:08:07] SPEAKER_05: that's saying federal and state law enforcement agencies have opened investigations into several leftist groups in Utah to determine whether they had advanced knowledge of or gave support after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, according to multiple sources familiar with the case.
[0:07:52 - 0:07:56] SPEAKER_05: is a foreign intelligence agency involved in this.
[0:07:57 - 0:08:00] SPEAKER_05: Oh, when you built your company, it was a different time.
