[0:00:16 - 0:00:30] SPEAKER_01: lives, the fitness and delusions of modern society and welcoming of the fuck reality.  Guys, today we have a real talk.
[0:00:37 - 0:00:53] SPEAKER_01: that they were going to have their baby.  So it just totally fucked up our whole schedule and he's probably going to get fired, you know,  but it's all good because I'm going to carry the water like I always do and I'm going  to give you a real talk today.
[0:01:28 - 0:01:44] SPEAKER_01: come along every single year, they say they're going to make these changes, they say they're  going to do these things, they say they're going to become all these things that they really
[0:01:44 - 0:01:51] SPEAKER_01: And I want to talk to the young people about this real quick because a lot of you guys
[0:01:52 - 0:01:58] SPEAKER_01: You're going to do this from now until you're in the hole, all right?
[0:02:00 - 0:02:15] SPEAKER_01: here the truth of what it's going to take to succeed.
[0:02:16 - 0:03:03] SPEAKER_01: that will help you be productive so you don't become one of these people who waste year after  year after year saying tomorrow and, you know, ends up wasting their entire life, which happens  all the time, okay?  I used to think just like you that someone was going to come down from the heavens and  give me permission.  I used to think that someone who was more successful than me was going to come to me and say,  Andy, I really believe you have what it takes.  Let me take you under my wing and show you how to do this.
[0:03:05 - 0:04:01] SPEAKER_01: okay?  Nobody is going to give you the opportunity.  Nobody is going to open the door.  You are going to have to break it the fuck down.  That is what you have to understand, okay?  This idea of waiting, this idea of just hoping that the world works with everything that  we want and eventually time will produce this life that we actually want is bullshit.  You have to make it happen on your own.  And I am speaking to the young people out here.  I am speaking to those people who think they have unlimited time, who think they have  a long life.  Look, dude, I remember being 22 like it was yesterday, like it was yesterday.
[0:04:01 - 0:04:13] SPEAKER_01: fast and you don't have as much time as you think.  You just don't, okay?
[0:04:14 - 0:04:22] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't care how experienced you are.  It doesn't care where you're at.
[0:04:22 - 0:04:31] SPEAKER_01: None of the shit matters, okay?  And you have to understand no matter what you've been told, no matter what you've been  taught.
[0:04:32 - 0:04:49] SPEAKER_01: The world does not reward mediocre performance, okay?  It does not hand out participation trophies.  No matter how special your teacher said you were, no matter how special your parents  say you might be, the world doesn't give a shit.  All right?
[0:04:50 - 0:05:42] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't care if you're trying to figure it out.  It doesn't take it easy on you because you're inexperienced, okay?  The clock is ticking no matter what and you have to understand that when you are young,  you have this ridiculous opportunity to get ahead because typically you don't have the  same amount of commitments.  You don't have the same amount of responsibilities.  And unfortunately we have these people online telling these young people, hey man, you can  use your 20s to fucking do whatever you want.  Sure, you can accept then your 30s are going to be a fucking house show that you're going  to hate because you're going to have to put 20 years of work in a time to get where you  are and then most people quit and never become what it is they want to become.
[0:05:42 - 0:06:37] SPEAKER_01: does not give you the excuse to coast.  You should be using this time to be productive and to learn and to try and figure out  legitimately what it is you're trying to do.  That doesn't mean I'm going to go to Ibiza four times a year and fuck off.  What it means is you're going to think about things, you're going to analyze things,  you're going to take actions, you're going to fail, you're going to learn, you're going  to get better and you're going to build a fucking skill set when you're still young.  There is no bigger advantage to you than that.  Okay, I am very, very fortunate that during my 20s, I took my shit relatively serious.  I could have went way harder.  I could have tried a lot harder.  I could have been dedicated.  But at the end of the day, I was doing something and that's something got me here.
[0:06:38 - 0:06:51] SPEAKER_01: right now, you cannot do that by saying, Oh, I got time.  Oh, I got time.  Oh, you know what?  I'm only 20.  I got time.
[0:06:51 - 0:07:13] SPEAKER_01: Not if you got legendary aspirations.  Okay, and you don't want to be one of these douchebags that leases a hurricane for 144 months  and think you made it.  I'm talking about real success.  I'm talking about 360 success.
[0:07:14 - 0:07:18] SPEAKER_01: can't be shaken from who the fuck you are.
[0:07:22 - 0:08:05] SPEAKER_01: Okay, the second point I want you to understand is this talent is not enough.  Okay, you could be smart.  You could be intelligent.  You could be creative.  You can have all the ideas in the world.  You could be full of potential and nobody gives a fuck into you actually build something real.  Okay, action always beats potential every single mother fucking time hard workers will beat talented people that don't work.  We've all heard the saying.  We've all heard it, right?  Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work.  Well, most of the fucking talent out there doesn't work.  Okay, and by the way,  you probably don't have that much talent.
[0:08:15 - 0:09:12] SPEAKER_01: And if you can do those things and apply those lessons moving forward and never fucking allow yourself to quit  because you built yourself into a fucking machine of discipline and grit and fortitude and endurance.  You can't be stopped.  You cannot be stopped.  Okay, so don't get upset that you don't have all the talent.  Don't get upset that you got to struggle.  Every mother fucker out there that ever became what it is that you might admire came from struggle came from hardship.  They did not have it easy like you think they did like society says they did.  Most of the most successful people in the world had to fight every mother fucking step, which is why they are who they are.
[0:09:12 - 0:09:20] SPEAKER_01: You got screwed over.  You didn't you got blessed with an opportunity to become great.
[0:09:26 - 0:09:37] SPEAKER_01: Okay, nobody knows what they're doing in the beginning.  We all look stupid.  We're all afraid of getting laughed at and guess what?  We do.
[0:09:47 - 0:11:04] SPEAKER_01: I get laughed at now.  You see the mother fucking comments.  You see what people say.  I do not give a fuck if someone laughs at me, bro, because you know what?  When I walk the fuck out of my house, I get in the fucking Bugatti or another Bugatti or whatever the fuck else I want.  And I go to my place of business, which I love and build amazing shit with people I love and create the ultimate life that I've always dreamed about creating.  Not just for me, but for everyone around me.  So I don't give two shits who laughs at it.  I don't care.  And you shouldn't either.  Losers laugh winners build.  That's the reality.  So when we think about how it's going to be along the way, you cannot expect yourself to be great at something when you haven't put in the fucking time or the reps or the energy.  It's not going to happen.  And I want you to think about this.  How arrogant are you to think that you're going to be great at something from the start when all the people you admire had to struggle for years and years and years to get to that point?
[0:11:06 - 0:11:18] SPEAKER_01: You're telling me you're better than all those people.  You have more talent than all those people.  You get to skip the fucking struggle because of why?  Please explain it to me.
[0:11:22 - 0:11:35] SPEAKER_01: We all get our asses kicked.  We all get laughed at.  We all get made fun of.  It's part of the process.  And you can't avoid it.
[0:11:37 - 0:12:02] SPEAKER_01: If you're mom or your dad or your uncle or your aunt or your teachers or fucking anyone hasn't done what it is you want to do.  You shouldn't listen to them about how to do it because they don't know.
[0:12:03 - 0:12:22] SPEAKER_01: Just because they might be in a better spot or appear to be in a better spot than you right now does not mean that they are actually successful.
[0:12:22 - 0:12:36] SPEAKER_01: That is not true.
[0:12:37 - 0:13:01] SPEAKER_01: We live in this world of fucking smoking mirrors and people have figured out how to appear to be successful without actually being successful.  So it's very simple.  You have to vet where you're taking your lessons from.  If you don't do that you will end up listening to someone who could potentially cost you everything.
[0:13:01 - 0:13:13] SPEAKER_01: They can't figure out that just because someone loves them doesn't mean they know how to win.
[0:13:14 - 0:14:05] SPEAKER_01: Okay. You have to look beneath the surface.  What have they done?  What have they built?  What is their business?  Can I shop there?  Do they employ people?  What's the product like?  What's the customer experience like?  We could go on and on and on and on.  Is this actually real or is this smoking mirrors?  Have they built any real shit or do they just sell courses on how to build real shit?  These are things that matter.  These are things that will cost you time and energy and effort over and over and over again.  And if you listen to too many of them it will fucking crush you.
[0:14:07 - 0:14:21] SPEAKER_01: That doesn't mean you have to be rude.  It doesn't mean you have to be mean.  It doesn't mean you got to tell your parents to eat shit.
[0:14:21 - 0:14:34] SPEAKER_01: If they knew how to do it they would have fucking done it themselves.  Okay.  And point number five.  Nobody is fucking coming.
[0:14:35 - 0:15:17] SPEAKER_01: Motivation phase.  Guidance is rare and it's often wrong.  Nobody's going to come wake you up and shake you out of bed and say here's your critical task that you need to do today.  To become the version of yourself ten years from now that you ultimately want to become nobody's going to check up on you.  Nobody's going to hold your hand.  Nobody's going to pull you through the mother fucking fire.  Nobody.  Most of these people haven't even been through it themselves.  You're going to have to walk alone a lot of times.  You're going to have to make sacrifices.  You're going to have to understand for this big goal that you're trying to create.  It's going to have a price.
[0:15:18 - 0:15:29] SPEAKER_01: For some people they're going to move on from their friends or their girlfriends and boyfriends or maybe even a wife and husband.  Who knows?
[0:15:41 - 0:15:57] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't matter what people say to you.  It doesn't matter if they laugh at you.  It doesn't matter if you're tired.  If you're sore.  If you're beat up.  You're going to be all those things and all those things are going to happen.
[0:15:58 - 0:16:08] SPEAKER_01: And when you become that version of you.
[0:16:08 - 0:16:30] SPEAKER_01: Regardless of what's going on in their life.  Regardless if they're tired.  Regardless of their sore.  Regardless if their husband yells at him or their wife yells at him.  Regardless if they have all the stress in the world bearing down on their fucking head.
[0:16:56 - 0:17:20] SPEAKER_01: You can live the life they live.  You can listen to them.  You can bullshit with them.  You can drink your life away and fuck your life away.  Or you can get real mother fucking serious right now.  And you can listen to someone who's actually done a lot of the things that you want to do.  And you could start today right now.  Real fucking ugly.
[0:17:25 - 0:17:39] SPEAKER_00: Now my jury box froze.  Fuck up, fuck up, fuck up, stole.  Counting millions in the coke.  Bad bitch, booted slow.  Got a own bank road.  Can't fold.  Does a no-hit shot case, cloak, cloak.
