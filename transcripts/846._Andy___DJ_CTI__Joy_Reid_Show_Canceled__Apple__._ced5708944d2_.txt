The greatest energy drink in the history of earth. Mm-hmm just one sip and all good stuff happens. You know what I'm saying? You know that thing you wish for you know that thing?

You'll have you'll have full three wishes. You won't have to waste one anymore. Oh fuck man. How about that for that? It grows your elephant trunk. It doesn't really grow your own. I feel like it's working. Yeah. Fuck man. All right. Yeah. So brand new segment. Yeah. Brand new segment. This segment's called finding our senses with Kamala. Oh. Awesome. All right, man. So we got brand new segment here. So Kamala decided to go to California and visit the disaster zones from finally from the fires. Finally. I mean she's been listening. She's been busy. Yeah. Okay. She's been busy. But she finally went. Okay. And let's let's first question that was ever given to her while she's on the zone. I'm going to see where her responses. Let's check this clip out. Go through your mind when you see this. You're here. You're now seeing it up close. It's not only seeing it Alex. You can smell it. You can feel it right. So it's seeing it with our eyes and many people have seen it. You all are covering it. But to literally be on the ground here. You can smell. The smoke that was here. You can feel the toxicity. Frankly of the environment. You can feel the energy of all of the folks who are still here on the ground. Well, that's good to know. Thank you for you're on the site reporting. Kamala. You can smell it. Yeah. That was lunch, baby. That was my double B burrito. You know, they got good beans. I bet they do, bro. And you know, she was. She had two of them which are the last of wine. She did. But she did. Yeah. No, man. Kamala Kamala. Kamala's been chilling lately. You know, just like Biden. You haven't really seen her. She made she didn't make one appearance. Those are the fact that this is Kamala. She should hide. And here's what I'm being dead serious. She's so bad. Yeah. And so ridiculous and so unlikable that she should go away for a while and then come back. Because and let people forget about how bad she is. Yeah. Because everything she does like this, all it does is make us remember like how bad she was. I mean, I'm thankful she's doing it. Yeah. But I mean, if I'm her, you're a producer. I mean, she's a producer. Yeah. Right. Right. Say, hey, take a nap. Calm down. We'll bring you back in a couple of years. Yeah. Well, I mean, they're lining her up for something. I don't know if she decided to go to the end of NAACP. And she got she got feature there for the N.C. NAACP image awards. And she made some veil threats. But how the fuck is she getting into double ACP awards when she's fucking Indian? Two, well, that's one. Two. She lost. I mean, like, fuck, man, like, we can just keep hanging out trophies for losers. I mean, that's the, you know, that's the left agenda. What the fuck is she wearing? And what is that? Well, I mean, you know, they signed with talent agencies now. Most of them signed with like some big talent agencies. I saw Biden did that to you. Yeah. Imagine this. So what those talent agencies do is they book these people to speak. Okay. And you pay them a couple hundred grand to speak. Three, four hundred grand. Imagine hire her to come in and speak. Not only can you hear me speak, you can see me speak. It's smell me. Smell me speak. I'll tell you this. They say it's going to be good. Been burritos. Yeah. They say, oh, it happens. Not hard. She's got a good grip on that trophy. Yeah. She does. She's cupping the balls too. Oh, it happens. Not hard, man. That's right. She's an expert. No wonder she got to be present. Oh, man. Guys, brand new segment. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, man, we got a lot of crews. Got a lot of stuff to watch. Jesus. No. Okay. No. I have a day 747 of DJ being gay. Yeah. No. Yeah. I'm not sure. Where do you watch it? Like where can I find it? Anywhere great movies are, man. You want me to get you? You want me to get you a VHS? I know where those are too. I don't know where they stand. No, the beta maxes. That's a duty drinks Starbucks on the weekends. That actually is. That's a final boss. Yeah. That is a liberal. All right, man. Guys, let's get it through our crews. Remember, if you were to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find them all there. Let's get into our first set of headlines. Headline number one. And on the more and reach MSNBC chief tells blindsided staffers of canceled joy read. They'll be laid off, but they can apply for new jobs at network. Joy read the joy is out. How do you feel? I mean, just like just taking that in. Listen, dude. How do you feel? Okay. I can easily be a smart ass here and make some fun. Yeah. I should say. Yeah. And I probably will. But, but I want to say this. Okay. I don't root for anybody to lose their job. No. So, okay. Yeah, dude. And like, you know, I see like all these federal workers losing their jobs and shit. And they they're fault that losing their fucking jobs, bro. The government's overbloded. It's not meant to be this, you know, employment farm for people that don't go out and build careers. It's just not meant to be that. And I think a lot of people were, you know, sucked into that. And they're losing their jobs. And, you know, they have families and they have bills just like everybody else. And it's not cool. I don't like seeing that. But it's necessary to get our government a place that makes sense. Okay. So I have empathy for those people that are losing their job. I know a lot of people don't and a lot of people are laughing and shit. And real talk, dude. That doesn't make people any better than the people who laughed when people were getting fired for vaccines, which happens to be these people. Right. And so really is a little bit of karma served up pretty cold for these people, but that doesn't make it cool. I don't like it. Even though those people probably all hate me. I just don't like that. There's still Americans, bro. And we all know what it's like to not be able to pay your bills and the uncertainty to not know where your next checks coming from. I mean, bro, that shit is very stressful and very hard. And it sucks. And I would never wish that on anybody. But the truth of the matter is is, you know, when I see Joy re-loose her job, it made me extremely happy. It really did. And she is the biggest racist piece of shit that I've ever seen on TV. She deserves to never have a job again. She deserves to have her citizenship revoked for the damage that she's done between races and political ideologies. And this woman gets on TV every single day. And instead of thinking like an American citizen and thinking like, okay, there's people. And I agree with some of the things they're about, but I don't agree with other things they're about, but there's still people. She doesn't do that. She just identifies with the ideology and just berates anybody who may have a different opinion or a different skin color of hers. And I'm fucking tired of hearing it. Yeah. I'm tired of hearing about white supremacy when there isn't white supremacy. Like we don't get privileges. Like, bro, this woman gets all the privileges. Like if I went on TV and said the shit she said about other races, bro, I'd be tired and feathered and fucking unable to work anywhere ever again. You know, like, and it's the double standard pisses me off and I'm tired of hearing about it. And so, joy, read, fuck you. That's what I think. I think she's a terrible person. Well, I think, you know, one thing that I found interesting with this is that it just goes to show that even the left understand that like you can't just keep throwing cash at something that's just not working. I mean, do like the data speaks for itself, but nobody watches her shit. And nobody has been watching the shit. Her highest numbers was back in November of 2024 during the height of the election. And that was it. Like nobody watches her. And like, and then with all of the exposing of the funding and all of that shit, which we got a little bit more on that a little bit later. But they can't, the money's out. So you're not getting money from actual viewers. The government funding that you were getting is gone. Yeah. People need to understand that. That USAID fund was funding these mass media channels to put this propagation out. Okay. So all this race baiting, all this division, all this political ideology that is designed to create very hard lines between left and right, black and white gay and straight everything. Well, you we all paid for that. And she was the mouthpiece and other people like her like Rachel Maddow. They're the mouthpieces for that. They call her the racial motto. Yeah. But here's the other thing, dude. Number number one, I am a little bit concerned because you know, now that she lost her job, how is she going to afford to fix her hairline? That's because that's expensive. She got to go like Turkey for that. You mean like you mean you mean like that? Yeah. Well, and that's the other thing I was going to say. So now that she's out of a job, how is she going to afford all these different wigs that you know, bluntly like, you know, that you know, definitely don't culturally appropriate white people. Yeah. You know, I think it's funny how I think she's going to get back to our roots bald. I mean, look, dude, how why is it okay? It's not okay for white people that you know, to fucking be all about hip hop culture. It's called fucking cultural appropriation. Okay, you can't just like the music or the style or whatever, right. But she can wear any mother fucking wig that she wants to look like a white woman's hair. And it's okay. It's fine. So let's we're all about double standards here. Like I don't give a fuck if she does that. But don't sit up there on your fucking microphone in front of TV and talk shit about other races wanting to fucking like bro, we're America. We have different cultures. We have different things that we fit into. We got different things that we like, you know, I'm a fucking mid 40s dude that listens to fucking trap music. Okay. That's okay. You know what I'm saying? Like I like opera. And that's okay, bro. You know what I'm saying? But she these people don't allow us to even enjoy the things that we enjoy without feeling guilt or shame for doing so. Right. And this shit's absurd, bro. Yeah. Like this have created the division that exists in our country by hammering it in our brains for years and years and years and years and years and years. And I'll be real, dude. You know me and you guys listen, you know me for a long time. I'm very reasonable person contrary to what the internet might think because of a couple clips that I say about throwing pedophiles and woodchipper. Okay. Like I have empathy for people, but I have zero empathy for her. I hope her life fucking sucks. I do not fucking wish bad on people. I wish bad on her. Yeah. She is a bad human being. I think I mean I'm in the same boat with you because my my issues because I feel like she knows what she was. You know what I'm saying? It's a different like you could see in her fucking eyes. She she she believes what she said. Like she knows it. And like that's the part that's even me right like the people who push mass and skin like. I mean you can have some okay. Yeah. You were just. Well you can't you listen. She's fucking guilty 1000%. I've said this for years when it came to the COVID shit in the mass shit. Okay. You can't blame the average person for believing what the news tells them. Okay. Up until the last few years. It was a reasonable expectation that what was on the news was real. They had us all fooled. And by the way, I don't think it was. Even then I think it's been decades since the news has actually been real because how much easier of a time would they have hiding the prop the propaganda. When there was no internet. When there was no that you know like do the internet's only been around for fuck in an effective way for every 25 years now. Okay. So. And really only 15 years to where it's like it's been adopted by most people as part of their life. So it's new right. If we have the internet we wouldn't know they were lying. We would just be like holy shit. And so what we've seen here is a is like a changing of the behavioral understanding that we as citizens have of the information that's fed to us. And 30 years ago, dude, you know, you couldn't talk to someone across the internet or see these people who like make their lives about digging in for the truth. You didn't see that. It was like, dude, I would see and a lot of people have a hard time realizing this because they didn't grow up without it. But I am in a situation where I did and we might go to dinner. We might go get some beers and be like bro, do you see that shit. That sounds like bullshit. And we talk about it for five minutes and that was it. But now we have all these people all these online, you know, I guess detectives or whatever you want to call them that dig in and find the story behind the story. And so they can't do what they used to be able to do. And not in scale. Yeah, so do when I look at like when I look at like people during COVID who got fooled into, you know, the masked thing or the vaccine thing. I actually feel really sorry for those people and I see them as the biggest victims of the lie, the crime that these people put out. And I've said for years, I don't hold. I don't hold grudges towards those people because they were manipulated. They were lied to and let's be honest. A lot of these people are walking around with this fucking vaccine. Knowing that people are getting sick, knowing that people have died, knowing that it's causing myocarditis and all kinds of accelerated cancers and all this shit. I mean, bro, that's punishment, man, enough for being fooled, you know, and and you know, if you believed that if I was in six feet of you that you were actually had a chance of dying, you'd be pissed too. Okay, so, you know, I don't hold a grudge against those people at all, but I do hold heavy grudges against people like joy, read and the talking heads who all fucking propagated this mass hysteria and division and identity politics and racial bullshit for the last fucking 15 years. They've ruined culture and society and quite honestly, dude, I mean, these people mid-century of, you know, the 1900s, they would have faced execution for their complicity in a crimes against humanity. Okay, and dude, I'm old school, like I think if you knew what you were doing and you did it and you took money to do it and you knew it was hurting people, those people should be eliminated. Yeah, 100%. I mean, they did that. We're not even that far away from history of when that stuff was going on. No, I mean, Nikolai to Chescue, right? Roman dictator fucking Romani, I mean, like, dude, it is what it is. But it wasn't Joyce Joy read either, bro, like the MSNBC, they canceled a three other lefty anchors in the wake of joy being out. So you got, let's see, Amin, Moiellen, Katie Feng and Jonathan K. Part, these three there, they were also asked for MSNBC. You know, when it cries a lot, cries all the fucking time. Yeah, Joy reading, she hasn't said a whole lot since this. I do have a clip of like the most recent thing that, you know, she's commented on, but they called it leaving her, her million dollar house and nice fur coat earlier today. But then she went on this, this, this town hall podcast, I guess. Let's listen to what Joy read had to say. My show had value and that, oh my gosh, she's crying. This is awesome. That what I was doing. And value, and in the end, I'm sorry, I'm not trying not to cry on TV. And I say this is kind of like me on TV. So I apologize. And that, and that it kind of, and then it mattered. I see Karen is there and she's been texting me as well. And so what I will just say is that in the end, thank you. Where I land is that the moment that I've of guilt that I felt that I went hard on so many issues, whether it was the Black Lives Matter issues of a young baby or a mom or a dad that was killed or. And when we opened up people's eyes to the fact that Asian Americans were being targeted and not just Black folks that or went hard for immigrants who've done nothing but come to this country like my parents did and try to make a life and defended them. Or whether we've talked about what the president is doing that is subversive to the Constitution that is injurious to our liberty, you know, defending books that people find inconvenient, you know, that Nicole Hannah Jones put into our spirit that we need to understand 1619 as the real founding of this country, whether it's talking about any of these issues. And yes, whether it's talking about Gaza and the fact that we as the American people have a right to object to have a right to object to little babies being bombed and and where I come down on that is I'm not sorry. I am not sorry that I stood up for those those things because those things are of God. Well, first of all, if 16 night, these people love to fucking say 1619 and then in the same breath, they love to say Native Americans are the rifle like what the fuck is it which one which one is it? Pick one. Okay, we are a colonizer. Well, so are you in the 1719. So anyway, well, I love the fact that she left out a really important thing that she also were hard on like this in America. There's a thing about both white vigilantism and white tears, particularly male white tears. Oh, really? Yeah, let's stop this right now because that's what carrots are right. Let's stop this. When you go to the ATM at two o'clock in the morning and you're out in the fucking somewhere you don't know, are you looking around for white vigilante? Who the fuck are you looking for? Who the fuck are you afraid of? What is the crime data set? I'm just being honest. So let's not fucking bullshit about what is. Okay, I don't go to the ATM at fucking two o'clock in the morning and look around. Where's the fucking KKK? Where's the beta max? Where's where's these fucking domestic extremists? Probably because it's me. But like dude, this is I'm tired of this villainization of fucking white man. It's bullshit. She left this part out. Like, yeah, it left out how hard you're in a right. I'm just so sick of her. I would love for her to come on my show. Yeah, I would love for her to sit right there where Z-Shine sitting. She can even come and co-host five or six shows just so I never get tired of destroying her. And by the way, it'll be the biggest audience she's ever gonna have from here on out. It's true. This is true. This is anyway. Play the clip. That's what carrots are, right? They're carrying out and then as soon as it gets caught, it's being water works. White men can get away with that too. And it has the same effect even as the right tries to politicize the idea that masculinity is being robbed from American men by multiculturalism and locism. They still want to be able to have their tears. Well, masculinity has been demonized for the last 15 years. Competitive nature has been removed from society. We give our young men 20 place trophies. We don't teach them the value of competition. We don't tell them that they have to go out and work hard. We tell them that it's not fair what the way the world is and that they should just sit there and pout. We also, you know, villainized people like Daniel Penny, who goes to jail for a year or whatever for standing up for people. I mean, look, dude, you guys did. You had me too. So every dude in the world is ever flirted with a woman is a fucking abuser. Okay, you people have completely removed men as being valuable from society. In the fact of the matter is men are extremely valuable to society. They do like 90% of the fucking jobs that are hard, that are dangerous, that build things that create the communities that we have in society. And that's no knock on women. That's just the fact. Okay. So this movement has been extremely culturally damaging. And now, especially in relationships, how often do we see women saying, there's no good men all men are weak, all men are pussies, all men are there. I can't find a good man. Well, you can't find a good man because you bought into the feminist idea that men were not needed. And you villainized them to the point where most men have figured out, it's not worth it. Fuck it. I'll hang out with my dudes. I don't give a shit. Yeah, I'd rather do it for real. And they're so afraid that you know, they're gonna like dude women have massive leverage over men. Okay, like they can accuse men of things that aren't even true. And it the society will consider it to be true, even if it's not. And it will ruin men's lives. This happens all the time. And there's no repercussions. And that is a product of this ideology that these people put out. So, you know, smell you later bitch. I mean bro, no, I don't have I she's one of my most despised people on the planet with Hillary Clinton. Yeah. That she's up there. Bro, what do you think? Yeah, no, I can't stand this lady. I'm glad listen, like it's just like this. Like bro, she got a different energy there. Didn't she? Yeah, you know on her show, the redout, she's fucking cocky and she's talking shit. She thinks she's untouchable. And now you learn the people in with your shit. You know, these people, bro, they're so fucking stupid that like look at the agenda that they're still pushing DJ. They're still pushing the same shit when everybody is tired of it. No, it's good though. I agree. It's good though. Like keep pushing it. Keep pushing it. I mean, they're just making sure that nobody from that crowd ever will have a chance in political. You know what they're making sure to like go ahead, keep pushing it. You know what else they're making sure of? They're making sure that if Donald Trump continues to be ultra aggressive, that no one's going to fucking stop it or speak out against it. Like with their, the way, and bro, I've talked about this like there should be some cognizant, you know, awareness around the pendulum swinging too far to the right. And because of people like her and because of the way these people are still hanging on to these talking points and these ideas and this white supremacy, domestic terrorists, all this shit. They're just ensuring that that pendulum is going to continue to swing and no one's going to say anything because even if even if they were to go Trump was to go too far, people are going to say this. Well, fuck it's better than what that was. And so like dude, the more they do this shit, the more people are going to be with it. Yeah, man, guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, let's go cruise in comments. Bro, imagine if every day you woke up and everything on the internet says you're a piece of shit. Everybody in the world can say because of your race that you are a fucking bad person. Okay, like little kids go to school and they're told they're bad because they were born white. Think about that. Let's fuck that. Dude, think about the black kids that are told you're never going to be successful in this country because you're black when it's not true. Because a little billy sitting over there to push their, that's right. To push their own agenda of racial division so they can continue to be fucking in power over divided populace. It's insane, bro. And you know, I've never paid it. I don't care. Like I don't give a fuck. Because it's always been that way. Like it's always been you could say anything about white people, but you could you can't say anything about anybody else. It's always been that way. It doesn't bother me because because of that behavior that has existed my entire life. I don't put value in my race as a human. I don't care. You're not hurting my feelings, but the hypocrisy of the conversation is pretty ridiculous. Okay, the fact that people can get online and say what she says about any race is unacceptable. It's unacceptable. Okay, race discrimination against any race is racism. All right. And I'm for one and I don't know how everybody else feels, but I'm fucking tired of it. Like I'm tired of it. And I know you guys have heard me speak out more and more on it because I'm fucking sick of it because it's wrong. Because if any white person got on TV and said any of the shit that is said about white people on television about other races, they would be kicked out of fucking society. Is that okay? No. I don't think so either. Nobody does it. We don't need to have it, bro. It were Americans. Well, I mean, I think that's also the dichotomy of it too, right? Because it's like, you know, bro, we've gone all over this country together and we've seen the real world together, right? And like everybody's cool. Everybody's cool. You know what I'm saying? So like, I mean, but they spend trillions of dollars getting us to want to fight each other using our money to do it. Yeah. You know, I'm saying this like people are over it, bro. And I'm like that. I mean, I did today. She's out. Yeah. We'll see what I'm on the show, Joy. Seriously. I'll fly out. You can be on the show anytime. Yeah. We'll have a actual discussion, not you sitting there with no resistance. Yeah. We'll see what happens. It's easy to fucking, it's easy to have your your your your your your your your pushback. And you say whatever you want. Safe and secure behind the telepropter. Yeah. Yeah, bam. Yeah, man, guys, let us know what you guys think, man. But that big. So let's go cruise some of these comments. Let's go see some of your thoughts. This first one. Let's go to at just Cohen 305. Please stick to being awesome podcasters because your fried game is trash. Bro, you're 160 pounds. You don't shit about fries. Shut the fuck up. You should be offended by that too. Yeah. That guy knows more about fries than you. I mean, listen, you know, I took a IQ test the other day. I did all right. You did. And, you know, so I'm going to, you know, I just think that that's just a low IQ comment. I'm above it. Yeah. I appreciate you liking the podcast. But, you know, before you comment on french fries, you should try eating some. And look here, I had enough of you, my fuck. You better eat some fucking fries. At least for the time that's got their mouth. That's probably fucking pride. He's probably like, I like hooks. I don't know what it is. That's right. Yeah. What is that? You know what it is, bro? He likes McDonald's. That's what it is. I heard his feelings. That's probably what it is. Well, sorry, brother. Well, I mean, we, you know, we've listened. I mean, we're all open to criticism. Right? Like, I mean, you know, if it's legit, let's be real, dude. The worst french fries, the worst french fries still pretty good. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I mean, yeah, it's not a win-win situation. Yeah. The way it goes. It's like blow jobs. Yeah. I mean, you know, braces are worse. But, you got to still get it. What? I mean, I. You know, but you know, this was just a, we got to cut that out.

Oh my god, dude. But, you know, this was just a big, big deal. I'm going to really, really big deal. Oh my god dude. But you know this was just a one sentence, you know, a little slapback. I like a little bit more detail. You know if you're going to give some criticism, have a little bit more to say. Yeah. So let's go to Jerome Clemonds. Jerome Clemonds 6640. He says, Andy, love you bro. But your taste for the fries is fucking horrible. Wendy's fries are ass. Absolute lowest on the list. Five guys are actually made fresh from real potatoes, never froze and taste amazing. They belong in at least a category. And yes, raising canes is fucking dumpster juice for fries and chicken.

This is this. This riled people up. Do it. I got a lot of comments. My DMs about it. I mean, listen, I mean, it was a very what's the way they use. Very polarizing. It's more controversial. The other shit would say. This is what Shawn niggas got. We did. That's cool. That's fine. No, that's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Yeah. Jerome, I appreciate you. Yeah, I like that comment. Listen, I'm cool with disagreement as long as you got a reason why. Yeah, I'm with it. I'm with you. Just your trash. That's like liberal. That's a liberal argument. Friday game is trash.

We gotta figure out. Yeah. Where did they hit up? They'll find them. We'll get there, you two. We'll reach out to them. We're going to have, let's create an email address that we can send these guys to, to claim their trophies. Yeah. All right. Now, just to be clear, we don't give out trophies for shady comments in 15 place. Like all your motherfuckers are used to. Yeah, sorry, just Cohen. Yeah. Should try a little harder. No, no, no. Get back to comment practice. Yep. That's what it is. Yeah. That's what it is. Yeah. All right, man. Guys, we do appreciate you, man. Let's keep the crews moving. Yeah. We got headline number two. Hello to us. This is world. This is great. You know, with Trump's new tariffs and stuff that he's been putting on, there's been a lot of new updates going on. So let's just dive through some of this. The first thing's up. Trump, Tareff, win Apple to invest $500 billion in United States. Pudges to create 20,000 jobs. That's shit. I mean, yeah, I think they moved it from Mexico to here. Yeah. Yeah. Trump announced plans to invest half a trillion dollars in the United States over the next four years and hire 20,000 new workers as a company seeks relief from President Donald Trump's tariffs on goods imported from China. Bloomberg reports that in the move to bolster its domestic presence and potentially avoid hefty tariffs, Apple has committed to investing 500 billion in the US over the next four years. Tech giant again, pledging to create 20,000 new jobs, marking its biggest US investment commitment to date. Announcement comes on the heels of a meeting between President Donald Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook in the Oval Office last week. Cook has joined the parade of tech titans attempting to repair their relationship with Donald Trump following his return to power. So part of the investment plan, Apple is going to start producing AI servers in a new facility in Houston, Texas. They're also going to be establishing a supplier academy in Michigan and increase, increase spending with this existing US suppliers. And it's good. It's good. Now what else is going on in government news? Elon Musk explains his what did you do last week email to federal workers as Tulsi Gabbard is latest to tell staff to ignore it. Elon Musk has further explained why he is demanding federal workers to justify keeping the jobs as newly confirmed, D&I secretary Tulsi Gabbard ordered her intelligence officers to ignore it. And the left of this shadow like, you know, Mark, this is like a, you know, infighting going on inside the cat. And that's not what's really happening. But let's talk about it. So this was an email that was sent out to pretty much all federal workers last week. It says, please reply to this email with a prox five bullets of what you accomplished last week and CC your manager. Please do not send any classified information, links or attachments. Deadline is this Monday at 11.59 PM Eastern standard time. So this email went out and this was sent out to literally every single federal worker in the country. Now there was a couple of agencies that got in quickly FBI for one HHS, the D&I, who were their leaders, you know, basically told their employees that this does not apply to you. Again, it's for security reasons, classified information, right? Like, and even just the thought of just exposing, you know, confidential, you know, protections for people who are, you know, in operations, what other cases is it's not, it's not really that deep. Because the left is trying to paint it. You know, but that went out and there's been a lot of pushback from the federal workers themselves. Donald Trump had to post something out. He posted this, this meme out says, got done last week, cried about Trump, cried about Elon, made it into the office for once, read some emails, cried about Trump and Elon some more. But another swing, federal workers who failed to return to office will be placed on administrative leave must dates. So that time is coming very, very quickly. Elon Musk, who's leading doge warned federal workers on Monday morning that those who failed to return to the office will be placed on administrative leave. Quote, those who ignored President Trump's executive order to return to work have now received over a month's warning. He wrote on Twitter. Starting this week, those who still failed to return to office will be placed on administrative leave. So that came again after he, you know, told them about reporting their accomplishments from last week. So that's going on anything on that. I mean, what? I mean, asking people to like ask them the employees to tell you what they, what they accomplished. I mean, I don't think that's that big of a deal. Well, it's only a big deal if you're not accomplishing anything. I mean, it's just like five things. Why would you get upset if you had a whole little deal? There's a list of things that you did and you did it well. I did this. Why wouldn't you use it as an opportunity to say, look how much good shit I did, right? Listen, this is capitalism. This isn't fucking fascism like you guys all like to scream. The government doesn't owe our people jobs. I'm sorry. It is what it is. I mean, this is, this is how it works. If you don't perform, you get fired. If you don't finish first, you don't get a trophy. You don't get to play in the game. This is dude. This is what it said, natural order, natural order, natural order always wins. The best of the, it's the best of the group, the survival of the fittest. These are not, these are laws of nature. These are not man-made laws. If you don't do your job, you don't have a job. If you can't list five things that you did that were effective, you don't deserve a job. That's that. So that's how I feel about it. If I was a federal worker, I would be looking to show that I am one of the productive federal workers that deserves to keep their job. But instead, these people are widening, complaining and bitching because they all know that they're not doing shit. Well, I think the fact of even just being a federal employee, like that's a privilege. It's a privilege. It's not all right. Well, not if you ask them. You know what I'm saying? But like the truth of the matter is, for the last four years at least, those people haven't been doing shit. Do not only that, here's the dangerous part about it. It's not just been four years, bro. It's been for a long time. These people basically cannot be fired for any reason whatsoever because of a lot of the laws have been in place for the last, you know, couple decades. And they have learned behavior that makes them unable to compete and operate in a true capitalist environment, such as a company, right? They think that if they come in and they get hired, then all they have to do is show up and they don't have to do much. They can sit around and fucking, you know, milk the clock and go home. And that doesn't work anywhere. So the biggest challenge a lot of these people are going to face and fuck dude, I've said this for a decade on the internet is that when you tell people that they deserve a certain outcome and that they are entitled to a certain outcome and that they don't have to compete and they are special. They behave that way in a corporate environment and it's just not reality. So these people are in for a rude awakening for a lot of different reasons because I believe also that what will happen is, you know, the government assistance program will be drastically altered at some point soon. So these people aren't going to be able to just sit at home and collect or they're going to have to do something. And how are you going to be an effective part of a team if, you know, you're for 20 years or 15 years or 10 years or five years, you haven't had to be. And in fact, you could kind of tell your boss to fucking eat shit when they try to hold you accountable. So there, these people are in for a rude awakening. And then to the previous story, you know, the 20,000 jobs in America, $500 billion, I believe that that 20,000 jobs is something that they're saying to pacify their audience because let's be real, dude. No one's addressing the elephant in the room when it comes to job creation, which is AI. And they're talking about putting AI servers, you know, and Houston Texas. Yeah. And nobody like one of the 20,000 jobs. Yeah. Like what are they? Because these people are so quick to adopt technology that humans are going to be obsolete in the job market very quickly. And the problem with that is, you know, people say, well, you know, it's an, it's an ethical thing and it depends on the company. Well, you know, yeah, okay. In an ideal world, the average person would support companies that don't use AI, but they are not smart enough to do that. That's not happening at a wide scale. They're not, they're not recognizing the danger because they're sold the benefit. All right. So in an ideal world, everybody would protest companies that use AI and not buy their shit. But because it's cool and people think it's neat and quick. Yeah. Right. They prey on people's, you know, infatuation with technology and, you know, they're want to sit at home all day and basically do nothing. And unknowingly, I believe that humans are making themselves obsolete and it's very dangerous the position that we're in because it's not just coders or marketers or copywriters or, you know, customer service or any like all those jobs are going to have to be replaced by AI for companies to be effective. So how do you create an even playing field between companies who employ real people and refuse to use AI or companies that use AI to add up much, you know, more cost effective model? Well, this has already happened in history and the government failed to protect the interests of the people. And when it happened the first time, it was the e-commerce internet, you know, the Amazon's of the world and these big companies that came out in the late 90s, early 2000s that didn't have to collect sales tax. Okay. So they had to collect sales tax for over a decade. And it was even more than that. And sales tax in almost every state is somewhere between eight and 12%. So if you don't force these companies to collect sales tax, that gives them an eight to 12% price advantage over the mom and pop companies, the smaller companies that employ humans. And those are the companies that employ the most humans. All right. So the government allowed these big companies to come in and have a huge advantage over these brick and mortar mom and pop small, medium sized companies. And these companies tried to maintain, hey, buy in person, deal with the human, this that the other. And dude, they got crushed because Amazon retrained, first of all, when they weren't, they weren't required to collect tax, they marketed on price. So they sold products cheaper than what brick and mortar could do, which cut the margin out of them and put a lot of them out of business. Then what happened was they leveraged that price advantage into a convenience advantage. So they took the money that they earned, that they shouldn't have earned, put it over to convenience where now people get, you know, they're shit in an hour when they order from Amazon. Well, no brick and mortar could compete with that, right? All right. So the government didn't adjust, regulations didn't adjust. And because of that, it drastically hurt the economy. And is that capitalism? Sure. Is it ethical capitalism? Absolutely not. All right. Now we have a situation where that's happening again, where AI is coming in and a lot of these companies are going to replace all their humans with AI's, including construction companies, including like people like, oh, well, bro, have you not seen the robots that are already coming out? What do you think that's going to be in five years? They're going to be able to do your job better than you, quicker than you. They're going to work 24 hours a day and you're going to have to figure out a way to make money or take what the government gets you. Unless they regulate this in some way, shape or form. So what's that look like? Does that look like an extra tax burden on the companies that use these things? What does it look like? But people cheering for this, they don't really understand what they're cheering for yet. And it's concerning because for companies to survive, they're going to have to adopt this technology, which means humans are going to become less and less of a part of everybody's business. And the culture isn't supporting that movement. Like they're not shopping with companies that don't use it. They're not saying fuck, dude, I'm going to spend all my money with companies that don't use AI. They're not there yet. And by the time they do, bro, those companies are going to be gone. So that's a whole other thing that nobody's talking about. That is definitely going to happen. Well, listen, it's definitely a fucking scary thought to think about it like that. And like, because I mean, the boom of that world, I mean, like you said, it's late 90s. It wasn't that far. It wasn't a long ago. You know what I'm saying? Here we are on another resurgence. I mean, dude, it's scary to think about me. So I mean, it would be, I'm interested to see what you're doing. Here's the thing, too. So they've retrained the consumer to not worry about price, but instead value convenience. Right. Right. Like people pay, even when they don't have the money, way more money for Grubhub and all these apps. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Yeah, bro. And now if you can't get them the product the next day, you know, they're calling you up on the phone and motherfucking you because Amazon's retrain the consumer to accept the level of convenience that only they can provide. So it's scary to think about you. Yeah. I mean, dude, it's a real, it's a real thing, man. Yeah. I mean, other things going on too. I want to bring this in because, you know, I firmly believe that the work the doge is doing is good, good work. It's necessary work. It's needed. But I wanted to bring our attention to the new onslaught of attacks that the left is trying to use. The first one being cruel trolls use heavily edited video to claim Elon Musk has abandoned his son. This was a new thing that just came out. And like, dude, I mean, it's so crazy when you go on social media and you see like the comments on this fucking video. It's insane. Like this one guy posted this video, his name is Joshua Reed, equal. He said Elon Musk walks off and leaves his four year old son wondering off stage by himself. This clip legitimately disturbs and saddens me. Here's the clip. Let's watch this clip. That's the clip. That's the clip. That's the clip. That's not the full clip. You want to see the full clip? Here's the full clip. That's awesome. That's awesome. The little kid starts cheering on the stairs. Elon goes and gets him in like cheers for him. But I mean, he's being a great dad and they're trying to turn it into he's a piece of shit. Bro, they edited that clip. That's a great dad. That's a great dad. That's great dad. I wish I had one. Why is that so funny? Do you say grape? Grape dad? Grape dad can't find him. It's like that first form of grape energy. I saw a fucking. I saw a fucking meme. I said, A-I, dude, I can't even fucking film. So I asked A-I to create a black terminator. So it shows the black, it shows the terminator. You see this? You see this? Oh, I did. Do you have it? Yeah, you fucking sent me that. I'm pretty sure you sent me that. Dude, it's got the terminator with like an afro. And he goes, I won't be back. Yeah, I'm pretty sure you sent me that. Oh, man. No, somebody sent me that. You didn't send me that. Okay. Yeah. Somebody sent me that. It was funny, though. I chuckled. Oh, Keith sent me that. Yeah. Yeah. But that was, you know, so they're trying to pull on that, which like dude, I think it would be real with you. I think going after like kids at all is like fucking low ball shit. Well, yeah, what do you expect, though? But you know, they hate to expect. So they fucking hate everybody. Yeah. They hate themselves. But here's another new attack that they're starting to use. Okay. So let's go here. Read this headline, Andy. VA, what is that Virginia? Virginia, yeah. Virginia Dem slams doge fans, compares job cuts to the Holocaust. First they came for the Jews. Okay. Now, I don't get the comparison. So, you know, and that can be taken out of context. Well, let's see the clip and what exactly this, this, uh, Democrat from Virginia. Well, let's see what he actually said. And Mr. Chair, I must say that I have seen so many different people on social media rather excited about these cuts, rather excited about these job losses. Um, and that reminds me of a quote from a long time ago that said at first, they came for the Jews and I didn't speak up because I wasn't Jewish. Then they came for the trade unionists and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. And then when they came for me, there was no one to speak up because everyone had been taken. And so I think what's very interesting is that these job cuts and these cuts are not just impacting people with federal jobs, but all across the board, people are going to be feeling the hurt. And we have to make sure we're doing what we can within the power that we have. I still don't get why we got to right make that. First of all, you don't have a right to have a job anywhere. Okay. Second of all, you guys have just been exposed for stealing our money at mass scale for decades. Third of all, we've all dealt with government employees. And if we had gone in there for the last 20 years and been treated with respect and not been told to go sit down over there and wait till your numbers called and buy someone who sit on their fucking ass or, you know, waiting in line for 30 minutes and then you get to the window and they throw a sign up that says they're going to lunch. Like, if we hadn't been treated that way, maybe people wouldn't be happy about it. Okay. So let's be honest, you're reaping what you sowed. You're having to sleep in the bed that you made. If we could go on and on about the old sayings here, but certainly first they came for the Jews, isn't one of them. No, it's not. It's not. And it's so stupid. But I want to move, move, move, change courses here because there was another new update that happened since the last episode. I think it's interesting too. How when people were comparing the COVID camps to the Holocaust, you were on a society. Oh, wait. You can't do that. Yeah, you were called, you know, anti-Semite and all these things that save and money. Yeah, right. But you can make the comparison for your job. Yeah, right. Okay. I'm trying to save money to fuck out of here. Yeah. But other things have also happened in this last little final touches on headlines. You we have deputy director for FBI Dan Mangino. So cash retail. He was just sworn in on Friday. He issued a post declaring that he is proud to welcome Dan Mangino as the next deputy director of the FBI. And so that's cool, right? Like that's cool. Mangino, we all know he proudly served for NYPD. He worked as a secret service agent for many years. He's also a conservative commentator. He has a damn Mangino show. All right. Cool. Now, I got to address the hypocrisy. I want you to. This is a political headline. Trump names podcaster Dan Mangino to be second and command at FBI. Yeah, right. Like he's only a podcast. Just podcast. CNN podcaster and ex secret service agent. Dan Mangino will be FBI deputy director. Trump says again. Well, this is like when they write shit about me. Podcast for YouTube. I mean, Jesus. All right. Whatever. But here's the thing. All right, cash. And I'm listening. I'm cool. Dan's cool. You're cool. I like it. Where is the Epstein list? I don't believe anything that these people say until that comes out. Where is it? Listen, they promise that over and over and over and over. They've promised to classification over and over and over and over. We have yet to see any of it. And the longer that it goes, the less I trust these people, it makes their credibility go down. I agree. A lot. Yeah. And dude, like, you know, Trump talking about eliminating the IRS and then not happening and all these things like bro, it's. I can get excited about, you know, things, but the longer they take to happen, I get less excited. And the less excited I get, the more I believe that these people are just part of the circus that they're, you know, that they're putting on for us. It was just the real, the real, the real issues at hand are not being addressed, such as the AI issue we just talked about. That's not being addressed. No one's talking about that. That's coming on the horizon real fast. You know, you know, the amount of money we send to other countries is not being addressed including Israel, including any country. Okay, that's not being addressed. It's being completely ignored. You know, fucking Bonsino's on TV saying, yeah, Epstein was a, a, a, a secret agent, black male agent. But for what country? I don't know. Motherfucker, you know exactly what country. You just don't want to say why is that? Mm-hmm. Dude. Now, I've looked, I'm just saying, dude, we're not addressing real issues. Yeah. You know, where's the account? Where are the arrests? Okay. And until those things happen, dude, we're getting federalized as shit as far as I'm concerned. No. Listen, I've looked and looked and the only update that we have as, as of right now, when the show's being recorded, is from Elena Habba, who is one of Trump's attorneys. Right. She's, she's awesome. She's a fucking pretty badass. She's pretty badass. But she just did an interview and she says transparency is coming. They don't want anyone to know who was on Epstein's island, who was a pito, and who was probably still sitting in DC. So she just went on Fox and had this to say. Attorney General Pam Bondy is now vowing to release the bombshell Jeffrey Epstein documents. She says it's sitting on her desk. You know, do you have any insight on what's coming? Transparency. Transparency is coming. You know, we had a lot of defiance, I think, as the word you were looking for from the radical left. And that's because they would have rather us kept quiet. They didn't want to expose the funding that they were getting through NGOs, through USAID. And now they're going to panic because they don't want anybody to know who was on Epstein island, who was a pito, and who was probably still sitting in DC. And the reality of the situation is this, there will be accountability and America deserves it. We needed to know what the drones are. We need to know that we were okay. We need to know about Epstein's island. We want to know about JFK. The days of American government hiding from American people are over. We need transparency. We have done that. And we will continue to do so. I'm excited for Pam and now Cash to get in there and clean up our mess. I hope she's telling the truth. Rub it out. Yeah. Listen, man. I'm not going to be satisfied with bits and pieces and crumbs and shit and redacted fucking statements or any of this shit. We want full disclosure. And if we don't get full disclosure and we don't get the things that we are promised, this administration is just another administration of bullshit. Yeah. Okay. And nobody wants to say that because everybody wants to be on the right side. The side you should be on is the side of American people, regardless of who's in office. And I do like Trump. And I like the shitty says. And I like his personality because it's very similar to mine. All right. But and I like the things that they say they're doing. But we have yet to see them and I have so little trust in our government and the elite class of this society until I see those things happen. I'm not going to clap and cheer because I feel like a lot of people are preemptively celebrating when we haven't really fixed any of the problems. What do you think about that? I mean, where are you at with that? The absolute shit. Yeah, just like the overall like, bro. I'm listening. I mean, it's always been in the back of my mind, right? Because I know you you set it out there and like, it's hard for me to like want to admit it. But there, I mean, listen, like, I mean, I would be ignorant to say like, and anybody would be ignorant to say like, there is a possibility that this could be a fucking, you know, leading the blind off the fucking cliff. Okay. It's possibility. I would hate for that to be the circumstance. You know, but again, I mean, bro, like you said day one, cash. Or past day one. Where past it? Past it. I agree with that. Where past it? So, so my mind now, again, like that's eroding your credibility. It's eroding the trust that you guys are, you know, promising the American people. I brought like get it out. Everything needs to come out. I don't care who's on the list. Listen to it. I don't care if it's people I like. Obviously, I don't care if it's people I hate. Get it out. Yeah. And not only that brother, um, we need to have an effective belief. In our government because the American people put a lot of trust into these people. And the amount of trust that I can give the government right now is legitimately way less than zero. It's the opposite of trust because everything I look at, I'm looking beneath the surface every time. And I think most people are at that point. We're like, okay, well, they say this. What's that mean? What's the dangers of that though? I know, brother. What I'm saying is that we shouldn't fucking have to do that. Yeah. That we should understand what's happening. And there are so many classified scientific experiments and technology and all of the shit that they don't want us to know. And I believe that they don't want us to know the truth about the human race and what we're capable of for the purpose of control. Okay. I believe there's all kinds of things that are kept secret. That's not to protect us. No. Right. Right. That's not okay. We pay for this shit. So when, if we're paying for this, wouldn't you like to know those things? Wouldn't you like to know the truth? Wouldn't you like to see the actual data? Wouldn't you like to know what people are actually capable of or what cares exists that we're not privy to? Like, there hasn't been any of these things. And so when's that going to happen? Because for me, personally, to trust anything these people say, it's going to require full transparency, full transparency. Not, you know, oh, well, you know, that's a danger to the American people and national security concern. Motherfucker, we're done with that. Everything's a national security concern. Right. I'm just, that's what it's going to take for me. And I believe that we, a citizens, have a reasonable right to demand that. No, 100%. I agree. You know, there might be some things going on in the world today that we shouldn't know. Like maybe there's some things that if we knew it would give up strategy, you know, to something that's happening. Clendeston Appalachian. Right now, for sure. Right now. That's, you know, but, but this, this idea, no, we're talking about the class of, like how the, the, the farmer companies want to classify the data for 75 years. And by the way, what's happening with them? What's going on with those companies? You see, like, it feels like everything's changing, but how much is actually changing? You know, and, and there's, you know, I see these people saying, we're so back, we're so back, we're so, it might feel that way. But where's the actual substance? Yeah. Right? Show me the pudding. Bro, for real. Yeah. For real, dude. I'm with it. Now, and that doesn't mean that I think these people are bad. I operate companies, dude. I understand that from the time that you come up with a plan to the time exact, executed can take time. I get that. I get that. But there should be some symbolic things that happen along the way that show people that, that these people are not fucking around. Yeah. Meaning, they should have fucking released that Epstein list within an hour of cash batel being confirmed to show people, like, hey, we're going to do what we say. This should have been a symbolic thing that happened. You know what I'm saying? Bro. They have yet to do anything like that. And it's been sitting on a pair of bondies desk for, I mean, where I'm most at four or five days now. Well, look, man, I'm, I hope. And at this point, I still expect for a lot of this to happen. I do think it's some of it's going to happen, but how far and how deep and how wide. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Now, one little last thing on this, that's interesting. I just want to put this out of here on the radar. All right. Do you remember us talking about this last week? Trump says he's going to check if somebody stole Fort Knox $400 billion gold supply. Remember us talking about that, right? You know, again, like, you know, people, you know, joking, like, you know, there's nothing in there. And it probably isn't anything in there. But I thought this was weird. Okay. I saw this headline. My banks are flying gold bars on commercial flights from London to New York City. Just thought that was a little weird. Well, do you not remember me telling you that it all got sold to London when you brought this up? That's, that's, that's a little known fact. And by the way, that was like 80 years ago. Mm-hmm. And now they're trying to bring it back in. Maybe not 80, but the point was it was a long time ago. Yeah. And now they're trying to bring it back in before it gets exposed. I just not there anyway. Just a little weird, man. Well, grow up, you know, look, dude, I have friends that are very good friends that are very smart who feel that we are getting steered into digital currency, digital ID, master valence state. And that people just feel better about it because it's Trump and it's not them. And like, dude, I, you know, look, dude, it's hard to argue that argument because of, like, technology can't be pursued for the sake of technology. That will eventually get dangerous. And we are to that point, right? Look, man, at the end of the day, I don't know what's going to happen, but it doesn't, there's something that feels not right. And I don't know, I don't share the same enthusiasm that I feel like everybody else shares. You know what I mean? I don't know if it's just like I've learned over my life to not celebrate until things are done. I don't know. I just, there's something in me that doesn't feel right. Yeah, guys, let's know what you think down in the comments. Do you feel that way? With this Epstein stuff, just all I'm starting, well, I'm saying like this has been like, I would say a tip to it. I'm definitely leaning more to it. You know, I just try to keep my mind on the mindset that like, I'm not in those rooms. Like there's people I trust that are in those rooms. Yeah, they have been on this show. That's say that. No, that say things are going to happen. Yeah, right, right. That's what I'm saying. So like, I mean, there's a thousand different things that could be going on that I'm just not privy to. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? So like, that's true. It's, so I mean, like you talk about benefit of the doubt. I go, you know, it's there. Like I think a healthy skepticism is good. It's good to have for sure. You know, I'm going because of the day, bro, like whether they're good or bad, it still comes down to us. You know, it's the same stuff that we talk about all the time. Like it comes down to us. Like Trump's not going to say about fucking life or fix your bank account or do any of the show, bro, you got to do it. Dude, and that's what I'm saying, bro, like we're not, you can't go back to sleep. You have to understand that culture will be what we make it as individuals. And if we want a great culture, which then develops a great political environment, we have to live that as individuals. That's why I always say personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion. If you don't live the example of what you think an American citizen should be, then we will never have a country the way you think it should be because we as individuals make up the collective. And it's, you know, everybody has this mentality of like, I'm going to look over here and I'm going to look over, you know, he'll take care of it or they'll do it or it's like a bystander effect. And dude, that's why our culture has degraded because everybody else thinks that everybody else is going to fix it. And if everybody else thinks everybody else is going to fix it, then it will never be fixed. So we have to take responsibility as individuals to live to a higher standard, to do the best that we can to become what we are capable of becoming, to set an example for the people around us, our family, our friends, our neighborhood, our communities, our city, our state. Once somebody goes, then other people join. And if we get enough people to go and enough people to join, culture will be what we want it to be. And these motherfuckers will have to do what we say. So 100% man, it's just, we can't, you know, I see a lot of people celebrating like it's over, bro, this is, this is far from over. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said, let's get to our third and final headline, headline number three, got to go through a little Ukraine update. Let's talk about it. Trump issues dire warning. World War Three warning. If Russia, Ukraine, they'll not worked out as he meets a crown. So Donald Trump just outlined today the stakes in play. If a piece deal is not secured in Ukraine, warning that any overspill could trigger World War Three. There will be a point where it is not going to stop at those two countries, he said already there is such involvement from other countries and it could really lead to a very big war. World War Three. And we're not going to let that happen either. So you know, this was made as he's meeting President Emmanuel McCall in France. They're meeting at the White House right now. Well, by the way, it's married to a dude. A dude. A dude. I'll say it. Did you see that canister? Bro, she, she, how are you going to argue that you can't lay it out any more clearly? Yeah. And I mean, listen, like, I mean, it seems to be a fucking pattern there. You know, I'm saying dude, it's a theme amongst the world, the globalist world rulers. Obama. Can't just do Obama next. Not only that, that's what I was saying. I believe that a lot of these people are legitimately what we hear the, what we think are the crazy people say and they're fucking, they're, it's a big group of fucking pedophiles. Yeah. Yeah, bro. Why else would they normalize pedophilia? Who normalizes pedophilia? Only those people, pedophiles. Yeah, that's right. I mean, it's very simple. Yeah, minor, minor attracted person. Yeah. You got government officials in Europe arguing for children to have the consent right to choose who they want to have sex with in front, like, imagine this dude. You're a child to be able to consent to having sex with grownups. Only pedophiles. Yeah. Only the motherfuckers that want to have sex with them. Bro, it's insane. Like it's insane. But, but we can't have, you know, 20 year old, genius computer hackers fucking disassembling the government because they don't know what the fuck they're doing, right? But, right. And the kid who's six years old can decide who they want to have sexual relations with according to some of the government officials over in Europe. And we all know that Europe is more progressive than the United States. So what's going to happen here next if it's allowed to continue? It's going to, those people are going to be saying that here openly. There is people that say that here openly on the internet, you know, like, it's crazy shit. And I think that the pedophile culture is much bigger than what we believe it to be. And I believe that those people have somehow figured out a way to get to the top. And I believe that we're going to find a lot of that out. And it's going to be really hard for people to accept because it sounds insane. It's sounding insane the first time I heard it too. The first time I heard it, I was like, dude, what the fuck are you smoking? But then you start looking and then you start paying attention. And then we start like looking at things and it sure does see. And by the way, this is in alignment with the ruling class across history. All right. If you go back to the Roman Empire, you go back to like these, these old civilizations, having young children be their lovers is, it was a normal thing. Yeah. Okay. I mean, it's a, it's a power thing. That's what it is. Because we're in the sense that's right. When you have unlimited amounts of money and you have unlimited amounts of power, there are certain things that get these people off. And I believe that the, the kid thing is one of them. Yeah. We'll see. But on the Ukraine thing, so you remember a talking last week, I'm like, you know, it's like, you know, the list he was getting mad because he wasn't a part of the peace deals and shit. And like, I'm like, I think I, I've paraded it to like, you know, being at the kids' table while the grownups are talking, right? So the UK has decided to jump in the conversation. Starmer, Warren's Trump, that Ukraine must be involved in peace talks as he braces for a showdown in Washington, telling Keith, summit marking three years since Putin invasion that the US president has created an opportunity. So they did this like emergency meeting on Ukraine or all the world leaders are over there right now, weirdly enough, like, you know, they go to a war zone to have this like emergency meeting. It's kind of weird, but whatever. But yeah, he wants to, he's demanding that Ukraine be a part of these peace talks. Okay. All right, Zelensky, let's give you an opportunity. But come on over to the table, what you got to say, you know what he says, give us more money. He will resign in exchange for NATO entry. The very, the very reason the war got, go back to the fucking kid's table, dude. Listen, man, Omar Gaddafi. Okay, you know what, you know what the United States did? Kill them. They armed them. And then they killed them. Kill them. Do you know what they did? Is it an army saying? Yeah, armed them. They armed them and then kill them. And then they killed them. Zelensky doesn't understand history. Oh, we've armed them. Yeah. So I don't know that it's the best idea for him personally to be demanding anything. You should probably shut the fuck up little guy and hope that you don't get drone strike on your fucking house. I'm blame that I don't rush it. Yeah, no shit, bro. Because that's the, that's also the thing where we kill them. We blame it on somebody else for doing it. Yeah. Yeah. But also, you know, there was, there was, there was top, wasn't their talk of, didn't Trump, didn't we, did we cover that on the show? The, the resources and minerals of Ukraine? Is that true? Well, from everything that I've been seeing, that's all, like that's supposed to be a separate deal as a payback of all the money that we've sent them. Okay. So basically they're saying we sent you all this shit. You're going to give us half of your fucking natural resources. Right. And Zelensky's claiming that it wasn't alone. It was a grant. That's right. So what happened when Kadafi didn't share the resources or synombed it and share the resources and tried to try their own research? What happened? You keep them? We went there and we fucking killed them and we took the shit. They're right. Do you think it's possible that this is repeating itself again, meaning he's going to object to the natural resources coming to the United States? And then we're just going to end up going over there and killing him and getting it. I would say that history tends to repeat itself over and over and over. And then the next question should be from everybody is what's going to happen to the country of Ukraine after a few generations of men have been conscribed and killed? What's going to happen there? Okay, because there is a plan, you just don't know it. There's a lot of empty houses now. There'll be a lot of empty men. I mean, like, how do you use it? I mean, a population has to be able to survive there, right? There's nobody there now. A lot of real estate opportunities. I'll say that. If you don't think there's a plan for Ukraine, you're insane. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to know where all the fucking money went. Like, I mean, they, you know, the senior defense official, you know, who stole 40 million fucking dollars of US money? What's happening with him? You got suspended? You just get suspended. You know, I, or like, you know, when Zelensky said, you know, that, you know, they received $177 billion in eight. You know, we got so funny to see what these people have to say about that. You know, this is from political fact. They say, oh, Zelensky's statement about Ukraine aid didn't reveal money in long-during operation. No. The money isn't being laundered. It's being spent as Congress intended. So how the fuck does that make sense? It doesn't. That's a lie. It's being spent as Congress intended, meaning that it was intended to find its way back to their pockets. Yeah. It's legal. Legal. Legal. Legal. Legal. Legal. Legal. Legal. Legal. You know that's what I used to do. You know, it was really weird to say chicken or something together. Except for what they did. For how long now?tycznie I do. I hope they do fuckin' drown strike his face for real world. at this point, dude. We're good at it. I'm so sick seeing him walk in these events. When he's five foot How tall is this is Zelensky? I heard he's five eight. There's no way five seven seven there is no he's five four. He's probably like five five three. is 5'4", says their 5'7. Right. So he's 5'4". So here we go, little man. And he behaves like he's got little man's disease. He has a little man complex. Yeah. I mean, look at him, bro. He's not even as tall as that lady. And that lady... Yeah, it's heeled on. Yeah. That lady's not a big lady. Those are just average sized dudes there. None of those dudes are 6'7". So I don't know what this has to do with anything. Like, I guess it would take a half of a drone strike. You know, like... I just can't stand the dude. And then he walks in with his commando outfit on. Like he's fucking badass. It's like, bro, we've all seen you dance around in lingerie. And stilettos. Yeah. You ain't fooling anybody. Once you see that, you can't undo it. You definitely can't not unsee it. Yeah. Yeah, man. I'm walking in with this fucking fake ass, you know, raspy voice. It's like, bro, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how deep your voice is when you're fucking, you know, 5'2, 5'4". Yeah. We're 8. Doesn't matter, bro. Is everybody else here? Hey, guys. Please give me more money. Yeah. Yeah, man, guys, jump in on the conversation. Let us know what you guys got down in the comments, man. But that being said, final second of the show. We got thumbs up. We're dumb as fuck. Because we're bringing a headline in. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. You've been talking about hockey lately. I like hockey. I told everybody not to talk shit. You did tell everybody not to talk shit. You did. But yeah, so let's go to hockey. We're thumbs up. We're thumbs up. We're dumb as fuck. Headline reads, NHL referee goes tumbling to the ice after getting hit in the groin with the pup. It's just sucks. It sucks, man. Let's dive into this NFL NHL referee Justin Key was in the wrong place. The wrong time on Sunday afternoon, standing in the line of fire as a pup came at him and hit him directly in the groin. I knew the end of the Western conference clash between the Vancouver canyx and the Utah hockey club. What? What is that? Canyx, you're faking that. You know, I'm not, bro. I'm not fucking Canadian. What is that? Canucks. Yes. Okay. All right. Excuse me. I'm not. I mean, shit. What is that? Like, what is that? Canucks. Yeah. Is this a racist shit? No. It just means like Canadian. Oh, that's what canuck means. Yeah. Canuck. Meaning. Oh, what Canadian? Okay. Why don't they just say Canadian? Because there's another team called the Montreal Canadians. Oh. Let's do it. Well, you would think they had a better name too. That's what I'm saying. I got some scary shit up there in Canada, bro. Why don't you get one of these animals or something, you know? Like, I don't know. They're f**king what they call it. Moose, what do they call it? Moose Knuckles? What is that? They had to put some fear in somebody. The Vancouver Moose Knuckles. That's the scary shit out of me. Oh, but yeah, man, he got hit in the balls, man. Let's check this clip out. Well, it's not up. Obviously, you see, he knows what they're doing. But he doesn't know is that the official is standing right there in the line of fire. And that is not something you want to see anyone. I'll tell you what, he just got a great, great round of applause from the crowd here at Delta Center. If he didn't put you, you could hit him now. I was thinking, I've never been hitting the balls. Like, you're like, like hot, you know what I'm saying? Bro, I used to play lacrosse. And in lacrosse, I played long stick, which is defense. Bet you did. Yeah, of course. Yeah, right. Played that gersetick, too, you know what I'm saying? So I was out there playing defense and this f**king guy, like an underhand a shot lacrosse is like a pretty hard shot if someone knows how to do it right. I was guarding this kid and he's good, too. And I was guarding him good. So he's getting pissed off because he couldn't f**king score. This kid was like an all-state player. And so like, dude, so like eventually he gets pissed off because he couldn't f**king score and he f**king got somebody passed him the ball. And then he scooted back like six yards, like a wait, he went away from me like six yards. What the f**k is this guy doing? And he wound up an underhand shot right at my f**king balls, bro. Yeah, and he hit me in a ball and instantly I f**king puked. Yeah, bro. And I was like f**ked up for like two weeks because my sh** swelled up to the size of like f**king racquet balls. Like it was your black for real. Yeah. And f**king turd purple and everything. It stayed that way. Yeah, I'm like dude, f**king, but dude. What a douche move. Well, he's trying to get me out of the f**king ways so he can score some goals. He went on a score like three goals and he gave me. Yeah, so it was a good proposition for him. But man, you get penalty for that? No, that's what happens in the cross. You hit by the ball. I can't do anything illegal. But he definitely did it on purpose. Yeah, f**k, that sucks. Yeah, I've never been like hitting the balls like that. Consider yourself lucky. Yeah, I mean, I don't wish that I'm a worse enemy. I don't think that gave him a full shot in the balls there because we would have seen some puke. Yeah, I mean, dude, it looked like it went pretty fast. I know, like those, those pucks, they go pretty fast, don't they? Oh, f**k yeah. You see, you see, you see, you know, where the net is. I mean, I don't think it hit him in the balls, bro. I think it hit him close to the balls. You see, you see, perfect. Like because it looks like, you know, it's a little far down there. Yeah, he's white. It's true. You know, you got to get it to look at. Oh, he's conooked, right? Yeah, well, that's even higher. Yeah, up in there. Yeah, me probably spilled a little maple syrup, you know? Oh, man, you know, he's all right, though, you know, he's all right. Give it thumbs up. He survived. Walk it off. Ice it. I bet thumbs up on that guy's, Andy. That is all I got. All right, guys, don't forget tomorrow night, 7 p.m., Real America Freedom Gear release at RealAmericanFreedom Gear.com. Don't be a hoe. Shout it, shout. Yeah. Never sleepin' on the floor.
