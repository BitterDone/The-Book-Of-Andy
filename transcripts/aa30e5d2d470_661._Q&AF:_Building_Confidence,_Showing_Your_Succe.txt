We're you submit the questions and we give you the answers now you can submit your questions to be answered on this show a few different ways the first way is guys you can email those questions in to

throughout the week you're going to hear CTI that stands for cruise the internet so we put topics on the screen we talk about what's going on in the world we speculate on what's true what's not true and then we talk about what the solution is and what we the people have to do to make that solution materialize sometimes we have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes and we're giving you some real talks and things that I think you need to hear then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus where people who have completed the 75 hard program which is the world's largest mental transformation program they come on they talk about how their life was before usually a shitshow how their life is now no longer a shitshow and how you can do the same in your life using the 75 hard program if you're unfamiliar with the 75 hard program it is the initial phase of the live hard program which you can get the entire program for free at episode 208 on the audio feed only it's not on YouTube there is a book called the book on mental toughness on my website you can buy which will detail the entire program as well plus a whole bunch of other chapters on mental toughness what it is how to develop it why it's important and how it'll change your life so you can get the book on my website and for sale.com and other than that you can also get the program for free at episode 208 on audio feeds so we have this thing on the show we say pay the fee what that means is we need you to share the show all right we talk about things on the show that usually get us throttled they traffic banned or censored or whatever man it all kinds of stuff they really hate us on the internet and so I need you guys to help us get the message out so if you're a regular listener of the show I ask you very simply that if you get value out of a single episode please share that episode please share it with one friend if you brought me one friend for every time you listen to the show the message that you enjoy that you believe is important would be out there so that's what I ask of you guys and I ask that because I don't fill the trade I'm making a trade okay this is a deal all right the deal is I pass on spending 30 minutes talking about ads on the show which would be 10 plus million dollars for me a year it would be eight figures a year for me in income and I fund the show myself so you don't have to deal with that shit and it can actually say what I actually want to say and I have to abide by these companies policies and in exchange I ask that you share the show out for us I think that's a fair trade so I just ask that you share the show and help us getting out there so don't be a hell show the show all right what's up DMV today huh yeah man how was that you know I mean you know it's the DMV I don't you know I don't I've never understood like you know I remember watching all the shows and they always had this like stigma on the DMV I just don't understand why it exists like stigma yeah like of like just or why it's actually like that like why is it actually like that like I like it doesn't have to be you know well that's what you get when you provide no incentive for people to process and do their jobs at a timely manner you know if that was an actual privatized business it would run completely different yeah you know like if it was if it was if people were incentivized right to process the amount like let's say every single uh you know license every single permit every single thing they did they got three dollars for five dollars for how quick do you think they would get shit done oh yeah right they don't move in that we got since we got we had to go like you come in you get your shit oh well you forgot this you got to wait this yeah then you come back oh we got to do this thing too yeah yeah they make it such a fucking miserable process yeah every once in a while you go in there and you'll get someone who's extremely helpful yeah um but it's not the norm man I just don't get it I do I mean I get it but I don't I just do you I mean what do the people that typically work in these places look like they look like they don't give a fuck about anything and they have found their way into a job that allows them to be themselves they come to work they're unkempt they're 300 pounds overweight they don't give a shit about anything bro so what do you think that they give about your license that's true they don't care I think too I think a little bit of that too is the problem in the world yeah 100% but I think I think another little piece of that tube row is like anytime there's like there there's positions of authority like that yeah they love to flex it they flex the shit out of yeah because that's the only time someone like that has that a thing man people that have real authority don't flex it like that no because but dude you got to remember these people don't and haven't done anything in their lives and this is their job they don't take it serious they don't give a fuck and they treat people like shit because they can because there's nothing you can do about it so and I appreciate the good ones that are out there everyone's a while I get in there and there's some people that really care and they don't want you to run around they value your time they treat you at respect but it is the minority in that in that area so the reason those stereotypes exist is because it's fucking true the reason I should have got one person that works to the community that's listening to me yeah well do better job you better be the fucking best one oh shit and not only that on top of that um there's a reason all stereotypes exist it's not because they're bullshit let's just say that right now these are the amount of truth in there yes that's real it's why they exist that's real shit you cannot have a stereotype exist that doesn't have a larger amount of truth to it otherwise it would be a joke right be goosebumps myths yeah yeah like it wouldn't make sense to people it would be it would go right what do you mean yeah what do you mean yeah the government's corrupt yeah right yeah oh man we're guys let's get into it man I guess we're good ones for you all right let's get into I'm just thinking I'm thinking of a stereotype that doesn't have truth there's not one yeah you know that's the you know these people they want to fight all these stereotypes and social justice it's like there's a reason that these things exist it's it's because they're true yeah it's true shit man the guys let's get into this man guys any question number one Andy your podcast has changed my life and I just got your new book and I blew through it in one week because I couldn't put it down yeah I have one question though confidence how do I find it within myself if I feel like it's just not in me period I like like I I have it and never show lack of it but deep down the truth is I feel like I have no idea what it really is I'm a small business owner I provide and do well for my family I have a great five star rating on Google and Yelp but man I feel a huge void when it comes to never feel like I deserve anything I have or good that ever comes and it happens it's it's hello fucking frustrating and a present can we can we just take a diving and confidence yeah there's a lot to unpack here number one you're are driven human being and and if you're a driven human being who is wired for success and ambition and growth and change you are always going to feel like you're not where you're supposed to be you're always going to feel like you should have done more you could have done more you could have been better you should be further along I'm behind these are common feelings with anyone who has working to achieve anything any champion that is out there at the top of their game if you crack their hope and you looked in there their brain is not filled with all of these what the average person would think all of these headlines about how great they are it is filled with insecurity doubt things that motivate them things that people have said to them chips on their shoulder slights disrespect things that make them feel less than which is why in reality they push harder to develop a bigger better game whatever that game they're playing is so you happen to be someone because you are an entrepreneur someone who is driven you are building something you are creating something and I would bet that if you were sitting right in front of me right now and I asked you if you feel behind you would say yes and that's because everybody feels like they're behind when they're in that game so you have to understand that is the way you're wired that is how it is everybody else feels the same way and if they're out there in their boy's year and they're cocky and they're talking all this shit it's usually a cover for their own insecurity okay so that's number one number two you're going to never feel confidence until you start keeping the promises that you make to yourself on a regular basis and these are the small promises and the big promises if you constantly had a friend who came to you and told you they were going to get in shape they were going to get their money together they were going to get their life together and they told you that over and over and over again but then every single time you saw them in public two hours three hours later they're drinking beer they're eating shit they're doing all this bullshit every single time you task them with something to do they fail at it they fail to accomplish that task how much confidence are you going to have in that friend zero you're going to know that everything that that friend tells you is going to be bullshit all right and that friend is you that friend exists inside of you so when you tell yourself you're going to do all these things I'm going to get in shape I'm going to get my money right I'm going to get my business going I'm going to take care of my career I'm going to be better with my family I'm going to do this and this and this and this and this and this and you fail to do those things on a daily basis you are losing confidence in yourself bit by bit by bit by bit it's like a bank account you are either putting a deposit in or you are making a withdrawal out and every single time that you do not keep the promises that you make to yourself you are making withdrawals which means your confidence level will always be low so that's the second part to this so what you need to work on here brother is one you need to recognize the driven people always feel behind and they're always going to have doubt they're always going to have chips on the shoulder that's what makes us fucking great at what we do when we become great it's not the affirmations it's not the feel good bullshit it's the fucking dark shit it's the people that told us we were losers it's the people that told us we were pieces of shit it's all that stuff and anybody who tells you different they haven't achieved anything look at what they've achieved value them on that it's probably a bunch of smoking mirrors real motherfuckers remember all the dark shit they take the dark shit and they put it in a productive action to build the life that they want and because that's the way that most of these people operate they always end up feeling behind they always end up feeling like it wasn't good enough I bet if you go talk to Michael Jordan who's the greatest fucking basketball player ever to play the game and you had a real conversation with him real no cameras no fucking people around and you said what do you think about your career you know what he's going to say I could have done way better I could have done this I could have done that I could have done this I could have done that I wish I would have done that I missed this shot I did this wrong and he's going to talk about all those things because that's what fucking champions focus on they focus on the shit that all the things that are wrong and then they fix all those things which ends up making them great so you're wired this way otherwise you wouldn't be out trying to build your own business and start your own thing so you have to remember that and you have to remember that confidence is built it is a bank account you make deposits or withdrawals and most people only make withdrawals and then try to cover for all their withdrawals with a bunch of false provato that is very easy to pick up if you know what you're looking for all right so if you want confidence you got to build confidence that's what the live hard program is truly all about it's about building an actual stack of evidence that says you are who you say you are and when you can look at the stack of evidence to say I am who the fuck I say I am and you could remind yourself when you have all this doubt and you have all this dark shit and you have all this drive that makes you feel behind but you can stop and you could say wait a minute I've done this I've done this I've done this I've done this I've done this I did this thing I'm this I'm this I'm this I'm this and have a conscious reminder of who you are you can ex out all those feelings at any time you want when I start because I'm a very driven competitive when I start to feel myself get down on myself and I stop myself and I say hey wait a minute bro you started a business were 12 grand 25 years ago that now employees thousands of fucking people okay now you have a thing you know go through the list of all the shit that I've done and all the good that's come of that and then I'm like wait a minute I'm the fucking man what the fuck am I talking about right and now the sudden that shit goes away and then I have access to it when I need it now when it shouldn't be there you see what I'm saying it makes sense perfect yeah because look do you want to have the dark shit because it's useful yeah but you don't want it the forefront of your mind all the time because it'll drive you crazy right so you need this shit and you need to remember like like dude there's times were like when I get lazy and I'm like wait a minute there's a bunch of young motherfuckers trying to take my shit they think they're better than me you know what fuck them right that's you know what I'm saying yeah so this is real shit and by the way that's no disrespect because I'm friends with all my competitors I actually value and respect and love them because their wins motivate me to keep going otherwise if no one's chasing me where the fuck am I gonna go I have to chase or be chased and that that is the truth for all winners bro the minute that you have nobody to chase and the minute nobody's chasing you you're dead it's over so that's my take on this bro you've got to make deposits you got to be aware of how you're wired when you get too dark you got to remind yourself of the shit that you're doing that's why doing the power list and seeing your progress is so valuable going back and saying wait for the last 180 days I have four losses no one else has four losses right now all of a sudden you don't feel so bad you're like wait I'll move the need to leave it if it can't be seen out there which helps you feel better so there's a lot to this there's a lot of nuance to this but that's the general answer yeah I mean we were that when I was initially reading this question it's like I'm like okay well what does confidence have to do with this but I see they work in tandem almost like you need the dark energy but the confidence having that confidence that you've done yeah dark energy dark energy is absolutely necessary right I don't care who you are I don't care what you've accomplished how many trees you hooked bro real people who have built real things in real life have a dark side fucking all of them okay Tim Grover writes about this in his books yeah people who are great have positive motivation I want to become this I want to build this I want to do this I want to create this I want to do it for these reasons because it's going to cause these things to happen and these reasons have to be outside of self to be big enough to get everybody else to help you do it okay and it has to be real if it's not real people won't buy in and do it with you and then you also have to have the other side which is all the people that told you you were a loser all the people that told you to get a real job all the people that told you you weren't going to be shit all the people that laughed at you and said uh you need to be more humble you need to remember where you came from people people like you don't do things like that from here you know all this bullshit that we all hear all the people that laughed at us all the smart ass comments on Instagram you put those over there on the negative okay and you use both real winners use both they don't just use one they don't just do affirmations and feel all good there's a reason why those people get their fucking asses beat because they are only drawing on 50% of the available energy to drive you forward they want to be virtuous and they want to say you know what I hope everybody wins well guess what mother fucker there's only one spot on the podium that says number one that's reality so you can want and wish and desire things to be different but there is still reality to deal with and the reality that you and I and everybody else has a deal with is that we are in a real competition it is real shit there is only so much space for what you want to do where you want to do it and so to do that you have to be great and to get great you have to use both sides of the energy equation which are positive and negative and you fuckers that think you're too virtuous to use a negative you're gonna get fucking crushed by people who can use both so it's the truth it's been that way for fucking you make the rules man it's been that way for thousands of years yeah this is not made up this is the way it is I don't know what to do yeah I didn't make the rules bro yeah damn sure gonna play by it if you have a fucking if you have a fucking formula one car okay and you're running a race and everybody else runs on four brand new tires the two fronts and the two rears and you only change the rears because you think that's the way it should be what's gonna happen to you you're gonna fucking lose okay and you're gonna lose over and over and over and over and over again because your belief is not based in reality even though you believe it yeah it's just a virtuous self it's it's virtue it it's virtuous masturbating is what it is you're masturbating your virtue you're saying oh I'm such a good person because I don't have any of the dark energy in my life and I'm at peace yeah you're also broke you're also getting killed you're also losing at the very thing you claim to want to do it your life because you refuse to acknowledge the reality of both sides of the energy equation yeah and the dark side three the dark side is far more powerful for most people if you can harness it the problem is people ignore it or they're not willing to look at it or they just dismiss it all as haters oh that's just a bunch of haters actually bro I had a guy on fucking Instagram in 2015 and I got the comment in my mother fucking phone I look at it all of time it says was a CEO is a CEO too successful to use his own products a fat fuck you know what happened in 2015 I lost a hundred pounds and the company grew hundreds of millions of dollars since then I should send this guy a fucking check because every single time that I haven't felt like doing what the fuck I need to do I opened my phone and I'm like yeah fuck that guy and I put my phone down and I get to work that's how you do it bro fuck man I love that man I love it guys any question up to Andy I'm a 30 year old entrepreneur who aspires to live life on a similar level to yours one day as I've become more successful I've noticed people clients and contractors are hired making comments about the nice vehicle I drive not in a complimentary way but more so of a must be nice or this guy must be ripping a software now as someone who is motivated by nice houses and cars etc how do you deal with this perception from others and ultimately employees that may see my material wealth in the future and not think that they are getting the short end of the stick have you ever had this this like moral dilemma I guess do you want anybody working for you that doesn't want nicer things for their own life do you want anybody associated with you that doesn't want to win do you want anybody associated do you want to do business with anybody that isn't trying to win on the biggest fucking scale you want to be surrounded by poor little me's who say oh must be nice yeah it is fucking nice it's been 25 fucking years of my entire life I traded it all to have this life it's really fucking nice while you were out doing all your shit and taking your vacations and traveling the world and getting in touch with nature wherever the fucking is you do guess what I was doing I was working all those relationships you had those four five year relationships where you went out and partied and did this and you went through four different careers along the way you know what I was doing this okay so it is nice it's not must be nice it is nice that's what I say when people say must be nice okay I have no fucking apologies for what I've done because I have given everything I fucking have to have it all right lots of good is creative from that lots of people have careers from that millions of people have changed their lives because of that all right do you think any of these people would have believed in me if I wasn't a driven human being if I pulled up an afford fucking focus with rusted out buckets and I gave these motivational talks with anybody fucking here what I'm saying no no fucking change okay what I have a what I have a company full of highly motivated killers if they didn't realize that I was a winner myself and that I was very serious about fucking winning you see what I'm saying yeah you don't want these people around you bro fuck those people okay that's it now fucking love it yeah what now was there a transition a because you know like early on a business that's a them problem yeah that's a them problem yeah and it's a good filter for you to use to weed out people's mentality yeah I do not want a single person surrounding me that doesn't want nicer shit for themselves now they're nicer shit might be different I got guys here that have lots of animals and they own a little farms and they do other things they they have you know they're not gonna be a lot yeah I don't got to be cars don't got to be a house but they want nicer shit for themselves they want nicer life they're highly motivated inspired by success I don't want a single person around me not even with a hundred miles around me that would say something like that so you should use that as a filter to filter out every single motherfucker that ever says anything with you lose their number don't do business with them if they're a contractor viewers don't use them find someone who wants to win because what they're really telling you is I don't have any intention of ever going where you're trying to go why would you do business with that you know I'm saying from that standpoint it makes perfect sense I was thinking like you know like in your journey right like when you started to see the success right like when you started to see it because I feel like what in their story about like the first Lambo you had yeah I struggle with this because it's a natural way to do it right you have nothing to start winning and it's uncomfortable yeah yeah and that was so how quick yeah so let me tell you stories so I bought my first Lambo game in 2012 2011 or 12 okay it was I think it was I don't know it was 11 or 12 I can't remember and it's a huge deal for me you know huge fucking deal huge deal but dude I I felt the same way this person feels because I was around a lot of people at that time who are still very much so just gonna live their life like everybody else does which by the way that's fine if that's what you want to do fine if it's really what you want to do if it's really what you want to do but I'm not buying your shit of pretending that that's what you actually wanted when in reality I've heard you talk about all this other shit your whole life and the truth is you're just too pussy to go out and build it right all right don't buy don't fill me with that shit I have friends that don't give a fuck about anything money wise yeah I love those people but it's real it's real shit they don't care okay and actually those are some of the most interesting people where I have a problem with it is the people who virtue themselves and it's no different than these motherfuckers on the internet everything you know I'm a I'm for this I'm for that I stand with this man fuck off you know these people are the same they just do it with finances and so when we when I first bought that Lamborghini I was surrounded by I hadn't leveled up you know how I talk about leveling up and I talk about how when you have your first group of friends and you go out and try to be successful they're all gonna laugh at you and they're gonna make fun of you and they're gonna question you and they're gonna doubt you and they're gonna tell you you're wasting your time and that you're stupid and you're gonna be the butt of the joke and this is why most people never try all right and that's real that shit happens that's that does happen okay but it's irrelevant that's what I'm trying to tell you because you start to move down the path of creating a better life and that's where it starts to feel lonely and this is where most people when they're in the middle they say oh it's lonely at the top you're not the top bro because you bought a fucking entry-level Lambo that's not the top okay that's the top for where you used to be that's not the top and they'll say oh it's lonely at the top you don't fucking know what the top's like you never been there I've never been there so you get to the middle and you start saying oh it's lonely at the top and then these people go back to their group because they want to be friends and they fucking give up on all their shit all right but the guy who keeps going he finds a new group the new group likes the same shit they're on the same path and by the way not only they like the same stuff and they're on the same path that'll help you get to the next phase and that's what it's like for people so when I first got that car I was out I was in between I hadn't met my my new network yet and I still have my old network and you know I was here in the same shit you're talking about must be nice and bro you know I had a stretch to buy that car that car wasn't easily affordable for me you know I would do a diff I would recommend you do a different but that's the truth for me it was it was something like it was important to me I'm a car guy I fucking made the deal to do it and that was it and it worked out pretty good for me but I wouldn't drive the car for like a year and my buddy at the time or you had this car for a whole year and you didn't drive it no I drove it but I wouldn't drive it to like work yeah and what happened when it up happening was I I drove the car out in public I saw one of my guys and they fucking was like they were like holy shit is that your car and I was like yeah it's and they were like fuck dude that's awesome and they were super pumped all right so I didn't have I couldn't hide the secret anymore because everybody's gonna know so I started driving it and yeah some people got pissed and they fucking bailed but since then I've gone on to do the rest of the shit that I've done and you know why because it weeded out all the people that didn't want success all right so when we think about these things and by the way I went up to my friend during that time I had a I had a friend at that time who had a who had a lot of nice cars and I went up to him and I said hey man I said do you ever get any like like pushback from driving these nice cars very similar to this question you know what he said to me do you want any people around you that don't want nice shit so I'm gonna share that with you that's what you should think about do you want anybody on your team that doesn't want nice shit do you want anybody on your team that doesn't want to win do you want anybody on your team that's not driven that's not on the same path not on the same wave as you now it doesn't have to be cars but a sure as fuck shouldn't be hating on success you see what I'm saying absolutely man so that's my take on it I love it bottom line is this use it as a filter to weed out the people who aren't gonna fit in the direction you are taking your life I love it guys Andy are third and final question question number three Andy I've listened to you for about seven years now I'm a 38-year-old small business owner not by choice so I don't really know if I would call myself an entrepreneur however I've been selling my product for about 18 years now storage sheds I've been in business on my own for the last eight within those first three years I managed to acquire four locations and an online store it was awesome in January 2020 I was finally able to start working from home at the forefront of living my dreams while my business ran itself pretty much I was going to be chasing a music career well then the country shut down I kept my locations open for business we made less sales but it was okay however each year the sales and income are being cut in half I made 34k last year that's not really feasible for me I have adjusted the business to take on new types of business so that we can hopefully stay busy I just don't know what to do I've pressed and pushed ahead and can't get up this mountain I don't think it's my fault but it really beats me up mentally I feel like I'm failing at something that I know I'm a fucking G.A. but I don't know man I don't want to be arrogant either I feel like I may have to switch up my game plan to start selling something else that people can afford during this time period in the economy when he thoughts on this well first off bro uh you said everything was going great and you decided to go work at home and fuck off what you think was going to fucking happen this is the result of your decisions and by the way you are arrogant yeah you're misunderstanding the game you can't win without your best you are in the most competitive game in the world which is entrepreneurship it's not pro football it's not pro baseball it's not the fucking Olympics it's business and the consequences of being bad at business are life altering and you're you're not understanding that you've allowed your sales to cut in half and cut in half again because you want to pursue a music career you're right you're not a fucking entrepreneur because if you were a fucking entrepreneur you'd be in there every mother fucking day winning the goddamn game that you're playing but you want to go play a different game so my advice to you would be get out of that fucking shed business and go play fucking music that's what my advice would be now if you say oh well that's not the answer I was expecting that's why the fuck you asked me because I'm telling you the truth all right you are not good enough to win on half your effort neither am I and neither is anybody else who's out here winning and the reason that your shit is cut in half is because you weren't listening to me close enough I gotta listen to you for seven years clearly fucking not all right so do you want to fix it I'm gonna assume you do all right so that's the truth now let's talk about fixing it all right you can't become a professional musician while you're digging your business out of a fucking hole and from the way that the question was framed I'm assuming you inherited the company and are running the company for eight years on your own that's the way it sounds like to me you said not by choice I'm not an entrepreneur by choice well if you're not an entrepreneur by choice you're definitely gonna fucking lose because there's too many people that want to do it that'll kill for it that'll give everything that they fucking can for it to beat you and I guarantee you in the shed business there's plenty of those people all right so how are we gonna fix your business you're gonna have to make a decision am I going to grow this business into a real business or am I going to let the family business die and me going to live my other dream which is going to take another however many years and by the way you're what do you say 38 you're 38 you can do it still bro there's fucking country music stars now like jelly roll and these other guys who are coming along later in life kicking ass killer might just one gram is a fucking 50 years old okay so comes out of nowhere after being dormant forever and fucking crush it is possible but just like business if you are not completely bought in with all of your effort all of your intent all of your work ethic you cannot make it because just like business there's people that are willing to give everything to be successful in that avenue and the biggest mistake that we all make is thinking that we can compete with half of our effort with other people that are willing to fucking die to get there that is not reality it's not reality in music it's not reality in sports it's not reality in art it's not reality in business all right so what do you want to do do you want to be a musician are you willing to give 10 years of your life are you in a position to starve and become maybe if you're great at it a star and by the way to get great at it you're gonna have to first understand what I'm saying which you don't yet it takes everything man this is not bullshit you're not gonna buy a fucking course from one of these online fuckheads that's gonna make you a professional fucking business guy it's not gonna happen you have to put the time in so do you want to put the time in the music for the next 10 years and maybe be able to survive not be a star be able to survive or do you want to take something that you already know very well that you're at a position in life to operate and dedicate yourself to doing that and build it into something real that gives you you don't have to become you don't have to be you don't have to become the fucking Nike of sheds okay but it sounds to me like you're the kind of guy that wants to make enough money to fucking live his life that's not ideal when it comes to being the main guy at a company the main guy at a company is in it for the fucking win they're not in it for the fucking I'm trying to you got you got a fucking regular dude mindset bro there's nothing wrong with that but you can't win the game with that mindset when you're playing the game so you have to decide what you want to do do you want to put the time in to resurrecting the shed business and create a situation where you get real income and when I say real come it sure is fucking 34k a year that bro I'm gonna tell you right now that would freak me the fuck out if I were you I would be in a straight up panic the fact that you're not even more panicked is a red flag to me that you shouldn't even be in the game because you're gonna fail bear I hate say you're gonna fucking fail all right so what do you want to do if you were my friend and say what do you want to do bro here's the reality of the two choices play music dedicate all your time to it figure out a way to earn some income so you can fucking eat during the way maybe do some lessons I don't know what it is I don't know I don't know how good you are I don't know if you have any skills I don't know if you have any talent I don't fucking know you you you could be beginning in day one guitar lessons I don't know what you mean when you say play music but this gonna take 10 years you got that you're 38 10 years at a minimum to maybe make it do you want to take the shed business and do you want to make it so you can make a million bucks a year you could probably do that in three or four years with the shed business so you have to make a decision but if you go with the shed business you can't go play guitar all fucking day and expect it to go it's not gonna happen you gotta start taking a serious you gotta set up your company the right way you gotta give it everything you got you gotta go full guerrilla fucking warfare mode on your business and go straight hard as fucking long as you can and that's it and that's what it takes if you're competing in this game you will lose with anything else and anybody who tells you any different I promise you is losing yeah there was something you said that really like clicked for me too because you know even even me personally I've always looked at when you talk when you think about a company or just a business right like when you think when you think about it it's like oh well you know that's a you know that's a that's a taco stand or this is a construction come right like and you think that they're different but when in reality the principles of it's the game it's it's business bro business is business bro everything is everything yeah it's not just business it's do you want to be a master at your craft if you want to be a fucking artist and you want to be great at it you're gonna have to put in 10,000 fucking hours or 10 years of time Malcolm Gladwell talks about this okay and at his book outliers he defines what this means 10,000 hours or 10 years of your time that's what it takes that's what it takes for to be great at anything you want to be a great graphic artist that's what it takes you want you want to be a great audio engineer a producer that's what it takes you want to be great at operating weapons that's what it takes you want to be a great musician that's what it takes you want to be a great entrepreneur that's what it takes you have to pick a thing and you have to go all the fucking because it is arrogant to think that you can win a game against other people where they are all in and you are giving half of your effort you can't win that one do it nobody's that good nobody's that good when I say that to this guy you're not that good nobody's that good nobody it's a myth it's a coach from comparing yourself to these people on the internet that smile all day and act like this is easy I run my business and I got 17 other ones and they do all this shit and you know what I do I fucking by cars all day like dude bullshit what do I do all day fucking work seven days a week I'm here seven mother fucking days a week yeah okay and then I just hear I'm doing shit working I'm meeting with people I'm fucking making sure the shit runs like if you took if you took half the week off to go play guitar bro sales will start dropping shit will start making like in that that's what that's what that's what I want it to bring up it's like like I said it's like nobody's immune from it yeah but see here's the thing there is guys that compete against me that take half the week off to play golf yeah and take half the week off to fucking go on vacation and play guitar and you know what I beat all those guys right I'm the guy that you're competing with and you don't get it in the music industry there's there's me in the music industry that guy's gonna win in the fucking art place there's me with that mentality that guy's gonna win in business that guy's gonna win all the time a thousand times out of a thousand it's fucking math it's inputs and outputs that motherfucker's putting in ten times the inputs that you're putting in he's gonna get ten times output yeah and you want to say work life balance and all this shit listen when you're the fucking headhunt show and it's your shit that shit goes out the fucking window okay your employees fine totally get it they're I totally get it but when you're the fucking captain of the mother fucking ship which this guy is that shit is way far down the line of priorities that's why I want you to get the shit business to the million dollar mark over the next three years and then maybe you can have some of that but you don't get it all bro and you ain't in a place to get it all right now even if you want it and you're not good enough to compete at half your effort just like every other fucking person out here that's competing I fucking love it man what guys Andy that was three yep go pay the fee
