yeah because you do hurt all the time but man think I'll that they hurt who like the the fucking people that don't move around and shit yeah yeah like keep themselves in shape like Biden yeah anyway yeah dude so I think I found you know I scour the internet that's the word scour yeah didn't you it was scoundrel or something yeah there's some for me scoundrel the internet something weird yeah all right but I scoured the internet today and I think I found the probably most cringe worthy video oh no no we covered that yesterday no it was that girl that like did the thing that don't even come close it does not come close so what I have for you there's no way it doesn't come close bro all right let's doesn't come close let's let's let's check this out um so headline is dim pack drops cringe ad portraying mega Republicans as sweaty anti abortion creeps um so a Democrat pack released a cringe worthy political ad portraying mega Republicans as creepy sweaty degenerates and religious zealots who want to control women's bodies classic liberal projection uh the quote these guys are just weird ad by won't pack down shows a series of obvious Biden voters portraying themselves as what they conceived to be the typical Trump supporters creepily explaining how they were outlaw abortions uh nationwide and control your sex life the most creepiest fucking cringe worthy video I think has ever existed let's check it out a smag of republicans banned abortion but that's just the start it's just the start if Trump gets elected we want the government involved in all aspects of your sex life way more involved way more involved when you have sexual intercourse it should be illegal to use contraception no pills no condoms your genitals are reserved for procreation if you freeze 12 eggs you should be required to have 12 babies or else you're a serial killer and I'm definitely not a serial killer are you my son monitors my porn usage to make sure I'm not self-pleasuring just like speaker of the house Mike Johnson that's true you can look it up don't you think that's normal yeah I do it's normal for your son to do that you should have a family member monitor your porn use too because pleasuring yourself is very very naughty I'm voting in November I'm voting in November we're all voting in November are you because what happens in your bedroom is up to me is up to me and my son also mouth stuff is a sin that's not real that is absolutely they're running that as a fucking TV that is there's no way there's no way that's a fucking parody that's real won't pack down look it up we got the link clicked on Andy for sell it I come that is real okay we're the weird ones yeah we're fucking weird bro first of all we're the weird every one of those dudes looks like they fucking touch kids I would check I would check the hard drive of every single one of those people and I guarantee you I guarantee you there's some shit on there it shouldn't be on there secondly not a single one of those people looks conservative they all look exactly like they look like they pulled these people out of white dudes for Harris and fucking made them do a commercial as they say oh we're gonna pretend to be conservatives here's the most concerning thing like that's that's what they think of you that's what they think of us that's what they think of you that's what they think of of anybody that's not with them and they're marked they're literally talking about running the country and making a case for running the country based around porn usage based around abortion they're making up lies okay the only thing that anybody's ever said about abortion is that it should be a state level decision it's not the people to make yes it's not federally banned which it never should have been ever okay that's not within the realm of the responsibilities of the federal government all right and it's very weird to me how these women especially will make a vote based upon abortion like how many fucking abortions are you having no i'm being serious like we're talking about a functioning economy low crime rates not getting into wars not sending our friends and families and brothers and dads and kids to go die in wars that don't interest us and you're talking about being a cum receptacle that has no responsibilities for your decisions and you're voting on that over everything else how does that make sense and then the same people who say this thing about reproductive rights which isn't even true the same fucking people are willing to vote for a party that completely erases them from culture okay these are women voting for women they can't tell you what a woman is unless they are running for office and they need the women vote okay they're okay with men being in your sports they're okay with men being in your locker room they are okay with men dressing up as women coming to your school and dancing and shaking their dicks in your kids faces they're okay with all that shit all right but we're the weird ones weird bro okay like maybe you guys should sit down and examine what the fuck you are doing and how you are thinking about things i don't give a fuck if you're pro choice or that's not even an argument the argument is not pro choice pro abortion or whatever is that it doesn't affect you on a frequent enough basis to be above the line on where you should be making the decisions so you're going to forego all decisions that affect you day in and day out and affect your family day in and day out and affect your well-being day in and day out you're gonna you're gonna ignore all of that so in the in the fucking chance if there's somebody fucks you fuck some dude that you don't want to fuck and you get pregnant which there's still options they're still there that might happen once in your life you're willing to throw away the rest of the quality of your life to vote on that one issue how does this make sense at all to anyone it's insane and the people that vote for it as the top of lying issue are literally fucking morons they are morons okay because one it'd be one thing if it was completely banned and you said hey this should be right the truth of the matter is you hear Trump and you hear these people talk about the need for uh you know abortions in certain scenarios Trump said that many times Senator in the bank yeah and the people still don't hear him they don't they don't care they don't care if he says what it is these people don't care what he says they only care about group think they care about what is told to them by the media they care about what their liberal social circle leader thinks because these people all live in these little Facebook groups and these little communities and shit and they got a fucking ultra left leader who basically runs like little cults with these people and the minute they violate it they lose their whole network of friends so they don't want to know how and their super discount yeah right exactly they fucking do all dry soon but I mean dude let's be real you know like how are you gonna vote for something and make that the priority of the thing that you were voting for when all of these other issues affect you day in and day out like you have to be a fucking idiot you know I'm saying and then to to vote that way when there is no issue there like there's plenty of places to have this this taken care of if that's something that you need it's like dude it's insane bro where the where the how many motherfucking abortion you think these people have it no I'm being serious I think how many do you have to have yeah how many do you have to have to make it the number one thing you vote on yeah yeah I don't know man like I'd rather what they're saying is effectively I'd rather be poor I'd rather have a chance to get murdered mugged or stolen from or fucking violated or raped I'd rather you know have the country and disarray as long as I can get an abortion makes zero sense no it makes it makes absolutely no sense man but that video is fucking yeah bro and let's be real man that's what they look like you guys are the motherfuckers over there in the fucking progressive left who are trying to normalize minor attracted people you're trying you can't even type pedophile in a fucking Google search it won't even come up you know why because you're all trying to hide it and protect these people which makes me fucking think that you are these people it's very hard to for me to think at this point in time like separate that out dude I can't like if you're gonna defend this shit of minor attracted people and pedophiles then that means you must be one like for real dude that's where I'm at makes sense to me man and that's that's the straw that breaks the back it should be for everybody yeah yeah it's just it doesn't make well I don't know one conservative person it looks like any of those people talks like those people acts like those people when people see that you guys should know that's what they think of you they think you're fucking stupid they think you're gross they think you're scum of the earth and bro these people hate you like they do not care about you and and this is the same group of people that says oh you know I just want to be left alone no they don't want to leave you alone bro they're never gonna leave you alone so stop thinking I just want to take the high road and be left alone and start realizing that figuratively or literally we're gonna have to punch mother fuckers in the face to get him leaves fuck alone whenever that means you see what I'm saying it's real shit man it's real shit so other things too man well I was scouring the internet I think I found an article that Joe Biden wrote himself that's impossible all right let's give it a try uh tick bite to blame after Kansas man suffers new fatal allergic reaction to barbecue sandwich that doesn't sound like some shit like by what say to blame after Kansas man suffers the idea the idea that a man gets a tick bite and lurging he's a barbecue sandwich that doesn't sound like some shit like to say see what I'm saying yeah I can see it see what I'm saying yeah I don't know man I just hit tick bite to blame after Kansas man now look I break I've broken down a lot of shit on this show that doesn't make sense but this is a fucking this is a this is a rubik's cue right here the idea the idea man come on you know the thing oh yeah tick bite man Kansas and barbecue sandwich supposedly there's a there's a big outbreak right now it's not even how break there's something that happens when you get bit by a tick that it changes something where when you eat certain types of meats you have allergic reactions and you swell up and duh duh I know somebody actually has it really was it you what I know somebody I got a friend we're asking for a Fred I'm not making fun you bro well good luck with your swelling oh man let's get it to this cruise man bro look at this guy yeah like they even put on makeup on this guy that's what the fuck he looks like his hope he's for sure yeah bro like dude that's real shit that's one of them and that's the person that wants to fucking dance in their little drag outfit in front of your kids yeah and they want it they want to fucking you know put dick sucking books in front of your kids that's also him yeah I mean bro that's

discussion of anything I'm not one even there bro like how's your life you know I'm saying I'm gonna monitor his porn bro your son's watching his own porn okay it's wild shit man but let's get into these headlamps I will dig into this I'll say this it's interesting how they try to promote porn so much yeah how they try to push it so hard they like people don't realize and I didn't for a long time how fucking bad it is for people's brains yeah it fucks a lot of stuff up yeah and these guys push it hard as fuck and it's unrealistic yeah that's the part that makes me mad yeah well what what it is unrealistic like when there's a female in there unrealistic that's for unrealistic for you god damn it all right guys let's check out these headlines remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com we got a link there for you that being said sorry to hear about your tick by yo oh we got a show to do hell on the board new updates so they got a new acting director for the secret service um we got a brand new guy in there his name's uh Ronald roe junior this gentleman here he already is starting to point fingers um but uh he's back in the the congressional hearings right now um with with the senate um and he started everything started off cool all right start off cool he admitted that the the the attempted assassination of president trump was quote a failure of the secret service um and this was by far probably the most like directed mission of guilt i guess we've had out of the secret service um but that's where it started and um and then things just got weird uh so one of the FBI um i guess leaders in this group um he made he tried to make an allegation that there was a social media account uh multiple social media accounts that they're still working through um but he claims that the would be assassin allegedly ran an anti-immigrant and anti-semitic social media account um on the social platform called gab um so the FBI has linked Thomas Matthew Crookes the would be assassin from a president Donald Trump to a social media account purportedly filled with anti-immigrant and anti-semitic rhetoric uh this revelation was made during a senate homeland security uh committee hearing on Tuesday where US secret service acting director Ronald roe an FBI deputy director paul abbot provided updates on the ongoing investigation now we knew he had a couple of social media accounts he didn't have anything major like facebook or instagram or twitter um these are all like kind of like super anonymous uh where you're anonymity you can kind of you know hide under uh very very well um things like discord gab um things like that um but what he says is that something just very rees quote something just very recently uncovered that i want to share as a social media account which is believed to be associated with the shooter abbot said some of these comments if ultimately attributable to the shooter appear to reflect anti-semitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature he added but here's the problem um so a gentleman by the name of andru torba who is the CEO of gab um quickly hopped on and called it bullshit this was his tweet it's a little long winded we'll we'll read through it here um he starts off by saying the fbi is now claiming that the trump shooter thomas methew crooks had an unspecified quote unquote social media account um in 2019 2020 when he was 14 or 15 years old it's very important that posted anti-immigrant and anti-semitic content even that alone makes no sense because yeah the post uh that they're alleging were made back in 2019 2020 when he would have been 14 or 15 years old making statements on and like immigration and simitism i mean i don't know bro like half these half these people on the internet are fucking 12 years old arguing politics why do you think i don't get in the comments with people like here half of you motherfuckers are in there arguing with fucking 13 year old kids yeah no no yeah um but uh andru torba goes on to say this is not consistent with gabs understanding of the shooter's motives based on an emergency disclosure request we received from the fbi last week for the gab account epic microwave which based on the content of that edr the fbi appeared to think belong to thomas crooks uh and he continues saying many particularly regime media reporters have doubted gabs claims that this request existed normally we do not confirm the existence or content of law enforcement communications in this instance we had to make an exception due to the overwhelming public interest and disclosure and transparency um and to which they uh post it uh the edr that was sent to them from the fbi um but uh andru concludes by saying as a courtesy to law enforcement we are not going to post the entire request this is the first page of that request the story is the account for which data was requested was unequivocally pro-biden and in particular pro-biden's immigration policy to the best of gabs knowledge as of 2021 crooks was a pro lockdown pro-immigration left wing joe biden supporter that's the CEO of the company yeah and he's tired of the of the media trying to twist this shit and he said fuck it i'm going to tell truth or the fbi lying directly to the senate oh he's a registered republican it's bullshit i know it's complete bullshit um and uh yeah he's been ripping them up he's even posted is like listen like i mean we'll be completely transparent he has an entire threat that's on twitter right now and you tour but at base tour but you guys can check it out for yourself but he's exposing all of he's like no the like this is the fucking truth this guy was not a republican he did not have conservative beliefs did not have conservative morals right which is like what the 30th fucking violent person over the last five years that we've covered that's going to that team have any of these people been conservative i haven't seen one mean either i have not seen one now one mass should be because if it was like obviously we would know it right and they would make it mainstream media but yeah well they do that with all they try to make these people that but then but then it comes out i know look bro these people are liars now and an interesting thing i know something that you you've personally have been asking and wanted to see uh was more people from within the secret service stepping out and speaking up yep um and i know we have buddies that listen to the show awesome awesome guys great men uh you know and in all the agencies in all agencies um you know but there's something mother fuckers to step up dude yeah what time is here time is now um and i think uh you know people got the message um check this out so this is an exclusive report the secret service counters sniper sent an email Monday night to the entire uniform division not agents saying he will not stop speaking out until quote five high level supervisors one down are either fired or removed from their current positions the countersniper also said the agency quote should expect another assassination attempt before november and complained that he is no longer proud to be a united states secret service countersniper after leadership failed the officers at the trump rally in butler on seventeen i'm sorry on seven thirteen um this is the email well before you read the email you should accept you should expect an assassination all the time that's the level of fucking protection that you guys are supposed to provide yeah all the time just saying that yeah but i mean this is his email and i'm not going to read the entire thing but i mean he does lay it out and there's five key people that he's alleging that are directly responsible for this now i don't know if that's alluding to the intentional you know responsible for this right the intentionality part that's been a question that everybody's had um but that's what they did to this email they wiped it off the servers the internal servers of the secret service you know i know that because my my buddy who i know called me immediately when they did it and he said hey they just did this mm-hmm this has been going around everybody's getting pissed everybody's point fingers and they just deleted this email off the fucking server and there's like a bunch of people on it it's a bunch of big chain it's a bunch of one so think about that and then shit really takes it turn yeah in this hearing bro um they talk about it getting delete off the server in hearing uh no because that just happened to just happen yeah i'm not sure if they if they didn't that that'll be on tonight's news or tomorrow's right yeah right um but then the acting secret service director he loses his composure completely um and plays victim um when senator holly uh started started trying to question me check this clip up the person who is in charge of the interoperability of radio frequencies between local law enforcement and secret service has that person been relieved of duty uh no senator because interoperability is a challenge uh is a greater challenge than just one person on that day we had a counterpart system uh it failed as a person who decided who made the decision to send Donald Trump on to stage knowing that you had a security situation has that person been relieved of duty no sir they haven't as a person who decided not to pull the former president off of stage when you knew that in your words the locals were working a serious security situation has that person been relieved of duty uh no sir again i refer you back to my original answer that we are investigating this through emission assurance and as opposed to zeroing in on one what more do you need to investigate to know exactly what this decision you need to investigate to know that there were critical enough failures that some individuals ought to be held accountable i mean what more do you need to know what i need to know is exactly what happened and i need my investigators to do their job and i can i can't i can't put my thumb on the scale otherwise what do you mean put your thumb on the objective the objective you're asking me senator to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing i acknowledge this was a failure of is it not prime of face that somebody has failed the former president was shot sir this could have been our Texas schoolbook depository i have lost sleep over that for the last seventeen days just like you are somebody i will tell you senator i will tell you senator that i will not rush to judgment that people will be held accountable and i will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people i can't believe that you are unfairly persecuted fairly sir well i see both sides of this i do see both sides i mean look i like holly like i said the other day it does irritate me that they don't get anything actually done and hold people accountable um with that being said i watched a little bit of this earlier and that guy the acting director does seem like he wants to fucking get to the bottom of it and i feel like right now what's happening here is holly's just putting a ton of pressure on him that you know and that guy's that guy's gonna walk out and be like all right we got to fucking fix this yeah so i do think he wants to i do too i get that feeling too yeah i get that feeling too i think they're both right here and i i bet you honestly like i mean i think they both want the same thing that's how i'm reading it yeah like it's completely opposite of that situation with that other woman where she was clearly fucking gatekeeping and hiding information from these guys yeah for sure and dude and that guy's also right like if it's already been hidden and he's just now the acting director as of a few days ago how much information could he possibly have now what i think should happen right is all of those people that Josh howly mentioned should be suspended immediately immediately yeah they should like that should be handed protocol dude listen because those people if this was which i believe it was an inside job which was they were counting on uh god on trump being assassinated that means that there's people that are still operating inside the secret service that are that allow that to happen and you have to remove every single key person from that scenario and kind of like gather them up and stick them over here while we figure out what the fuck is going on yeah so those people should you know if they're still allowed to be working that's extremely dangerous and to the point um that was made in the letter you know from the or the email from the secret service agent uh dude they're yes they're going to try to assassinate him again and and i actually think it's gonna be different this time i think and i think i said this last week or the week before but i still think this like a mass casual well they they came out the day after that or two days after that and they said Iran has this huge uh assassination plot of trump right and they just came out again today saying the same shit Iran said the same about that Iran has plans uh uh pedal metal with the elections okay yeah you mean like our own government does okay um yeah it's gonna be Iran this time instead of Russia yeah could do it yeah around around around anyway and trump paid them to do it yeah i know dude anyway um what i see the i think these people are so evil you know they're gonna try to accomplish multiple things at once and now that they're saying you know oh you know Iran wants to assassinate trump dude like these people could cut the power fucking drone strike a fucking rally turn the power back on and be like Iran killed trump we're going to war and they they could accomplish a whole bunch of shit they get their war they get rid of trump and they try to turn the mega base trump's base to be pro war and they get all the shit you see what i'm saying so that makes sense to me um i dude i down on trump needs to be really fucking careful dude they does and yeah here's the weird thing man to to that illusion just remember if it happens it wasn't Iran right it's our own fucking people it's these fucking communists who have infiltrated and compromised our government you know it's the same old characters bro the people who won't get out of the fucking spotlight you know the the point of of democracy a constitutional republic is for fucking new people to be in it all the time we have had an election 50 fucking years it didn't have Clinton bush fucking Joe Biden in it you know i'm saying um what the fuck is going on here this is this is like a monarchy you know i'm saying like dude these people none of these people should be in office anymore they should you're supposed to come in make your influence move on and they're not moving on right use some no and those are the people who want to fucking kill trump and keep it moving for themselves now the interesting thing here man like so we got all these illusions of shit happening we obviously know there was some laps in in decisions whether intentional or strategic we don't know yet um but they're we're already starting to see that at least somebody inside of trump's permanent detail uh is back in the plate because trump just did a uh a speech she just did uh a speech at uh in Nashville at a bitcoin convention or some sort of that right yeah well there was a there was a security issue there as well that nobody's really covering and talking about um but to the point where secret service had to delay uh trump going on stage and speaking because of it where apparently two people uh were able to get through the first line of perimeter right but then skipped the second entry border check you know where they there's another weapons check metal detector all of that stuff they were able to bypass that somehow some way and find themselves in the crowd and in the audience and thankfully um it caught the attention of somebody whether uh uh you know whoever it was um and uh they they delayed trump from going out to speak um apparently it was two people that uh two credentialed and screened attendees were removed from the video uh from the venue for not following proper entry protocols um and so that's been released um and he was you know trump was told by his secret service detailed a wait until the two individuals were located um because they were just somewhere out in the crowd um have not been through the proper screening process um and they're saying obviously that there was never a threat to trump of course they're gonna say that because they don't want to show any further weakness in this and fuck ups did you see what Charlie Kirk said about what about the security at he he's Charlie Kirk uh put on that event this past weekend when trump spoke and he said the fucking security was super-laks yeah he said it was terrible yeah he said it was the worst that he's ever had and he said he's hosted trump a number of times which we know trump's always been at at Charlie's events right so look bro they're trying to get him killed they gotta get the shit together no no it's not that there are key people it's not about getting the shit together there are key people inside that organization who won him dead who are allowing the fucking gates to stay open so that he could potentially be killed that is exactly what's happening and there was a plan that failed that people are responsible for and need to be held accountable for and quite honestly need to be hung for okay publicly yeah all right when the fuck is that gonna happen yeah guys jump it on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments uh we'll keep close eye on this as always i still stand by what i said bro there's zero chance there letting us do win zero yeah zero you guys are gonna have to really come to terms with how bad you want your country and what you're willing to fucking do for it because i can promise you trump is not going to save you because they are not going to let him in it's it's not happening they're gonna it's gonna be they're gonna kill him they're gonna shut the power grid down they're gonna introduce a fucking war here there's gonna be riots here whatever they got to do it doesn't matter could be fucking a million different things but there's zero fucking chance zero that he wins the election and gets inaugurated without some major fucking issues so all of you guys out there that fancy yourself patriots and fancy yourself you know real americans you better come to terms real quick with what you're willing to do to preserve this country and keep this country from becoming a communist country because i can promise you there's zero fucking percent chance they're letting them get in there without major disruptions oh guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think i will keep a die on this one now with that being said let's go check out some comments cool let's go cruise the comments cool yeah all right blackhost let's do this from yesterday so i received so from d6 don't you don't you realize you're black well listen i mean this first comment comes from uh stand to six six six oh you ready yeah Biden was a very solid president by almost every measure an undeniable fact let's Gavin Newsom I don't think solid about Biden was a shit and that's not even that's debatable that's still debatable what are we talking about what do you consider solid you know if you're somebody who has nothing listen if you're somebody who has nothing who's extremely poor who hasn't doesn't have a job doesn't have a career um and you got all kinds of free shit by Biden being president i could see why you think he's a solid president but the fact of the matter is the people who actually pay the money that you then receive to do nothing in this country they're having a much harder time making the money that the government steals from them to pay you to do nothing so it would be in your best interest for you to root for the other team so at least the people who are out here working can work and make money and an easier pace and without uh disruption like they they've had so that you can actually get your aid more effectively yeah just to put it yeah no all right solid president yeah yeah fucking 20 million illegals okay who are now doing exactly what I said for years and years and years they come here they they do not adopt the culture they attack the fucking women they cause all sorts of problems they're taking our tax dollars now they're infiltrating the black communities and the black communities are getting no aid while these people are getting free homes he drain the strategic oil does it reserves so that we to artificially keep gas prices in check if that wasn't happening our gas price would be fucking $10 a gallon right now you you more eyes don't know nothing about that um let's see what else did he do he got us in the fucking war in Ukraine uh he spent a hundred and something billion dollars on the war in Ukraine which you know clearly they're not going to win um you know they lied about Russia collusion I mean we could go on and on and on the crime the fucking inflation the filet president bro the guys destroying the country and you're sitting here saying he's a solid president by almost every measure what are you fucking talking about what are you smoking dude no like these people are so delusional this is why when you see them on the street and you ask them all right what were your three best things that they did they can't say anything and we see these videos over and over and over again online how many times we see these videos where somebody walks up to someone and they're and they're not a Trump supporter and then the person asks them well why don't you support Trump he's a fucking blah blah blah blah blah blah he's a piece of shit he's a convicted felon okay well what do you like about Biden what do you like about Kamala well I like their policies which ones don't do that to me here bro well don't do that you see what I'm saying yeah these people don't know shit bro and this is my point that I was making yesterday in the show these people are allowed to vote and these people vote and then other people have to go fucking pay the consequences of their voting yeah if you don't have a tax return dude you shouldn't be able to vote that's it yeah Charles Paul he doesn't agree with you Andy he says inflation down jobs back and then some deficit spending down he saved when Trump left us in the crisis backs don't care about your feelings that's funny because I got something I got I got I got you inflation down okay I'm not sure why interesting because this is still higher than any point when Trump was in office it's down from halfway through 2022 you don't think that the people that were halfway that at 2022 at all time high inflation aren't still suffering from this you see what I'm saying yeah inflation is down sure compared to what compared exactly exactly it's still higher than any point by a lot look at the interest rates dude look at the cost of fucking groceries look at the cost of living it's insane what's the second point job jobs back and then some okay okay well I'll say this well here's the graph but I will say this some of you are so fucking stupid that you completely forget about all of your media all of your Democrats have the school board the the fucking every single organization that aligns with the left demanding that businesses be shut down and schools be shut down and they're not taking into account those jobs rebounding after Biden came back in office so you're attributing all the jobs lost to Trump when Trump said that he didn't even want to fucking lock shit down and all of your fucking people wanted to lock it down all the media wanted to lock it down don't you remember if you said no lockdowns you what you were you are grandma killer you were selfish you were this and that and these weeks just stop this yeah and these people here conveniently forget that their buddies the people they vote for left all of the fucking big box stores open the Amazon's the Walmart's the targets and they closed all of the small businesses because they were not essential and all of that wealth transfer went from the small business to those big business that's why the guys like Bezos and all these big guys their their net worth has doubled or tripled since 2020 and the average Americans net worth has gone way the fuck down so when you say we got jobs back and then some you're selectively picking data that is not true no no because even if you look at it and employment was actually still lower under under Trump yeah I mean that's really yeah it's right there it's right there so that your life so your facts don't care about your feelings there's the facts right there for you bro uh deficit spending down yeah deficit spending down deficit spending down yeah we just top 35 trillion for the first time in history yeah down yeah yeah yeah that's down yeah up is down yeah down is up he saved when Trump left us in a crisis no Trump didn't leave us in a crisis your people fucking stole an election they stole a fucking election okay so you could say whatever you want that will come out that will come out to be true people still you know there's still people like this dude who don't think that it will come out that they stole the election the same thing that's happening in Venezuela right now happened in fucking 2020 here and if it happens again we'll see the same thing happening in Venezuela here in fucking three or four months yeah so good good job Charles yeah yeah yeah last people these people just make shit up dude brother hot talk they just make shit up both of their but no they believe that fucking they believe the lies that people like Kate they can't understand when you listen to KJP or any of these people on CNN or fucking MSNBC these people are blatantly fucking lying to your face and they have no problem lying to you none and you believe it you hear it and you're like oh my god yeah okay well they must be telling truth because it's on MSNBC it's on CNN Biden saying it KJP saying it all the talking you have to say it so must be true it's not true that's the point there's a massive conspiracy happening that most people see now that some of you you will not allow yourself to see because you have created your identity and sunk your identity so hard into this political party as part of who you are that you're not able to see the actual facts it's insane man yeah this last one like literally not one thing that person said was true nothing and it took me three minutes to pull that shit up two minutes yeah they wouldn't just lie to us I watch porn videos longer than it took me to fucking research that well that probably lie yeah this last one comes from weather outdoors we'd head outdoors love the show Andy when DJ takes you on the movie date just buy out the movie theater tickets it'll be so romantic just y'all two in the whole theater I did that one time I

relationships and they can't find them and then they get divorced seven times or they they have fucking you know dude I'm being real that there's a real fucking wrong expectation of what a relationship is like in the movies versus what it's like in real life and a lot of people destroy their whole lives because they're chasing an unrealistic expectation and that movie is one of the main movies that creates it okay these love stories of you know like it's just like listen bro I'll go together yeah bro it's fucking bullshit yeah yeah there was truth about the indecisiveness part though huh like what do you want like that is some truth it would be more true if it was like where do you want to eat it's like I don't know okay well how about here no not there I'll you anywhere no that's

monitor my porn usage too right you can't see the problem with your fucking eight year old daughter in the backseat of the car singing wet ass pussy yeah like you don't bro you should have your kids taken from you for that right I mean I mean to your point bro like that's what they're trying to do in the black community is like this is this is the democratic platform this this is what black people look capable of this is it oh and and and it's okay because you know why because Hillary Clinton also endorsed WAP so it's fine have you seen this clip that Hillary Chelsea Clinton praise WAP great to see women be so fierce yeah check this out what about like women like discovering you know new medical breakthroughs what about like like it's it's kind of like how they feel about black people it's so degrading that's what I'm saying like they they say stupid ass shit like oh well I'm for black people but black people are so dumb they can't get a computer and they can't get an ID right and they need extra help and they sell that and then they sell the same type of ship to women you know they say oh you're being fierce by listening to wet ass pussy right and dancing and swinging your ass around and fucking all this shit but they don't say anything about like the educated women that create change in society in a real and in a real manner right they pander to this fucking disgusting shit no that's exactly let me do it's it's fierce what's fierce about saying wet ass pussy when I was a kid we called those bitches whores yeah not fierce yeah not strong not courageous we like kept our distance because we have one other shit to jump on us then want the cooties yeah yeah let's check this out from Hillary Chelsea follows rap music she has ever since she was a large personal follows rap music like it's a she's just trying to pander to black to fucking a black woman she by daughter follows rap yeah let's let's let's hear this conversation that's the fucking out liberal shit bro let's hear oh your artist trans my daughter listens to rap music yeah really got about that yeah Chelsea follows rap music she has ever since she was a little girl but I kind of came to awareness of you with the Cardi B Wap I've always wanted to do a song with Cardi as soon as she sent me the song I think I sent it back to her like the next day and it was just so exciting the men they seem so confident and with their sin and they don't have no problem with talking about their sexuality and how they gonna have sex with you so I was like well I can do that and it's gonna sound fire coming from a woman it's great to see women be so fierce that is my life's mission to make sure that I'm always unapologetically mean hey killer we got one so she's unapologetically unapologetically a fucking hoe that sings about her way like bro like real talk like not whatever man yeah bro and then there's the same women are like there's no good man there's all the good man there's no good man no good man want to fuck you bitch because you're fucking talk about how wet your pussy isn't shit they know 17 other dick's been in there since this morning bro but here's my issue man this is my issue this is something I'm always gonna drive in like people are they're trying to paint Kamala is this like fucking you know I ain't working down with the people it's not working it's not working and like I think it's important to remind people of the bullshit that this woman has done right and so I want to show this story this is story of Jamal true love he tells he was one of the victims of Kamala Harris's prosecutions he was framed by police and convicted of murder in 2010 he was then sentenced to prison for 50 years and he served six years before his conviction was overturned in 2000 right the math doesn't math on that doesn't well he was probably in jail for two years before waiting for the trial that's okay okay well I serve six years before his conviction was overturned in 2014 recently a video made the rounds of Jamal telling how Kamala Harris set in the courtroom and laughed after he was sentenced to prison for 50 years check this out in 2008 I was framed for murder and wrongfully convicted by the office of Kamala Harris sentenced 50 to life in prison it took me five and a half years to ultimately get back in the trial due to postcutor and misconduct and it took me another year to go to my second trial to which I was vindicated by a jury of my peers when I got convicted Kamala Harris was in the courtroom when I got sentenced 50 to life in prison Kamala Harris was in the courtroom when I looked back and I was seen her she was smiling and she did that stupid ass laugh that she do right now she ain't funny yeah and so that's one of the things I'm like and that's the thing like nobody talks about like her like nobody really like they try to erase that shit like it never happened did you see that clip of her trying to talk to team USA she walked in on team USA the basketball team and they're all like who the fuck is this bitch like nobody respects her dude it's all of this is fake hype okay and honestly the fact that she's trying to push herself as a black woman when the black community knows she's not black is making it way worse and this also lends itself to what I've been telling you is going to happen they put her in she's not the certified fucking candidate yet for the Democrat party it hasn't been formalized they're testing the waters to see if it's going to take it's not taking and when it doesn't take they're going to make another switch and it's going to be Michelle Obama yeah yeah 100% man and it's not taking did you see this it's not taken from from MSNBC and MSNBC tried to do a focus group with black voters it went real bad yeah let's check this out how many of you know a black man who has expressed to you they're committed to voting for Donald Trump for the brothers who have told you that what said that to you has the emergence of Kamala Harris changed that for those days no why should it no no why should it right why should she's black okay that's not a real that's not a reason no that's not a reason that is a reason that preschool kids might pick somebody right that's not an actual reason no so because she's black and because she's a woman are not actual reasons to choose a candidate for president of the United States because she's the first whatever that shits irrelevant to okay if we want to fucking solid country we have to pick the person who can do the fucking job and right now as it appears we have two choices now if I had it my way there would be other choices but there aren't so we have two choices we can either say we're fucked or we could say I'm going to pick the better choice for right now and then I'm going to work on myself and my community and my standards to produce people who could be better options later on down the road by making myself and my family and my community better and more aligned with the vision that I believe this country should be okay that's what people should be thinking about but this whole fucking bullshit of we're going to make history with the first who cares who cares you can't fucking pay your bills you have to dodge bullets in your neighborhood you fucking you you might get drafted into this war that's not going to make any difference for any of us because you want to vote on someone's skin pigment bro it's it black people aren't buying it bro they're over it they're done being pandered to they know that Kamala Harris is not one of their people they know that she is pandering they know Megan the stallion knows that Hillary Clinton is being a dumb white bitch when she sits there and tries to relate to her just like this picture they walk away bro this is the best part what does Megan the stallion say when she walks away from those women stupid as white bitches that's right that's right that's what she says and she makes fun of them to all the other girls and she says well they might be president or they might be powerful so I might as well fucking cultivate a relationship with them that's what that's the real shit am I wrong no there's a 100% what did Hillary say after this you walk away oh man we you know I think we really made a connection there you know the black people are gonna like us did you think your tongue out should I have stuck my tongue out no no no do you think that went okay that do you do you think it was was I awkward like did I sound cool do people people and it is a good thing man like every single day I see more and more clips of people that are just like that maybe have been on that side maybe we're over there that are completely like saying fuck it like this clip here you check this out yeah this is great yeah this message is just to all you Trump supporters or you mega people I have one thing to say to you I'm sorry sorry that I bought into all the bullshit that the media was feeding to me for all those years sorry for thinking that you guys were the enemy when really you're out with trying to protect this country the past three years the past four years have been horrific you can't buy food gas prices are ridiculous and our cities are looking like fucking slums elect Kamala Harris who's actually in charge of the border now yeah no sorry I bought into all the bullshit not this time another thing as a gay man I'm over this fucking gay woke agenda bullshit because that's not what the gay community is sorry it is not what they're pushing on TV is some sadistic shit and as somebody who has enough you who's in kindergarten the last thing I want is for my nephew to think that if he you already know where I'm going with this right that's some bullshit that in my opinion is some bullshit that they're doing with the kids it has to stop it has to stop because it's giving gay people a bad name gay people who don't want any part in that I don't even go to gay pride anymore because it's disgusting gay pride gay pride gay pride you're a key key we have to that now but basically turn it to a fucking sex fest it's disgusting and it does not represent me and one bit I just told that if I vote for Trump that my right as a gay man would be taken away and I would be set back a hundred years and can you show me where Trump said that you know the response I got crazy liberal shit so again to all the mega people you have a new person on board with you Trump 2024 let's get this fucking country back in order thank you I like that dude to the Lou yeah but you know what bro he's telling the truth telling the truth man by the way how many gay people are actually with the shit that just happened in Paris for real yeah fucking none of them do okay these people have weaponized that movement in the name of communism in the name of demoralization and destabilization of our culture and society and it's making it very very dangerous for men like that no what brother I think that too like you know gay people already know they're going to hell and so like with that like they're definitely going yeah of course for sure yeah because you know why they're going to hell because my son's gonna monitor their porn bro you know it's crazy all the people that I know the vote for Trump with with the exception of the hyper aggressive like Christians because there are those people yeah those people are new monitor their porn yeah yeah I'm sure there are those motherfuckers look at the more porn anybody that's why they're so vocal trying to cover their shit like bro Christianity's not about being perfect it's about trying your best it's about being the best that you can be and that's not going to be perfect all the time and there's this group of people on the far right that are Christians that are very judgmental and very harsh and and hold the cancel culture weapon right now and misuse it a lot of times and that needs to stop okay now there's certain times where it should be used like all the advertisers of the Olympics should be pulling out or you guys should stop buying from the people who are advertising on the Olympics and that should be real shit if that's how you feel about things which I do but the point is is that we have people in this country who are being painted in a very very bad way in a way that makes them viewed in a way that's that's not true okay and also dangerous to them as people like they're pushing this this crazy like he said sadistic satanic shit so hard that if gay people don't speak up loud and in unison and say hey I'm not fucking with any of this it makes them the target of the recourse of very pissed off people because of what these disgusting elite people are doing no to the other side and you will be sent back 100 fuck dude dude maybe a thousand yeah it's it's it's so weird like how do you not see that like how do how do we not see that with black people women and gay people when we talk about them voting progressive left it hurts all three of these groups of people more than anybody else because it takes the rest of the people and the rest of the people look at them and like fuck you yeah man guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said man let's get to our final I have seen a lot of people say that they know like that like she's getting exposed for this fucking fake black shit mm-hmm a lot of people like bro this bitch is not black she's there was a clip when she was with that one Indian comedian girl cookin Indian food I saw that yeah and she was like because you're Indian right yeah she's like yeah yeah did you see the one where did you did did we play it and show yesterday where the black dude had a picture of her and her family up in all their Indian oh no I showed you that oh my god dude that's so fucking funny that's a good one like I was like bro can we play that can we put that in here yeah this is this clip right here check this out y'all don't think it's weird that black folks are forcing the black card on Kamala or Kamami Harris Kamala whatever the fuck y'all don't think that's weird this is our family right here that look like a black house though that's the house though you grew up in that's not the yeah nigga I can't recognize this shit nigga I'm at BA I'm from the soil nigga from the plant from the slave plantations here nigga I don't recognize this family all right but y'all can keep putting the black card on somebody it's kind of weird that you're trying to force the blackness on somebody that's that slave in you boy cut it out that don't look like that's that look like a household you I don't see no wick of chairs or nothing you know she's not black or dead there huh bro there's someone dude these people are so cheese did oh man like Hillary like how does this work hey we're down in the polls with black people they're starting to realize okay well who could we get oh I know we get Megan the stallion need some whopping there yeah we could talk about whop we could I got it this would be great we'll paint I'll get a paint and you guys can all get a circle and you could paint Hillary and Chelsea you could paint and then Megan could paint too yeah and you guys can like be sitting around like it's like brunch and and then you could talk about wet ass pussy right and I'll tell her how you studied the rap culture yeah as a child yeah and and black people will love it dude they'll love it because you know why because she's black and we invited her into our garden to have brunch and paint pictures in the ritualistic garden yeah that's her fucking family look at that and that's our current family yeah we'll put that in here that that's our current family that dude and they're trying to put bro listen I don't think black kind of real black family people think I hate black people and that weird that's fucking weird to me that's probably why you hate black people probably if anybody can hate them it can be me that's what I'm saying he's like got the motherfuckers now he's making shit in a gattle bullshit but dude that's pretty funny that's fucking bullshit but like dude I don't think the black culture is buying this shit no more I don't even think if they put Michelle Obama up they're gonna buy it and I think they're fucking sick of I think they're sick of their intelligence being insulted yeah the problem is that scared that idea scares me because they're gonna catch they're gonna become aware that it ain't gonna work and then what are they gonna do about it that's the part that scares me I don't know man I think these people I think these people think about race all day yeah I think that's all they think about I'm talking about the politicians yeah yeah black culture yeah yeah it'll be it'll be interesting to see man do you know what's crazy bro I know you know it's like black people want to leave like the being identified as black people out the door and they just want to be normal they're normal fucking people and these fucking people that convince them to vote for them every four years won't let that happen they won't let racism die they won't let us become Americans they won't let us become you know real brothers and sisters Like we have had that before in America. It's just that the younger generation, the Gen Z people, they don't realize we just had that 15 years ago, and then Obama came around and fucked it all up for everybody. You want to see something interesting too that I just noticed, right? This is like some subconscious psychological shit here. All right, I want you guys to notice this picture here. Obviously this is Kamala here when she was a little bit younger, but notice her head position and how it's leaning in towards the family, right? And how, you know, that strength there, there's identity, there's a sense of belonging there. As soon as she gets into politics where it starts becoming an issue, notice, look at her body language here, right? That's her mom, her head still to the complete opposite way. Same thing with her father. You mean like she doesn't want to be identified as an idiot? So consciously it's happening. Like bro, that's a real thing. Yeah, like she knows. She knows. She knows. She knows. She knows that she is identifying and panoring to black people and I guarantee, I guarantee if you ask her fucking family, they'll tell you that. We're probably, yeah, I guarantee you. Oh Kamala not to normal. That's what they're gonna tell you. We used to get sluppies. No, most lepis. That's too much. No. That was wonderful. We don't get sluppied normal. We used to get sluppied, no, most love. Oh my God, dude, we're going to jail. Hey, what it could be worse? What it could be gay? Yeah, we're definitely going. Hey man, Alex Jones played, Alex Jones played our clip with the end of his show. Yeah, we're going to jail. Oh my God, dude, the bottom of the month are you on the top of the month? You know what, man, I ain't going. Yeah, so if you all come in to get me, just know I ain't going. So you better bring it whatever you got. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm, guys, just a little fucking helicopter flyovers ain't scared me either, bitch. No, they do this yet. Fucking every day, bro, right over the fucking house. People think I'm fucking joking. They think we're fucking. Oh, shit. When you sent me that one, that one, you just got buzzed. I looked, there was nothing there though. That was all the time, bro, what they're doing. It always happens at like fuck at 5.30 in the morning too. And I'm like, fuck, it's almost six. That's when the rage happens. Yeah, 6.04, I'm like, all right, back to sleep. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. Well, that being said, let's get to our third and final headline. At number three, we got to check back in. All I know is if they put me there, they do something to me, you motherfuckers better do something. I'm just saying, I'm talking to all of you. They fucking do something to me. You better fucking do something. Yeah. And I'm not talking about post about it. Yeah. I'm being serious, dude. I know, man. Like people don't realize how much risk and how much bullshit that we deal with. It's real. It's real. You motherfuckers better do something if they fuck with us. Yeah, please. Please. I couldn't make it in jail. You got to check in on Venezuela though. Because there's some interesting stuff happening. I like to expose communism like we always do. Let's check in. So right now there's a lot of stuff happening in Venezuela. There's protests as riots. People will lose in their fucking minds. But you got two major sides, both trying to claim victory here. And it's weird. Protest have broken out across the country as both sides of the Venezuela presidential election claim. Victory with opposition candidate at Mundo Gonzales claiming he has proof that he won from the exit polls. Saying quote, the voice of the Venezuelan people has been clear through their votes yet the morally bankrupt dictatorship remains deaf to their cries. Isaiah Smedina III, a former Venezuelan diplomat to the United Nations Security Council and Harvard fellow to Fox News digital. The regime has not only defrauded the election results, but has also begun persecuting the courageous leaders who ignite at the flame of freedom. And a remarkable display of unity and defiance, spontaneous marches floods the streets of citizens, fervently plead for liberty and the chance to rebuild a nation where families can reunite and prosperity. And yeah, they're definitely going in a bold move though in a very, very bold move. There's another opposition leader who the people also could have very well elected in their leader Freddie Superlano. How about he was the police just a kid napkin kidnapped him. Kidnap them live fucking television on live TV. Yeah, on live TV. Here's the clips. Well, yeah, so Venezuela and opposition party, a volunteer popular said on Tuesday on Twitter that his national coordinator Freddie Superlano has been detained. Here's the clip of him getting arrested out of his house. We got to store hold the politicians accountable. And that's why we don't get out with this thing. It's got to be the government. We're going to have to get out of the way. It's got to be the government. They're going in the fucking car. You're just looking at it. And we put the faith in man. We don't care what this is. It's got over the public. If I'm not one nation on the guy. And we will be one nation going under. That's some wild. That's Jimmy Levy. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that's wild. That's wild. You lose the election. Then you start locking up. What is that? That's communism, dude. Who do they try? Didn't they try to lock up somebody here? Yeah. And I guarantee you, dude, when Kamala gets in power, they will do. They absolutely will. They will do that. She is one of these people. She's a prosecutor. Yeah. She's a prosecutor. Yeah. She has good record of it. Yeah. Now in the legal election, people going after everybody else who's been talking truth to all of them. Yeah. Now, like I said, it's communism. There's no doubt. But we got to address some communism that's actually happening here as well. Hold on. You're not covering the full story. The military just before the fucking show today announced that they are siding with the people, not with Moderna. I saw a bunch of cops in the state police are stepping down, stepping their uniforms off. Which is what's going to happen here, too. Is what's 80% of the fucking police in the military here, no matter what you guys think, when you see these dudes up there dressed up as fuck. Women in shit in our military and they're all saying, woke up shit. 80% of the service people are pro fucking America pro freedom. They're not these communist fucks. They don't respect Joe Biden. They don't respect the regime. And if this goes this way with our election, where someone wins 66 to 30, 66% to 30. Okay. And they try to claim the election, which will be their last case scenario. I think they'll try to kill them. I think they'll try all the chaos before that. But if it does get that far, they will just say they won. And the military and police are going to have a really fucking hopefully easy decision to make to say, how no fuck it shouldn't be hard. No, it shouldn't be hard, but they should have done it in 2020 and they didn't do shit. No. They should have done it during the lockdown. Lockdowns, they didn't do shit. You guys fucking went and arrested people on a fucking beach. You filled fucking parks with sand. You arrested people for opening their businesses. That's fucked up, bro. Yeah. And here's a good thing though. You'll have a chance to redeem yourself, man, because it is coming. It is coming. But I want to address some communism that's happening here in a new report that just came out. I'm not sure if you saw this or not. But take a load of this shit. Tax hypocrisy. Nearly 6,000 IRS employees and contractors. Oh, 50 million dollars. And back taxes. A Treasury audit reveals. So the same people, they're not paying their taxes. That makes sense. The same people though, that come to us and audit us and investigate and take our fuck and arrest us if we don't pay our taxes and put leans on our shit and make our lives fucking horrible and take fucking half of our money that we work our fucking balls off for. And you're not even paying their fucking taxes. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Let's dive into this. So a recent audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration or TIGTA. It has uncovered that nearly 6,000 employees and contractors of the internal revenue service collectively. Oh, close to 50 million dollars in overdue taxes. It's around 10,000 per fucking person. It's it's $8,333 per person. Yeah. What would the government do if you owed $8,333? Uh, dude, it's it's. So US Senator Johnny Erst out of Iowa who requested the audit did not hold back in her criticism of IRS Commissioner Daniel Wurfel. In a press release, Erst introduced the audit the IRS Act, which mandates annual audits of IRS employees and calls for the termination of any agent found to be delinquent on their taxes. The spirit of 1776 is still alive and well with the tax revolt happening right now at the most unlikely of places in Washington, the IRS, instead. Quote, while the IRS warns tax evasion is a serious crime punishable by imprisonment, fines, and the imposition of civil penalties, the agency is rewarding its own tax dodges with paychecks and lavish benefits made possible ironically with the taxes paid by law. Abiding citizens. My legislation will create a zero tolerance policy for tax evasion and misconduct while ensuring these IRS bureaucrats are no longer allowed to live by one set of rules and enforce another on honest, hardworking American she added. So here were some of the key findings over 5,800 IRS and contractor employees owe nearly $50 million in overdue taxes. Despite having the authority to terminate employees who willfully fail to pay taxes, only 20 of those individuals were dismissed for tax related reasons. More than 500 former IRS employees with documented compliance issues, including criminal and sexual misconduct were rehired by the agency or its contractors. And of the 3300 IRS employees identified with unpaid taxes, 2000, owe over 12 million without being on a payment plan. Among the 2400 contractor employees, 1700 owe more than 17 million also without payment plans. It gets worse than that. Governmentwide, the TI GTA found 149,000 federal employees owe an astounding $1.5 billion in unpaid taxes. There are almost 150,000 federal employees who combined collectively owe more than $1.5 billion in unpaid taxes. That's 150,000 employees that owe $10,000 in back taxes who haven't arranged a payment plan because they're not being forced to have one, which is what they do to you. If you- Exactly what they do. They're going to show ages. If they don't fuck it, if they can't get a payment plan. And first of all, before you get a payment plan, they'll look at your assets and they make you fill out all this shit. And then they'll say, you go sell this, this, this, this, this. And once you sell all this shit, we'll put you on a payment plan. Like bro, they ruined people's lives over this. Listen, people don't understand if you've never had an issue with taxes, you don't- they don't understand how fucking vicious and how predatory the tax law is in this country when they go to collect. Dude, listen bro, we don't live in a fucking free country. I say this over and over again. The reason that people don't understand that is because they're used to paying these taxes from birth. Okay, but that's new. Paying the amount of tax that we pay is relatively new. They started that back in 1913. Okay. Before that, we didn't pay shit. We kept what we- what we earned. And that is how it should be now. Okay. Most of the government services should be privatized. Yes, there still has to be a little bit of a government. There has to be things that the government isn't charge of. Police, military, defense of the country, basic things. Yes, we are going to have to pay some tax, but the tax that we need to pay should never exceed ever. 10% of our income. It should never exceed that. And people who are at the highest tax bracket are paying 50, 60, 70, 80% of their money in taxes. And people say, oh, well, that's not true. That's an exaggeration. No, it's not. Because you're only counting for income tax. You're not counting for all the tax that you have to pay when you buy shit, when you sell shit, when you own shit, when you create shit. Like you don't understand it. Like the tax code and because they're used to it. And then the people who vote for it, they don't pay taxes because they don't have jobs. And yet they get to vote. So do we not understand the problem here? If you have people that don't have a job that have a voice and they get to vote on what's going on, they are going to vote for more of your shit to them. Okay, if they're paying taxes, they're less likely to do that because they're actually operating as a contributing member of society and they want to keep more of their own shit. So their goal here is to import or make people unemployed enough people so that there's more people that don't produce than there are that do because if they have more people that don't produce those people are going to vote. The other people's wealth away from them, which then handicaps the population completely, both the producers and the noun producers. And it creates a scenario where it's very easy to control the population. And they trick people into thinking that, you know, you might have paid your fair share, motherfucker. Everybody that pays taxes pays their fair share and they pay way more. There's no reason that these people should be in Washington DC walking out worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It's quite honestly impossible without them stealing it. You can't go from a net worth of a million dollars or less to hundreds of millions of dollars in the government without stealing. No, and they don't call it inside of trading because you know it's confidential briefings and it's within the regulatory rights to have these meetings. And so what they do with that information and they can just go invest in these things like, well, it's complete bullshit, man. It's complete bullshit. I just hate that these fucking these fucks will literally take all of your shit and they're not even fucking. Not only will they take your shit, bro, they'll they'll be smug about it. They have these people are the biggest power trip mother fuckers in the face of the earth. They're they're unhinged fucking communist bro, like just wait, dude, just wait. It's going to get way worse if people keep voting for this shit. Yeah. Yeah, man. Guys jumping on this conversation. I hope the people of Venezuela fucking stick. I said this when fucking Canada did it. I said this when they did it in Europe. If you don't solve the problem and finish the job, bro, it's you're going to be worse off. So all the homies in Venezuela realize this is your one chance. If you don't fucking if you don't get this Maduro out and like complete the revolution that you're a part of right now, you are going to pay and your family's going to pay and they're probably going to be killed. So it's all or nothing for you fuckers in Venezuela and you better push through. Apparently he has like a $15 million warrant form here. Listen, dude, it's a lot versus a little. It's it's it's it's it's millions of people versus fucking 50. It should be very easy. Yes, there's going to be some people that are fucking killed trying to do it. But for the greater good. You guys got one chance, dude. If you let this dude stay in power, you're fucked. Yeah. So, you know, what what true do do after they didn't finish the job? What was the next thing he did after those trucker combo is during COVID didn't fucking do anything? You like shit down harder. No, no, what do you take away from people? That's right. Yeah. And to those of you that say January six was an insurrection. Think of all these people that you see in Venezuela, writing, but all of them have guns because that's what an insurrection will look like here. Yeah, guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. I was that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where bring a headline and talk about it. And we get one of those two options and I'll be honest. This one scares me Andy. This one scares me. Let's check this out. Thumbs up. It dumb as fuck. Headline reads chimpanzees appear capable of human speech and remarkable resurface videos, researchers revel. Reveal reveal reveal reveal. Okay. So researchers are going bananas. That's racist. I'll just start there. Oh, huh? How is that? A new scientific paper reports that chimpanzees are capable of producing sounds that mimic words they hear from people. It follows recent research revealing that chimpanzees can gesture to one another in conversations like humans. The new research looked at two archived videos of chimps uttering words on camera. One clip from the mid 2000s and another from the 1960s in both cases, the apes uttered the word mama. When given cues from their handlers, it defies previous belief that speech was beyond chimpanzees. Neural circuitry researchers noted quote grade eight vocal production capacities have been underestimated the paper read. Quote chimpanzees possessed the neural building blocks necessary for speech. So here's the first clip from the 1960s. There are two chimpanzees in Rome who have brought a new twist in communication between animal and human. Now we don't mean the dance. We mean Renata. She's a champ with an IQ that has scientists climbing trees. With her train at Renata has developed a routine that draws applause from everyone. As explained by her foster mother, this is one of the most extraordinary chimps in the world. You don't have to know Italian to understand Renata's accent when she gets her IQ. This is from a younger. That's crazy. There's the more recent example of the two filmed inside sun coast primate center in Palm Harbor, Florida. So chimpanzee named Johnny speak the word in exchange for a red twizzler when prompted by caretaker to say it. Johnny's deep pitched cadence sound eerily similar to Andy circus English fluent chimpanzee Caesar from the planet of the apes film franchise has pointed out by several commenters on the 16 year old clip. Let's check this clip out. You're my sweetest man. Who's my sweetest man? Bro, listen, yeah, now it's cute. Next thing you know you got Caesar fucking coming after bro. I don't have none to worry about. I treat animals better fucking anybody. I got none to worry about. Bro, in fact, I'm going to join their fucking side. I promise you if there was a war of chimpanzees and humans, I'm fighting on their side. Really? Fuck yeah. People are shit, dude. Especially the evil ones. Yes. I give this thumbs up. I hope it happens faster and faster. Oh, come on, man. Dude, that is creepy as fuck. That's awesome. Could you imagine a fucking yeah bro. Be great. Those are great movies too. They are really good movies. No. Bro, that's some scary shit, bro. It's badass. That's some, he does sound like Caesar. Yeah. No. Thumbs down for me bro. Nope, thumbs up. I like it. I'm waiting for him to send me my draft papers. Just the hand print on the paper. Yeah, I'm fucking in, dude. Alright, man. Well, guys, Andy, that's all I got. Alright guys, don't be a hoe. Show the show. Bad bitch, who the fuck got her own bankroll. Can't fold. There's a note here. Shot case, cloth, cloth.
