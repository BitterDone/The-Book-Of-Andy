Oh Yes, she was an alien. Yeah, I honestly I don't okay, but here's the thing So there's a video of this shit happening all right, and again, don't even focus on just stop the oil people See if you can catch what I call thought was fucking weird even weirder than the vegans What the fuck was that they just climbed up the stage You're the fucking theater door Twinkle toes no bro, what was that bro that was you in your underpants bro crawling out of a hole Listen, I'm sure there's some wonderful context here, okay? I'm just not into this shit man bro. What the fuck is that bro? It's a bunch of dorks It's a bunch of dorks and and dorks watching He was so ready to do his little part it's Yeah, he was there you got mad they shot off a little fucking Bro, and then how about the people right how about the two nerds running out on stage with the banner and They look so like scared to do it. Oh, bro, and then y'all do like oh you ready. I'm ready. Are you ready? I'm ready All right, let's go you first They look like they're stealing beer out of somebody's garage 14 Well, shit, I can't do my pot I've had enough of these environmental nerds. Oh, they're so weird. Yeah, no Didn't they fuck up the Mona Lisa or some shit or try to yeah, try to fuck up everything and they think that's what's gonna like get them attention Dude what you know There's two of you Like that should that should tell you something right you should look around and be like oh I'm the only ones a limited one you know the ones that get me two or the ones that try to block the cars Run him over oh you see that one clip to do like fucking drug them like you drug him out the street like Most people are over there shit anyway, so I mean that's good to see we I don't think we have many of them here in the US That seems to be more like a British UK thing bro anybody that like lays in the street or sits in the street like It is what it is man. It's natural selection to me roke-kill I mean, I hate to be that way, but it's it's fucking annoying and these people have figured out Over the course of the last 20 years that they can annoy society and do things at disrupt society and not have any repercussions whatsoever So how are you going to teach them that there's repercussions? You're gonna have to make examples of a few people and when people do things like hold up traffic for four hours How do you know that there's not people on the way to the hospital? How do you know there's people not on the way to you know a loved one passing away? You don't know and it's incredibly selfish for these people to do that and for them to stop it They're gonna be have to make examples of like you're gonna have to make examples of everybody to stop behavior That's that's how you stop behavior and you only need a couple. Yes, you only need to couple. Yeah I mean dude look man. I These people's days are are coming to an end in terms of their social acceptance people are over it and I don't know they should be over that God awful theater Yeah, I just want to know what I want the content you listen in on the on the show on Audio this fucking big fat guy crawls out of a hole on the stage and he's wearing like with W. W. He's wearing Tights and me high boots and some sort of corset by the girl come off the top rope. Yeah Yeah, yeah Anyway, I just thought that was fucking interesting man I don't know guys tell us what you guys think What should be happy Hmm, I want to know what people think should happen to people who disrupt society Like that that's a good question people who damage You know cultural art that's hundreds of years old thousands of years old That's irreplaceable people who sit in the highways and who vandalize and throw pain on shit and pain on people Throw fucking can of pain on me, bro. See what happens? It'll be the end of you, right? That's what you have to fucking start doing to these people to get them to stop their The Greta Thumbnails bro. This is this is what these people do they have not had any repercussions They don't get in trouble for anything and if you don't get in trouble for anything Then one of the limits of what you are willing to do to be annoying and By the way like imagine this being your whole cause. Oh fuck. That's what that's my other thing I feel like there's way more other things like I've never been a big you know, let's go protest this thing, right? I feel like there's way other way more other things you could protest No like taxes because like there's no right like let's go throw some tea in the Boston Boston Harbor I'm down with that you know, but like this ain't you're not gonna do anything bro. It's temper tantrums It's grown adult temper tantrums squeaky wheels man. Give him some oil Yeah guys, let's start the comments. What's you guys think should happen to these people? Let us know With that being said I really drew truly believe like all all sort of jokes aside. I believe Like those people shouldn't if you analyze or block traffic or any of that shit 10-year-presidents automatic automatic no matter what I'm down with it. Yeah, we guys let us know what you think With that being said, let's get into our crews. We've got some interesting headlines to cover And if you want to see any of these headlines go to Andy for sell out calm guys We link all of these articles pictures links videos. We link them there for you. So go check them out With that being said, let's buckle up buttercup. Yeah, that line number one. All right Ain't the first time they call buttercup. Oh really ain't the last either tell me more That's not number one I want to touch this real quick just just quickly and get your take on this This has been making some waves. Do you see the new AI thing? Right I'm not a spack guy. I don't I don't know much about what the play here is I know there's a lot of people that are pissed off. I know in video I think as of today lost like 20 billion dollars in market cat. That's it. Yeah, I mean they were down way more Yes, I think fuck yeah, I mean, but that's a shit turn of fucking money. Yeah, but they're trillion dollar mark kept companies True, so fuck that's ridiculous. That's hard to fathom a trillion dollars. Well, I mean They're being exposed for why they are you know That's what's kind of going on here with this deep seek shit. Yeah, we got yeah I mean yeah, the nightmare on Wall Street tech stocks set to lose one trillion dollars over Chinese A.I. Startup deep seek so major US tech stocks like Nvidia Microsoft meta and Tesla Reset for a stunning one trillion dollar out on Monday as fears over an advanced Chinese Artificial intelligence model triggered hysteria from Wall Street to Silicon Valley Valley Shares of Nvidia plunge nearly 13% in early trading erasing hundreds of billions in value As investors Learned about deep seek a China based startup which has made waves in the industry after launching a free open source large language model in December And apparently deep seek is claiming that they did all of this were able to start this this new thing In just two months at a cost of under six million dollars And that's without access to Nvidia's best computer chips. So a big difference These were the stock markets as of January 27th. This was a screenshot of the NASDAQ Dow S&P 500. I mean, it was a pretty big hit Like I'm not a big stock. I don't really know what the business play here was what the consequences mean This is your I mean, that's your alley. You know that shit. What exactly was this? So I guess in plain English for us. Well, I mean look dude. I've seen this before we've seen this in the late 90s Went with the dot com bubble bursting You know when you're the first to market and whatever you're selling whatever technology Have is a mystery to your competitors or maybe there isn't even any competitors yet It's very easy to commence Potential stock buyers to buy your stock because you have a unique product that no one really knows how to replicate and You know in the case of this AI in my opinion and obviously this is all my opinion But the technology is so impressive and so I don't know history altering that People want to be a part of it and when the video is the market leader, you know, they were able to raise that sort of a Money through the sale of their stocks and and you know people wanting to invest because they had the magical formula, right and And a lot of times and I'm not saying this is what happened But a lot of times when the companies are in that position they oversell their exclusivity and they make Their product seem like it's more complicated than it is and harder to produce than it is so that they can perceive more value with the people who are who are Potentially going to invest and so what this this deep-seek Exposed is that Superior technology can be made Very inexpensively which then causes people to understand that what they've invested in isn't as special as What they thought it was and it creates a sell-off Fuck yeah, so I mean there's a lot of people pissed on this. I mean we're talking like shit ton of money got lost Yeah, I mean look dude. Well, I mean yeah a lot of people lost and a lot of people sold what was probably the top Mm-hmm There's a lot of people that made a lot of fucking money, you know, but I mean do they're still worth a crazy amount of money But the more AI technology that comes out Unless they are you know going to establish themselves as the premier AI solution sort of like How Apple has in terms of computers and phones and you can argue if that's true or not, but they've definitely created that perception for sure I think that you know I think If they're able to keep that they'll be able to keep you know their position or at least a very valuable position in the stock market But if they're not and this technology becomes easy to replicate and cheap to replicate I mean they they'll be it'll be a commodity. Mm-hmm won't be worth anything very interesting man Very interesting shit like I just wanted to throw that in there because you know You got all the people with their Facebook degrees talking about it. Well, I mean that's my take on it I mean, I'm obviously not the most I'm an entrepreneur builder. I'm not an investor I'm not I'm not a stock investment analyst I'm someone who takes ideas and make them happen from nothing So, you know, this isn't even really my expertise either, but that's my take on make sense though. Yeah, that's my take on watching it Yeah, well that's interesting work wanted to put that out there But we got all the stuff to cover Obviously we have you know, we wrapped up the first week of Donald Trump's presidency second term Lot of interest and stuff happened in there So far he's already setting records one of those records being uh, the total number of questions Trump answered in his first week Is a record number of questions apparently. I guess coming off a Biden presidency That's shocking people throwing people off But it's doing weird. It's weird watching after what we've seen for the last four years It it is weird watching him sit there and Just talk to people right, you know, and then like port is aren't being rushed out the rooms. Yeah, or hidden or you know, like I mean dude It's it's it's how it's supposed to be, but it just feels weird after what we've been through well I think it's also too. You're seeing you know the the report is all these journalists and shit They've lost their manners and they forgot how it is and how it's supposed to be when you're talking to the fucking leader of the free will Yeah, but he's straighting them out Yeah, I'm saying real quick, right? I think those reporters that do that are doing themselves a disservice I think reporters have lost their Understanding of the position that they hold in the world. You don't create the fucking news, bro You did for a long time, but you don't know we do we're the fucking press now, right? Okay? Um And secondly, you know, you're talking to the fucking president of the United States I know for the last four years. There's been no repercussions There's actually for the last eight years. There's been no repercussions for your tone of voice and your lack of manners and your lies But that's gonna come and you know, we're seeing it already happen It's like a fucking deep diamond etiquette class again. Mm-hmm. It's good to see But yeah, so we said records with that Other things he's doing though that are very interesting. He just fired a bunch of us AID workers. Did you see this? So so USAID workers put on leave as Trump officials investigate resistance to aid pause So dozens and not just like a couple 56 Okay 56 workers officials and these are top officials They were just placed on administrative leave Because they were trying to do some work around some one of his executive orders So this is I don't know if this is so much of deep state work You know, but he put the executive order down saying hey, we're gonna pause USA Going to fucking foreign countries right now, and they were trying to do a little kebal work and their offices trying to fucking backdoor the shit We just put them all on fucking leave good So that's pretty fucking cool. Put him in jail. That's what they I mean bro Listen if you're not gonna listen to the president or abide by the rules of this government that have been laid out for Hundreds of years put him in jail Like do that that goes along with what you're saying about the reporters everybody's gotten so they think they can just do say Whatever they want, you know And and dude you can't you can't just when the president signs an executive order and you are part of The executive branch of government you don't get to just do whatever the fuck you want to do you have to do what he says right? so I I mean Yeah I think the the the administrative leave is too light. I agree You know now obviously they're saying they're gonna go through the investigation and all that I hope they fucking get fired some ass the jail bro. That's what that's what they're doing You got Mark Rubio in he's the the new secretary of state So these come these actions come after secretary of state Marco Rubio acting on Trump's executive order paused All US foreign assistance funded by or through the state department and USAID Uh, it's a 90 day pause All right, so not another fucking dollar is coming from the United States going to these you know Gender studies in fucking Pakistan or fucking condoms in fucking Gaza right you hear about that 50 million dollars Yeah, see that's an example see like look dude That is an example of how they steal your money. Do you really think they spent 50 million dollars on condoms like do you rip? No, do you okay? Where'd you buy them? Where'd you get them from where's the sales order? Where's the product? Let's see it because this is what they do they make shit up like that hide it in a bill on page 4,000 and then they take that 50 million dollars that is your money and they put it in their pockets 50 million dollars on condoms in Gaza, but I mean dude It's a good example because it's so absurd. I don't believe that most Americans understand how the government Not just oppresses us financially, but also Legitimately just steals their money and this is how you have people that come in with zero net worth leading with 50 60 a hundred million dollar net worth. This is one of the ways that they do it Well, yeah, brother, then they get they put you put them put those same people on these fucking committees Right, they get these inside of information on you know a deep state coming out or you know in video with the new chip They they're in those fucking confidential classified briefings Then they go invest the money that they just got done stealing put it back on a stock market and they're getting 45% Yeah, it's insane. Yeah, your money. Our money makes them rich. It's insane. Yeah, but yeah, so you got that going on like so that's good to see Um, but we got some anti-domas here. We got some anti-domas man and I already know if it feels good to see it um Let's head on reads is Donald Trump abolishing income tax what we know whew I mean A few people have been talking about it. Yeah, horse me years. Yeah um President Donald Trump Said has suggested that imposing tariffs on foreign nations a key part of his administration's agenda will bring back wealth to America Not income taxes America or actually let's just watch the video. Let's hear from the horses mouth. Check this clip out Again, and it's gonna happen very quickly It's time for the United States to return to the system that made us richer and more powerful than ever before You know the United States in 1870 to 1913 All tariffs and that was the richest period in the history of the United States relatively speaking in other words relatively and we they set up the great tariff Commission of 1887 And this commission had one function what to do with all the money that we took in it was so enormous that they had no idea Was a blue ribbon committee was set up 1887 And what to do with all of the money that we had and again Teddy Roosevelt was a beneficiary because when McKinley was Killed he took over this vast sum of money and he did all of those national parks and all of the other things And I'm not knocking him But he was given a vast amount of money and that was all made through tariffs as we had no income tax the income tax came in in 1913 As I said in my speech last week instead of taxing our citizens to enrich for our nations. We should be Terrifying and taxing for our nations to enrich our citizens. Is that makes sense? Now now here's my take real quick This is the shit that gets you assassinated Trump needs to be very like bro Well, because what he's effectively talking about is ending the federal reserve I mean that's that's where this is going to go right You know that I mean you talk about dangerous walking waters to trade Yeah, it's people don't understand what that means that means you're cutting The federal reserve is not a actual government entity correct private people own it And when you're cutting off their ability to control the money across across the globe because that's what will happen If America does this now you're talking about by any means necessary stop that because that's how they made all their money That's why the richest families in the world have you know the people who control the federal reserve those families have more wealth And then the rest of the world combined and no one ever talks about that nobody talks about that nobody talking about the fact Yes, you have five or six families that have more wealth than all of the nations the entire country entire population The entire world combined So how is that okay? It's not okay. It's not it's not man, but again I mean we you can look in history man. There's been leaders all over this world. Yeah That have initiated. Hey listen this type of listen bro. Let me run through it in 1913 this is when this was created you want me to run through the leaders who have been assassinated over it? Let's do it Hitler fucking JFK fucking Omar Qaddafi fucking Saddam Hussein all of these people had one thing in common and they've all been painted in history except JFK As a villain, okay, I'm not saying they weren't but I am saying this it's they weren't killed and villainized for the reasons The exact reasons that they tell history tells us right they were killed and villainized for the reason that they wanted to set an example of what their country look like off the Federal reserve system and They in some of these cases they did it such as Germany, okay? And if one country you can do it and it becomes wealthy that shows all the other countries that they can do it And they can't fucking have that so any of these leaders who have ever proposed getting off the Federal reserve Have been killed in one way or whether through war assassination or whatever right and then all of them except one have been villainized to You know be the worst people ever right right right, so I mean dude, you know And and who writes the history and who controls the fucking news the same fucking people So I'm just saying this danger is waters bro I mean this is some real dangerous waters man. You start having those Do this is what's gonna correct the country. This is what's gonna correct The problems that we have in this country and to be completely honest It's really refreshing to see Trump talk about these things because my biggest criticism has been that he's not gone hard enough and He didn't talk about these things like we talked about on the show Because he had to keep him close to his chest and now that he's in here now he can do these things and You know I think it's a great thing. I think so happy. Yeah, it does and here's the thing too Well, I think he has the people that he needs in places. Yeah, to get it done to get it done look dude the administration that's in place Exist solely in my opinion right now. This is my opinion as of today This could change and it's been different in the past But I am becoming more and more excited about what's happening with this administration as the days go by because what I'm realizing Is that they're moving very quickly intentionally? Not to necessarily make the change but to show um because look dude They have to show the country and the world in the next four years What these changes will actually do to someone's real life, right? Okay What's it gonna do in their household right right right and it takes time for these changes to trickle down And so when I recognize with these people and I know a lot of them personally Is that they are trying to move so fast So that we over the next four years will feel this change and then won't ever go back to this bullshit That we've had in the last 12 or 16 years with Obama Fucking Clinton's Clinton. Yeah George W They're trying to reform The entire government structure and realign it with what You know more with what it's supposed to have been well, I think to that point too, man I'll take it a step further not only they have to to prove this and show us what it's gonna be like within these next four years I believe that it's gonna take we have to be able to live in that you know fruitful environment for at least two of those years That's what I'm saying and you know, yeah, like I mean that's exactly what I'm saying They're making the change now so that for you know three to four three to two or three years of this of this term People's lives get so much and better that they will never go back the other way right 100% I see like just so like dude if you make their life that much better over the next three years These fucking idiots to get up and talk this stupid ass shit They're gonna get laughed out of the room or thrown in jail Because every the reason that people are okay with the oppressive environment that we live in is because we've always lived in it Right We've always lived in it a fucking there's the parable of the of the elephant baby elephant in a little stake Right when you take a baby elephant and you tie him to a little bitty stake the side a 12 inch stake in the ground He put it fucking rope on it. You can't get away Well, you could hold that same gigantic elephant when it's a full adult with that same little bitty stick because it doesn't know any better And that's what the American people are the American people were born into a system of financial Tax slavery that we all agree to and and and and and deal with because we don't know any different But if we knew different which is what they're trying to create in my opinion now We would never go back to the other way So when I see what they're doing now and how fast they're moving it makes me think that They're trying to create the result quick enough that we get to live in it so that the next time these fucking communists come around we're like dude Uh, we're gonna take your head and put it on a stake if you don't go somewhere else You know what I mean? Oh no fucking chance. Yeah, no chance right um that's how I'm taking it right now dude Because they're moving extremely fast Mm-hmm I'm gonna and like when you say extremely fast like for you guys and it's like The actual impact the fucking through the executive orders the actual action of the fucking fix is as fast Yeah, you know, I'm saying which is super important man Um, and again like he's putting the right people in place to do it right um Senate just confirmed uh his nominee Scott Benson uh for treasury secretary This guy's fucking awesome. Okay. He's fucking awesome And for those you know blue hair liberals out there um He is the first openly gay treasury secretary As he get it what he does guess what? He's got anyone to be known as that as he good at what he does He's fucking great. Well, I don't know. I will find out But I don't give a shit if he's gay he doesn't man. No one cares and guess what trump didn't care He could do the fucking job. He's he was qualified for it, right? Um, and that's really what it comes down to but this guy's fucking awesome He had an exchange with uh Bernie Sanders uh during his confirmation here And I don't know if you got a chance to see it Bernie thought he was about to put a hot one on him and it kind of backfired on him. Let's check this clip out What Biden said last night is we're moving toward an oligarchy. I'm asking you that question Do you think to get how they made their money? Do you think that when so few people have so much wealth and so much economic and political power that that is an oligarchy Funtzzide Well, I wouldn't note that the President Biden gave the presidential metal freedom to two people who I think would qualify for his oligarchs. Oh Oh, so so yeah, sir he's trying to uh saying to try to hit him with that, you know With Trump singing out with Elon Musk and you know the Bezos of the world and you know Is that okay to be surrounded by so much power and money and you know so few people can throw his like Well, I mean What about George Soros that fucking Biden just fucking gave the middle of the line to like yeah not only that dude Let's let's think about this too. Okay, all those same people were on board with fucking Biden Okay, Zuckerberg was with Biden. Okay The Google guys with Biden all right Jack what's his face from Twitter when he owned Twitter? Jack Dorsey Jack Dorsey with Biden Okay The Biden regime and the the DOJ and the FBI and that whole fucking group of people Those people were an ugly a garkey like by by default definitely yes and now and dude and now do you notice that like all the same people that Said nothing about grocery prices Four weeks ago or now like oh look at the grocery prices under Trump like bro people are not this fucking stupid Okay, it these people up in Washington are so full of their own ego and their own hubris They think that we've forgotten we haven't forgotten we all lived through it and unlike you mother fuckers up there We got to deal with it in real life you all live in your fucking you know 40 million dollar homes that we bought you You know like Bro, you these people don't know what it's like to have to worry about you know how much money they spend on groceries You know what i'm saying right like and then don't give a fuck they give about themselves bro The one thing I've figured out over the over the last four or five years Is that most people not most but most people i guess most people up there in Washington They're there to make money. They are not there to serve anyone. They are there for their own fucking greed And these people at the top of the food chain that are worth a hundred plus billion dollars They're no different these people do not have standards. They don't have integrity They don't give a fuck what side they got to be on as long as it's the winning side All right, and these people thought that the woke left communist regime was going to win America And so they contributed to them helping them win because they figured that when they win they will benefit which they would Okay, and now because the the culture has switched all these people are now changing like chameleons To try and fit in with trump because they don't want to feel the hammer of accountability come down on their fucking face And unfortunately it feels like trump is falling for it Which he has this fault in his character that i that i think he has where He he fucking duty forgets what people did like and dude you can't do that in these scenarios like these people are not These are savage people bro. They'll fucking they will take the dinner off of someone You know Who has nothing they will take it and dude unfortunately, you know There's there's ethical entrepreneurship where you have a sense of service to your employees and your community and your customer And then there's unethical people and there's people that don't give a fuck and and the more I realize what's going on up there Is that we have a collection of the biggest fucking egos The Most entitled Superior god complex group of people that exists on this planet, you know, and they think they rule over us And when they do not fucking rule over us they work for us and we have to remember that so Uh, you know birdie sanders Isn't wrong and what he's saying But when they say it that when those people when they try to market that instead of marketing it like they are right now to the very top People and saying hey, this is wrong Six months ago that motherfucker's talking about people like me right? The your local entrepreneur or your national level entrepreneur who's not worth a hundred billion and and also Employees thousands of people and takes care of community and sponsors teams and charities and does all this crazy shit for their own city Those guys don't do that shit, okay? And and fucking six months ago He was targeting that same rhetoric to guys like me and entrepreneurs like me and smaller and now Because it's convenient He's attacking Bezos and fucking Elon and fucking zuck and like dude this guy's as foolish shit as everybody else And at the end of the day There's there's a reality and the reality is this There shouldn't be so much wealth at that level accumulated by individuals In my opinion and I don't know what the limit is or how the fucking I I'm a capitalist But I believe in ethical capitalism. I believe that once you're past a certain point I mean bro, it doesn't matter anymore, right? And and dude we have a situation where these people have so much money and so much control Especially with the technology that they produce that they can literally run the world and That's that's what he's talking about but that's not different than it was six months ago or four years ago or whatever It's always been that way right and so Dude we have to get to a Come to an understanding as as Americans that yes for capitalist yes for entrepreneurs. Yes. We go on kick-ass Yes, we want to be rich. Yes. We want to have nice shit, but When we're talking about, you know, you you you're a hundred billionaire, okay? I mean dude back in the day we broke up companies like that in this country, right? You know, we deregulated countries like that our companies like that because they had too much power control And with the tech companies you have three tech companies that fucking own everything and they own every line of communication Why isn't Donald Trump or these other people up there in Washington De-regulating these companies for the interests of America because they no longer work for Americans They work for themselves and those people get funded by those same people to make it to not make that decision Exactly, okay, and this is why the elimination of lobby money and special interest and campaign donations from corporations Needs to fucking be illegal If you made it illegal if you made those contributions illegal the people that were up there Would make decisions that were in the their best interests their best interests used to be I need to get my voters in my community to support me Now their best interest is I need to raise as much money as I can so I can lie to these people It doesn't matter what I do once I'm there because I'm there and I'm getting the money to stay there Because I can run ads that just aren't true. Yeah, so The whole system is fucked and it's not just fucked a little bit. It's completely fucked and if we lived in a If we lived in a situation where men were men there already been a revolution That's the truth and all these motherfuckers be out on the street. I think two men like I mean It's also interesting to like me. Let's say I run for governor for Missouri I'm not let's use a different because Missouri actually does it pretty decently but like you know Let's say you know I'm running for governor for California. There should be no reason why I should be able to take fucking campaign donations from people that You know not only don't live in my state, but don't live in my country And that's how it's set up right now Right like or well, why why Why should you be able to take donations from companies Anyway, right. Hold on From companies, right why Yeah, so I feel like I mean if that company is established running in my district in my state Okay, fine. Why no because you don't serve the company serve the fucking people. Yeah, it should be individual human donations people Right and then for people like Zuckerberg who can write unlimited checks There should be a cap on what they can donate. Yeah, yeah, there is no cap right now Right because the super PAC will take any amount of money, right? So like dude There's all kinds of these little fundraising Fuckery things that most people don't understand how they work That need to be resolved so that the people can have the power back. Yeah, and you know eliminating income taxes a great start dude Huge deal and then you have people saying Well, terrorists. They're just gonna pack This is my favorite fucking argument Well, if we just make tariffs then all the products are gonna be so expensive that you can't afford them Well, if we have more money because we're not paying tax number one uh We will be able to afford them and number two What products would you be incentive eyes to buy if you were looking to say my oh you'd buy products that were made in America And then what happens is the money that you saved from not paying taxes goes from you to other Americans who make products and Then the economy here grows right and it benefits all of us job is very able to hire more I mean, it's a very simple solution very simple and again, it's been done It's very simple, but remember 90 fucking five percent of this country can't balance a fucking checkbook or a bank account And they're intentionally kept financially illiterate so they can't understand what all this shit is So that they can continue to do it the government can continue to do it So and listen I'll say this I have more faith and Trump to fix all this shit now than I did a week ago And then I did a month ago because these movies so fast it makes me think that he has a whole long list of other things that need to be fixed And I think he know I think he's a very smart man I think he knows what needs to be fixed to make the the company run and profitable And uh if he if he really does then what I'm saying is what will unfold eventually for sure Yeah, it does also seem very strategic and methodical to yeah, and he's trying I believe they're trying to place the power of this country back into the individual citizen And if that's going to happen then you're going to have to take the power away or limit the power of the richest people in the world Maybe you allow them to make you know I don't I don't necessarily think it's right to limit someone's ability to make money even if it's a lot But Maybe you can make their influence the same as everybody else By limiting the amount that they can donate or things like that, right? You know what I mean There's just a lot of ways you could cut it, but at the end of the day Bernie Sanders is not wrong. He's a fucking total hypocrite, but he's not wrong Okay, five people six people shouldn't control the outcome of the entire country for all the citizens So it's fair man guys jumping on this combo. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said Let's go cruise some of the commentary That cruise comments this first comment comes from ad Madison college 24 42 She says I am normally an Apple podcast listening but currently on YouTube at work. Forgot how handsome you guys are I mean that been trying to tell you guys You guys listen on audio 90% of our audience listen on audio You guys need to go over there YouTube subscribe get a look at us. Mm-hmm good looking motherfuckers good look Yeah, take a picture of that So Madison thanks Madison It's better than our fucking hate comments. I mean it's nice to see this. I like the hate ones better I like the hate ones, but yeah, thanks Madison appreciate it Um, all right, we got it. We got a OG uh comment here. All right OG status. I'm gonna give the dusty feather remember her dusty feather had her a couple of weeks ago. She says uh DJ doesn't know about Southern black feon rules because of Because the crunching of this fruit circles while laughing maniacally manically Was too loud ps my hair is not blue your hair is blue. It looks like it But she says it's not I think it's just a filter then well anyway Uh, yeah, I don't know why DJ doesn't know about the black feon rules because that's kind of fear I'm gonna have for sure. That's sweet guys. We appreciate you for being a real ass fans guys With that being said, let's keep the screws moving. Got headline numero dose I'll do a little bit more of a deep dive. Obviously the deportation um You know movement that's happening right now throughout the country. Let's let's give a little uh diving this What would you say overall great thus far though if we were to grade You know this first week and a half what would you give a scale? I mean, I would let's go to you one of you One to ten would do eight. I mean do one to ten. I mean, I think it's a fucking I think it's a nine Okay, you know, I I think the one of the things I think one of the things that should have happened on day one was repealing the income tax, you know That's a that's a point off of his yeah And I also feel like they should be deporting more people, but I know you've got to walk before you can run. Yeah, so I would say it's pretty good man. I mean he's they're doing a lot quick and uh, I think it's abduable And I think it says a lot to America Especially the people that always thought that you know he wasn't You know a real president, you know, he's done more real things for the country that are gonna benefit the citizens In a week than these guys did in four years and I wonder how many people Seeing that and then seeing him take questions and then seeing him talk to the press Have now like fully come to terms that the 2020 election was still was stolen, bro Because you could clearly Like seeing the the disparity between what's happening now and the confidence and the confidence What's happening now versus what was happening even for the people that hate Donald Trump you cannot fucking compare it No, okay, it's like Major league baseball player versus a four-year-old kid trying to hit them all off a tee for the first time Yeah, and well, it should piece pissing people off too. What I mean, yeah They know I'm saying knowing that the last four years it was just intentionally ruined and it could have been so much fucking better It's eight years because they didn't allow him to do his job his first first firm. Yeah, I mean, that's true But other things that he's doing too that I'm actually loving Um, you know, is he Trump's not afraid to get into some dick measuring kind of test. Yeah, you know, and apparently he is Pretty big, you know, that's you know Speculation But it seems to be pretty fucking big Columbia you saw the little bottle he had with the Colombian leader. Yeah, and he caved After Trump Trump whipped it out and put it on the table with the next with that coke. Yep. That's the story I heard so again speculation um You know, so that that was the interesting story that quickly turned around not too much going on there But today apparently his daughter the Colombian leaders daughter decided to to to hop in You see see that at all now. Yeah, Colombian president's daughter shades Trump's deportation feud. She says quote For every Colombian deported we will return a gringo Okay, he means white dude. Yeah bring him I mean whatever man like No, don't do it. Please I'm sure they picked up some spices and some new recipes to bring back. Yeah, I mean they'll probably be pissed Who I thought you're about to say so much trace of fucking oh No So stupid man, that's because these people are stupid. Yeah, but yeah, that's what she tweeted that out This is uh that that's it and then you know, obviously again translated for every Colombian deported We will return a green though green go from Oblando cool. That's what she wrote Now uh you got other stuff going on. Uh, do you see the Selena Gomez shit? Yeah, right like Good Lord lady, okay, uh liberal actress Selena Gomez cries like a baby over president trump deporting illegal aliens Um check this clip out Just wanted to say that I'm so sorry Only people are getting attacked and children They don't understand I'm so sorry. I wish I could do something but I can't I don't know what to do I'll try and be there Well you own four houses that are 10,000 square feet or larger You can probably house some of these people in those houses. I'm sure you got to mention lady Uh, I don't know if you remember but you're fucking American and your people are Americans and Americans are the people that made you fucking wealthy and famous and You know able to mount your camera and make a stupid ass video like this like your people are not next kids and by the way They're not deporting nextkins. They're deporting criminals It's not directed at one country's Illegals. It's people who are here illegal. These people are illegal. They're criminals by being here by the nature of them Breaking the law, right? Okay We don't just allow people to break the law. That's the reason for the law And dude, I'm out real talk like Is it everybody tired of this? Is everybody tired of these elite fucking Super mega stars like just fake Virtue signaling for attention like don't you get enough attention like you you have more fucking Instagram followers I think than anybody all right You're a billionaire because people buy your fucking shitty makeup Okay, and you're gonna see you and and fucking cry Where's all you're crying for these women who have been raped and murdered and families ruined and people paralyzed and fucking You know all this shit. Where's your apology for that? Where was your tears for that? Right, you know Because those are your fucking people You know and and dude real talk like these are the kind of people that should get no money from us at all What's funny? So she deleted that video Um, and then posted it with the follow up Uh saying quote apparently it's not okay to show empathy for people. Yeah, where was the empathy for all the other people No, it's not okay to show empathy for the wrong people. It's not okay to show empathy for fucking criminals And I know that leftist have like somehow normalized this that we're gonna give criminals more rights and more empathy Than law abiding citizens who are the victims of their crimes, but that shit is over Okay, and if you feel that bad then maybe you should fucking go with them Okay, get your ass on your fucking private jet fly the fuck down wherever those people are going and tell them you're sorry And if you really give a fuck take seven or eight families and pack them into your fucking four mansions and we'll see How much you really are sorry you're not sorry you're a fucking drama queen Virtue signaling attention seeking Hollywood dirtbag like everybody else It's funny. I buddy clapped in on this too. Who I buddy homin What do you say? Yeah, he snapped it on this homin reacts to Selena Gomez We're going to do this operation without apology. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's what's necessary. Yeah, that's what's necessary He was on Fox News And he said that he would not apologize actress Selena Gomez Let's check this clip out. Listen, this is how they've done this. They've used moral high ground terrorism to bring in this backwards society Okay, this moral leveraging and and and you know judging and you know Conditional judgment based upon if you agree with them. You're a good empathetic person or not is over dude We're done. We're done and I know that you don't think we're done because you're fucking in a different world But we the right everybody else we are done with this shit We don't give a fuck if you celebrities don't think we're good people You already don't you call us fucking Nazis anyway. You played every mother fucking card you have now We don't care anymore when you call someone names for 15 years eventually. They're like, you know what? Fuck you and that's where we are so Fuck you That's where we are. Yeah, let's see what home had to say check this clip out Don't know if you've had a chance to see the video that has been going viral over the past hour So we're still working to clear it and show it in fact The Hollywood celebrity who posted it has now deleted it I I think because probably she faced a lot of backlash for it Noting even the New York Times and Fox News poll show that a majority of American respondents are in favor of deportations of criminals and gang members She posted a video sobbing she was crying in it She said all my people are getting attacked With the picture of an a Mexican flag again. She has now taken that down But what do you say to those who are out there saying that that these are everyday people these are families Better being attacked and dragged out of their homes. How do you respond to that? I don't think we arrested any families. We've arrested public public safety threats and national security threats Bottom line and look president Trump won the election on this one issue secure in our border and saving lives This what happened on our southern border last four is the biggest national security threat this country seen At least in my lifetime because we got over two million no one got away You got a 600 percent increase in sex trafficking We got a record number of terrorists crossing the border on terrorist watch list We have quarter million Americans diving fat and all coming across the open border We're going to do this job and we're going to force the laws of this country If they don't like it then go to Congress and change the law We're going to do this operational apology We're going to make our community safer we're going to save Well, once we lock that borders on continuous operation You're going to see fentanyl dust decrease illegal alien crime decrease sex trafficking decrease It's it's all for the good of this nation and we're going to keep going no apologies. We're moving forward So what's necessary now With all of this though, this just happened today. I don't know if you guys saw this U.S. Border Patrol and Mexican cartel members trade gunfire at southern border. You see this? No, that was a fucking shootout with the cartel down there hurt people Right Suspected Mexican cartel members were caught on video opening fire on U.S. Border Patrol agents near the southern border Monday As a group of migrants reportedly tried to enter the U.S. illegally authority said The ordeal unfolded at about 130 p.m. They're front in Texas custom and border patrol protection um Set in the statement without revealing more details the apparent cartel members has started firing as the group of migrants were trying to cross the Rio Grande Fox News report Exciting law enforcement sources Border patrol agents quickly return fire according to the Texas Department of Public Safety Quote dps responded to assist U.S. Border Patrol after agents received gunfire from cartel members in Mexico while patrolling in front and lieutenant Chris uh Oliver S um set on ex alongside a slew of videos showing the heavily armed government brother walking over there were fucking Like there's some some some heavy heavy duty weaponry, right And so you know with that being said again. Let's go back to our buddy home and who's kind of like the frontman on all of this He's declaring war on him. He's going full out and Let's let's see what he has to say about the outlook of that situation down there What do you know about the border patrol agents exchanging gunfire with uh, Mexico drug cartels from earlier They're taking they have taken gunfire and it's going to get worse uh, Sean because President Trump's going to seal that border. He's going to put the cartels out of business He declared a terrorist organization We got the whole of government is going to dismantle these people and wipe them off the face of the earth They're not gonna go they're not gonna go lately The week we're taking them out of the trafficking business. We're taking them on the smuggling business We're taking them out of the dope business Those going to be more biased on a southwest border That's why Trump committed to calling the terrorist organization he has That's why the entire United States government is going to take care of those people in in abolish them We're going to attack them not just in Mexico But in the 42 countries that heliscule cartel is currently residing in The Trump administration is going to take them on just like you did the caliphate and we're going to destroy him So this is going to be a worse yeah, bro. I mean why why why is it that how is one American life worth Even risking over this like why are we not drone striking these people? Why do we not have a patchy's flying back and forth up the down the fucking border just taking care of business I mean dude it didn't want to take long for they figure out that they they're not gonna fuck with it what does anymore So what you know Let's do it. Let's do it. Yeah, let's do it And then so far the final numbers you know we talked about this You know like you know the not moving quick enough. It's not enough numbers. It's daily rate As of a full seven-day reporting The total number right now of illegals that have been deported is 7300 Yeah, I did the math on that and it was uh It would still take 35 years to get rid of what's come across. Yeah, so they went from 70 years on the first couple days to Almost half that yeah, so I am Imagine that's gonna accelerate. Let's don't keep moving. Yeah. It's gonna keep moving now And again, this is very very very clear because they're targeting the worst of the worst first Right, that's why these people who were saying shit like Like dude, I saw somebody post on the internet. They came into my classroom and took three people out or you know None of my farm people showed up to work or you know, they went to this they're not doing that no They're going down the list of known Criminal criminals and violent offenders and terrorists and drug lords and singling them out and getting them out of here They haven't moved on to that yet, but it just shows you how many people are willing to lie to stand on what they believe More high ground is and dude more high ground doesn't count if you're a fucking liar right right I mean, it's like Gavin Newsome in this shit, right? Like did you see the thing how Trump sent the military in to turn on the fucking water? Okay, well, why would he have to do that If Gavin Newsome and the the people that the people of California elected to serve their best interests Why is someone else having to send someone in to turn on the water that According to all those other people doesn't even exist right? We have people in this country that are willing to Endanger and harm their own citizens the people who voted for them in order to get some sort of initiative or more high ground or money In their pocket, okay, and It's wrong those people those people should be in jail. Yeah, like I know that I keep saying that But there's just I would rather have those people in jail than the dude who sold a couple pounds of fucking weed You know, I'm saying like Fuck out of here. Yeah, I mean dude it makes no sense man I'm in again to be clear every single 7300 people that have been deported they were facing charges or they were convicted already in the United States Of robbery rape assault domestic violence junk driving reckless driving killing people That's who they're getting out personally. I don't give a fuck if you're here illegally I don't care if you're a criminal or not the fact that you're here illegally makes you a criminal right okay? I personally don't give a shit But what I will tell you is the amount of you mother fuckers out there that are lying about this like because you don't know It's actually happening people are exposing themselves to how big of bullshit as they are I saw people in our own fucking town Post on Facebook about how ice came into their classroom. I did not come into your mother fucking classroom You're a liar and if they did it's because you're that fucking school higher than fucking rapist Yeah, you know fan But it's funny you say that the amount of people lying we got both politicians and again these virtue signaling bleeding hearts You're whatever we want to call them. They're fucking lying. Let's go to Chicago real quick I don't know if you've seen this. This is the mayor of Chicago Brandon Johnson in a brand new statement Um, let's see what he had to say Listen to the mayor of Chicago talk about the raise that is supposed to be coming to his city and Breaking it down and playing terms that this is all about white supremacy. Listen And is that when 30,000 Ukrainians saw asylum here in the city of Chicago Nobody said a mumbling word But all of a sudden indigenous people who are trying to get to a land that was robbed from them through colonization They want me as a black man to be mad at me What what I don't understand we say yeah You say you know because they took 30,000 Ukrainians. That's white supremacy and that you know We didn't do anything about them. No, we don't know. We like get their asses out too Anybody who's here illegally should be here should go it doesn't matter what fuck color skin on and by the way The fuck are you talking about stole the land from whoever? Okay, I get real tired of this fucking saying stole the land Okay, every motherfucking country that exists in the world was conquered by other people It's called conquering. It's not called stealing right okay. This is going into this moral shit. All right. I don't feel guilty that Somebody conquered the country and created an awesome place pretty bad ass. Yeah, it's awesome dude Like this this is the history go through fucking the 12,000 years of human history that's documented And you will see that every mother fucking land and the history of earth has been conquered many times by many different groups of people And the group of people that currently reside will probably be conquered at some point too And if you want to know the truth the reason that we're getting these fuckers out of here is so it doesn't happen here Right That's real shit. So like let's be real. It's the lose man. Not only that like okay The these people are not indigenous to fucking America right the fuck you don't even know what the fuck you're saying It's stupid shit. Let's bring it local. We got a Missouri guy here. This is a tiktok guy Let's check this shit out So they're doing this trend where they're trying to like you know talk about something completely irrelevant while Subliminally, you know talking about you know their true purpose right so check this out I just haven't had the chance yet to come on here and just really think tiktok for everything that they've done You know bringing this app back and the fact that there's just been absolutely no changes that we can notice and no additional censorship It's just Honestly so helpful I just really think that we need to all reach out and make sure that tiktok understands how grateful we are for You know this platform that we've created here and what it looks like today because we're so So lucky to be here and still be sharing our videos with no changes Is that a felony should be no I think it's a felony to disrupt a federal operation. It's doctrine. Yeah I think people like this belong bro the whole theme of this is fucking jail. Yeah straight to jail Tell him Tell him where they going Stettergel that's right that's fucking right Bro it's crazy man jail straight to jail jet bro.

Yeah It's gross dude I've started to think a lot more people are pedophiles than what we think Here's the thing like if this does not prove to you I mean if you needed some evidence or you needed some extra convincing on why it was not a good idea To allow biological males to compete against biological females What do you mean bro if you need any more evidence hold on but like what Why would this ever be a discussion like why would this ever in the history of earth be a discussion Every fucking scientific study that's ever been done in the history of mankind has shown that men are physically superior to women in general Okay, they're stronger they're faster. All right. They're bigger. Mm-hmm muscle density at one point in time It's not even people don't even believe this. They're just cowers. Mm-hmm no one ever fucking believe this No one ever out there ever believed that men should be in with women sports every single mother fucker knows that They shouldn't be and every single person out there knows that men are superior physically to women Everybody knows it But because people are cowards and they were shamed and they've been have their moral high ground Quote unquote leveraged against them. Oh, you're a bad person if you don't think that Steve should be say to you Now we have this and nobody nobody Nobody disagrees that It's like it's just obvious. It's a fucking obvious thing dude like we all know it We all know it and everybody knows it and the people that support it know it too Which makes them bad people? Terrible people. Yeah, where's your fucking athlete in my opinion? Yeah, I agree Cheering this fucking dude on that's about to lap these girls with some fucked up shoes. Yeah, that does not prove That there's something Majorly wrong with this that not only not only with that person with the people that support it That's what I'm saying like you want to take with the bad people are the bad people are the people that pretend that men and women Should be on the same athletic field and let women get fucking destroyed by men Those are the bad people how about the bad people who allow someone who is a terrible male athlete join female sports and Dominate and ruin all of these girls their entire life work their entire dreams everything they work for for their whole lives And you root for that you're a piece of shit.

Yep. Like bro. This is like disgusting Medical experimentation that's made it's it's it's return Because the powers, you know, the globalists that's who the globalists are These people want to create an identity crisis where people don't know what the truth is and when they don't know What's up and down left right man? They don't know. They're just a man and a woman How can they have any pride themselves or national pride in their culture? They can't which allows them to be cultivated into a global system, you know, and The truth of the matter is is these globalists aren't as smart as they fucking think they are because if they were smart They wouldn't have fucking flooded all these countries with all these migrants to try to fuck everybody's culture And they wouldn't have pushed this shit and they should have just stood up there and been real and said hey We need a one-world government because of this and this and this everybody should join and the conversation would be much more palatable for everybody You know without all this crazy shit that they did to destroy culture and society like it's not diversity Whether or not creating diversity right now if you go to fucking Ireland and you go to France and you go to fucking You know Germany, it's all the same Okay, diversity is you go to Ireland you're with the Irish people you go to you go to France with French people You go to America you're with Americans you go to fucking see that's diversity right you can have diversity within a globalist system If you allowed people to maintain their culture, but these motherfuckers think they fucking know everything and to be honest They wanted to create two races in the world at one of theirs and and one of everybody else and It's a very sinister much more sinister plan than people realize yeah Yeah, guys jumping on this conversation.
