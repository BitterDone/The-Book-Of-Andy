What is up guys it's Andy for selling and seeing us to show for the real estate about the lives, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome. Another fucking reality guys today. Andy, and DJ, cruise the motherfucking internet. That's what we're going to do. This is CTI. That's what cruise the internet stands for. Wait, I said that backwards. This is CTI. It stands for cruise the internet. All right, I had to get it right. What we do on today's show is we put up relevant topics to what's going on in the world. We talk about them. We speculate on what's true, what's not true. Then we talk about how we the people can be the solution to what's going on in the world. Other times you tune in, we have shows within the show. We're going to have Q and A.F. That's a personal development based show that usually comes out on Monday. We start the week off Monday with some good information about how to win, not just what the problems are, right? That's kind of the gist of the show by the way. If you don't understand what the show is about, we talk about what's going on in the world and then we also talk about the tactics that we use to actually win and solve these problems in the world. We get a little peanut butter and jelly action going on here. By the way, I'm going to beat you in peanut butter and jelly contest. Just so you know, prepare to lose. All right. All right. I know you've been at home practicing. No, I remember. I do actually. I haven't, I've not been practicing. But you better practice. But so that's one of the things, man. Like, you know, I mean, you're that good. It's not even. See, that's how you lose. Not called practice. That's how you fucking lose right there. So if you listen to Monday's shows, you'll figure out that an attitude like DJ is displaying right here is exactly how you lose. And why we have different attitudes. Okay. So we have Q and A F. That's where you could submit questions and we bring you to answers. Now, you could submit your questions one of a few different ways. First way is, yeah, guys, even all those questions in to ask Andy at Andy for seller.com. The second way is if you go on YouTube, we've had a podcast for almost a decade now. We just started on YouTube in 2023. So if you go on YouTube and you check out the shows that drop on Monday and you go in the comments section and ask a question in there, we'll answer some from there as well. Other times we have real talk, real talk is just five to 20 minutes of me giving you some real talk that I think needs to be heard. Then we have full length, full length is pretty much what you see on most other podcasts where interesting gas comes in and sits down. We have a conversation and then we have 75 hard versus not 75 hard versus is where someone who has completed the 75 hard program comes in and shares their experience about how their life was before, how their life is now and how much difference they have created in their own life by taking charge of what's going on. If you don't know what 75 hard is, it is the boot camp to the Live Hard program. The Live Hard program is a 365 day mental conditioning program. It is the biggest, most popular, most effective mental conditioning program that's ever been created. And guess what? It's free. So if you're interested in that 75 hard and live hard program, you can go to episode 208. This is a program that will help you take your life from this place of frustration and hopelessness and lack of control and put you in a place of power so that you understand a lot about how to cultivate that within yourself. So if you ever heard of it, you might not be on the internet because it's been everywhere. But if you're interested in getting a shit together, go get it. It's free episode 208 on the audio feed only. Like I mentioned, we weren't on YouTube until this year. So go back and listen to it from there. So we have this thing called the fee, the fee when I say pay the fee, that means share of the show. Different than other podcasts, I am an entrepreneur. I am very successful entrepreneur. I've been very fortunate to be surrounded by extremely talented people who work very hard and we've built some incredible things. And over the last 25 years, I've had the fortunate, good fortune, massive fortune of being able to fund this show on my own without ads, which gives me the freedom to say whatever the fuck I want. So I don't do ads. I don't let people pay me, even though I could make an extra eight figures. Sometimes I feel stupid for not taking it. But I don't want to answer to anybody. I think a big problem that we have in the world today is that everybody's fucking owned by everybody. And we do get shadow band, we do get traffic throttle. If you want to see an example of that, go back and look at Saturday's show. We happen to talk about what meta was doing that Google refuses to do and they went ahead and just turn our traffic off. So if you want an example of that, go on YouTube and look at Saturday's show. But I don't answer to anybody. And you're always going to get the truth here. And I ask very simply in exchange that you do a couple things. Please share the show. If we bring value to you, if it brings truth, perspective, if it makes you think a little different, if you learn some valuable skills, which you're definitely going to learn on the Monday episodes. We spread the message. The show doesn't get out there as much as it could because of the things that we talk about. So we rely on you guys, our soldiers out there to spread this message. And also think about supporting my companies. That's something that a lot of you guys look over. We don't run ads. I don't do anything. But when you need some good things, figure out what company is I own. I own a whole bunch of them and support those companies. That's always appreciated. So don't be a hoe. Show the show. All right. Yeah. So what's up, man? Oh, man, you know, there's a lot coming off of a good weekend. A lot happened, man. It's been hard for me to stay on top of everything that's going on because there's just so much. It does feel like things are accelerating. It's going so fast. And it does feel like that because I feel like a lot of people who have kind of been sleeping the last few years thinking that this was just normal ebbs and flows of political cycle are starting to realize that it is not normal ebbs and flows of political cycles. So it's doing it from a fire hose. Yeah, sure is. Even for us, like I, like dude, when you really think about that, it's interesting to think about what you just said. I think about that all the time because like dude, you and I, we spend a lot of time. The team here spends a lot of time working through these topics, digging into them. And when you think of like the average person out there, the average listener, right? Like all of you guys listening, these people have kids, they have jobs, they have careers, you know, the economy's not in a favorable place right now. Everybody stressed the fuck out. Like how could you really know what was going like they've made it so it's almost impossible for the average person to really understand what's going on. But that's okay because that's why we do what we do. Yeah, you know, but it is great point, man. Because even for these just like the CTI outlines guys, this is a five hour outline. Yeah, production time. Yeah. I'm saying just to get to the recording, man, because like you're having to go through and like do one thing I'm seeing now that like you know, versus three years ago, when it wasn't this revolving cycle of fucking, you know, propagandas that like, I mean, what I see now is like I'll pull up a headline. I get started on these around like nine, nine, 30 and you get those morning influx by noon. It's changed. It's completely different. It never happened. Yeah. That's why old man, once you throw in there, the misinformation, exactly. You know, like it's, by the way, a lot of people say we put out misinformation, but the kind of misinformation we put out is like we don't miss information. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's right. That's right. You like that. Don't teach you that. Yeah. No, that's me. That was all me, baby. That's right. That was fucking. That's how we don't miss information. I like that. It's a truth, bro. I like that. Listen, you can go back and and fucking audit it. This one thing I will say is I don't think like it's very stressful to come on here and talk about this stuff. Like you guys got to understand like this isn't any fun for us. Like I would, I would much rather talk about and I'm going to start talking about again, personal development and how to win entrepreneurship. You know, those of you who are fans of the MSCO project, we have a big announcement about that coming really, really soon. But I'm excited to start talking about that because I feel like when I talk about the personal development, the how to win, I feel like, you know, it feels good. It feels like I'm pouring into people. I'm teaching them what I know and what I've learned through the process. But this stuff, this is not fun to talk about. Like it's draining and, you know, I think it's necessary. But when we really like break it out and break it down, I mean, it's a fucking lot. You know, absolutely, man. Well, yeah, well, we don't miss information. I like that, man. That's fucking, I don't know why. That's just so catchy. Is it not true? No, it's fucking true. Bro, go back and audit the shit. I mean, we've, I was getting right, this is my point. I got a sidetracked because I was thinking about other stuff. People don't realize like I actually operate companies too. You know, besides just, I'm not just a podcast or, right, in a YouTuber, right, the sublet seller. This is just in your house living room. Yeah, right. Yeah. It makes me proud that all of what we've said is like on record. You know what I mean? It's there. Yeah. You'll see. I mean, we're only been on YouTube for a year, but bro, we got four years of fucking audio. And that's there. If people, like, I don't think, I really, I really think this. I'm not saying this to be fucking, to be cocky or be a dick. But I really think that you and I have bent culture in a real way. Yeah. Like, I don't think, I don't think we would be where we are in culture where things are starting to turn the corner the way that we need them to. If you and I hadn't had done what we've done because of the real, the real shit is most of these other podcasters, these people who are mainstream level people, we have been saying what they're saying in the mainstream years or months before they set it. You know what I mean? Oh, so like, when I see these people who are big names, getting all the, this big recognition for the shit that they said nearly every time. And I know you feel the same way. I look at them. I'm like, we fucking said that. Yeah. Like, so it's frustrating because we don't get any credit. But the real thing is is like, we don't do it for the credit. No, the culture is about the culture. That's right. 100%. I mean, I want one little tip of tip you could try. You know, like, you know, we had a little tip of tip. To tip. Yeah. I had a bite of my mom. Yeah. You sure did. No, but like one thing that I saw, it was really, really funny guys. Like you guys could see this, you know, you know, but we had a couple of days there where we did, you know, we couldn't get a show out, whatever, you know, we have traveled yet, events and stuff going on. And you know, it's funny because the days we don't put nothing out is also the same days that all the motherfucking other influencers don't put nothing out. Yeah. I'm like, okay. I see it. It's also interesting. Like dude, it's just funny. Hard to mean wants to go on the internet and be like, you guys all fucking hear what we say and you just parrot it and like talk shit, but that's the point. No, that's why we do it. That's exactly what you know, like I don't do it so that other people won't use the information. It's the fact that we got to get people to see it. You know what I mean? And I don't know. I think that's a testament to all of our listeners too. I think all of our listeners, you guys listening, you know, I know there's people that don't share it and there's people who just consume. And that's okay. But I think there's enough of you that give a fuck that have started to speak up and started to share the show because when we first started, nobody would share the show because it was too controversial, right? And now I think people have gotten to a point where they understand that they have to and they have enough to where like we see it. Like we see, we see Elon Musk saying shit that we said fucking months ago. We see, you know, these other big names who are on TV saying the shit that we've said months ago. And that makes me feel like we're doing something that matters. You know what I mean? Like it's frustrating as it is. I'm very proud of that. Yeah. You know, 100% bro. 100% man. Well, guys, let's get into this. Let's get into it. Yeah. We got some stuff, uh, interesting stuff coming up. The first thing I really before before I say it though, like that's a testament to you guys. You like, yeah, like real talk, like I really fucking appreciate those of you that do share and do stand behind us. We're going to have some cool stuff coming up in 24, you know, DJ and I are going to be doing some live events. There's some cool things that we're going to roll out. And, um, just to know that you guys are out there and just to know that you guys are sharing the show and I know I get pissed off a lot. But I don't say thank you very much because there's so much work to do. But the truth is I'm very proud of the following that we have and the people who follow us and the people who are brave enough to stand behind the message that we put out. It makes me feel like, like gives me hope. You know what I mean? Like, like not everybody's just a fucking mindless plebe out here caring about themselves. There's a lot of people here that do fucking care. It makes me, it makes me feel like there's a lot of hope for the future. Yeah. And as much bullshit is going on, there's also people that have taken the information and going out there and actually, like that's the biggest plus the big. You got to live it. It's fucking awesome. You got to live it, dude. It's awesome, man. So, uh, but yeah, so let's get into this, man. I wanted to bring something up first. This is making some, uh, some waves around, uh, you know, the internet, the mainstream media. Um, let's get into it. Uh, photos. Don't tread on me. Argentina nation celebrates Javier Miele. Uh, it's first libertarian president. That's a, that's a play on that Madonna song. Don't tread on me. Don't tread on me, Argentina. No, they're, they're, they're, no, no, bro. There's a Madonna song about Argentina, bro. Oh, isn't. Yeah. Google it. Oh, yeah. I thought they were just doing the gatson flag stuff. No, no, no. That headline there is a play on the song. Uh, most people probably don't, it's don't cry for me, Argentinians. Don't tell me Argentine. What is it? That name for a song. The lyric is like, don't cry for me or some shit like that. I don't know. Yeah. Anyway, you never heard it? No. That's things like something you'd be into. Well, it's interesting because you're the one that knows about it. That I think I'm fucking old, bro. Yeah, I don't know that song anyway. Yeah. Well, yeah. So, so, so they got a new president in, um, fucker. It says quote, without a doubt, we are partying tonight. The president elect of Argentine or Javier Miele promised his supporters after winning the nation's presidency on Sunday nights, sending thousands to flood the streets of Buenos Aires, chanting freedom and waving gatson flags. Miele, who for most of his career has been an economic analyst and television commentator, ran his campaign for the presidency as an anarcho capitalists and self-proclaimed libertarian railing against triple digit inflation and decades of socialist rule in his country, his political party, liberty advances first appeared on election ballots in 2021 and triggered the first loss of control of Congress for the peronist socialist since 1983 Miele, a lawmaker following the 2021 election shocked political observers by topping the August 2023 open primary in Argentina. All prospective presidential candidates must obtain at least 1.5% support in a single primary election. So he won this in the in the landslide, right? And of course, you know, he's being called crazy and, you know, all of this stuff's going on. The Guardian tries to do this. I whom right, right? Um, it is don't cry from the Argentina. There you go. No, we found it. Yeah. Yeah. Is it a good song? I mean, it's, it's pretty famous. It's all right. No, we find out. It's all right. It's your style, bro. It's like, yeah, bro, it's, listen, motherfucker, we all see you sneak into the bar and play the piano. It's saying, hold on. Hey, did you want the fucker see him play the piano at the fucking art? I mean, that's his game. He's classic. He sneaks in. He sits down at the piano. He starts playing. He starts in there before, like, hold on. He starts singing some shit that sounds like you're about to cry. I think they were whole fucking game. A simple man. Yeah. It's a great song. First of all, there was four. You do simple man. Pretty good. Yeah, it was a good song. Yeah, it's good. There was only four people in there. Yeah, but then how many can and then I fucking looked up and this fucking 50 people there. I was not expecting that. Yeah, I thought everybody else. My fuckers passed out flyers. 40 seconds. I was, I can't believe you guys are here. Guys, I'm going to cover Madonna tonight. But yeah, so, so I thought this was interesting. I thought I got some, some videos apparently. Here's a crazy thing. So the stock market, you know, it's Monday right now when we're recording this. It opened up. The stock, Argentina stock markets are booming because of this guy's in. I'm here. Here's a video of him at the celebration. Dude, this is great. Yeah, it seems all. This clip is great. Yeah. His little dance. Yeah. It worked up. Who could you see doing that? They won. Fucking that. That doesn't mean me. That's you. It'd be worse though. This is also you. Fucking chase. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Wow. I was starting to change side of where I go. I was starting to turn the woodshipper behind my truck everywhere I go, bro. We're going to paint red, white and blue. Listen, he's wild. I love his energy. Dude, people are tired of the shit. Yeah. They're tired. This is what I'm talking. Is there more? This last look clip I want to show to you. This is this is him calling out the leftist. And I call some left-tards. I love this guy. Bro, he's got some energy. I don't know shit about him. So like he might be fucking, I don't know. That's all the world economic form thing. But like, listen, at this point so much shit has come out that like those little like, you know, our young leaders like a lot of that's bullshit. Dude, they just, no, no, no, no. We're doing that. I know because they did this to Eric. That's what I'm saying. Okay. So what they, what the world economic form does is, you know, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to be trying to, you know, make this so you can make this as a幕over. Really clean your wok and then you don't have to surveillance to try to meet this or this or this or this or this or this or this or this or this or this or that. You know, Leftist son of a bitch is broke. He was calling him he was calling him left tards Like in public like in a fucking speech. I love it bro. This dude This is what so so All right So as much as I love this there's there's something of note here, okay? First of all if this guy can do it we can do it all right. I see us Didn't he win like 95 yeah bro to five listen this is what happens when people get fucking tired of shit Yeah, and this is also why like Like these people they try to make Donald Trump seem like he's so extreme right all right This is what you're gonna get soon And it's gonna be me Because I'm telling you it's I'm going to do it bro. We wrap the 450 Yeah, told the fucking wood jibber. Yeah, and I ride it back with a chainsaw bro And also like a flame for a good measure. We got a flame Thor. Yeah, no like a real one though We got you weren't I mean like the kind with the backpack that shoots out like a hundred yards. Oh, yeah That way if any antifa people come We got stuff to eat. Yeah, you make a little antifa course, yeah, whatever man So like but dude, this is what you're when I tell you guys That when the pennell we have to be really smart Because that pennellum will not stop with Trump. Yeah, okay? So like when these people falsely label Trump I believe falsely label Trump as an extremist You have to understand there's people out there that think far more extreme. Yeah, that when you start crying about the Extreme net people aren't gonna listen, you know what I mean? And that's the danger of this like the what the left communist have done is They push the pennellum so far to the left that the only way it can go It can go more to the left but that ends up with a genocide right or it gets swing back to the right and it can it's gonna bro These people these these blue hair You know typical and I realize there's people blue hair that aren't that but you know what I'm saying the typical like lazy not in shape Complainer like Hop-hop agrees bro. Just you know what they're all they're they're overreactors right like Remember that girl I used to post of my story Whenever the BLM shit was going on and she was a white and she like She was big and fat and like disgusting and she was talking about how She doesn't want to settle with people like us and like people like us don't belong in society We all remember that like we remember that and so when that pennellum swings back We and I've said this a hundred times These people are the weakest people in society and they have refused to compromise With everybody else who just wanted to be left alone and now the pennellum swinging back to the people that wanted to be left The loans way and they're gonna remember what those people did like bro the amount of abuse that you and I have personally take I will never forget it like you can't forget things like that So like when we take the megaphone and start saying the same shit. It's not it's we don't say the same shit We just do shit and like dude you want to talk about extremist shit I don't believe that extremist shit at this point in the time even exists on either side. I think it's a fucking straight out war They'll note if those people continue to get their way they will kill people like us No, absolutely, you know, they've already tried they tried to do that. Yeah, you just didn't get them fucking majority of the public behind it You know one thing I think on this too, man, because I was also seeing some stuff like like I like to listen the people on the right You guys got to calm the fuck down sometimes you You know, I'm sick because I but they get started going crazy on this and I'll just say this I don't know this guy very well. I don't But what I will say is when you can get tens of thousands of people out in the fucking streets to support you when you can get a 95 to five Landslide victory The people want him the people chose him it's like that's not you like that that is so far from being fudged or any type of funding games going on The people support people of Argentina want this man for whatever reasons. Yeah, they want them. They want them Yeah, and dude, I don't know everything about him. I know I know people think Trump's an extremist, but my hope for the situation in this country is that He stops the extreme shit from happening. Yeah, while making and correcting the processes Make it correct. What's going on? Yeah, but stops Because like dude, what'll happen is we'll get to a point where Because I joke about it and shit, but we'll get to a point where legitimately Those people on the communist side will have to be eliminated because they won't fucking stop You know what I'm saying? Yeah, like they don't want to stop. They don't want to they don't want to compromise They're and like dude That's how what this I see it differently than everybody else. I think every I think a lot of people see Trump as the extremist and I see him as actually the reasonable solution To bring us back to something that represents America the way that we've all traditionally believed America to be And the media and the news and these far left people Accusing him of being Hitler and all these things over and over again Is going to create the second coming of a Hitler You know what I'm saying and they're going to be him and it's not him right and that's a big problem that crying wolf and These accusations from the media are going to end up creating and I'm not for that either. I'm a good person like I don't think that people should just indiscriminately be killed like Like what we see going on in other parts of the world where people innocent civilians just being killed because Of whatever the government thinks like I don't believe in that. That's not something I believe um And I think if we just re and I think if we came in To America and just addressed it and and just enforce the laws that were there ran the country the way it's supposed to be run Had an unbiased justice system and moved corrected some of these problems I think we'd have an amazing country pretty fast again But I think if like what I'm nervous of is like these people steal another election Okay Which by the way Do you have that topic in this at all about the tapes that came out and shit I don't even know if we're allowed to talk about it because like they are the letter after a K or whatever Yeah, number five. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well These Did you see what they did you guys to see what they did to our show on Saturday? Like that's insane for even talking about it anyway my My fear is is that we're in a situation where That those accused it. I don't know man. I just I just fucking really think we're in a dangerous situation because of The intolerance of a very small percentage of society You know what I mean? I It's mob rule by minority and that's a dangerous further minority You know the four or five percent of those people Absolutely see what happens. Yeah, we'll see ma'am Guys, let's get into the rest of our headlines remember if you want to see any of these articles pictures links videos Go to Andy Fisola.com you can find them link there Well, if you're watching over on the tube Check down in the description below you can find them there as well Seeing that dude win gives me like hope that maybe we could win dude. He was happy No, you know what I'm saying like I think people want a regular person. There is not bought and paid for yeah That's why I don't do ads on the show Dude, I think we need a president in this country that runs strictly without anybody else's money But like that would take a real movement of the people as a grassroots you know what I mean like sure The people would have to understand we're not spending a billion dollars on TV ads right I think if people would understand that We could maybe get someone into office that was for the first time and for the first time in fucking 200 years Yeah, you know what I mean dude it could be some powerful ship. Yeah, it'd be powerful ship man But let's get into it man. It's let's get headline one Headline number one reads we got to sing happy birthday For good old Joe. It's his birthday man He's 81 but he jokes study 60. I think he still thinks he's 60 I don't think he knows he's 81 How many times did you shit his pants on his birthday? Is it over or under two? Over two over absolutely over Pro I feel so bad for his like seeker service details little fucking like think about think about the 22 year old kid that you know People who understand you have a people don't understand that like they don't understand what goes into executive protection Oh, yeah, like those dudes who were right.

Yes or no right now. Yes. Pull it Okay, and he says that you know, it's all because of the inflation reduction act Even though inflation was going okay um But yeah, and he has this really nice little you know graphic that he puts out You know saying that you know everything's fine everything's good Um, he talks about how the price of gas are down You know but From win Prices of gas are down from win from Because they're still almost two dollars higher than when Trump was in office well, I mean, let's just look at when the bullshit started How about this April 2020 Gas looks to be about a dollar seventy five Okay, then it goes to a peak immediately after Uh What is that November or I'm sorry, maybe November 2020 February 2021 it starts to curve up real gradual Then it gets to a point where we're in August of 22. It looks like At an all-time peak just under five dollars now just under five dollars on a national average means that people out in the west and the east For paying eight nine dollars exactly all right, so that's like to be ten So now You know, we've got it back down to a national average of 60 is what it looks like in October of 2023 however 360 is still more than double what it was in April 2020 when the covid shit started exactly right exactly and then also it's It's actually Is about 60 percent 70 percent higher than when Biden took office Okay, so this is how they manipulate the data right well it's down from its peak right This is what they're doing with inflation. This is the same thing they're doing with dude. They're counting job creation off of okay You got that I brought that up because that's another one of his accomplishments More people are working than at any point in American history that is a that that hold on Also, there's a there's a okay keep going but I got a good point on this what the fuck are you talking about bro? Like okay? Well, let's look at it Let's look at it you mean okay, so you're basing this off of it really should say people are working more right Than at any point in American history and why are they working more because they fucking have to to survive because they can't fucking afford anything Yes Like these dude these people are the amounts bro It's disgusting what they've done to the middle Bro, it's the gass lighting on American people like dude all these people out here are talking about I mean, that's all they're talking about how how expensive it is to live and they're they're misrep it's funny because the people at center right They know what it is they say it's inflation and fucking bad government and the people who voted for Biden What they say companies are screwing everybody like Bro, how do you not understand that this is trickle down shit like fuel costs costs of goods raw goods Like these are things that affect the price of your product you cannot lower the price of a product where its costs have gone up Otherwise you put the company out of business and jobs are lost like Which is what they want it that is what they want right there. They would be okay if that happened That is what they want that's why they closed all the businesses during COVID and you can clearly See that yeah, you can clearly see that on their graph you can clearly see it Fuck these people, but here's what I wanted to point out man, so I came up on this video Um that I saw circulating around That I thought was interesting. I thought we shared here take it take take a take a little bit um You know Cuz I mean there's a lot to be said about this video. So let's play a here for a second I don't know I'm making this video. Who is this? I don't know any oh, there's just like a random video. Mm-hmm. Okay. I feel like My husband and I are doing everything right We both have good jobs. I'm a nurse. I'm a registered nurse For work full-time he works full-time We just got paid this past Friday, right? We've paid the mortgage Bought some groceries Put some gas in the car And guys it is Tuesday We have like two or three hundred dollars So last doesn't till next Friday like We don't live in a big house. We live in little Little ranch to 1100 square feet three bedrooms one bath us in our two kids And like I don't I don't know what to do I'm in school full-time I work full-time He works more than full-time he works overtime every week I don't know what to do I'm so stressed out This isn't how it's supposed to be No growing up we were told You know go to college get a degree Work to support your family Here we are did that now what? Now what I'm not in the politics I I don't follow it frankly that stresses me out too And but like Well, there you go. I don't know somebody Somebody has to do something to change this because I make good money politics that somebody is you We don't live above our means Go keep going I want to watch this We're I don't know what less than paycheck to paycheck is what what is that poverty Lessons here This is what the fuck you've been talking about fucking years Here's as much as I do but Bro, he still works. He's not I get the gist that's super fucking hard to watch him for and frustrating to watch You know what I'm saying like how can you not watch that and have real empathy for her situation like all This is why I tell you guys This is why I tell you to When you listen to the Monday shows where we talk about how to get better how to win This is why I fucking tell you do not listen to these people who are saying oh, I'm just vibing out or I'm gonna go to the You know Touch the grass and I'm gonna go live my spiritual journey uh Having a successful comfortable life is hard and your 20s are not meant to be Quote unquote lived that's the time when you're supposed to build And yeah, they do tell you go to go to school and they do tell you to get a job and and they tell you to do all these things And then why why do they tell you those things who Who Wins when you go to school and get up to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars with the student loans for a decent degree who wins Their debt Our debt is their asset. That's how they win and that's how they trap you into doing this like these people here They have no options now that the reason she's upset is because she cannot make it work on the path that they told her That she was supposed to follow and imagine following the path just as you're told Go to school do good in school go to college do good in college get a regular job do what everybody else does right And then you end up in a situation like this our system Is not about Creating prosperity. It's about creating worker bees to show up and work and never have and this is why it's important for you To Start to think about developing your skill set and start to think about getting with a company that maybe doesn't require a degree But is on the path of upward mobility where you have a chance of really making some real money You know the money that they tell these people is a lot of money like they tell people a hundred thousand dollars a year is a lot of money Bro fucking fucking ask any single person in the whole world that makes a hundred grand a year if they feel wealthy or rich or even secure It's not enough money the amount of money they tell you That you're supposed to earn is is told to you that way so that that's all you ever aspire to and that's all you ever try to do Because they know that that amount of money and that amount of success will enslave you for your entire life Like you have to get yourself in the right position meaning with the right skills in the right path with the right company and the right people To literally go build something that is not a true this woman is a nurse Nurses are typically considered to be a well-paying job, right? They're not living but they're they're definitely not living above their means I mean she's living in a decent house. I mean two houses ago. I was living in a house like that You know what I mean? Yeah, and it wasn't that bad. It wasn't like it was Like how she's making it but I understand the frustration. You know what I'm saying? It's just It's frustrating dude because y'all don't listen man. I got more to say about that than this But y'all don't listen to me. You know, I tell you guys like you have to fucking do it And you have to do it you have to utilize your time Everybody gets the same amount of time Okay, and if you only use a quarter of your time and everybody else is using half or three quarters And then who do you think's gonna win the guy that spends the quarter of his time meaning from 20 to 40 That guy's gonna lose the people who spend half the time they start when they're 30 They're gonna be okay, but they're never gonna be truly successful probably unless they really get into something that Maybe they get a little fortunate to get into and then the people who put in the full 20 years Those are people are gonna be like yeah, I work my ass off my 20s But you know what I'm glad I did because my shit is nice now and now I'm not struggling like these This is the reality There is a time part of the equation because it takes time to develop the skills Skills are required to produce the result So if you don't invest the time because you believe all these spiritual guides on the internet and travel around the world and fuck your life away Don't expect to like be living in a nice house and comfortable. That's that's not realistic Unreal Correct. It's unrealistic. It's unrealistic. It's not a real thing And there's so much bullshit on the internet because there's all these people trying to sell people shit Like look at the amount of fake entrepreneurs on the fucking internet. It's like it's it's a fucking disease Yeah, that's a whole episode. Yeah Yeah, anyway, I'm getting off track, but the point is Is that y'all got to use your time wisely and I feel bad because this woman did you know right? She went to school She's still in school and by the way, she's right to still be in school because to progress in her path That's going to require more schooling But the reality is is most of college is worthless Uh, you're much better off spending the time actually building real skills and getting some experience and great companies that are young and going to replace these big dinosaur companies They don't give a fuck about your degree. That's the truth. No um But You know to address what she said Uh, you know, this is my frustration with people. Okay, we do this show like we tell you guys you have to understand the political environment And you have to understand the skill set and a lot of people want to like I give a lot We have a lot of listeners that only listen to monday show right they don't listen to fucking cti Because they don't agree with the politics You don't have to agree because it's not really political It's about the the actual reality of our situation And if we don't understand reality of the situation we can't operate no matter what skills we have And so this woman's on on this on the screen saying I'm not political don't tell me about politics I'm not trying to hear that part. I'm not trying to hear yeah listen bro Like that's why you are where you are like I promise you if you and I could be wrong But I'm probably not like most of the time I bet if you go look at who they voted for I bet you I bet you they voted for fucking Biden And I bet you they stand by his policies and I bet they say it's not that bad And I bet they say things like you know when they talk about politics the things they talk about are mindless social issues Okay, they are below the line issues I bet for her and her friend group and I'm making assumptions could be totally wrong But I bet That abortions at the top of that list of discussion right because they like to throw these social issues in here to get people Emotionally riled up they throw identity politics in here if you vote Republican you're racist Well, the fuck she doesn't want to be a racist not a racist right so they vote And they don't really look at the issues. They don't look at the economic plans And they don't look at the foreign policy They don't look at the things that are actually going to affect their lives on their front porch And then they say when things are fucked up somebody has to do something Well, yeah motherfucker that somebody is you We cannot build a great country with people that are not great Okay, if you build a building out of crumbling bricks and Rotted materials. What are you going to have if you're going to have a rotten building that's crumbling and falling apart Well, if you try to build a country off of less than ideal individuals Less than ideal Uh quality people people without skills people without moral standard what you end up with is a country that crumbles the same way And that's what we're dealing with we have a giant Part of the population that believes that just because they live in America and are quote unquote free That they have zero obligation to contribute in any way possible They don't see their lives as something of service They see their lives as something that they get to live and it doesn't matter how they live Don't bother me. I can do what I want. I can be fat. I can be broke. I can be a morally corrupt human being I can hurt people and it doesn't matter because I'm free But in the way America is supposed to be is that we are citizens of the country and we should all feel obligated to invest In the country for the people coming after and what's really ironic about this whole thing that I'm talking about here Is that leftists like to think of themselves as higher moral standard people And they are very selfish in the way that they live Okay, they have the attitude of what I sort of just described. I'm here for pleasure I'm here for what I enjoy it doesn't matter what I do But if you really wanted to be of higher moral standard wouldn't you really care a lot about What you're leaving behind for people? Wouldn't you care a lot about the economic environment in terms of what prosperity was even possible in this country when this whole entire country Is based upon the pursuit of happiness and opportunity and good fortune like if that's what you believed and you truly thought that was the way it should be for people And those people should have the chances that you had even if you didn't take advantage of those chances Then we would all be investing in the country We would all be living our lives at a high standard And this is why when I say personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion is because I understand very clearly that if we want a great country We got to have great people and people seem to forget this right build us down bro. We have an obligation There was a time 30-50 years ago where these men men my dad's age who are you know close to 80 years old these people believed that they had a obligation To live At least a decent life to be good to people to invest into the community to like do the right thing To set a good example They didn't have to be rich they didn't have to be You know, but they had to take care of their own stuff. They had to you know reinvest where they could they had to they had there was a certain level of Understood obligation true, and it's not it doesn't exist anymore until we bring that back By you know recognizing what's going on and then rebelling against it through the culture We can't change anything the only way we can build a great country guys is by recognizing that when you have the attitude that this woman has Which is this is not my responsibility. It ends up fucking you It's sad dude. I hate seeing this stuff. Yeah, it's terrible bro. I agree 100% man. The only thing I want to add is Keep your fucking cat off the downer room table. That should see I can't do what they want. Well, that's nasty Yeah Well, I'm just saying man like we gotta be real Well, bro because like here's the thing people I heard and I think the sad part about this video man is that She is yet to understand and put together That because she refuses to talk about the politics is why she's in the situation. That's not what I see I see that plus a whole lot of other you know, I'm saying I see this yeah, I do know what you're saying Here's what I see bro. I see someone who does has deflected responsibility for Everything in their life like when you say someone's got to do something no matter listen No matter what the circumstance no matter what the fuck is going on No matter what no matter if it's political there's something in front of you. There's something unfolding in front of you And you think to yourself someone has to do something That's someone is always you That's the point. Yeah, and when you when these when she's like blaming this This is what's created this this disgusting political ebb and flow that we have in this country This is your fault Whether you want to admit it or not This is your fault you're struggling because you and many people like you Defer responsibility of who is quote-unquote Rueling over us to other people if we say to ourselves Well, I don't really want to get political what you're saying is while other people can decide who makes the rules for me Other people can decide how much money I get to take home I'm not going to exercise my voice in this because you know what It's annoying to me. Well no shit. It's annoying But it's also annoying whenever they take more than half of your paycheck, isn't it? Yeah, it's also annoying I think you're pretty annoyed about that. It's also annoying when you go to school for six years And you can't pay your bills, isn't it You see what I'm saying? There's a trade-off here And until the general population and this is why I get on you guys about sharing the show Until we as a culture truly understand that we have to Correct what's going on in our own lives and the way we think about our own lives for the country to be corrected Nothing could change like this what's going on in the world won't change until people like this start to say Actually, it is my fucking responsibility who I vote for actually it is my responsibility to know what's going on in the world You know actually it's irresponsible highly irresponsible Even in default of my obligation to America to say I don't like politics don't talk to me about politics You see what I'm saying? Until we get to that point where we're all having interests and creating the environment that we're going to plant our seeds in There's enough people like this that vote for the wrong party or manipulated or apathetic that don't vote That what ends up happening is we get the most evil fucking crook people in charge of our country which fucks everybody I don't know, dude is that cool what we had man yeah Yeah, my last thoughts dude you want to um, so I was thinking I was gonna stop by Walmart And grab a pair of these for old jail is that what those are yeah, is that what they look like?

Yeah, 100% man guys jump in on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments hashtag make a wish you over fart.

I'm not going Just on the strength. I have no interest of the kind of no interest being around any of those people. No No, no, but guys it is time to cruise the comments man I want to bring up something I got a really really nice comment. I think this actually came from our Q&A episode but it's something to talk about you know We talk about this young generation doing hard work and then getting into it and he got that out there This cruise of comment comes from at Buddha swole 76 hundred he says I'm 21 years old taking a trade and plumbing. I knew after I graduated shit Just got real. I needed to find some purpose. So there's a few young bucks who know what's up? That's badass We with your Andy. That's badass dude listen. He's definitely swole. I'm gonna fucking back. That's a big guy. Geez look man There's massive opportunities in those kind of fields right now because first of all nobody's doing them Yep, and nobody's learning them and the people who have the knowledge that no one else has or work the most where we always need them too Yeah, that's what I'm saying bro when I got my house my fucking shit clogged up like fucking seven times. Yeah in the last three years Yeah, no, I mean dude I called them. Yeah, I can't do that any plumbing electric concrete these things like They're starting to try and combine AI with robotics to perfect but like the reality is is um I think these these skills are gonna be needed forever. You know, and I think it's important that young men like this guy here Um stop looking at the trades as some sort of Last ditch, you know effort. You know what I mean like like dude Bro, you can be 21 mega six figures. Bro, that's what I'm saying and just don't vote the way the union tells you because they're gonna tell you to vote Fucking Democrat and and bro that's really like a lot of union guys right now Like they're really suffering right now because there's not as much work But they continue to vote Democrat because the union the union makes those deals with the Democrats financially And they do it and like bro now like this is what you get when you vote for the shit they tell you to so you You can nod your head and say uh go vote for the right person motherfucker because like the truth is Um, they'll kill it. They'll kill it all But I think this is cool. Yeah, I thought those are just dope man. That's fucking awesome Yeah, so good luck in your trade man. Yeah, I think a lot I think more young men should look at the trades as a honest Real career to to go towards what about nobody can take that from the pay scales only gonna go up because the supply of people that can do it is going down You know what I'm saying? I do nobody can take those skills from you. Yeah, they can't take it Yeah, and if nobody knows them that means they're valuable And you know, it was a like when I was a kid like most of the dads were trades guys You know what I mean? Nowadays that's how to it. No, you know, so the guys that know how to do it Especially the young ones are gonna have as much work as they want Yeah, yeah, appreciate your common boot. Yeah, keep going dude. Let's clean those pipes Why you got always got to make it like that? Keep playing the pipe, you know what I'm saying? He's like keep cleaning the pipe Guys, we appreciate all you guys would have been better if you would have said keep laying the pipe Yeah, keep I try to clean it up. Yeah, come out. Yeah, but you made it worse No, I think they're both the both quality Both quality guys. We appreciate you sharing the show. We appreciate you guys liking and commenting So keep being really here's one here's one. I've had my bison hat for a few days. I've already had all kinds of people asking me Oh what it means and had discussions. It's working bro. That's cool. Keep wearing it spread the word Ah, so keep being real ass fans guys. Yeah, we appreciate you. Let's keep moving man. Have lined up to this one is making waves This is a very very interesting topic here. I have a senator Mike Lee calls for investigation of J6 committee after tapes released deliberately hid from us It says let's dive into this a little bit so you top a public and senator Mike Lee is calling for an investigation to the now defunct house January 6th committee Accusing farmer and current lawmakers who served on the committee of quote deliberately hiding some of the footage from the capital riots Lee's comment came after house speaker Mike Johnson out of Louisiana Begin releasing more than 40,000 hours of footage taken at the US Capitol on January 6th 2021 when angry from protesters Angry about the 2020 election results entered the halls of Congress highlighting the release of the footage of a series of posts to ex formerly known as twitter Lee caught into question the character of former Republican Representatives Liz Cheney and of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Quote why didn't Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger even refer To any of these tapes. Maybe they never looked at them. Maybe they never even questioned their own narrative Maybe they were just too busy selectively leaking the text messages of Republicans. They wanted to defeat Lee wrote in a post Maybe they don't care about anything other than their own agenda and initiatives and they are willing To lie cheat and steal and imprison innocent Americans to do so or even kill them. Yeah, maybe that maybe maybe that's possible It's possible. Yeah, so he tweeted out a couple of things This one says uh We need to investigate the J6 committee follow about this one given the evidence They apparently suppressed how much footage and how many other records do you think Nancy Pelosi in the January 6th committee deliberately Lost or destroyed Now here's the thing so this comes out House Republicans make January 6th footage public over Democrats security concerns Now this is the new argument that's coming out from Democrats, okay House Republicans are releasing most of the security footage right we know that Roughly now 90 hours of footage have been posted on the House administration committees website by Friday afternoon Um in a move that Democrats and left-leaning groups have called a threat to security Starting Monday members of the public will be able to set up in-person appointments to view the capital police security footage In designated rooms within the capital complex. I think that's fucking awesome by the way. I think that's really really cool Um When they're saying that eventually around 95% of the 44,000 hours of tape will eventually be made available Excluding segments that contain sensitive security information or information that could lead to retaliation against private citizens Um now here's a response. It says quote it is Unconsciously that one of speaker johnson's first official acts as steward of the institution is to endanger his colleagues Staff visitors and our country by allowing virtually Access to sensitive capital security footage. No. What are they afraid of Andy? No You endangered yourself by lying to everybody. Why don't they want this to be shown I think that's a good question. I think we start there What what what do they not want to be shown like hey? We start there and then here's the thing People have already got it started um on twitter. You got this uh circulating out around a trader Is now trending on on twitter? Um, this is one of the videos that is going around right now Um, and I've been able to confirm this is a legit video. It's real and it has been doctored by CNN Here's the video So So so what what that what we just saw was two videos Okay, the first video was the original clip showing Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer on the phone private call with uh, then vice president Mike Pence However, that footage was doctored by CNN and showed a clip of Grassley to make it seem like this was all one big like everybody was on the same page Which is not what was happening? So they they used a clip and changed when the recording was playing correct Now same same audio file. This is CNN's version So they're playing the audio over different time and video correct Quick, so that's one of the first things that came out right maybe maybe that's one of this So they're trying to make it look like grassley was in on it too correct well look dude this this this I mean we've been saying this for Fucking years, but the reality of j6 is really simple um They planned it they executed it then they they fun literally they killed one person Then I mean do you see the videos of them shooting the crowd with pepper spray balls Yeah, I'm not warning throw and throwing fucking uh, disbursement cans into the crowd Couching grenades. Yeah, well no warning. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I got that No warning So So they have The people there They start shooting them with pepper spray and and concussions Unprovoked then they have provocateurs in the crowd saying let's go. Let's go Okay, and then these people move peacefully through the capital like that's what we watched it on live tv A lot of you guys didn't watch it. I watched it on live tv. He was on o an and news max these videos Show exact there's a do you have this video of the fist bump? Yeah, that's right here no audio guys, but what we're seeing is uh Two US capital police Escorting a man away from the crowd uncuffing him He fist bumps them and walks off and walks off scoffery They give him his property back like that's that's unheard of Now why would you do that and what scenario in police work would you do that? Yeah, if he was one of yours if he was undercover. Mm-hmm. That's the only time. Yeah You would arrest him in front of everybody and then when everybody else is not around you'll let him go. Mm-hmm Yeah, so Go ahead. This is my favorite part though, right? So like I remember you know when all the stuff was happening You had roaders everybody the fact checking the men who stormed capital identified by roaders are not undercover Antifa as post-claim right because it was all this all there was antifa there, right? And the fact check was that no It wasn't antifa. Yeah, it was actually the FBI. It was the FBI posing as Very interesting. Where's the proof? Yeah We go under covers antifa and the crowd so What do you say He said we go undercover as antifa in the crowd You know, it's just it's the same old word play like that fact check. Okay yet. Maybe there wasn't an teeth for there Who posed as them bro? They put people in prison. They got people serving 18 years in prison Yeah, it was a send them like five or six of these dudes killed themselves Because of the pressure that why would they do an operation like this? I know I think of two reasons one They want to intimidate everybody from protesting during the time That they were going to destroy America Which has worked because nobody's done shit since then yep And two they needed something to deflect the stolen election From onto so What's the story going to be is the story going to be The election being in question or is the story going to be an insurrection right? You see what I'm saying right So they've they shifted all the energy of the population onto the quote-unquote Insurrection that was done by unarmed Americans in a country that has more civilian firearms than any country in the history of earth by The constitution for the purpose of defending against tyrannical leaders Which in this situation that is what they were protesting so you're telling me that millions of people showed up To to protest on January 6 when Trump was giving his speech and expected to Pull off some sort of revolution With no weapons in a country that's founded on Pulling off a revolution and having weapons for the reason of having a revolution exactly so So that's the story they went with so when you think about what actually happened What actually happened in my opinion was they fucking pulled a coup and then they used this to cover what they did That's how I see it dude. They even have the basis of it like like declining the national guard coverage Offered up by Trump right like there was there was there was intel reports that were coming and they knew this was gonna be out of control They knew even just by the sure numbers of attendees They knew that was way too much to handle from what they had Right and they declined all like that right there is a red flag To red flag it listened dude. We're being we're being Run into the ground intentionally By a bunch of people who shouldn't be there. Yeah They're got to tell you guys think about all of this let us know hashtag truth to anybody who believes that January 6 was an actual insurrection and watches those tapes And you still say it is You're either you're ridiculously low IQ Or you're part of them you're part of them if you're a decent American citizen Who is maybe votes Democrat And you watched that and you still say yeah, they caused an insurrection and fucking all those dudes belong in jail and all this shit Bro you're as far as I'm concerned you're part of them. Yeah, they want you to think that was an insurrection Because if that's supposed to be the representation of America by strength by numbers by emotions, right It failed that's fair that's more demoralization to the rest of the country All right, it's fucked up shit and then you look at what they did on the year anniversary How they like think about this like think about you're a person right now Who's like just now like you've heard us say it was bull shit this whole time But you have you have still said no it's legitimate right? Let's just say you're one of those people and now you're like holy shit They actually did do this now think about all the other stuff they've done exactly okay now think about how they did the The candlelight visual on the year anniversary and compared it to Pearl Harbor and 9-11 Okay, now after you think about that think about why they did that and the reason they did that Was because they want the history books to read as a real insurrection because 40 50 years from now No one's gonna know the difference because we'll all be dead right all right And the reality Is if you get to that conclusion then think about All the history they've lied about before that And that's where you're gonna start to warp your fucking mind yeah, okay For real shit man guys as it gets our third and final headline headline number three little quick when 40 supreme court rejects appeal a former Minneapolis police officer convicted of killing George Ford This is another one of those big topics is out there um, you know where we've covered this with the blacks where I mean we covered the protests all the degradation of society and Looting the the burning down of police departments and shopping centers, right like the destruction that went on during that time the mostly peaceful time, right? Yeah, talk about all of this You know and we and I follow this kid like so we I know we we've jumped into this a quite a bit burdened down on their own fucking stores in their own neighborhoods. Yeah Makes sense Makes sense, you know and so you know a couple of we've been following this you know, and so a couple things happen Let's talk about a little bit Um, so this is an AP article by the way their article was literally this little excerpt and this right here. That was it Very very short, right? So they didn't even get into the details of this, but we got them for you So AP news article reading this prim court on Monday rejected former Minneapolis police officer dex chauvin's appeal of his conviction for secondary Immorter in the killing of George Floyd the justices did not comment and leaving in place state court rulings of framing chauvin's conviction And 22 and a half year sentence chauvin's lawyers argued That their client was denied a fair trial in 2021 Because of free trial publicity and concerns for violence in the event of an acquittal Floyd who was black died I'm a day Yeah, we know we know bro. He was fucking black what I went Ha Oh Floyd Floyd was black died on May 25th 2020 after chauvin who was white You fucking white What are we doing? Uh who is white pressed a knee on his neck for nine and a half minutes on the street outside of convenience store We're Floyd tried to pass the counterfeit $20 bill a bystander video captured for its fading cries of I can't breathe Now Floyd's death touched off protests worldwide some of which turned violent just a few And forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism that is still playing out Yeah, aka removing the rule of law from society completely More of it. Yeah, yeah, we've been having fucking insurrections in this country for the last three years I think this should about it. Yeah, dude criminals are now It's if you look backwards. It's easy to see how it's part of the fucking propaganda Like when you look backwards and you see what they've tried to create with the situation where All these prosecuting attorneys are not prosecuting crimes and inner cities, right Like when you see that right and then you see them release the prisons during COVID and then you see them Say this right which by the way if you actually look into the evidence I don't know if you have it for the show, but the evidence shows that he actually died from fentanyl Okay, and if you had your knee on somebody's neck, it wouldn't take nine and a half minutes of full body weight to kill them These are facts. Well, that's the thing like that's a really it's actually a tactic that was approved and and and trained into the academy Most of the Academy's used that same tactic You know, like yes, it fucking hurts no doubt But then cut off your airway you know, I'm saying like put your neck. I'll put you put your 265 70 pounds directly on the track Yeah, you're done and pretty quick you're done or if he would have did on his back that would have been mad You know, I'm saying because like now you're you're fucking with a diaphragm from there's so much fun But when you lie these things together, it's easy to see how What was the call lawlessness that's created in society was intentionally created through a set of multiple Circumstances not just this one thing 100% and no one's saying that there aren't cases where police should be held accountable for the shit that they do But what we are saying is that this wasn't one of them And they use this to propagate massive political and societal division to then also create the reality of Massive crime sprees and the police unable to step in and do anything to stop it And this is intentional people have to understand this. This is not about black or white They just understand that making it about black or white accelerates their Agenda more quickly. Yep in multiple different ways and a prime example of this do like I remember when J6 was going on And you had CNN MSNBC talking about looking at all those people not social distancing and not you know But the moment that you know this shit kicks off Covid didn't exist. Yeah, they didn't care. They didn't say one word about it That woke a lot of people up a lot of people do that was a big deal that one issue You know, I'm saying to it's like you see this like the double standard It's literally on every single topic that we talk about in society at some point some way shape or form you know and and That's not falling for it. I feel for this dude. I don't you know I don't really know why the justice is with that I think the argument he has a very very valid argument. I do when the moment That's impossible to say DJ that the the That was the most societal pressure on any issue that I have ever seen in my entire life being 44 years old Yeah, there was more pressure on that To post that black square and Stand with black lives matter Then I've ever seen on any issue ever in my history of my entire life So to it was worldwide. Yeah, so to say That the trial was fair and it would be impossible to have a fair trial like even if they worked And did extraordinary measures to make it fair Even those people would have still had a bias about what's actually happening and that bias at that time was That Derek Chauvin killed this dude. Yep. It was everywhere, bro. Yeah, it was fucking everywhere These jurors they go home they get on their fucking phone Instagram has everybody has like dude dude your family members Family members were calling you saying you're a piece of shit for not posting the black square We're a fucking big it. I didn't know you were a racist. I'm ashamed to be related to you Like the amount of pressure and propaganda around this particular issue Was like whatever ranking they have it was at full throttle It was unreal and then I say this to anybody out there that still has doubts or still doesn't believe that you know I want you to just take a second put yourself in and and show them shoes Imagine you do something right and before you even have a day in court You are convicted guilty by everyone. Yeah Everyone. Yeah, not a chance to tell your side your your your your life is done your career is done Family safety is in jeopardy. Yeah, put yourself in those shoes Imagine that that literally one day whether you you feel like the the mistake you made or whatever it is Was good bad if he was right wrong justified at the end of the day the we have laws in this country You're innocent until you're proving guilty He was proving guilty Not even an hour after that shit was done by every person in the grope even if people even if people Even if people were think that he wasn't guilty You couldn't say it right because they would cost you everything exactly you get fired from your job You'd be labeled back then if you were labeled a racist right and meant something still it doesn't mean anything anymore Well, that's this is what fucking in it. I agree. This is what did it. This is what ended it like Yeah, it's it's fucked up dude and You know Like I said, I'm not saying that there isn't situations where people are unjustly murdered But the reality is is for the amount of interactions that police have The the percentage of that is like astronomically low when we talk about all the contact points that police have Over the course of a single day, right like and even those 99.9999% of their interactions are handled appropriately And they have been villainized and they have been Defunded and we're seeing the result of them being villainized and defunded We have police departments that will not allow their police officers to do their job And then we wonder why crime is the way it is Okay, if we just Enforced the laws and the rules of this country the way they're supposed to be We would have an amazing country Okay, now we can talk about taxes. That's a different issue But at least I would feel a little bit better about paying taxes if everything was enforced properly Right, and so think of all the police officers that have left their profession or their career Because of what happened that year like dude they've lost all respect all credibility with the general public And they don't it's not it's not valid. It's not a valid Sentence for them to to be sentenced to you know most police officers are fucking good dudes man If I had one gripe on you guys It's that you don't stand up enough for what's right like we count on you guys To hold the line for the people not for your paycheck And like that's that's my gripe like when this COVID shit was happening You all should have stood up and say we're not enforcing that Like when they come and tell whatever they're gonna pull for the next year which is coming soon I don't know what it is you guys got to hold the line That's my gripe that's my gripe there and I understand it's uncomfortable and I understand it But if you all do it they can't fuck with you. What's the key it has to be all yes Can't just be fucking three of you. Yeah That's real shit guys jump it on this conversation.
