It's going on any thank you. I'm good man. How are you good now? You guys think this is just my buddy, but in reality Nick has an crazy story to tell He's a Navy Cross recipient and if you know what the Navy crosses the Navy Cross is the Metal that is right below the metal of honor and the way that he earned that cross is something that we're gonna talk about a little bit before we get the show going so Let's talk about that. Let's where do you want to start? well Man, I mean, where did you where did you begin your military career? What made you decide you wanted to join the military? so I mean considering the date Three days ago what 22 years? 9-11 happened I was very young. I was probably fourth grade fifth grade and As soon as that happened in my life, I Started to follow the Iraq and Afghanistan invasion My sister's nine years older than me so a bunch of her friends started joining and I was watching following them and then Growing up in Kansas City just right down the road from you guys. I mean, I thought I Experimented with all sorts of other drugs and alcohol at a younger age and I was just like you know a typical Midwestern upbringing Right, yeah, yeah, it's like all right like I'm already living that war path And you know, I want to go fight for this country and that's just what was like in my blood and so I Joined I actually I ended up going to this alternative school I almost dropped out of high school, but I was like I need my my degree so that I can go into the Marine Corps and As soon as I graduated December, oh nine I left in January of 2010 to go to boot camp So soon as I turned 18 I went shipped off I started my career in Camp Pendleton as a infantry Marine I was a mortar man at the beginning so basically just dropping bombs and tubes and Pitting people from far distances I Did a deployment as a mortar man and then I saw these snipers running around in their gilly suits and I was like I want to try out for that like that's what I got to go to So soon as we got back I tried out for the sniper platoon and We're running around all over camp Pendleton and Starting to do a workup for the next deployment to Afghanistan and I start seeing all of these signs around the base for Marsok and I was like what is Marsok? I knew what Recon was which was like What started Marsok back in a day Marsok is the Marine Special Operations Command so if you think about most people still don't know who we are I think we're it was started in 2006 So it's very new but it's an up and coming special operations community basically so this would be equivalent to like Green Berets or Navy Seals Air Force PJs things like that. Yeah, so we we mirror pretty much identically for a green beret team. Okay, so Now it's evolved into something that's pretty amazing There's all sorts of different teams and they're all regionally aligned to different different areas I was specifically in a jump team so we did a lot of like advanced freefall stuff Jumping from 29,000 feet and every time I'll up every time I'm up in a Commercial plane. I'm looking down on my man. I've jumped from this high So you have to have like a mask on everything. Yeah, we pre-breathe on oxygen the whole way up and then Getting ready, sooting up in the plane and then put an oxygen on before we jump out It's really cool because then by the time you jump out like we open really high as well and You're you're sitting there floating under this parachute seeing the curvature of the earth and just hanging out It's freezing cold. Oh, you're gonna have all the flat earthers mad about Yeah, so anyways like I you know Basically wanted I continued to Search for more in my career. I once I made it to the sniper community I was like this is great, but I I know that there's more I want to go try out for the next best thing So I tried out for Marsauk in 2013. I moved really quick. I tried to move as fast as I could because I was like I Just felt the potential. I felt the growth happening and I knew I had this like leadership mentality that I needed to let like eat So I took selection in 2013 that was six weeks long. There's pretty gruesome Lots of ruck running lots of running lots of carrying heavy weight and just moving through the woods and what's the ruck running like? I got to know about this. It's so we have 45 pound rucks without Or before food and water And then like if you're like me I drink a lot of water when I'm moving and I don't like to be without it Because there was a mission in Afghanistan where I where my team ran out of water And then we got extended two more days and it was just a fucking rough rough day rough couple days and So I moved with a lot of water on me and basically we do a timed for 810 and 12 mile ruck run and And The 12 mile is what normally gets people Especially because we start so late and then we end when it's still dark and it's like dudes are just going and it's like the super long Like dreadful trail that you're on and it's just like never ending but you know that's when that mental Mental fortitude kicks in and it's just like I got to keep going I got a time on a 12 hour ruck run and you had to complete it in Under two and a half hours. Oh shit. Yeah, so you're really running You got to move. Yeah, you have to move. Yeah, and that's an awkward run dude because I've been secretly Okay, I've been you don't know this but I've actually been trying to run with my ruck Yeah, it's like it's so tired all these people out here bragging about all the running I've determined that I'm going to learn how to run like properly. Yeah, and so I'm like fucking I'll learn to run my Ruck on and then it'll be that much cooler. Yeah, so I've been doing it and it's really fucking hard to do bro Yeah, because the shit's bouncing on you the whole time It's really it's like an uncomfortable thing. What do you just get used to that you do find like a rhythm? Yeah, I mean It's like a 12 and a half minute mile Yeah, you're cruising dude. Yeah, that's fast. Yeah, you can't if you're walking you have to speed walk I mean it's it's a it's a husband. Yeah, yeah, so It did dude like I would say that you get used to it, but it sucks every time you do it Yeah, I don't know I mean you got to be a psychopath if you think that it's like No, yeah, yeah, I mean there are some dudes it will book it I mean like running faster than I run without bro. Did you see will did you see what will did out there? No, so will did a hundred pound Mile and did it like eight. What was it eight minutes like like I said I couldn't run at my eight minute mile with no way. Yeah, I really couldn't do it Yeah, I'm totally green when it comes to that. Yeah, but that's crazy. It's wild Well, I got a new goal. Yeah, there you go. So so you join Marsauck So I'm a Marsauck. So I want how do we get to this picture? And so for those guys at home, this is this is when you receive. Yeah, your name is how do we get to this picture here? so January 2020 This is it'll be my third deployment with my my radar team so When you get in there, you're Called a marine rater I was an element leader which I'm basically in charge of Like four other guys in my team, but I was one of the more senior combat like veteran guys in my team. So Whenever we got to Iraq, we were still hunting ISIS and you know, it's it's 2020 at the beginning of it when I got there The world was still somewhat put together The team that we had just Replace to their actually lost one of their highest enlisted guys On a mission in August So when we're getting ready for our turnover, we were like, hey man like they're shit still happening There's still combat happening overseas no matter what you see on the news like they're there's dudes fighting and there's dudes that are dying and A lot of my guys have never been in combat Yeah, at this point they're not even talking about it anymore. Yeah, oh, yeah And so you know it was a it was a real thing getting into it and What ISIS had now come down to is basically like I mean they were damn near getting close to a conventional force they were running they had like a whole governance Established and all this stuff they started as an insurgency and the way that they move up Well now that they were basically back down to an insurgency So now they're hiding out in caves. They're in these little sleeper cells all over the big cities and so our task when we were there was to hunt them and find them and Kill them take care of them however we we can We found ourselves being tasked with a lot of like cave and tunnel clearances That's not something that we've really even messed with since Vietnam like all the tunnel rats and things like that So it was it was interesting especially as a special operations team like we work in a very small capacity with we have we have assets but um Basically, we had to get creative with explosives with the way that we enter with the way that we engage with our partner force So now we're teaching them to be able to crawl into these tunnels and clear these things out So we have done several of them at this point and it was Late February and my team gets tasked with this really large cave clearance operation. We'd been watching this thing for I think weeks at this point all they've seen was seven ISIS fighters coming in and out of these caves. They've seen seven entrances And it looked like a pretty straightforward mission. It was on the side of this mountain and I had a pretty pretty good plan I think um We had it all set up We were gonna drop two thousand pound bombs on every cave entrance right before we entered so it was like all right cool like the ground's gonna be softened up Doods are probably gonna be concussed we are we already knew that it wasn't gonna kill them We've been in caves before like you strike it with the with the bomb. It's only gonna hit the surface It's not gonna penetrate in there and actually like kill the dudes Um, but we had snipers in place. We had machine gunners in place and um My team flies in they start dropping bombs I guess let me back up because so I told you that they had only seen seven guys at the beginning Well 24 hours before we were about to leave we tell our partner force what we're gonna go do They knew that we'd been doing rehearsals for something they didn't know where we were going So within that 24 hours before we were about to leave The intelligence starts coming back like hey now there's 10 guys there Now there's 11 now there's 12 we're about Two hours before we're gonna leave. There's 19 motherfuckers on the ground. How many how many are you? We have a lot. We had uh, but the number of numbers have built them. Yeah, I mean Yeah, so And in the planning you basically have these go and no go criteria's and A no go criteria is like if they reinforce to double their size Well, they're over double and they're like we're still going Which as killers, you know, we're like let's fucking go. I'm ready like I'm ready to go do my job But now it's real and we know that we're gonna get into a fight um So once we land they're hitting this shit they're Really softening it up for us um bombs are Making good impacts snipers engage some dudes kill some guys Um machine gunners let loose and they kill some guys as well Uh, but now there's no real like headcount. We don't know how many guys are still alive We don't know what's still out there and I'm leading the the patrol down Once we land our helicopters. I think I have like 50 Iraqis with me um, and then there's probably 20 us and uh So We start walking down The mountain and you can still see the plumes of smoke from the bombs that had just been dropped Uh, it's pretty pretty wild Once we reach a certain point I call up to the support by fire, which is like the The machine gunners and the snipers and I was like hey when I reach this point I need you guys to just start shooting because I'm gonna start making noise and walking up to where I need to go So they do they actually engage a couple more bad guys in that movement which was pretty cool I I throw some smokes and then pop up on these rocks and as soon as we get up there we start seeing the first caves But at this point people in the back are starting to get kind of antsy. They want to go do work as well And we got a lot of fucking guys So my team chief which is the highest enlisted guy in my team um He was a gunnery sergeant so one rank higher than me, but still like a very senior guy in the team um Said hey, I see something over here. I want to split off and go take care of this real quick I tried to tell him no like just wait. We're almost done clearing this um this cave out I was literally had hands on this dead ISIS fighter Like pulling all of this stuff out of his pockets getting his Fingerprints and whatnot whatever we do to to the um sensitive Exhaust processing yeah processing exactly so once He continues to go do What he thought he needed to go do he breaks off um and takes about half of the patrol and The reason why you don't really do that is like you start getting sucked in you see more and more things and then basically like now he's got a Other assault force that's completely detached from the original plan and They start getting further sucked down and down into this mountain Will now the support by fire can't see them anymore. I can't see them anymore. They're basically in the middle of us and I was like, okay like They they can do this. We're all trained for this. We all know what to do. Let's just keep fucking going I go up to this next cave. I had just thrown in this this grenade and inside That's kind of like our our SOP our standard operating procedure. Let's just throw something in there soften it up peak our head in there and see um see what we got and When I do that huge explosion. It's called an ASM round and anti-structural munition It's almost a full pound of C4 which is a fucking it's a pretty big bang in this little little grenade But it covers everything in dust and I peek up and I look at him and there's this dead ISIS fighter in there Completely white covered in dust and I'm this guy's face is gonna be forever and grained in my in my memory because As I'm staring at him He's fully kidded out. He's still got his rifle like right there. He's got an M16. There's an AK there. There's a A PKM which is a belt fed machine gun that's mounted into the wall. It's looking down into the valley Like they were ready for us. They were ready for a fucking fight But as I'm staring at this guy. I'm like okay. I'm gonna make entry into this cave I just hear this fucking hell brake loose behind me machine guns grenades like all of this like Chaos and I was like holy crap like these guys are in contact and they're calling it in contact five meters 20 meters five meters and then it's just like there's a casualty and At first I didn't know who it was If it was partner force if it was one of us if it was a we had some french guys with us um And then a couple seconds later. There's an eagle down and an eagle is a us service member and Freakin gut drops and I was like oh my god. It's fine. They got it. They got it under control And then not even a second later. There's another eagle down And I was like I just got the goosebumps. I was like oh shit and I turned around and I look at my irackies and I was like hey you guys stay here You need to watch this cave. I gotta go and I just ran as fast as I could They call these I mean it was probably the most untactful Way that I could get there, but I ran up and over this finger of this mountain I ran by like two other caves that I didn't know if they'd been clear or not and there's blankets and there's like little hidey positions in there So I just shoot a couple rounds through each one of those and I'm just like I got a fucking mission And I gotta get the these guys as fast as I can Then I get down there and everybody is frozen Nobody knew what to do But there's a fuck ton of gunfire going off still and I was like you know where the casualties like what's going on? Tell me something and it's just like dudes are like ghosts like I don't know what the fuck to do So I throw my rock off and I jump into where I hear the fire coming from and there's one guy and they're fighting and it's a french guy I Asking him what what the deal is he can't even speak English. I'm like okay guns pointed this way bad guys are this way So I mean the walls are close. They're closer than these walls here and there's boulders rocks everything and I get a wild hair at my ass and I start crawling up these rocks and Still have my like NVG's up on my head and I pop up over this rock and I see this Massive cave entrance that's just stacked with rocks like a big ass bunker um As soon as it sees I see it. It's they see me and immediate machine gun fire like Makes me get my head down and I see as I popped my head up I saw a body right up there and I was like well There's no way this dude's alive if they're shooting this much at me like there's no fucking way This is one of our guys. I didn't know it. Okay, and uh So this french guy starts yelling he's yelling something and I later I found out he's telling This person to roll he's saying it in french, but whatever he was saying he's just like roll roll roll And all of a sudden I see these legs fly up in the air and my first instinct was like I need to go grab him So I just chicken winged my gun basically just put my butt sock under my my armpit and Run up there and I'm shooting with one hand and I grabbed the student with the other just shooting as fast as I could Pull him down and like push him down off of these rocks and then get him down to this other french guy and he grabs him And I'm dumping rounds. I have to reload real quick and still shooting and Finally like dudes woke up they fucking pulled him out and he was shot through and through in the left leg and shot in the top of the head Luckily he was alive. He was a french operator French special operator And I was like okay, you said there's two other casualties. You said there's two Americans where the fuck are the other guys? And this is after I had gotten out of that situation And they're like I think that they're up there in front of the cave I was like well, there's no fucking way I can get there from here So I basically got out of that situation I went and I walked on top of the cave now like they're like in this like nasty cut ravine thing And basically I'm on top of the roof now and How far below Below you are they? It was probably four feet. Oh, okay, so you're like right on time right on top of it like they could hear everything I was doing right So When I got there I talked to my snipers and they were like walking me on to exactly where to walk So then I didn't like have to like come over and like look around the edge and do this like I wanted to be right on top and They walked me right up to it And as I get closer and closer I see I start to see the Aftermath down there and I see one body And the first body that I see him like there's no fucking way the suits alive um Just by the looks of it. I could I could confirm right there. He was dead And then I move up just a little bit more and I see my other teammate and he it was almost convincing that he was alive So I said his name a few times he was sitting upright his eyes were still open It's almost in the position. He was pushing back because he was still fighting and um yeah, that's Uh Yeah, that's it right there um So Yeah, I'd see him and then basically when I confirmed that they were both dead. I was like fuck uh I'm I push back I called over the radio. I said hey sir um This is what's happened mo and Diego are gone. They're dead and he's like what do you mean? It's like I just told you like they're gone He's like you need to go back and confirm. I was like I'm telling you right now sir. They are dead and It was the hardest thing that I've had to do you know, but it was like I need to make a new plan like it's no longer like hunting ISIS. It's now a recovery mission So how do a bunch of grenades on me still and I was like I'm just gonna go back up there. I'm gonna Do everything I can I'm gonna jump down there and pull these dudes out. It'll be done So I go up and I basically lay on top of their roof and I start leaning over like you're gonna look underneath the desk and I start chucking grenades in and like I could literally see the whites of their eyes when I would fucking look down there and chuck These grenades and they're just brrrrr be shooting up at me and Now we start taking shots from the other side of the valley and we find out that they've got fighting positions all over like looking at this one main Trap this one main bunker and uh So I throw a few grenades in there still getting shot at I'm like dude. I can't get down here. So I call an Apache An attack helicopter basically. I said hey like I first called the J attack and The joint terminal air controller and I was like hey, I need you to Help me like thread some bombs through this fucking cave and he's like okay Well like you need to talk to this guy. I don't know exactly where you need me to put it And so I was like okay like helicopter you see me. I'm standing on the cave right now Here is your grid fucking shoot this please and he's like okay. Yeah Yeah, don't fucking shoot me. Yeah, so he's like okay. Well, you need to move and I was like well. Yeah, no shit And I go and I move he's like I can still see you you need to move farther I was like dude. I am low on water. I'm low on ammunition. I'm tired as fuck. I'm not moving anymore. I'll hide behind this rock and he's like Okay, I'll let it rip so they shot 220 30 millimeter rounds in there and the snipers are like there's no effect rocks didn't move nothing fucking happened I was like threat of hellfire in there Please With all due respect fucking do it. Yeah, and they did and still nothing man I went back up there. I tried again. I threw some organ aids in there and I was still getting Some gnarly fucking feedback like they're still shooting at us from every angle. How how was it that that missile didn't do anything If you could see A photo of this cave like they had these rocks and like it was such a small cutout um I don't I don't know I Personally didn't get to enter the cave later that night a few dudes did um from Delta Force and Guys came in that night and actually got to recover our guys. So super thankful for them and what they do and how fucking hard they train like yeah um So Basically I went back up there. I tried a couple more times and I Was almost at the point where I was like man. I don't know what else to do If I tell him to go down there. He's got two kids. He's got a kid like I'm gonna get other people killed Like I'd rather keep trying this for myself and I went back up there for the last time We're shooting we're throwing more grenades in there and the next thing you know, it's just like bam It's like holy fuck. What was that? I got shot. I had like no other I'd get down I like kind of roll back and I was like I My leg is burning. It's on fire right now. Now where they hit you right in the in the shin in my right shin and I Didn't see a bunch of blood at the beginning and I looked down. I'm like man. I feel like I'll be okay I try to walk over to my medic and I was like my leg was Burning yeah, like I didn't know if I broke something or what happened Then I get over there and he looks at it and it's already super swollen and Just a little tiny trickle of blood coming out. It almost looked like I got like shot by a BB like so Something was lodged in my legs swelts like made it super swollen right off the bat But I couldn't put any weight on it and So he's I went over to the medic. I was like hey dude. I think I just got shot He's like, what do you mean you think you got shot? I was like, I don't know my leg hurts. It's fucking bleeding All right, let me check it out. So he looks he's like yeah, sure shit. So I basically called up to the commander and I was like, hey man like we need a new plan their plan was to fucking drop a bomb on it I'm like dude no you have two Americans sitting at the base of this cave you cannot do that like that not not gonna happen We need another plan and I'm a staff sergeant telling High-ranking officers what to do. Yeah, there's other high-ranking individuals out there that weren't Really taking command and it was just like dude. I'm I'm I felt capable, but I'm like I'm a low-ranking guy. There's a command structure for a reason Why am I the one fucking stepping up to make these calls and telling officers no on certain things? It's interesting how people respond to those types of situations. It really really know until you're in it Yeah, and like it's like dudes can respond one way in training and then it's like once the real things are happening That's where Yes, some dudes will just shut down but So they they basically made the call they were gonna wait for the quick reaction force to come in the QRF and once they showed up They were like okay, well, let's just watch the cave for a while make sure that nobody fucks with our guys and wait for the Special mission unit to come in so that the Delta Force unit came in that night um They got into a gnarly firefight uh killed like four more bad guys inside the cave They made entry in there and then a suicide vest cranked off in there um blown Luckily no other US dudes got injured. I think a couple dudes did take I don't know maybe a couple cuts and scratches or whatever but um The only those suicide vests like fill with like shrapnel and stuff like that. Just like you see on TV. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's wild man like beads um I don't know like marbles. Yeah, ball bearings. Yeah, nails like all sorts of nasty shit depending on like who what who the maker is They'll have their own like taste on what they want to put in there um Working with like the EOD text like the explosive ordinance disposal guys I got to experience a lot of like working with that stuff and explosive so I would help them like Blow in place a lot of stuff we call it bipping so like we would take like Suicide vests and all sorts of other shit that they had made and like Blow them up where they were so nobody could use them anymore But it was just wild you dissect these things and see like they're putting fucking nails in there They're putting all sorts of like rusted out Screws and weird shit. Yeah, so it's just like Greeks havoc on whatever it hits so yeah um Once I got met a vac like the the terrain was so steep they basically they had to bring down a hoist so um a helicopter Lowered down this wire and they this medic picked me up from the side of the mountain picked me up take took me to the hospital and uh um I was sitting next to the French guy in their his legs blown out and I got this little pin prick in my leg and like the doctors You're like oh you'll be fine man like you'll be walking in two weeks no problem two weeks come by Still can't walk still on crutches And I basically told my team else I came in like I can't do this anymore um I need to go get more help So went try to get more help and Had to get back to the states and now um It's April 1st by the time I get back home April 1st of 2020 And it's a fucking ghost town everywhere COVID was running ramped through the Middle East COVID is now taking over the states um So this picture right here is when I landed in Wilmington um My wife and maybe two other friends were there to greet me Nobody from the Marine Corps nobody from the government nobody from my team Most my team was still deployed but like um Because they couldn't Because of COVID Yeah, just like and we couldn't have funerals Yeah, just like people had to die over a zoom call Just like a lot of bullshit. Oh, yeah, yeah, and they made me go straight home in quarantine for two weeks No visitors No phone calls no fucking nothing spending a lot of time on my couch looking like a couch potato and uh I Had to coordinate my own travel up to Walter Reed every time for my surgeries for all of that stuff and uh Go get my surgeries still know real check-in still know heads up. What's up? How you doing? Thank you for what you did Nothing, I guess you know, it's like whatever I did my job. I'm gonna get back out there I'm gonna my goal was to get surgery and go back out to country because we I got shot in March We just got there in January so I don't even there two months and uh After that first surgery man, it was like there's fucking no way like in the back of my head I was like I want to get back there, but I doubt it um And what did they find was going on with your leg? It so whenever I got hit basically whatever went in there like Shrappin old out or splintered out and destroyed my superficial peronial nerve And which is one of your main sensory nerves in your leg And so it was just causing all of this crazy pain and then I ended up getting this rare symptom Syndrome called complex regional pain syndrome. So it basically took over my sympathetic nervous system and like started Like every time I would get mad sad angry or depressed like my leg would flare up. I could literally feel it and see it and it was just it was fucking insane I didn't really believe that stuff. I like I was very much a part of that whole like It sounds fucked up, but like I didn't think that PTSD was real because I kind of thought like oh well those do do two Week they just couldn't handle combat. They couldn't handle Yeah, and it was just like here's a fucking straw dude suck it up. Yeah But then when this happened this was literally the straw that broke the camel's back because it was like I I cried almost every single day after that like all of those images were burned into my brain like Then I get this like I was at the peak physical performance of my fucking career And now it's like I get shot. I can barely walk like my wife literally One of your athletes literally carried me Inside When I had this I had this infection in my leg. I was six surgeries deep Thinking that I was gonna be able to run like a week before that and I get this fucking gnarly infection in my leg that nearly kills me I went septic. I got a hundred and six fever. I was like I'm about to die I made it through all of this shit now. I'm about to die from this infection. Yeah And I so like Oh, right bad damn And so she carries me inside and I was like this is a low point in my life But it's I mean at least I got a strong wife to be able to do it So she's curious you wasn't bad. I feel like the we saw that she I think she posted it. Yeah Yeah video or camera like a baby That's still respectable. Well, let's be real bro. It's not like she's like some like weak-ass woman Yeah, very athletic very strong and very noble shit. Oh, yeah. Yeah And man like if I like got to give credit to anybody it's it's her because Every surgery everything that I went through she was right there. She was I mean Every second of the day like whatever I needed I was right there and I didn't really do a very good job it giving her What she deserved at that time because it was booze it was drugs. It was whatever I could to stop feeling this pain. Yeah misery and You know, it actually was what really woke me up is I I got notified that I was gonna get awarded the Navy Cross And I was like holy shit man like this award doesn't just get handed out like this is the real fucking deal Like I fantasized about people who would get these awards and I was like that is so badass and then as soon as they told me that I was getting this thing I was like this isn't cool anymore like I don't I don't really want this I'd rather have these dudes back I'd rather not have that like right detriment on my my soul and It was December 21 January of 22 I started to become extremely suicidal Because they had told me or I had just received the Navy Cross August 26th of 2021 And that was actually the same day That 13 Marines were killed in the Kabul After that day yeah, we're drawn. Yeah, so like I'm prepping for my speech for the Navy Cross ceremony And I get a phone call from the secretary of the Navy and he says hey So that's our Jones like I'm sorry, but I'm sure you heard but there was just this bombing in Afghanistan and I won't be able to make it because These 13 Marines just died And I was I was bummed I was shocked I was Obviously feeling sorry for them, but also reliving everything that I had just gone through and I'm like fuck man like Because of everything in the world that was going on When my team got killed or when my teammates got killed nobody fucking knew about it nobody even batten I about it who's on the news for maybe 20 minutes Nobody knew that another US forest dude got shot like I mean There's still people fucking figuring out what happened on that day when my team got hit and it was like a very intense like I mean we still lost American lives and nobody fucking knew about it. Yeah, we were still over there We were fighting ISIS. We were actively hunting dudes and nobody fucking knew and I was just I was just kind of shocked again. I was like dude. It's it's happening again like the dude's not gonna come here Because Something else in the world is You know it's happening and that that's life, but I actually got a call again from him in like 20 minutes He's like you know what he's like I actually he's like We lose guys Often unfortunately he's like but it's not every day that we get to award somebody for the things that they've done He's like so we just fired up the helicopter will be there in a little bit. I was like holy fuck I think that's wild That's a lot of ebbs and flows of just emotions. It was man, and it was just like That was a traumatic day for I think everybody. I can't imagine like seeing when like Like seeing The the the aftermath of those of that bombing and then seeing those guys like fall from the airplanes and shit that day Like that's like yeah, like that was traumatic for me and I didn't have any skin in that You know what I mean? I can't imagine what that's like yeah for you And it's like everybody's you know bringing up the whole like You know we thought there for 20 years like what are we doing? What are we throwing away? And it's just like man we thought we lost a lot of fucking guys and we're we lost Them on the fucking last day that we're there too, and it's just like what are we what what is this still going on for? And it's like it was it was super fucking hard because it's like we fought for so much And now it's like you're pulling out like this and you're fucking making us look like chump sued um So it was definitely hard. It was cool though that they actually were able to come and recognize this and we were actually able to talk about it on that day too and um Actually on it was actually on 9-11 um In 21 I went up to Walter Reed and got to visit those guys and and see them and it was awesome seeing like the overwhelming amount of support that they had like All sorts of people from the command and the Marine Corps and The Navy everybody was up there to see them. They had a bunch of support So that was great to see like coming. They the kids deserved it. They were so young, dude That was the that was the wild part like they were I mean I was young when this happened to me But I mean I was 28 and they were like 19 20 23 like it was fucking crazy Um, so anyways Fucking kids bro. Yeah and Yeah, I'm glad that they had the support they did up there. It was good to see um so All of this shit is going on and like I said I was very much a part of that stigma. I was a part of that mentality like just suck it up and It starts hitting me more and more. I'm going through all these treatments, but it was December of 21 and to January of 22 like the It I basic I went through retirement. I moved out to Montana I thought that that was going to be my fix, but I was drinking more than ever I was getting more depressed than ever and I was just like I'm done Like this is it so um Yeah, I ended up trying to attempt to kill myself and Ended all right there and you know, I was just like we're about to have this kid and I I can't be like this. I can't be this person and raise a daughter Um, well, I didn't know it's gonna be a daughter at that time yet, but Basically, man like I don't know. Fletcher was in there with me. My service dog And I was in the garage and I was drinking a lot and I ended up uh pulling the trigger on my 9 mil and I have literally never had a malfunction and happen like that um, gun didn't go bang and there was a round in the chamber and everything and uh I Basically took this big sigh and Fletcher came up and was like what's up, dude? Like what's going on wagonist tail licking my face and I was just ballin and I was like What the fuck am I doing like I need to get my shit together and We got invited to this convention this lead your lead gen of valic. Oh, that was god, man It had like I don't know. I don't know what you believe we don't ever talk about that But that's divine intervention dude. It was something. Yeah, I had yeah, I got you That means you that means you have a much much much bigger purpose here We'll talk yeah, we've been friends for a long time. Yeah, you know what I'm saying I'm glad that happened. Yeah, I'm glad you're still fucking here. It was definitely I never heard that story before just now And that's the thing is like I still feel so like weird. I feel taboo about talking about it because I feel I don't know like I'm fucking sweating right now thinking about it because it's like I don't want anybody to know that side of Of me, but it's like why why not like I need people to hear that yeah, it's like You need to understand that the shit can happen and When it does happen like there's so many other fucking people that have been there in your shoes right now like All you got to do is reach out and there's gonna be somebody right there either at your fucking doorstep or talking to you all god damn night long and like you just have to fucking tell somebody And it's like that's kind of what I want to get across because it's like whenever I I ended up going to this legion of valor convention A convention with all of these like War heroes all metal of honor recipients Navy Cross like service cross recipients My goal was to be like how the fuck are you still alive? I literally have gone one year with having this award And I already tried to kill myself like why are you still here? How like how do you live with this? And it's just like It's just wild to see like that you just have to live you have to be present you have to love life and like Actually be willing to fucking fight for what you've fought for so long you fought for so fucking hard for all of this shit And it's all fucking worth it and now it's like I'm about to have a daughter and This is something to live for my wife is something to live for my life, dude. It's a fucking gift like yeah That's why they call it the present. It's because living in the present. It's a fucking gift. Yeah Yeah, now I feel like I do feel more obligated to talk about it just because it's like somebody somewhere Needs to hear it. Yeah, man, because it's like I like I'm supposed I'm what I thought is I'm supposed to be this hero with this fucking big metal on my chest And I'm supposed to be bigger and better than everybody else, but it fucking hurts and Even though we still hold this title and we still have all of this like wait behind us It's like this shit can still hit us too And you know doesn't matter who you are doesn't wait for anybody Why do you think it got accelerated after you were recognized for what you did Or do you think that had anything to do with it? I don't I don't really know if that had much to do with it um I think it was all building up and and you know certain Instances kept happening. It was just like I don't know. It's just a lot to fucking handle um Yeah, and it's like I've been I've been through it before like I've dealt with a lot of death like July 10th of 2017 we had a plane crash that killed 16 Marines Seven of them were in my company one of them was one of my best friends I literally had to go notify his wife that night But he'd get dressed up in my uniform and go there and that was actually my best friend Talon leech So I had to go tell his wife that he's never coming home and it's like that shit only happens in movies I've never like I've literally watched movies of dudes going to knock on doors and they're fucking alpha service uniform and it's just like Never in my life did I think that was mean What did I do the week after that? I went to the shoot house like we went right back to training and it was like Okay, let's go to work like I we were just so good at compartmentalizing because we had to like turn it back on like in an instant It's the same fucking thing in the real world. It's like well. I got to go back to work like This person just passed away. This this just happened. I mean I got in a fucking crazy car accident, but it's like All of these things in life they continue to build and build and build But it's like if we just keep shoving it down and not doing anything about it That's when it becomes such a detriment to your mental health and it's like You have to address it. You have to be willing to talk about it. You have to be willing to sit with it and feel it and like I mean since my last surgery in July of 2022 I Stopped drinking so I've been sober for a year and two months now And it's been the best thing that's ever fucking happened to me. Yeah, because now I can literally sit there and feel my Feel my feelings like feel my thoughts and all of this shit and it's just like it's it's hard. Yeah, but it's it's real It's me. It's like this is all me now. Yeah, so yeah alcohol is a fucking killer bro It is I grew up just like you doing the the drinking and you know smoking weed and fucking running around getting fights and doing all that shit And dude, I spent a lot of years In the alcohol, you know what I mean? Yeah, like and dude once I cut it out for the most part because I mean dude I might drink like twice a year now it doesn't Your life gets way better dude. Yeah, it's way better Especially if you're carrying a lot of weight You know when I have people that come to me and they're struggling the first thing I tell them I said bro Stay away from alcohol and control what you control those are two things. I tell anybody when they come to me Fuck so what what is what is Nick Jones doing now? What's the You know, where where are we at today? Yeah, so currently I'm the president and founder of a nonprofit called Talon's Reach Foundation We support special operators who have been morally mentally or physically wounded So doesn't have to be related to combat doesn't have to you don't have to have a purple heart. You don't have to have a valor award It's Some sort of moral mental or physical injury kind of just like what I just said We bring guys out to Montana. We have a five-day long systematic approach to healing We do all sorts of different holistic methods to healing so we we introduce them to yoga mindfulness meditation breath work art therapy music therapy We get them outdoors. We immerse them into nature We basically get them to get their mind off of fucking everything else that's going on in life But then we do the hard work which is the education piece So we teach them about traumatic brain injury PTSD This other term called operator syndrome which is basically like hypervigilance anxiety depression anger all of this shit crammed into one thing that creates like a dysfunctional well dysfunctional type of operator That is like most people either think that they are suffering from PTSD or TBI and now they've Basically joined those two and it's just like it might be this So we teach about all of that stuff and basically what happens to the brain when trauma strikes and ways to mitigate those um Basically got on this path because talk therapy Going to the psychologist like sitting in a fucking four-wall white room With one person that just like never understood would always fucking every time I came back. It's like So tell me about yourself. Yeah, I do die just fucking told you my story a hundred times Where are we gonna move on from this and their candy's always shit? That's the worst part about it like It's always they always got bullshit candy I get at least have the real shit. Yeah, I'm a big I'm a dance. I'm a I'm not an advocate for that sort of therapy right I feel like and I have experienced plenty of it you know, I believe it or not. Yeah Some of your motherfuckers think I still need it. I probably do but the reality is is uh You know, I feel like most of the therapy out there has has become less about solving people's problems and more about maintaining a customer base and that's what I noticed, you know So I think it's cool that you're doing it this alternative way. Yeah, thank you. That's awesome It's been cool man. We've ran three programs so far. We've helped um 17 special operators. We've got our fourth one coming up so It's it's been amazing man that the outcomes that we've had like the success stories that we've had and it's like we don't prescribe We don't treat we don't Like we're not fixing we're educating and we're kind of guiding them through and showing them the tools giving them the resources and like I mean, man, you'd be surprised like dudes that come there and they're like super Down sad like everything life is out to get me and then they come back and they they reach out and they're like dude Like I've never been fucking happier like Now they do art therapy or just They found other ways to deal with this exactly and it's like dude like the only copen that mechanism that we really understand how to do is Fucking drink if I and just like Take this prescription medication. Yeah, well, that's bullshit. Yeah, yeah, so It's been amazing man. Um, we've been a nonprofit now for two and a half years um, and we just hired our first employee so it's been pretty fucking cool Uh Yeah, man, we're growing. We're I'm loving it and it's like kind of like what you said like I needed to find my My purpose after What I thought like losing my identity losing my purpose and it's just like When this shit happened, it's like dude. I I have found something that really drives me and it's like I don't have to get paid to do what I love Um, and I don't get paid so it's amazing that I can Really share my story and let these dudes have this safe space become vulnerable and really fucking heal and like actually work on themselves from the inside rather than like Just telling dudes like I used to be like all right dude like I'm sorry that happened to you but like Try again next time. Yeah better fucking suck it up work harder like Sometimes it's not the fix sometimes. It's not that easy. So it's been it's been amazing Really looking forward to seeing how How it continues to grow because we have like We have a pretty big vision and what's the big vision? So eventually We want to acquire our own land our own like facility out there in Montana We want to be able to run at least one program a month right now. We're about three programs a year. So Funding personnel Logistics all that stuff kind of comes into play Um, but what we wanted to really do was like dial in a Quality program rather than like bump out like a bunch of like quantity and like like let's help a bunch of dudes right off the bat It's like I want to help guys, but I want to make sure it's a quality program Yeah, you want to make sure you actually help them. Yeah, because if you don't and they come to the program and it doesn't help them They think they're unhelpable exactly right. Yeah, we'll start blaming themselves. Yeah, it makes it worse. Yeah So We want to be able to be able to do all this shit in house. We want this facility. We want to be able to have staff on hand Do one program every month and then eventually have some sort of like longer term Treatment if you will um of like a four to six week program So then guys that need extra help or maybe who are suffering from some sort of substance abuse or just want to fucking Really immerse and like heal We'll have that availability. We'll have like all sorts of like Cold plunge hot tubs. Yeah So uh Float tanks like all sorts of different things so then it's just like the tools. Yeah, exactly because You know, you never know what's gonna help you never know what's gonna stick and it's really hard for like a Special operator who's got this fucking ego to walk into some yoga studio. Yeah, some like meditation room And it's just like all right like I'm fucking here. I'm like all I was gonna fuck with me right now. I was gonna laugh at me and I'm gonna fight So it's like we want to give them and have that fucking sanctuary It's like you can still be this humble warrior who's still ready to fucking turn it on But who also understands how to sit down calm down and like really like get deep and get within so um Yeah, we've got we've got some big plans. I mean Might take a while but we'll get there. I love this dude. Yeah. I love this like I'm so glad you came on the show dude Yeah, thank you so glad You're dude you're a fucking real fucking man like that's real man shit like what you've done and what you're doing and how you've Overcome and what you're doing now to help people Deal with that issues, you know the issues that you've experienced. I mean bro. That's That's what it's about bro. I It's fucking good work man. I appreciate that. Yeah. How can people get involved with this program? So we've got a website www.tallonsreachfoundation.org We've got social media Instagram Facebook and LinkedIn But on there we've got like volunteer applications My email is just Nick at talent'sreachfoundation.org. How do you spell the website? Talons so T-A-L-O-N-S Reach R-E-A-C-H and then foundation you name that after your buddy Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Yeah, and so there's like several Metaphores I guess because we call all of our participants Eagles then come through um, and it's just like you know There's no better Reach than like the eagle itself like we have such a fucking powerful grip and like if you ever looked up An eagle in their grip strength. It's it's pretty fucking intense But it's like if you think about it like I'm Senior or junior man in the team. It's like I have the power I have the reach to either like fucking reach out and help somebody or reach down and pick somebody up and it's just like I don't know like I come up with all of these different things to talk about it, but it's like I mean That means you're a natural born brand or bro It's good stuff. Yeah Yeah, I'm trying. I guess. Yeah, you're doing great, but um Yeah, it's just You know, I even called Talon's dad and I told him about it and I was like look this is what I have I have this idea. I was like there's by no means do I want to benefit off of your son or use your son's name in these certain ways, but like This is what makes sense to me This is what we're trying to do and I think that this is how we can help the most people and this is what I want to name it I want to name it Talon's reach and he was like fuck balling and so he's come to almost every like fundraiser that we've had and stuff He actually lives in Fulton, Missouri. Oh no shit right down the road. Yeah, so Yeah, his name's tab. He's an awesome awesome human. That's awesome, but uh Yeah, man It's it's cool. I don't remember what I was just talking about.

This is recent. Yeah, you know, and I applaud you bro Because I think that's just fucking awesome. I think it's awesome I also think it serves as a real example of like what real trauma.

I'm going to my safe space holy shit, man Like listen to what's going on here. You know what I mean this is It's powerful shit bro. I really really really commend you for doing what you're doing.

It's been been talking to town everybody's been on it Um, headline number one reads Escape murderer Nano Cavalcante survived only on watermelon for two weeks hid poop under leaves and reveals how just how close cops came to catching him If you guys have been seeing this This has been so it's been a big big talk right? It's been a big deal One where they took the picture with the guy. Yes, okay. Okay. Yeah So captured criminal denelo Cavalcante told cops he survived for nearly two weeks on stolen watermelon And then officers scouring heavy Pennsylvania underbrush for him had gotten so close they nearly stepped on him three times Um, the 34-year-old convicted killer was quote brutally honest After he was apprehended Wednesday morning sharing how he even buried his poop to avoid getting tracked US Marshall Robert Clark to news nation quote He did say on three occasions law enforcement officers did almost step on him They were about seven to eight yards away from him Clark said uh Cavalcante who escaped from Chester county prison on august 31st had just been sentenced to life For stabbing his ex-girlfriend to death in front of the two young children in 2021 Prosecutors are expected to love the additional charges for crimes. He committed during his 14 days on the run Um, and continue saying after crab walking up and over a pair of close set walls Um, an escaping jail Cavalcante told police he was able to survive for days eating watermelon eats stolen from nearby farm Uh, they escape eat drink water from a stream hid within dense brush and only moved at night Uh, it's a coverous track. He had his feces under piles of leaves now. This is what he looks like um when they captured him Um, he definitely Had a nice run around Pennsylvania Um, over those 14 days. He did all this on foot on foot Damn. Yeah, he was moving Moving We know like this guy have training or something. I don't know man. I don't know and I mean, you know Pennsylvania brush is pretty pretty deep It can get pretty rough out there You know, uh, so I mean, I don't know if if those uh I don't know if that's like branches that did that to him. I'm sure it was a branch. It had to be branches Definitely wasn't definitely wasn't the really amazing officers of Pennsylvania. Yeah, definitely the branches But uh, but do these eyes. So there's been a lot of heat. So the picture that Andy was referring to this picture here Um, that was posted when they when they finally caught this guy has been circulating and going around Um, but he's getting a lot of heat like all these officers are getting a lot of heat on it. Why? People are furious Andy. Uh, people are furious that Pennsylvania police took a photo with the captured convict and yellow calvocante Uh, two people posted on x formerly known as twitter pause. Why do they keep having to say that? Like it's not sticking. Is that what like is that the reminder people or like what do you what do you do when you post on on x What do you mean? Well, I got pote uh, listen, this is brand new. We talked about branding a minute ago. This is branding 101 Okay, you have twitter and you make a tweet. Mm-hmm. All right. A tweet is a verb. Right. All right action Now you have x they didn't think this through. I told you this when they did it You have x now. What do you do on x? Yeah, making x X-a-q x-a-q x-a-q all right Learn I told you This goes natural born branding genius. They need to sign me. That's right. Yeah, that's a pretty fucking good I Gotta come up with something that's that's the best one I've heard. That's the best one I've heard. Yeah, pretty good Um, but yeah, so a couple people went to to x Uh, saying this one person says quote a couple people executed. Yeah, a couple people executed on Twitter. Oh shit. Let's get shut it down So people executed these motherfuckers are definitely turn us to yellow for no reason again. Bro But some people saying that basically uh, this person said uh, cannot believe I have to explain why this is inappropriate Referring to the cops behavior following them. It's capture another poster. They call them up Like see it just doesn't make sense another exer Said taking a photo with the xkp was wild while another called it truly embarrassing now What's embarrassing about that? I don't yeah, I don't get it I mean like here's the thing. I think there's a common thing that we keep trying to make these criminals Be these like you know, oh, they were on honor roll and second grade and they you know They helped tie somebody shoes when they were you know eight years old like fuck that this dude is a convicted murderer right like I don't know if they would have held him upside down and took his lunch money. I would have been okay with it You know like why do we keep giving so much sympathy? I would have been okay with it. They shot him in the fucking head Like I wouldn't like you're a murderer. Yeah, dude. That's what I'm saying like dude. We're talking about yeah This this attitude around sympathy for violent criminals It's got to stop dude. It has to stop people don't understand Because they have good hearts and they have good minds and they wouldn't do bad stuff They assume that anybody who does bad stuff is some sort it was like an accident or was a mistake or was something Bro, there are evil people out here that will just fucking straight up kill you and you guys like make excuses for them All day long and then until it hits you right like that Congresswoman in Minnesota where I think was Minnesota wasn't it where she she was talking about you know sympathy for criminals and then she gets car jacked in her own driveway, you know Yeah, I don't understand what these people are criminals. Yeah, like these are not good people These are not people to have things like empathy and care and like do the right thing and grain it like how hard is this to understand That there are people like this that they exist that exists like why are we advocating for people that are disrupting society and causing harm and and sympathizing for them and making excuses for them. Why are we doing this? It's absurd shit I don't get it. I don't get it. Now here's one more interesting take on this thing right and I saw this and I had to go verify for myself Okay But if you go to Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, okay, they have this in my inmate or parole locator right and search this guy up Um, I did I pulled him up because I've been seeing this thing and you know I've been see there's been this increasing trend of how they label the ethnicity of people, okay So you know this is this is denillo right That's him, okay Uh denillo kamikante, okay. Yeah Let's see what they labeled them in for them. It goes race ethnicity white Hmm Nothing we were there Now again guys check for yourself take them and never go to that website. We'll make it down below Um, but I think that there's a very sinister thing and all the reason I bring this up because I feel it's important To call the stuff out For what it is as BS and you know, it's it's messed up what they're trying to do but they're trying to paint the picture You know denillo salsa calvacante is spanic male The labelling was white to increase the white crime statistics on white crime. That's right to justify Taking guns and to justify the narrative of white supremacy being the biggest domestic terrorism And also let's let's just stop and be real honest about this What if this exact guy because let's be real bro like on the spectrum like hispanist kind of in the middle of black and white All right, let's be real like um What if they took this guy what if they were taking all of these Latin American or foreign non-white criminals and they were labeling them black What if they were doing that What would the narrative be then All right, there's a racial double standard in this country that people refuse to acknowledge Even the statement of people of color is exclusive of white people only yeah, it's it's made to say everybody but white people And that's that that's a big problem and there is a problem in a very open anti-white bias And there has been for a long time. This isn't new. This didn't just happen in 2020 This has been going on my entire life white people have never been able to say the things that other races can say We can't say hey, I'm proud to be white. I'm not proud to be white because I'm give a fuck about being white because and you know Why I'm not why don't give a fuck about being white because I've never been allowed to give a fuck about being white Okay, so when we think about what's actually going on and we think about the racism that Actually happening. Let's have an objective look at what they're actually doing They're creating crime data that doesn't exist To push a narrative that isn't true to get people to exclude this one particular race And if you were to say people of color and an included white people but not Latin American people or not Mexican people We would call that racism If we said people of color and we just said well the color black isn't a color the color black is The one that we're not talking about that would be called racism But because it's white people no one calls it racism and no one wants to stand up and say what the fuck it is I'm not advocating for Like I actually believe that nobody should really put their identity in their race at all. I never did I know you like him high school and shit like I just put human Like legit like it's all my tests all of that dude if races your identity You're not a very sophisticated human being you're a low IQ person like if that you were born that way You know i'm saying like there's nothing to do anything. Yeah, it's not like you work really hard like you know Yeah, you know There's nothing to brag about about someone's race And it's very easy for me to see that because I've never been able to brag about my race But if you say that to a lot of black people or you say that to a lot of Hispanic people It doesn't make sense to him because they've never dealt with that And that's a real thing about race that's going on if we want to remove racism We have to remove all the racism. Yep We have to get rid of all of it like this is this isn't a this is a very Nefarious example of what they do To push these racial division agendas that are not good for anybody like dude This isn't good. We're supposed to judge each other on the content of our character We're supposed to say hey, I don't care if you're black or your white or your brown or your yellow or you know Anything else we're supposed to say what kind of person are you are you a good person? Are you not a good person? Are you do you contribute or do you do you hold a high moral standard? Do you try hard like do you treat people right? Do you lift people up when they're down or do you are you a piece of shit like that's that's the America that I want to live in That's the America that I know That's the America I grew up in up until you know The last 10 years or so where it started to get weird but You know, yeah, I just thought I was It was stupid but like I mean like it doesn't you don't it doesn't do it just by Seeing and I'm not saying something so I say something you see something. I call it out, you know Yeah, brother like look dude if we're ever gonna solve this problem with division in this country We have to be honest about where what it actually is and where it comes from you know, it's not It's not white people oppressing everybody bro if we actually look at what's going on white people aren't even allowed to say their Oh, it's like bro if you go to the ado website Like if you go to the anti-definition league website where most of the narrative comes from around censorship Around what's acceptable socially? Okay, if you go to the ado website a statement of hate is oh is that it's okay to be white That is marked as a statement of hate How the fuck is that a statement of hate? You see what I'm saying like dude and this is why you're seeing all this backlash against the adl on Twitter Ban the adl is one of the biggest hashtags for the last two weeks You have all the big names coming out and talking about it because these people Have manipulated social agendas to protect themselves and make everybody else's life fucking chaos They're man. I'm not talking about the Jews. I'm talking about the adl and the people that are there running that Whoever they are yeah Like these are just this we have to stop generalizing people as whole groups. Yeah, like we can't look at one I don't know what this guy is Next-kinder middle you know, I don't know what he's you know to say latino okay? We can't look at that and then say all latinos are bad We just like we can't look at a black person who does something bad and say all black people are bad Or a white person all white people are bad But somehow the adl has everybody convinced that if one Jewish person does something bad that that means that you're saying it against all the Jews And that's not what anybody's saying. That's just the defense mechanism. That's right Yeah, very interesting guys jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think hashtag bad boys bad boys What you gonna do?

They do all this hard work to make these things look beautiful Just for you that doesn't change the fact that what's on the inside is shit All right, so This is no different than the race example that we were talking about it all looks good on the outside Yeah, but we don't know what's on the inside. I happen to know because I drink this. Yeah, some days I gotta be reminded that you know there were days where I couldn't get that Fiji water like today So I'm reminding myself today what it's like, you know what I'm saying? Yeah So do you have like are you like a like a filter purified spring water guy? I am I'm a water snob now I drink some reverse osmosis at the house So you're definitely just like peasant waters.

It's I can it's just like I know if I fucking drink a full Fiji during the show Like I'm doing good on my water intake. Yep.

Thank you guys. Yeah All right, so let's get right back into it headline number two. Headline number two reads North Korea's Kim Jong-un to stay in Russia for several days He's like, it's nice here bro. They have the guitar over there. They are I'm gonna call that vodka So so North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has unexpectedly Extended his visit to Russia where he was meeting president Vladimir Putin for a suspected arms deal The pair had discussed possibilities for military cooperation on Wednesday Mr. Putin also quote great fully Accepted an invitation for mr. Kim to visit North Korea a Kremlin spokesperson said also a little change there. That's cool Uh, Moscow's buying weapons Uh, for its war on Ukraine and any help would violate you in resolutions the US's war uh, mr. Kim has was warmly received by mr. Putin at the Of its cash city space center on Wednesday in Russia's Far East the North Korean leader spent two days traveling there In his private luxury bulletproof train Now have you guys seen the pictures of these train this train does he now fly I'm gonna see for a thing. I shoot him down. He has a jet. I mean has a big like bow and business class jet um, you know, I don't I don't think I would be able to do a train bro Well, at least this one so so It's only it only can go 31 miles an hour because of how heavy it is So like that's a pretty slow like trek, man. That's like I don't think I can do it Taking in all the views. Yeah, I think it was like 800 miles or something from from North Korea to My only what the purpose of that is what the of taking the jet. I mean taking. Oh, yeah, like is that a security thing? Yeah, I mean maybe I don't know I don't know that was suck Yeah, I mean that's a long bumpy slow ride, you know, yeah, I don't I don't I don't get it Um, but the talk of the town between these two meetings outside of all the political things that I thought was most hilarious is that um You know Kim Jong um, he's a car guy. Oh, yes. He is a car guy. And so it's Putin Really, and so they're going back and forth talking about their presidential limousines That's what the talk of the whole town was and so this how I read Bizarre moment Kim Jong-un test out Putin's armored limo and sits inside it unlike when he visited Trump And was only allowed to peek inside the beast limousine So the this is the bizarre moment we got the videos the the Vladimir Putin invites Kim Jong-un To sit with him in his armored limousine One-up in Donald Trump who only allowed the North Korean to peek inside his beast limo in 2018 Putin and Kim met yesterday at the North Korea Russia summit to inspect the space launch facilities of the It's actually cosmodrome in the Russian Far East You know, that shit was about though, right? Was a Dude trumpet and some unfinished McDonald's in there, bro He didn't want Kim Jong-un. Touching his jacket nuggets. You let one real right? He outboxed his own ride Don't go too close. No, bro. He had he had 19 chicken nuggets. He didn't want Kim Jong-un to touch him That's a fucking fact So so here's the video from 2018. This is Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong-un here's video Oh Damn that thing's huge massive massive, so it didn't let him in but shit, dude I didn't realize that thing was that big massive cuz Trump's a big dude, bro big dude, man. Yeah That is huge. That's like a that's like a SUV limo that looks like a car. Yeah, well here's Putin's So Putin has a RS tonight And I think that's actually made by Rose Royce. I think it looks like a rolls Who has like a drive train and all of that stuff? Yeah, I'm so here's the video of those two I don't know where the audio is. We'll get a plug in though That has been a nice and here I've wasted over for you guys But yeah, so that's been talking to town Um, but here's the thing. There's been a new development in Ukraine. I thought we watch I'm not got the sound on this one for sure But Ukraine's transgender spokesperson issue stark warning to Russian propagandist Quote all will be hunted down and justice will be served. So let's watch this video Have you seen this? No Like I haven't seen him at all. No, okay. Oh, you've never seen the the transgender spokesperson of Ukraine. Oh, okay Here's the clip Ah, shut the fuck up, dude Russia hates the truth that their obsessive focus on a Ukrainian volunteer Is simply allowing the light of the Ukrainian nation's honesty to shine brightly Next week the teeth of the Russian devils will mash ever harder and their rabid mouths will foam an uncontrollable frenzy As the world will see a favorite Kremlin propagandist Pay for their crimes and this puppet of Putin is only the first Russia's war criminal propagandist will all be hunted down and justice will be served as we in Ukraine are led on this mission By faking God liberty and complete liberation You you're better looking You're much better looking I can't believe this is real life, dude. Dude. This is not real. I this is fucking that's real. This is satire No, that's real will nash the teeth Do do what the fuck look at that Adam's apple, dude look at Bro, what are we what is going on? We somehow crossed into an alternate reality dude Yeah, that's who they got man that that's the so so apparently what they have a they have somebody captured already a Russian propagandist They're gonna execute is that she said that's what they're planning on Capture them just yet they're working on it though. Okay. It's what they're saying. Yeah, just like they're winning the war Just like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know, but I mean back to these beasts. I just thought I was interested, but Yeah, they basically got an episode of pit my ride going on over in Russia. Oh, and we're in the White House. What kind of limo we gonna have? Oh, that's a tough one. Yeah, I mean, I think we should go to roles, bro It has to be roles like I mean we need this it has to know it has to be Rolls Royce It's it's not a lot I do listen get a phantom but like stretch anything less for me would be a fucking downgrade I'm gonna go do that job and take all this shit for everybody. I want to drive with the fuck I want to drive That's real talk You've been into any cool cars or anything or that was the coolest thing trucks you got to drive anything Um, bunch of different armored vehicles get drive tank. I got to ride in the tank didn't get to drive drive it Yeah, it would be cool No, I'm trying to think man my memory doesn't serve me too well ever now and then Well, it's rolls and ain't Cadillac No offense Cadillac a Cadillac makes nice stuff, but man rolls is rolls. They do make nice stuff The new s's sounds got one of the new escalate these yeah, I think it's fucking nice prepare sounds bad ass too. Yeah Anyway, how much yeah Make sense why Kim's got the bulletproof train that he had to take up there. Why's that because he's a car guy So he's like showing off his train going up there. Yeah, that doesn't make sense. Yeah, I'll bring him my train. Yeah, right. Let me see your train. Yeah, that's right A train I think the travels will a whole bunch of people though. Oh shit. I bet he travels a whole bunch of soldiers and all that shit Yeah Anyway, he's a weird dude He just does the things very weird man. It's like but you don't expect anything less well Judy lives in a fucking bubble those people aren't allowed to know what's going on in the other anywhere else in the world bro like I don't know. What do you think he makes of this transgender Fucking Ukrainian spokesperson Like dude, can we not be real here? Can we not be real about how embarrassing that has to be for the people you crane? Like he's an American. I know that that's that he's American. Yes What yes, this is an American transgender person that somehow got put into the role of spokesperson for something The territorial defense forces of Ukraine Like what What rank is that what What is going on? Anyway Guys jumping on comments has said pit my right. Let me know what you guys think. Yeah, let's go to our final headline headline number three. This is juicy here Headline number three reads hunter Biden sues ex Trump staff are tied to laptops dissemination Now this is very very interesting So do you guys remember Uh, I think it was when we had Eric Schmidt on And we had brought up the um We had brought up basically That a screenshot. I'm pulling it up here now That screenshot and it has like essentially This tit for tat timeline, right? You're talking about where they had uh, the Hunter by there we go June 7th FBI realizes document or I'm sorry June 7th FBI releases documents to Congress alleging Biden's took 10 million dollar bribe from Burisma June 8th the very next day Uh, Trump Jack smith and dice Trump In Mar-a-Lago docks case july 26th hunter Biden Uh, goes to court and where jex a sweetheart plea deal after it was revealed that DOJ tried to give him a blanking immunity for future prosecutions The very next day jaxmith hits Trump again With some more charges july 31st hunter Biden's former business partner testifies to Congress that Joe Biden Was on over 20 calls with his son's business partners that Burisma execs pressured them to fire the prosecutor He also have Joe Biden on TV bragging about that And then the very next day you have jack smith and diding Trump again for January 6th. Yeah, so that's like tit for tat thing right now This came out the lawsuit was initiated on Wednesday But what happened Tuesday? Oh, they announced the impeachment inquiry for Joe Biden and then now he's coming out again trying to hit on somebody's uh on one of Trump's team um But that's not just it right, so there's a lot of stuff going on um Mac gates you know he throws you know the speaker of the house throws him on the bus and like hey either do this or you're out Um, you got all these articles being written questioning whether Joe Biden is fit to run um, and this is all liberal left media that's throwing him on the bus right um and then it comes out Got some breaking news You gotta do your thing. Oh, it is. Are we doing it again? I mean, I mean, I think it's fair. It's like I forgot how it goes been so long You got breaking news breaking news. Hella reads hunter Biden and died in on federal gun charger So this just comes out this just just came out. This is how to press while we're recording Um, Hunter Biden just got indicted almost the three felony uh gun charges So he gets indicted on federal gun charges, but none of the now for taking millions of dollars for policy decisions They're affecting the well-being of our country. Is this gonna be what they use to just like hopefully sweep all of this out of the rug Hope everybody forget about it Like don't pay attention to all the millions of dollars of bribes over here We got them on the gun charges and he's facing like 25 years or something like that like what I mean, what's the angle here? I don't know it feels like you know The heat's been turned up so high on hunter Biden and Joe Biden that they just want to hook him into something so that people will be like All right, we got him and then forget about the real shit that's going on. Yeah, that's how that's what it feels like you know You know these people these judges and you know people think it's Democrat Republican These people are all playing together man. Yeah, so what they're doing is they're having a conversation on the back side Say hey, this is hot. We have to do something. We have to relieve some of this pressure and then they're saying okay, well You know We can do the gun stuff right? Yeah, that'll stick yeah, and that way we know how to blow the whistle on all the stuff that all of us actually do And that doesn't come out in the wash so we can just stick him with these gun charges. He's gonna have to eat that But that way we protect our Our livelihood. Yeah, you know, and I'm not a lawyer, right? But like I was looking into some of the like I looked into the lawsuit and all that stuff and like Dude, all that the hang up with all of this stuff like he's suing um the guy Who put all of this stuff out on Marco Polo, right? He uploaded the entire uh contents of all the of hundreds of Biden's laptop was all uploaded and obviously since it out some of the stuff right whether it was faces or you know credit card numbers or that's because there were miners There were naked miners on the photos It's people don't really people don't realize what's actually on that laptop And then it's just the gun charge. No, no, no, and it's not just some crazy pictures of hunter Biden's smoking crack Like there's way more on there. It's that people aren't even talking about it hasn't been covered by the media Right, so it's like they're showing a little bit But they don't want to show the whole thing. Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, I mean, there's a thing the Pandora's Box was open at this point um You know, but you know looking all into this stuff and like, you know what they're arguing it's like, you know People got to remember how he got here. He dropped a laptop off to be serviced At Mac the Mac store, right? He left it there He didn't pay for a service It was unpaid and he left it there, right? The owner contacted him multiple times Over the course of 90 days, right? To gay come get your laptop more importantly pay me for my services and hunter Biden never did Now he signed a document that was an agreement between the laptop store and hunter Biden saying that hey any property left after 90 days Unpaid becomes my property So He's like hunter Biden is now suing all these people saying they used his information like no, that's no longer yours You've abandoned it. It's gone, right? Which which is another reason why none of this stuff is really sticking in court But these gun charges are coming up. They're saying that the trials and all of this stuff probably won't get going until Right in the heat of the election cycle So that'd be very very interesting to see how that plays out. I think they're gonna drop Biden before before then It feels that way you know, it feels like the whole left media is starting to turn on Joe Biden um You know, I've said this on the show many many times We have to understand what Joe Biden's role has been his role was not to come in and lead the country to a great place And you know unite the country which is what he can campaign on it's not by nomics. It's not any of this shit Here's what his role was his role was to come in Do all the terrible shit That needed to be done to destroy this country open the borders keep him open shut down the oil production shut down or uh fuel Independence Allow the crime in the in the big cities to go crazy to do all these things right send all of our taxpayers money to Ukraine Because had we had someone who was competent or had we had someone who appeared to be competent The things that Joe Biden has done would have been revolted against and the only grace that he's being given right now Is that he's old and seen out and potentially just stupid when in reality. He's not stupid at all He's running the play as he's Having the play dictated to him to run because we all know he's not running shit This guy's not sitting in the back making decisions. There's nothing going on with this guy This guy is a scapegoat He's a pawn to serve a purpose to get as much damage as possible So that there wouldn't be a revolt because people will say well. He's just stupid. He's just old He's just seen aisle. You know, we got to get him out of here because he he's so he you know shits his pants or whatever embarrassing stuff This guy has done and If we had a competent person in here doing making these decisions, it would be very clear to everybody that the person Who was competent making these decisions was actually acting against the interest of our country as a whole So yeah, so like this is he's played his role like he's done all the bad shit He's done all made all the decisions that need to be made to to destroy and demoralize and start to destabilize this country From a communist standpoint which then he's tight. Well, how you know Joe Biden's a comment? Well, he's taken millions and millions and millions of dollars allegedly from China from our biggest fucking enemy So what are we talking about here? This is we are occupied. We've been occupied. He's not compromised He's a fucking trader. That's real shit. It's real shit Nick. I want to get you your your take this man. You know as a veteran right You took an oath to defend this country right against all enemies foreign and domestic What is your view on from you know How long has it been since you've been Well, since you went in what you know 15 years now 2010 is when I went in okay, so 13 years. Yeah um What what what was your perception then of the state of the union why you were going in what you were fighting for Comparative what you see now where what what what's the difference where you where were you at then where were you at now When I joined man, I wasn't really in for the the politics. I wasn't really in for that It was like fighting for the dudes that the people that I loved um So I mean, I guess as a guy on the ground sometimes it's more so About the fight. It's more about like the dudes to the left and you're right And then once you start moving up in the ranks. It's like oh wow like politics like the the big guys and in the big house have a lot to say with what we do Because when you're overseas and you're targeting bad guys you're actually doing the job In different countries you have to have different levels of approval to go do offensive operations And there are several levels of approval that go straight up to the big dogs at the White House and There are Certain instances where there's like obvious bad shit going on and you're like I need to go take care of this And they fucking turn you down and it's like we're just letting terrorists walk around on the streets over there as well As here in the states and it's it's bleeding over And it shows man and it's like I mean I joined under the Obama administration and then in 2016 Trump was elected and it was actually pretty wild because like our pay increased our equipment got better We actually got like my whole team finally got outfitted with certain gear that we had been missing forever and then 2020 happens and it's like where did the missions go where are we what are we doing now like what the fuck is happening And Once I got removed from that it's like now I still continue to see like it's like a downfall and in special operations Like they're still doing work, but it's it's kind of sad to see like the levels of approval that have to happen to just kill one bad guy That's doing an obviously bad fucking thing Um So I never reached like a very like high level in the staff positions to get involved into politics, but it was um I mean you could definitely see it when we're out there trying to fight and it's like what do you mean? I have to get a fucking general level of approval to drop a bomb on this guy for Doing it's not bad or I have to let him go right yeah And it's like who else is he gonna like How many other levels like it's everything has a second third order effect and it's like I learned about that at a young age And it's just like you do one thing that could literally trickle and cause so many different fucking Waves and it's like you let one bomb maker go and now it's like now you're killing several other Americans or you're fucking Like now this dude is gonna train somebody who's gonna go into the United States and do something fucking bad there And it's just like I don't know man like it's hard Um To really understand like what you're fighting for at times because it's like You want to say that it's it's for the dude to the left and you're right and then it's like you're over there fighting and then You get called to either do something fucking weird or go watch something specific and it's like I don't know um Sometimes it's a little a lot of dissect you yeah Yeah A lot of guys feel that way bro a lot of guys who have served over the last you know 20 years 23 years The same the same thing man even even more you know like a lot of these guys It's talking to Greg Anderson A lot of these guys feel like they served for The actual bad guys and like that would be a that's that's a hard thing. I think for a lot of people to deal with you know um I see I hear it all the time though. I mean like you Either openly like Greg will post about it openly. That's why I don't mind saying it but You know a lot of guys will say it privately Yeah That's what shit man. It's just it's it's sad to see that like I don't feel like this is the same America that you know those guys have fought for 20 years or I think it's I think it's a I think an important question for us to actually ask is did that other America ever actually exist? Was that even real well? That's what I'm saying because the only reason that we know what's actually going on now is because The internet so how much easier would it have been to hide the actual narratives when the internet didn't exist and just convince everybody here that everything We did was noble and just and right when in reality we don't know if that's the case or not Yeah, that's real shit. Yeah That's real All right, well, I mean, we'll we'll stay updated. I mean like I said this this Hunter Biden indictment just came down. We'll see what happens with that um But uh Guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you think Hashtag don't drop the soap. That's what we're hoping for so That's uh, let's let's keep growing man. We got our final segment of the show guys as always We have our thumbs up or dumb as fuck.
