your weeks yeah what'd you do this week Ed black people shit me too all right man let's get into a better start the week off right with some with three good ones you gotta say it the right way I got three good ones for you all right bro yeah I'm ready now let's not get out of the trigger phrase it is getting the zone until you say it gotta have that trigger that's right yeah that's right all right man that's any question number one hey Andy how do you keep a level mindset when you see people getting ahead by using shady business practices and cheating the system I'm a full time stay at home mom and business owner my husband also works full time and runs his business on the side we are a typical middle class family struggling to make an honest living we keep the mindset that honest hard work will pay off but it's difficult when I am with my extended family I have a cousin who's my age who is constantly bragging about family vacations new cars on their home etc they have lied to get government benefits these bankruptcies to get out of debt and have been known to still for employers without getting caught I know that in the long run I am instilling values work ethic and skills into my kids worth more than the toys and clothes they they give their kids I want to use this as fuel from a fire rather than being discouraged by it I'm pretty sure you see plenty of competitors using shady practices to get ahead how do you mentally use that as fuel to keep running an honest business well look I understand this question I mean I think all business owners go through this you know we look at other people and how they're doing things and that always are they doing things the right way and a lot of times they're doing things as mentioned in an unethical way and it's frustrating because we see them getting ahead and when I was new in business that was a problem for me because I didn't have the experience to understand what eventually happens to these people and what eventually happens to these people is their little scams their little corner cutting their little you know fucking unethical practices will catch up with them and they will end up losing all that they have I've never seen that work out not a single time where someone who was doing things in a quick easy fast cheating unethical way win long term I've just never seen it and um it's very frustrating dude I totally get the frustration because we live in this day and age where everybody's online and everybody's bragging and everybody's making their lives look like they're way cooler than they are and they're winning way bigger than they are and dude it's demoralizing if you like really concentrate on it but dude let me give you some advice man those people are going to come and go and after they go there's going to be a new rounder those people that come and go and after they go there's going to be a new round and there's always going to be these people because the reality is is that most people believe that success is built by unethical behavior you know if we go back to the stories that are told by a lot of people we've all heard people say well look at that guy he's wealthy but like he he fucked these people over or agree yeah look at this guy he's doing this this way and so we have this in culture this mentality of if you're winning you must be cheating and that's just not reality and I'm gonna explain why now 20 30 40 years ago that was possible but it's not possible anymore for someone to win long term you have to do business the right way you have to treat people right you have to have good practices that doesn't mean you're going to be perfect it means you have to genuinely be good and have the intent of being good and then when you fuck up you have to fix it here's why 30 years ago there was no internet all right and this is where this mentality comes from 30 40 50 60 years ago all there was was radio television and print media that was it so companies could cheat people and there was no way for the consumer to voice their dissatisfaction or let it be known that these companies were behaving this way and then when the internet came around it actually changed the game in a very good way and I know I can play in a lot about the internet but this is a really good thing that has happened in the internet what happened is is we gave the consumer a voice to criticize or tell the truth about the way that they were being treated as consumers and so overnight and it's continued to become more transparent over time customers were able to communicate with every single person they know instantly all right and that changed the dynamic of business and what that did was that create an environment where you have to serve customers you have to do the right thing you have to be who you say you are you have to deliver what you say you're going to deliver in order to operate a business so doing the right thing and caring about your customers became the way that business had to be done and so if we look at businesses who have become successful longer than a one hit wonder over the course of the last 20 years those people have to be who they say they are otherwise everybody knows instantly right it doesn't take a long time for a few customers to be saying the same thing and then all of a sudden it's everywhere and everybody's like well fuck them right that's a real easy thing to happen and it happens every day and so not even to mention the laws and shit that are put in place to keep businesses and check it in line and for sure but the main thing is just word amount it's the it's it's the availability and the transparency that's created by the internet that creates either positive or negative word of mouth and if you're out there fucking people guess what there's going to be negative word of mouth and it's going to spread instantly and you're not going to have a business anymore so that old idea that like this rich guy that you see is fucking people it's actually impossible all right for long term long term in short term one two three four years for sure people can get away with it but eventually those people will crumble they will go away and they'll be replaced by new people who still don't understand it because they're in a hurry to make the money all they carry about as the money and they think they can fool enough customers but bro i'm going to tell you this a pond only has so many fish in it and the internet is very quick to let the information be known about who's doing things right and who's doing things wrong and you can't escape it it's just the way things are so you know long way around to answer this question is you shouldn't pay attention to those people you should focus on what it is that you're doing you should focus on being the absolute best of what you do and playing the long game instead of the get rich quick game and you're going to come out on top and not only are you going to come out on top you're not going to be rich you're going to become wealthy because the money that you're making will compound over the course of time because you're doing things the right way which attracts more word of mouth which brings more customers into your funnel does that make sense okay so so dude you guys have to ignore this shit you know like especially in the entrepreneur space we have all these people that are pretending to be all these things that they actually aren't and you know we see them we see them come we see them go we see new ones come up we see new ones go and these guys think that they you know are are the new deal that's going to change the rules and it's not going to apply to them and it always does bro we always see these people come and then we see them go and if you think that those people are your competition or someone that you need to be comparing yourself to you're you're wrong you should be comparing yourself to the people who have been running real companies the right way over the course of the long term paying attention to what they do and then focusing on doing it right and you're going to have sustainability you're going to have endurance you're going to have the ability to compound money over the course of time which is going to make you wealthy and and and these people are going to be broke eventually so your cousin or whoever the fuck that is bro I promise you sooner than later they are going to get caught up in their bullshit and it's going to crumble them and that's reality that's the way it works I wouldn't worry about it I would start looking at people who have done it the right way and try to emulate them and even be better than them yeah one thing this should maybe think about it's like like it doesn't matter how advanced we are society how more they get like there's always going to be pieces of shit always and so like you're maybe just think because it's like what breed is one of the biggest drivers right right and that's what we say like outside of just being a piece of shit a stupid like you know you mentioned that is greed that like I would think like man fuck like they wouldn't realize that like you know we're in that like day and age where people can fucking yeah I talk like that yeah I'm saying but like they still do it yeah well that's because bro mostly people are low IQ their scammers they're fucking not thinking long term they think today you know they're trying to win the attention game on the internet it is what the fuck it is I mean it's just always existed there's always been hucksters there's always been thieves there's always been unethical people in business and if you could compare yourself your long term game to their short term flashing the pan wins you're gonna be frustrated so it's the best time to pay attention and consider them something else they are something else those are scammers those are unethical people they're not gonna last and you know we see this happen all the time bro if you pay attention you'll see people go up and then go right back down and it happens quick now whereas before the internet it would take a long time right for a company to destroy the reputation pre-internet pre-social media that could take years because I had a bad experience and then I don't see you DJ until two weeks later because there's no internet so we're not talking on the internet and by the time I see you I've already forgotten about the getting fucked over so something would have to happen to bring the conversation up whereas people will now they just they just tell what like hey I dealt with this company and they fucked me here's what happened and then at that point in time you know you can either as a company address that issue and try to fix it or you know hope for the best but I just give you a little free game here that's not on the question usually when you fix those problems for people that are vocal they become bigger advocates for you because they are vocal so you know don't shy away from solving problems when people genuinely have problems now some people yes they're just there to stir shit but in most cases they're not most people just are good people and they want to be taken care of they want to be treated right they want to be respected for the money they spend with their company and your goal should be to over-deliver so much value that they have no problem spending money with you they're actually proud of it they actually go around and they say dude this is the brand I use because they've they've been treerite and they can take to use of it exactly yeah yeah now let me actually then this might be more of like a philosophical question on business but I thought it's an interest in topics so like you know in entrepreneurship in your experience would you agree that there is like a natural order like social Darwinism aspect to entrepreneur and I accept because you know we talk about like you know there's always going to be these pieces of shit right like and and what's even worse or I guess more unfortunate is like there's always going to be people that fucking follow them and buy that shit do you think that like that relationship like that aspect of entrepreneurship it's almost necessary to weed out yeah I do I think that people like nobody talks about listen no it's real shit and like because everybody's quick to point at a scammer but they're not quick to admit that they wanted the quick rich too and that's why they bought it so really a lot of these people want what these people have and they're not willing to put in the work long term but then when they don't get what they want they point and they say oh this guy did that when reality they wanted to be that guy so yes 100% dude this is why I say over and over and over again you know entrepreneurship is hard entrepreneurship is not for everybody it's not what the internet makes it out to be bro it's very brutal it's very competitive it's very harsh and it's just not what people make it to be bro you have to be built for it or you have to build yourself into the person that can handle that and that takes a lot of work that takes time it takes you know getting acclimated it's kind of like getting in a cold plunge the first time it's like oh fuck but after you do it every day for a year it ain't no big deal you get right in so it's entrepreneurship's the same way bro you're gonna show up you're gonna get your ass beat and as long as you show up the next day when you get beat the next day it's gonna hurt a little less and the beings never go away you just get used to them and and uh you know this whole idea that entrepreneurship is you know I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna have all this time bullshit bro that's a lie you know that's not how the fuck it works it works like this you answer to all your fucking customers and if you want to keep your business long term that's going to take attention from you and then it's going to take other skills like building a team that's effective you know there's so many skills that are required to build a company that people don't even think about bro like do you know how to build a team do you know how to create systems do you know how to fucking market do you know how to you know how to hire people fire people do you know how to build a culture do you know how to develop product do you know all this shit most people don't they think they can just buy somebody's fucking bullshit course and all of a sudden they're going to be a gazillionaire and dude I've just never seen it happen it just doesn't happen the only people that become a gazillionaire are the people selling the fucking course and then you know eventually it gets found out that their shit doesn't really work and they lose anyway zero zero now yeah I mean look dude there's no easy way to this if there wasn't easy way everybody with fucking noise just like anything else in life you know we we search for the easy way we want the quick way bro I was no different so so listen this is just real shit my first 10 years or so in business I did not understand what I'm saying now so like if you listen to what I'm saying in this just this one question it'll save you fucking years of your life I thought if you ask most people and you say what's what's the purpose of a business what's your money okay that's not the purpose of a business the purpose of a business is to solve fucking problems and then people trade you money for the solution of the problem all right so like everybody else who says to make money I thought that shit forever too and I thought like hey it's my job to sell this guy to sell this guy to sell this guy to sell this guy and when I did that guess what I never made any money because you know what people did when they left the store they said don't go in there bro they're gonna fucking do this in this okay so I never grew company never grew I got 10 years into the company and I started you know I started to realize holy shit this isn't the way and I had some events happen in my life you guys have heard me talk about it where I considered other careers and I decided to go back into what we were doing which was nutritional supplement retail because we enjoyed helping people because every once in a while over that first 10 years we would actually help someone instead of sell them they would come in they'd hang out for a couple hours because we didn't have any customers because we were selling everybody instead of helping them and those people would come back after like five six seven months and they'd be a different fucking human bro and they're crying they're giving you a hug they're saying thank you kind of like all the people that come through the building now right everybody so we we kind of discovered that and we decided this is Chris and I hey all right we might not ever become wealthy and rich or a baller or whatever but I really like that that was that was cool so we decided that we were going to commit ourselves to producing that result and after we committed ourselves to producing that result all the sudden we started making a lot of money because people were leaving they were saying dude they're solving my problem go in you know talk to these guys they're good guys this and all the business fucking exploded we grew a hundred percent five years in a row okay so that's how I learned this lesson and if you listen this should one lesson this one fucking lesson not only will it save you 10 years of your life but it will cover every product you ever buy from me from first form it will cover every fucking seminar and will cover every fucking thing that I've ever do and if you come to it this will be work that one question will save you will you'll come out ahead because it'll save you fucking years of your life and make you millions of dollars so I love it man yeah well guys any question number two let's talk about them early years of business Andy Andy when you when you started to get traction in your business and become more successful did you create did you have any sort of checklist per se that you use to field friends I feel like when I started my company I've had five really solid friends when I started to get a little bit of what they saw a success I lost a couple of people but now I feel like so many people are trying to create friendships with me either for discounts or they are self-serving I run a clothing company that sells online and in stores I have been in business for about five years and this has been a problem that has been increasing each year I'm not sure how to field these people thanks man love the show how do you feel field people field friends well I don't have any new friends at this point in my life I don't I don't make new friends because at this point in my life where I'm at it's impossible to know someone's motive as to why they want to be friends with me I can't know like it's impossible I assume everybody has a motive that's right safe and they do so I don't I don't have unless they got their own shit and they got their own success no new friends because everybody wants something from you and that's just reality and it sounds harsh it sounds mean but it's real and it gets worse the better you get the more successful you get so I can certainly understand the question the reality is this the group of friends as an entrepreneur the group of friends that you have in the beginning are not going to be your group of friends as you move on yes one or two might stay and you might be great friends and you might be casual friends I'm not saying you're going to be like enemies but you're going to want to surround yourself with people who are on the same path as you because your old friends they're going to you know are you sure about this uh you know you need to be careful I think you're I think you're getting out over your skis a little bit you know don't remember or don't forget where you come from they're gonna always be planting these little seeds of fucking bullshit in your brain and so the reality of friendship is that when you leave your first friend group you're going to move towards a new friend group but that new friend group is a ways away once you get success so start getting success so what happens is is you end up spending a lot of time alone and I call that area of life no man's land because you feel like you're alone and this is where the saying it's lonely at the top comes from it's not lonely at the top bro it's lonely in the middle so we have to understand that when you start to get success yes you're going to lose friends but if you keep going you're going to gain new friends who are on the same path and those people aren't gonna put doubt in your brain they're not gonna question you they're actually gonna say how can I help how can we work together how can we push further because they're aligned with what you're trying to do with your life and these people that you knew from back in the day they're not necessarily on the same path as you that doesn't mean you can't be casual friends with them but you're probably not gonna be as close and so most people when they go through this process which is exactly where this person is they will start to feel lonely and what'll happen is is they'll go back to their old friend group they won't keep going because they're like fuck dude I don't have any friends I'm not around anybody but the reality is they're just not going far enough because when you go far enough you you meet new people you network with new friends they they have the same path as you and those people will help you win and then if you continue to go down the path you'll move beyond that friend group even and move to a different one and this is just the way that I've seen it work and it's so you know how do I vet friends I mean bro I just look back then I would just look for people who are aligned with what I was trying to do but at this point now I don't I don't really consider new friends like quote unquote new friends first of all I don't have time second of all and let's say have their own shit going on I can't really trust what their motives are so I don't I don't do it this is why you know you guys don't see me out doing a whole bunch of shit with a whole bunch of people because you know people want shit from you you know what I mean so that's just a reality of doing business but but I would tell you this um you're not going to be alone I the friends I have now even though there's fewer friends are much better friends because they understand what I'm trying to do they understand my motivation they don't judge me for what I'm trying to do and when they can they help me get where I'm trying to go and you're your friends from high school and college and back in the day they're not going to do that because they're not on the same path it's not that they're mean they don't know any better and they're not interested in that shit because they're interested in other shit so my answer is basically uh let it organically happen and then you know if you really want to vet who you become friends with make sure they're on the same path as you not necessarily in the same industry but they have ambitions they have drive they're growing something because another thing about being friends with people that are not entrepreneurs is they don't understand the time commitment that it takes and they don't understand that you're working all the time you know the average per-hapio we're bro that's right and they don't understand they take it personal when you say no I can't make it they're live on and it takes these two good for us now no bro I'm working on my shit and the life of an entrepreneur you know we can we see all these memes and all these people giving advice on the internet but the reality is is if you look at their life the way they're making money is off of leads that they're getting on their fucking social media and that really building anything real so these people don't know either you know what I mean and we have to be aligned with people we have to be in the same boat with people in terms of where we're going for us to even get along and they have to understand it so being friends with people who have their own shit going on who don't take it personally whenever you know you can't call them back right away or you can't text them back right away like all my friends bro like they might text me or I might text them I might not hear back from them for a fucking week you know what I mean like and I don't care I don't like nobody takes it personal but if you do that to like one of your old friends back in the day how do they react oh dude with the fuck I text you listen man no offense but I ain't worried about you I'm worried about what the fuck I got going on and that's how I would you know that's how I run the play and yeah I mean I you're gonna lose people you're gonna gain new people though if you keep going and those people are gonna help push you they're gonna help you succeed and they're not gonna put seeds of doubt in mine which is super important because this is hard enough as it is I love it I love it guys Andy question number three Andy I'm 25 years old I'm an entrepreneur and I've been working for this company for about five going on six years I've done well for myself so far but I was having an honest conversation with my boss the other day about my goals um in and outside of the company and where I saw myself in three to five years there wasn't a super formal like it wasn't a formal conversation but a deep conversation in the list anyway one thing he told me was that I lacked consistency he said I get these massive waves of forward progress followed by low tides of inconsistency and loss of focus and that should be something I work on in order to move up in the company well I kind of see what he means I feel like I kill it when I'm up but I don't see the downs or low tides like that but I will take the feedback my question is what exactly can I do to build more consistency like I never thought it was a skill or really looked at it like a skill now anything on this will help for sure dude look let me give you my perspective as someone who has employed thousands of people and currently employs thousands of people um look I have the saying that I use with people and it goes like this get hot stay hot okay and the reason that you have to get hot and stay hot is because you never know when your opportunity is coming you never know when we're sitting over there in the room and we're like bro we need the next person to do this and this and this and I'm going to tell you right now we don't pick the motherfucker who's losing we picked the person who's winning right now and if we have someone who is inconsistent and they go up and they go down and they go up and they go down we know that we can't pick that person because we know it's only a matter of a time before they fucking go down so the things that organizations look for are people who can get hot and stay hot for a long time and so when you say oh I'm crushing it when I'm up you have to be up all the time if you want to move up in your career and how do you do that well you have to systematically make sure that you win the day every single day and that you're operating at a high standard which is where you know the powerless system that that I've developed that I've used for years and years and years would you can get for free at episode 16 on the real AF audio feed is such an effective system because it doesn't allow for you to have dips it doesn't allow for you to go down and you have to figure out how you're going to stay at the top of the game so that when that conversation happens and that opportunity happens which you don't know when that's going to happen you have no fucking idea you have no idea okay it's no different than you dressing nice 50% of the time and like a slab 50% of the time and then expecting to meet someone that you want to have a romantic relationship with it's a crapshoot okay what if you meet that that's your dream girl and you're dressed in your fucking flip flops and you haven't washed your hair and you look like shit you're not going to have a fucking chance okay she was there right yeah that's right and you fucking lost it because you didn't fucking brush your teeth that morning all right so we have to look at it like that you don't know when the opportunity's coming and the opportunity is going to come at a time that you know you can't predict so what does that mean that means you have to be operating at high level all the time to get the opportunities and people who consistently move up as entrepreneurs inside of a company they are very consistent in operating at a high standard because that's what the ownership and the management team is going to look for and a lot of people will say oh they picked their favorites yeah they do you know who their favorites are the motherfuckers who win all the time that's why they picked them because those are their favorites because they don't have to fucking remind them or they don't have to coach them like they don't have to say oh man you could do this and put this belief in them they already believe in their fucking self-starters and they're taking initiative and they're going hard on their own those are the people that win those are the people that end up in executive roles those are the people that get paid big money in organizations and the guy who goes up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down they end up getting frustrated and then they go to the next place and they go up and down and up and down and up and down and they don't work out there and then they go up and down and up and down at the third place and you know what they know saying these people all fucking hate me nobody likes me and they make up this shit that isn't even true when in reality bro it's your performance that's not consistent so get hot stay hot be ready for the opportunity at all times and when the opportunity comes you're gonna be the first name out of the fucking mouth and that's how that works so you know you can't coast you can't come in you're not hiding a lot of people think that they hide right oh they don't notice that I'm taking off a couple months you did really good that's right they get one fucking streak of winning and then they they hang their hat on that forever like bro I don't give a shit that you won last year what you do between that and now right what did you do yesterday what are you doing now what are you gonna do tomorrow and I have to predict what you're gonna be able to do tomorrow based upon what you've been doing and that's how the decisions are made and you know people think all different kinds of things about how decisions are made they think it's their gender or their race or their this or their that any company any fucking company that wins picks the winners they don't give a fuck how who what gender they are or if they're gay or if they're fucking you know different they don't care they don't fucking care they want to win winning is hard we're putting the best players on the field the people that can be counted on and that's how the fuck it works it's very simple and you could tell yourself any story you want to tell yourself but any story other than that is bullshit it's just the truth yeah so let me actually just on consistency I mean because it's also it sounds like a momentum issue right mm-hmm like so so in your opinion what what's hard is it hard to create the momentum or is it harder to keep it well I think it's harder to create it I think people I think most people don't know that they can't create it I think most people are oblivious to the fact that they can create momentum I think most people believe that momentum is this magical force that they sometimes have and they sometimes don't have they they think of it like the wind sometimes the wind's blowing sometimes the wind's not blowing and that's just not reality bro what actually creates momentum is forcing yourself through day after day after day in the beginning until you catch steam and then momentum carries you throughout the way so as long as you're doing these things that you did when it was hard when you have the momentum you're gonna keep keep the momentum going and everything that you do all winners understand this they will do everything to keep momentum because it's so hard to create like they will miss dinners they will miss vacations they will fucking do whatever the fuck they have to do to keep the momentum going because they understand how hard it is to create if they're aware that they understand that it's created not caught right so you know yeah it's harder to create it but it's also and it's much easier to maintain it and as long as you're continuing to do the things that allowed you to create it whenever you have it you move that much faster so but yeah most people don't fucking understand that momentum is created it's not some magical force that just exists bro like it's a result of your own actions and once you start to understand that and take responsibility for creating the momentum in your life things get a lot easier and it becomes easy to maintain that high standard it becomes easier to do those things that you know keep you hot whenever the opportunity is going to show up so you know that's that I love it man I love it and get onto the boss here man just huh I want to say the boss is telling the truth bro yeah like look man you may not feel that way but they feel that way and when I say stay high I don't mean pretty good I mean you're fucking dominating dude because we want to win right and we have to have the best players in the best position this is no different than NFL like a business is the most competitive environment that you could possibly comprehend it's more competitive than sports it's more competitive than anything that exists because there's so many of them and it's low barrier to entry to get in so you have to be undeniably better than everybody else and that means you have to be good all the time and if as a company if you do this right you go up and you go down when you go down somebody else is up and you lose your fucking shit so that's how that goes they're going to another thing another thing that can affect this is people's ego you know a lot of times when people do good and they hit one of those hot streaks they start to think it's them they they don't think like oh man I did all these things and it got me to go to here they think like fuck look how good I am right and so there's this natural up and down that looks like a wave that people have because of their ego when they start at the bottom they know they don't know shit so they go to someone like a manager or a leader they learn what to do they do the thing perfectly right and then all of a sudden they start to produce results and after they've been producing results for a while usually what'll happen is they'll start to believe that they as a human being are just blessed with the minus touch and they're great and they're amazing and then they stop doing the things that put them there and they and they start to do other things because they believe that they're good and this is the hubris of the ego and what happens is they start to go back down and when they go back down they don't know why they're going down they're like fuck dude I hit a slow streak they don't realize it's a result of them not continuing to do the things that they did to get there and so what happens is they go down they go down they go down they get back to the bottom and they finally humbled themselves and they say fuck I got to get collected here and start over so they go back to the basics and guess what happens they start to go up again and most people will follow this pattern of up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down over the course of their career thinking that is just the momentum coming and going and coming and going when if they truly pay attention it's actually them believing in themselves a little too much as opposed to them believing that their current position is a result of the work that they did you see what I'm saying I love it that's a fucking Monday for you guys yeah I have the ending that was three all right guys let's get out there let's kick ass I see you tomorrow on CTI
