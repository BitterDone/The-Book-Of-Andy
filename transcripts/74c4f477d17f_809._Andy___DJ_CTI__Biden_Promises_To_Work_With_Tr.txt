Don't be ho. Share the show. What's up? What's going on man? Nothing dude. I'm just so excited to get into it. I remember the intro. Yep. Yep. That's fine. It's fine man. It's good man. Dude, they're listening. What we obviously got a lot to cover. There's a bunch of stuff out there happening man but like. Dude, the air, like it smells cheaper already man. Yeah. Feels lighter. Yeah. Like it just streets are cleaner. That's what I'm saying. Like it just skies bluer. We just just feels let's gay. Titties are bigger. You know what I'm saying? What? America feels let's gay right now man. Yeah. It feels more here. All right. So anyway. Sounds a little brighter dude. It just, you know, like I mean listen like I mean this and obviously we'll get into it because I still do have some concerns. I know you do as well. We'll get to those. But it just like it just feels different man. Yep. You know, like I can feel my utility bills just going down all right. The crash score going up. Yeah. Well, I mean Trump still got to do some shit on that. Yeah. But it's starting. It's starting man and it feels fucking I feel like the jokes are getting funnier bro. We got Syed. He's going to get a new job under Trump administration. He hasn't decided if you could take it or not. They're going project 2025 is a year not affiliated with that. No, man. We got some good stuff though guys. That's before we get to our headlines. But I wanted to bring this in. You know, there's, you know, I think. When we see these people that have these shows and stuff, right, whether it be podcasts, the mainstream media, right? Like, you know, I, there is a difference like sense of appreciation. I have it's a tough job to do. You know, like you have to, you got cameras in front of you. You know, you're trying to do your best to deliver a great product. You got to be handsome. You got to look good. You got to look good. You got to talk good. You got to have a face for radio. That's right. You know, and it's just like, you know, it's a difficult thing. It's not, it's not super easy to be good. Listen, man. It's, I know it gets real in the streets. Pretty me. Yeah, I'm just saying like real, real in the podcast and YouTube or world, bro, it's real shit, dangerous. Uh-huh. Yeah. All right. I forgot you don't know about the streets. I don't, I don't want to know about that. Well, they don't wait real quick. First, we'll get to the trolls. I got a bunch of those. But fuck, man, the shade room. They have, they have a massive bot system on the shade room. I saw that last night. It's each of the comments that comment you made. Yeah, bro, all I said was warm, warm. You know what I'm saying? And we got mad, bro. And this one lady she was like, that's why you a house nigga. And so I told her, I'm like, yeah, well, at least I got recognition in you in the fields. It's how to fuck out there. I'm just so excited, man. We're like, I feel it, man. But anyways, you know, it is a difficult job to do. And you got to, you know, there's just sense that you got to deliver your best at all times. And sometimes it does not happen. No. And sometimes there's slip ups and Brett bear apparently had a big slip up. Oh, he did. Yeah, he did. What do you do? He fucking farted on live TV. I really, I literally Fox News host mercilessly, merciless, mercilessly, I'm slipping up mercilessly. My after viewers hear suspicious noise during election coverage. So viewers to Fox News election coverage on Tuesday night caught wind of an unusual sound as the votes were being counted. I miss this. I don't know. It's real though, because like there's been multiple people sharing like different perspective clips. Well, fuck, dude, what's he going to do? Holding in a shit hurts. I've been known to let one go here. Here and there. Yeah. And, but yeah, so I said about one hour into the marathon broadcast coverage. Viewers heard what seemed to be the sound of a put pundits flatulence of the literal kind. He says, despite the serious nature of the topic at hand, several watchers posted the short sharp sound to social media. Yeah, video. Here we got a video, man. So so here it is. The audio has been in the attempt to lean forward and right method. Method to spread the cheeks, but the technique failed him. Man, you know what? It does. It doesn't always work, man. It doesn't always work. Sometimes you think it's going to be silent and you think you get away with it and your your booty betray betrays you. And then the other times you like, fuck, I'm not the room, the whole room. And it's just like, yeah, yeah. Yeah, but then you kill everybody with the smell. Why is it the loud ones don't really smell that bad? But the silent ones were fucking kill people lubricate it with with gas. What is it? It's like, it's, I don't know, man. I don't know, but yeah, I mean, we got the real is no one I fucking do. Like one of those real silent ones. I start moving around. But I want to get caught. I move across the room. Bro, you were here something fucked up. The worst is when you're like over it. Like because you know how we train the middle of the day. It's like one or two people in there. Sometimes like I like to fart when I'm training, bro. And what? It can only be one of us in this fucking room. We know. No, no, no, but here's what happens. So these dudes come, the people will come through and they're like, Hey, man, come what's up? Can I get a pick and I just fucking let it rip? And so I'm like, yeah, let's go over here. My flag. I'm not a lighting guy. Like she's over here in this part. Hey, man, it is what it is. I'm not trying to be uncomfortable. You know, here's some fucked up, man. I'm going to put my wife on blast. How many people you kill with your farts? Oh, what's your body count? I don't, I don't. I know Joe's almost fucking had been rushed out of here before. He's in the direct line of fire. Man, listen, bro, we need a new studio where you just stop back there. That's this is workers liability, man. It's dangerous. So what it is. Well, listen, my wife's going to have to get Joe's special suit. But my wife, listen, Alex is going to be pissed at this, but I got to tell it because it's fucking amazing. So one time, Alex and I were in IKEA, okay. And we're walking through our key and shit and, you know, we're looking at stuff. And there's this like little eight year old kid, okay. And all of a sudden, I smell the worst possible fucking smell. I could have ever fucking smelled, okay. And I look, bro, I got pissed and I looked at this little kid and I went the fuck off on. I said, you're nasty as shit. Listen, I swear to God, dude, I was pissed because it smelled so bad. I said, you are fucking nasty. Oh, you just, you just shit your pants right here, bro. He's just like looking at me, right? Now walk off. You know, black kid or white kid? You look like white kid, man. So you're just angry black bad. No, it's fucking like, bro, it smells, imagine the worst fucking smell of fart and shit and multiply that. Okay. It was bad. We go to check out, get in the car and stuff and like Alex saw the interaction. Oh, yeah. She didn't say not no. She knew it was her. It was fucking her. And I'm like, you made me fucking go off on this little fucking kid. And it was, yeah. Anyways, yeah. But yeah, one of these comments may replay turtle. What's that? You know the game turtle? No. What's the game turtle? You know the game turtle? It's where you pull the blanket over over the head and you fart and whoever sticks their head out first is the turtle. Oh, no, I'll be called that. Fuck. Dude, fuck. Fuck dude. That's fucking wrong. That's fucking wrong. That's cute. No, I don't know. Yeah, that's wrong. Fuck, dude. We might get trolling for that one, bro. Oh, dude. Well, all right. It's been fun, guys. I'm just seeing where the pendulum's at. I guess we are going to jail. You know, we just see where it's at. But yeah, this, this one guy, he commented to me. I got the clip. This guy, Grumpy Coppy said, did Bret Hume just shit his pants on my TV? I thought you said it was Bret. It's Bret Bear. Fox News. Well, I've been keeping an eye on this issue that was raised in our filler analysis. It's said to fully amp of all voter says the future democracy is the most important factor in the vote. It's a big number. Dude, you missed it. No, I heard it. I saw the ladies react to it. The ladies on the side of it. Yeah. Go back again. Well, I've been keeping an eye on this issue that was raised in our filler analysis. It's said to fully amp. This is most important. Bro, she looked right at him. Well, this is what I said. Oh, gee, I thought I was just hearing things. Ha, ha, ha, glad I'm not the only one. No way. But I thought the same damn thing. I was like, oh, my fucking God. He just ripped a huge one. Yeah, I mean, everybody caught it. So yeah, I mean, yeah, listen, I mean, shit happens. It does. You know, slip up happens. No beans before the broadcast. The lean and right. I didn't know that was an actual tactic. Oh, come on. Don't lie. I don't know. I don't know if anybody knows that. Yeah, sure. All right. Well, hey, listen, dude, wife's response room. Dude, wife's, there you go, bro. Perfect opportunity. Yeah. Hey, let me get endorsement, man. Yeah. Get endorsement. Well, let's get into our headlines, man. Guys, remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find them all linked there with that being said. Hell on. Number one. Hell on number one. Let's talk about it. You got Biden, Biden promises to work with Trump and tells the nation to come together after Kamala Harris is defeat. So Joe Biden, he's just, he's spoken to dress the nation. This is the first public appearance addressing the nation since Kamala took over. So we're talking about two, two, three months there. Pretty decent amount of time. I'm going to address as a nation. President Joe Biden promised to work with Donald Trump to secure a peaceful transition and urge the country to come together. And as he broke his silence on the election, he says, quote, I will do my duty as president. I'll fulfill my oath and I will honor the Constitution on January 20th. We will, we'll have a peaceful transition of power here in America. He said, now what was interesting. And I think we alluded to this yesterday. You know, we obviously got some buddies and friends and places. The entire time he was up there speaking, bro. He seemed fucking happy. Oh, yeah. He seemed really like really happy. Like he was smiling the entire time from the Rose Garden and his appearance. The outgoing president told the nation to be positive and accept the devastating results for Democrats after his vice president, Kamala Harris ran a quote, inspiring campaign. It's firing to who? Yeah, I know she called fucking 60, 70% of the country racist, bigots, misogynists, Nazis. Who the, I'm like, who the fuck are in her campaign? Hey, this is a good idea. Go up there and call fucking most of the country Nazis. Who's that? She and run a fucking inspired. And now not cute. Glorilla. Yeah, like super inspired. Yeah, super inspired. Now do the chant. Yeah, right. Right. And nobody's going to do now pretend to make phone calls. Now laugh. Yeah, bro. Like the fuck out of here. It's inspiring. You know, but obviously the country's in a much different place. I think even than just a week ago, I think honestly, like, you know, them announcing who the new president elect is. It's going to reveal some things. And obviously we got a lot of time ahead of us. You know, but it is interesting. Because, you know, as this stuff is happening, they keep kind of revealing themselves. And just how out of touch with Americans, like, like just how out of touch they actually are. Yeah, a lot of people on the internet too. You know, and so it's like, you know, I got this clip. We got to go back to MSNBC Joe Scarborough again, just show it. Yeah, Dilbert showing like how fucking just out of touch he is with Americans and really where Americans are. Let's watch this clip real quick. I want to talk about economy for a second. A few weeks ago, three weeks ago, somebody who was going to be voting for Kamala Harris, he came up to me and said, oh my God, Trump's going to win. I go, why is that? Because I just, I went to the grocery store, butters over $3. I kind of left and I said, I said, well, that's kind of reductive, isn't it? Said it to myself to him, my smile. And I said, good point. But it actually, everything we're hearing after the election is, it is the seven. What's that? The seven dollars butter is seven dollars. Yeah. What is it framed in gold? Yeah, okay. Anyway, you go. Okay. Well, yeah. Okay. Well, anyway, my point is this, Willie, the red is too damn high. And this guy was saying the cost of butter is way damn too high. Yeah. And so I thought it was a bit reductive. It ended up being the point that if you look at the cost of groceries, if you look at the cost of grass of gas, if you look at the cost of things compared to four years ago, it was a very simple answer for working class Americans. Things has cost too much. Yeah. Yeah. The chart that was showing on the screen here for those of listening, it shows 2020 at 20% and 2024 at 46%, which means based on this chart, that the cost of goods, such as butter, which he's mentioning, is double the price of what it was over double the price of what it was in 2020. And this motherfucker surprised that people voted to fix that. But again, it's people that are so out of touch. This dude doesn't buy his butter. No shit. His wife does. She just said, you know what I'm saying? So it's like a said it's $7. It's $7. Yeah. Well, is it wrapped in gold? No, motherfucker is wrapped in Democrat bullshit. That's right. That's right. Correct. That your economic policies of communism do not make products cheaper. The whole goal is to make it unaffordable. And then for the government, like we covered on the show before, to come in and set up a government owned grocery store that then keeps prices, quote unquote, affordable, which they can't do. So then they start giving out basically what equates to food stamps to trade for goods. And it looks like we're going to avoid this. Thank God. But these people are so financially ignorant and systematically ignorant about how things go. And the reason that they are, brother, is because they never run anything. Like these people, this guy sits there with his $4,000 glasses on and his $10,000 suit. Okay. And his fucking $400 haircut, which looks like shit. Okay. And he, they criticize Americans like their garbage. They literally call him that. All right. They never run a fucking snow cone stand. And they think because they got a degree at some school, they know how things work. That there is a very big difference between theory and application. All right. And reality of application is math. It is fucking math. Okay. So when the math doesn't math, like people can't make enough money to buy food, they don't give a fuck about racism or misogyny or Nazi or whatever other names you're going to fuck call them. They don't care. They're like, well, fuck you. I can't fucking eat. And then you have people, you know, insulting the country over and over and over again, which I mean, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to think like, how are you going to win votes by calling the other side all these fucking names, dude? Well, better question. Like what the, okay, even if you were to win, what the fuck are you going to tell half the fucking country that you just got done calling Nazis and races and all we like you now? You know, I'm saying like, what? Well, what do you do? You know, they have no intention of actually caring about those people. It's they, they tell the truth. They, they told the truth during the campaign. They hate those people. They, those people are useless to them. They are not in their circle. They don't go to fancy dinners. They don't, they don't live these lifestyles that these inner city, you know, liberals live. And like that guy's never pumped a tank of gas. You know what I'm saying? Like that guy's never, the guy's never worked in his yard. I didn't plan on it. Hold on. That guy's never fucking had to like decide and can I put gas in the car or can I get groceries? He's never had to make those decisions ever. And those are decisions at every single American citizen outside of their little group. Unfortunately, he has to make most of the time because the economy is so oppressive financially that we don't allow for the American dream to sprout here. And this is what I was talking about yesterday. If we want this country to be great, we have to be great. But we cannot be great at the soil of the country that we're planting our seeds in is not conducive to growth, meaning it mathematically cannot work. So when these people don't understand that and they act surprised about people voting for, you know, being able to fucking eat, it's like, it's, it's kind of insane. You know, it's, it's not just detached. It's delusional. Yeah. That is man. The other thing too that has been interesting happened around, you know, like, and I've been seeing everybody. I'm sure everybody has been seeing, you know, the fucking left meltdowns, right? They're everywhere. And like, yeah, they, they're, they're funny, right? But I haven't been posting any of that shit because dude, you know what? If we ever want the country to be great, dude, we're going to have to fucking pull together. And there's a lot of reasonable Democrats that, you know, just like we, we see them say that that half the country's shit, you know, when you troll all these people, which I understand can be fun because they abuse the fuck out of our side of things for 15 years. Well, how they won they would have been doing the same thing, bro, would have been way worse. You know, I get, they got to take their licks, but at some point we got to make room for the reasonable common sense people to come over and say, Hey, we're going to make this country great and you're part of it. Right. Now, they're, to that point, and I do agree with you into that point though, you know, this is, this is the problem of, you know, the propaganda machine did not just end. I'm talking about the citizens 100% yeah, 100% but I think something people have to understand is that like the propaganda machine, it's a trillion dollar machine. I'm talking about the mainstream media, right? Like the Hollywood, Hollywood music, it's a massive fucking, that shit did not end November and the fucking fifth. Nope. Didn't it? No, you know, I'm saying, yeah, it's still there. The, the, the black rocks, it's still there. Right. It's still very well in play. Yeah. And the thing is that like, you know, people have to understand is that like, yes, like, I think there is a short amount of time where it's okay to get your lick back, right? Call people fucking dumb, you know, your people I'm leaving fucking leave, right? Yeah. Cool, funny, high high. Yeah. But we have to still be very aware to your point is that like, yeah, we still need unity. We need those fucking people that want to leave because we know they're not leaving nowhere, right? And like, it's well, I don't know if we do need them. I think that the country has spoken in terms of where the majority is. And I think the common sense people have joined the, the middle right section of the country. And I think at this point in time, you know, I think there's a few people that are maybe like Democrat, like, like think about this. Think if you are a reasonable Democrat, right? And then you go on the internet and all your friends are talking mad shit. You can feel like a personal attack towards you when in reality, we're actually making fun of the people even further left of you, right? Just like you would make fun of the fucking redneck hillbilly KKK guy, right? That I've still never seen. But the point is, the point is, is that I don't think those people have any power anymore, bro. I think we, you know, there's some people we could make room for and should that are common sense and they're willing to say, okay, let's move forward. But dude, like just look at the comments that are being made towards us in the last couple days. Yeah, bro. You know, like it's these people don't want fucking shit to do. And we're all gonna tell you, like I've told these people for years and years and years, not if you want to win, you better become stronger, more effective, more skilled because natural order wins. And if you're going to beat the producers of the world at being integral to the success of the country, you ain't going to do it dying your hair, fucking rainbow and piercing your face 500 times and talking about what gender you are for your whole entire life and producing nothing. No one gives a fuck, all right? And standing there on your little soapbox, it's screaming at people, no one gives a fuck about that either because you've already exhausted it. So now what are you going to do? Yeah. You're going to sit there and have to take the brunt of the world that you created by bullying everybody, calling everybody racist, calling everybody misogynist, calling everybody homophobic, telling everybody that they're the fucking problem. When reality dude is, you produce nothing, you create nothing, you're not going to produce anything or create anything, you're not contributing to the country in any way. You've become a fucking bag of shit that we have to carry along over our shoulders to even exist and that's not okay. So I feel like we don't need all these people that are freaking the fuck out. But I feel like the common sense people are understanding like holy shit dude. How many people have we had a message in? Like I've had a bunch that are like said dude, I've always voted Democrat, I've over Trump this time. Like I had tons of that. Shit's on them. Yeah. And so like I think I just think dude, you know, I'm okay. Another thing is for me bro, I expect to win. I don't even in business or life or anything. I'm never been a big shit talker when I win. Like I just like yeah, that's right bitch. You know what I'm saying? I'm expecting it was like I calculated it. So like I, you know, I don't like, I think the shit's funny for a little bit. But I think at some point do we all need to grow up and be adults and build this country and what the fuck it should be. 100% and like and that's the thing though. It's like, you know, for the next five or six days I'll make fun of you. The problem is though, it's like, you know, what made me kind of get out of that okay, yeah, haha, haha is because I was quickly able to see the hey, that fucking propaganda machine still rolling. Yeah, and it's through shit like this headline that's all over the fucking like anywhere you look, it's still this message of division with Trump win. Democrats ask anxious questions about America. Harris supporters share their thoughts as they reconcile with you like painting this picture like these next four years are not going to be the most prosperous years of this fucking country for everybody. I know bro, but they would flood the picture like flood their these these articles with these sad fucking pictures of these fucking people crying like they're just so devastated. That shit's going to be so fucking bad. Well, I mean, dude, now people are trolling women because women keep saying, oh, I've lost all my rights. And then there's these people on the internet like, fuck, just just like making fake headlines saying, I don't know if you heard, but Trump ban dancing. You know, this is the new outfit for women and it shows them in like the what do they call the thing that covers their whole body? Do you shine? Berka? Yeah. You know, like new dress code for you and I like everybody's trolling these girls who are freaking to fuck out because dude, it's insane. There's one lady living in the post of the fucking real of her calling her doctor's office setting up a fucking volunteer he has directed me, which is a sterilization. Yeah. Because like, it's like, what do we do? Bro, I was talking to fucking goob and he was sending me this fucking reddit thread of these like liberal women freaking to fuck out, dude. And like one of the women was like, all right, ladies, it starts today. No sex for the next four years. And dude, like nobody wants to fuck you anyway, lady. You know, say what the fuck you think? They want to come bang some fucking 400 pound blue hair weirdo that fucking yell at you all the time. You're not even funny. You're not a fucking volunteer woman. Yeah. No shit, dude. Yeah. You're going to continue to work in no sex. The upside down world of communism and communist subversion is going to die. That's what's been happening. The world, the world economic form is going to get crushed. The world cabal is going to get crushed. And all of the shit that these people believe comes from that. It's all backwards shit. If we go back 15 years, bro, and you were going to go say someone, hey, you know, your kids should probably go get a consultation to have a sex reassignment surgery. Bro, you probably punched that person a fucking face. You know what I'm saying? Like there would be like anger, right? And now it's like, if you don't believe that, you're a fuck. No, everything you motherfuckers believe comes from a media source and a global cabal that has used a communist subversive system propaganda system, which Obama made legal when he was an office. He made it legal for the media to propagate its own citizens. A lot of people don't know that. They have used all their resources to keep these people believing things that are backwards dude. Bro, they're incentivizing you. Like I saw the rest of this. So you, that's how the shit from fucking Missouri State University. An anticipation of the upcoming week, which might be stressful for students, the counseling center will be offering the following partnering with majors, health and wellness to provide a self care, no phone zone space on 11, 5 through 11, 6 where students will be offered self care activities such as calm jars, coloring pages and sent like you're in college. What the fuck are we doing? You're in, well, dude, this is what we've been talking about for years. They're trying to remove the skill set of the average American when you have people going listening. Think about it like this. The whole goal is to get everyone dependent. That is the goal. If we can get enough people dependent on the government, they have to vote us in because we're feeding them. We're providing for them. Okay. So the whole goal is to leverage every need that is potentially required for a citizenship from the government to the people. That's what it is. They don't want you to own anything. That's why they say shit like you'll own nothing and be happy. The reason they want you to own nothing is so they can leverage all the other shit so that you have to continue to vote for them to even survive. That is the point. All right. And then it becomes this fake democracy where you don't really want to vote for them, but you have to because they feed you. So what they did with the academic system is they infiltrated it for the last 20 years. Many something years. It started right when I was about to get out of high school and they stopped talking about actual trophies for merit and started talking about participation awards and all of these different everybody's a winner. Not everybody's a fucking winner. It's not reality. All right. So now what they've done is they've created an education system that intentionally misleads and equips or unequips people to be effective in society intentionally. Okay. Why aren't they teaching how to balance your finances? Why aren't they teaching how to manage your money? Why aren't they teaching basic investments? Why aren't they teaching? Why are they allowing kids to go get $150,000 in debt for a fucking business degree from a mediocre school? And so they can play color pages. That's right. Bro, what the, come on man. Yeah. And bro, that's the situation. So this isn't about, you know, dude, listen, this is a college coloring pages. You could come color because you're upset. How about this? How about you don't always get what the fuck you want, motherfucker? That's called life. How about you're wrong? Dude, you didn't win. Well, like your thoughts, your ideals, it doesn't align with the rest of the work. Okay. So when you should probably go out and try to make that happen, color pages ain't gonna fucking do it. Okay. Like the fuck is a calm jar? I didn't know what that is. That's new to me. I put it up. Yeah. Oh, okay. It looks like a little lava lamp basically with sparkles and glitters and shit. So you can like calm you down. Dude, listen, how about go lift some weights? How about go do some boxing or jitsu or fucking run? Something productive. Yeah. How about, how about, you know, how about you grow the fuck up? Fucking fidget spinners. Fucking coloring. It's wild. Why? The people that fucking even say this shit, these people should be removed from universities. Like prepare young adult grow. Listen, dude, universities should be making champions inside these universities well educated, highly effective, highly resilient, tough. People who are going to contribute to society. That's what college should be for. That's what the fuck you're paying for. And you get that fucking for free from other from from other places, society, you pay $150,000 to go here and then make you into a fucking bitch. Dude, it's wild man. It's wild now. In other news, we have been talking about, you know, what's what's going to be the drop? Like what's something's something's going to happen, right? You ready for what it is, Andy? Yeah. They just released some fucking lab monkeys in South Carolina. I saw that. Like what's that? It's like outbreak. Bro. Yeah. That movie scares the shit out of me. That little monkey. Like the old, the original out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's fucking macaque monkeys. Fucking kind of looks like them. Bro, they just released these motherfuckers in South Carolina, bro. 43 of them. Escape. A bio research lab in South Carolina. Yeah. You know who did that? Well, you know what's interesting? Who did that? Fauci. Fuck yeah. He probably did it himself. He released these. Yeah. Bro, he out of all the people that are sweating, bro, he's got to be sweating them all. Bro, he's got to be. He's probably fucking letting some win loose. Yeah. It nervous in this like rep bayer. We sure we sure as fuck haven't seen him anywhere. Bro, he ain't been nowhere, bro. But you know, and it's interesting because this isn't the first time that this same lab has had an issue. There was one in 2022. Right around midterms. There's also one in 2016. Hmm. From like, it's interesting. I don't know if that's some foreshadowing shit. I don't know. It's a lot of fucking monkeys. The monkeys escape. You might see every year. That shit happens every year. The workers forget to lock up the cages and they go crazy. Yeah. That's what has to tweet. Yeah. Every election year is interesting. Now, I don't know if that's it. I don't know. I just thought plenty of the eights. They go crazy. No. No. No. No. No. No. Fucking seizures pissed. Bro, Caesar's scary, bro. Oh, bro. Like if you were what fuck it saw a Caesar and that motherfucker said that to you, a monkey just like yelled at you. All right. I'm out. Yeah. You got it, bro. No. I'm okay. No, you know, it's really the big fucking orangutan. Yeah, he was friendly though. Not in the second one. I don't think he was in the second one. Was he? Yeah. Was he? Still scary, bro. I'm fucking think he's a massive. Yeah. You know, but in other news of people going crazy, you now have across a few cities and not many. And I don't want to make this seem like this is fucking everywhere and it's a bunch of fucking people. It's small pockets of these idiots that are starting to mobilize. And I think it's interesting to keep an eye out. I wonder who's fighting that. Yeah. It's very interesting. You know, it's not. And also miraculously, after all of the same states and locations sent sent home the National Guard and tore down the fences and now we're having these people, these anti-Trump protests break out nationwide as the start left is lash out at the landslide victory. They all got perfectly coordinated exact same signs. I mean, it sounds like we've seen this before. It's set. Listen, dude, every single fucking person who ever puts any money towards fucking getting people to protest in this country should go to fucking prison forever. Yeah. Except money to protest for any reason. Meaning you are not protesting on your own will. You are protesting because someone hired you to do so. You should go to prison for life. Yeah. I mean, because here's the thing. There's a fundamental right, right? Like the right to protest is a constitutionally protected activity, right? That's not what these are. That's the problem. And like we've seen this because St. Louis is a unique place, right? We've been through Mike Brown. We've had the stockly protest here. We've had the George Floyd protest here. Riot. These are not protests. Like that's the thing. They're different. One, you know, but it was very, very interesting to see. Like I think we cracked the code in 2020 with the Mike George Floyd riots. You know, it was very easy to see that this is not just some grassroots thing that is just coming up from the people that, you know, people are pit. That's not what this was. It never hit none of those things. None of this stuff was because when you look at the data, even going back to Mike Brown, bro, when the police would arrest these people, 63% of the arrestees did not live in the state of Missouri. Yeah. Right? So these people are coming in. They're renting vehicles, right? Like that was really busted. Bro, bust in. Like that was always something that we would like watch as you could very, very clearly see. Anytime the fucking rental cars, they're out of fucking rental cars, there's no major events happening. You could see this shit happening a week before these massive fucking riots. Other cars would go up, hotel reservations would go up. Like there'd be no vacancies anywhere and it's like, what the fuck's going on? We're not winning the world series. And we have this influx of fucking people in here. Like these things, you got these fucking Pinsky trucks dropping off. Paris. Paris of bricks. Yeah. Like it's, this is not just some simple grassroots frustration, man. And it's very, very clear to see less than 24 hours, bro. We got people in Chicago, people in New York, people in Philadelphia. And it's not thousands of people, right? But it's still these same squeaky wheels that are somehow getting, you know, their lubrication from some external source. And we all know who it is, but it's just a sad escape. No, this is the sad pool. The sad, sad pool. No, this is the sad pool. The sad, sad pool. You really? She's saying? I don't know. Some crazy left shit. Yeah, there's like 300 people there. How so motivated? What? What a nothing like we're just laughing at these fucking people. Racist, sexist, anti gay. Donald Trump go away. It's so motivating. Like they're definitely changing the world. Listen, man, these, I told you the tide was going to change and these people were in for a rude awakening. Told you this fucking years ago. Yeah, man. How many years have been saying that, Joe? Four fucking years. I said the moment that these people are in for a rude awakening, they're overconfident. They're totally dismissive. And then anybody doesn't agree with them. They're mean. They're fucking aggressive. They try to get you fired. They try to ruin your life. They break in your home. Okay. I've got my home breaking into by these fucking crazy fucks. All right. These people are fucking, they're going to, they're in for a rude awakening. America's done with your shit. Oh man, guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. With that being said, let's go cruise the comments chat. We got this first one. First comment is from Ryan. Pizz Pizzini Grille. Pizzini Grille. He said, told my wife this year, if you don't vote, I will file for separation. She voted for the first time this year. It might be a little bit more. Ryan. I mean, it kind of sounds like what they do. It's true. Yeah, it's true. Yeah. Well, congrats. Good job. I'm glad she voted. Yeah, man. I mean, look, dude, you know, people should vote. Yeah. And it should be, you know, how, how, there's a lot of these black pill people out there literally like, oh, your vote doesn't matter. Clear it. Fucking clearly does. You fucking idiots. Okay. And second of all, you're not always going to have the perfect candidate. Like, like, who, where the fuck did you grow up at? Like, when have you ever gotten everything you wanted out of somebody that you had to work with? If you had a coach at some point, you probably like some shit about the coach. You probably didn't like some shit about the coach. You got a boss. It's probably the same thing. You got people you work with. There's probably some things you don't like about them. Your friends. Yeah. We don't have the luxury to have exactly what we want every single time. Intelligent people say, I have these two choices. This one is more aligned with me. I'm going to make that choice. And then when the two more choices come, I'm going to make the best choice then as well. They don't just opt out and say, oh, fucking, I'm holier than now. And I'm more intelligent than you. And, you know, you shouldn't vote. And, you know, when I look at voting, dude, and I think about, you know, all the people who have sacrificed for this country, not just been killed, but time away from their families or injuries or, you know, fucking just, you know, service in general of any sort. There's a lot of people who have given up a lot of things for us to have a say. And I mean, dude, it's weird that we've lost that. I mean, I don't know that we've lost it anymore, but that we got that out of focus, you know, like, bro, it's an obligation as a citizen. There are certain expectations that we have as citizens. And one of them is to vote. Yeah. Man, this next comment comes from at George Brumfield, E9-8. She says, what? So it hasn't been real as fuck. People are tripping it. Real American freedom. They thought really F stood for real as fuck, real Andy Farsala. Duped a lot of people there. Yeah. They're there. They're coming. They're being woken up again. Yeah. Well, what have we been talking about for the last five years? Makes sense. Yeah. Makes sense. All right. Brad, listen, yeah, that's called branding. Fucking genius. This next one comes from Kyle Isom, 9645, says, Blacks and Hispanics are now white supremacists too. Trump already uniting us all. That's right. That's right. Yeah, not too bad. Yeah. Not too bad. Pro. That's fucking idiot on TV. Scarborough is literally saying that to what's his face? Al Sharpton. Al Sharpton. Yeah. You're like to a black man. We've talked about this. Right? Yeah. Am I okay to say this? Right. It's the black people. We talked about this. Fuck, dude. This is gross. He's sitting here saying this on live TV, not realizing how fucking racist he sounds. It's a little racist. It's a little racist, you know? Well, I guess we found out the truth about black people and the Martinez. They don't like us very much. So fuck them. They're supposed to vote with us. We've talked about this. If they don't vote with us, how fucking stupid could they be? Did you see that fucking clip of the view where the black woman on the view was like, she's like, you know, Latino women voted 75% for Kamala. Black women voted at 85%. White women voted at 52% on educated white women. Black and she starts going off and then the host next to her who's white woman goes, well, maybe they did that because they don't like being called uneducated white women. Yeah. I mean, that's the restart. And then you could see or go, well, just, I'm just saying the data. Okay. Well, let's talk about the data. Like, because you don't like the other data. Right. You don't like the black crime data. You don't like that fucking data. Right. Right. Can't say that shit. Yeah. Right. Let's say we have one more comment, man. This comment comes from a law. Huzz. Huh? What? I think it's Laura. Lauren. Okay. So I know what I'm saying about these people like, oh, burlis. Like, do listen. I'm going to tell you this. This fucking anti white shit that's been going around. I'm fucking done with it. I'm done with a double standard of this fucking shit where you guys can call anybody. You call white people, anything you fucking want. And the minute someone says anything else about anybody else, you're fucking this and that. That shit is fucking over. I'm just going to pull Joe Scrober over. Yeah. Hey, we talked about this black people. It's all listen to that motherfucker say that. So, but this is a kept trying to pull for like fucking, yeah, confirmation. I mean, he's talking about this. Yeah. Right. It's a black salatino. Right. Imagine black salatino is not wanting to vote for that guy. Right. And what he stands for. You know, hard, hard made a good video about $7 butter, bro. Your boy. That's not my boy. He made a good video about it though. He said, he said, look, dude, he said, uh, Democrats ain't with people and people ain't with with who you put out there for us. Well, what's in Bernie Sanders? Yeah, he said the same good thing. I mean, it was like, oh, I'm so surprised that they didn't vote for you guys. Right. When you guys fucking call him pieces of shit every day. Yeah, man. We got one more comment from Lauren Eslow, 4886. Um, Lauren says, I got some weird, nervous vibes. Yeah, she can see that everything feels so smooth. I don't know why I have a nagging feeling. They ain't done. I agree. I agree. I still think there's a potential of a big black swan event happening between now January 20th or another assassination attempt or some other crazy shit. These people, how, listen, until he's in and we're getting this done, it, nothing's done for me. How I see this right now is they may understand that something is in the works. You think they didn't have a backup plan? It's too easy. Hold on. Do you think they didn't have a backup plan for if he won? I, I, I absolutely. No, for sure they did. Absolutely. Okay. Now they're all pretending, oh, peaceful transition of power. This was fine. Congratulations, Trump, all this shit, right? And what is something happens where he's killed or some, you know what I'm saying? Then they get to say, well, we were going to do it fine. You know, we're the, we're the good, we're good people. We didn't deny. We didn't do what he did. A peaceful transition of power. Right. So it's a way for them to sort of reposition themselves back to common sense in case they get in a position where, you know, this something happens and, and bro, I, I think these people are evil. I think these people, and I'm not talking about my fellow neighbor, Democrat, talking about these people at the top of our country right now. They're criminals. They're evil. Nothing is beyond their, their will, in my opinion, I think these people will do anything to keep Trump out. Still. So I share the exact same sediments as this woman. I've had a lot of people obviously message me and say, we did it. We didn't do it, bro. We didn't do shit yet until this country's fixed until, you know, we are legitimately at the top again until we get rid of all this sexual bullshit in our schools and all this cancer culture shit and all this oppressive finances with our tax code and the ability for the biggest richest people in the world to buy up all the real estate and fucking charges, all kinds of extra money. You know, all this DEI shit, all this ESG shit, you know, all the criminals wiped out of the three letter agencies until all that shit's done, we haven't done shit. Just so we're clear. Okay. And you could tell a lot about people, you know, who are like, oh, we fucking did it, bro, these are the same people that started diet and then be like, I started the diet. Well, that doesn't fucking matter. It matters how you finish. You know what I'm saying? Like, I don't get excited about starting things. I don't get excited about good omens or steps forward. Like if I was coaching the football team, you know, we would have just scored a touchdown and I'd be like, yeah, that's what we're supposed to do. The game's still going. That's right. And people got to realize that. And there's a lot of people that are willing to defer the personal responsibility of living a high level, high standard life because they don't understand that the high level, high standard life is what actually creates a great America. It's not a politician. And you know, it's interesting because a lot of people, I can feel it already. They're like relaxing. They're like, okay, Trump won. I think that was intentional. Yeah. That's what I'm saying, bro. So now you got everybody being like, Trump won. No, it doesn't matter if Trump won because Trump can't bring greatness back to America. Now what he can do is he can make the soil fertile and we can make the environment. He can make the environment conducive to success. He can make the environment great for sure. But until you go plant the seeds, cultivate water, take care and produce fruit, America stays the same. That's real man. Guys, we appreciate you for being real ass fans. Guys, keep like and keep commenting. Make sure you guys are subscribed and hit that bell notification on the YouTube to stay up to date with the latest drops from real AF from real American freedom. That's right. Guys, headlighting up too. Let's keep this moving. I want to talk about some other things. Obviously, you know, Trump winning. That's a great thing. But there were a bunch of other important elections around the country, very important decisions that were made around the country outside of just who's the president. So let's do a little bit of that. I think this is a good time to do that. Let's go to Cali. Go to California. I thought this was pretty awesome. Two awesome things happened out of California. That's the first one. California voters decide to make crimes felonies again over Gavin Newsom's objections. This is awesome. This is great to see. Like, it's good to see the temperature of the people also getting tired of the shit. Yeah. You know, I think this is a great example of that. One of the great examples again. I have another one here after this. But let's dive into this felony, felony measure that was put on the ballot. So a California anti-crime ballot measure that would reclassify some misdemeanor theft and drug crimes as felonies got overwhelming support on Tuesday as voters moved to slowly restore law and order following years of failed progressive policies. State Proposition 36 passed in a landslide after receiving widespread backing from voters on election day. 70.6% of the 7.6 million ballots counted in favor of the initiative, according to the unofficial results from the California Secretary of State. And so what this bill technically does is that it authorizes felony charges for possession of drugs like fentanyl thefts under $950 if the offender has at least two similar convictions. It will be counted as a felony now. California residents have expressed their desire for change beginning with restoring public safety. I thought this was absolutely amazing. Now the other thing that also happened, and again, just look at the temperature of the people and see where Americans really are. They also got George Gascona, which I think was another massive deal who got killed too, like killed in the election destroyed destroyed. Yeah, progressive Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascona has lost his reelection bid to Nathan Hatchman. According to results from Los Angeles County last updated early Wednesday morning, Gascona received 38.54% of the vote or a little bit almost under 900,000 votes to Hatchman 61% or 1.4 million votes. The voters of Los Angeles County have spoken and have said enough is enough of DA Gascona's pro criminal extreme policies. They look forward to a safer future. Hatchman said in a statement early Wednesday, according to the Associated Press, quote, as DA, I look forward to representing all of the people whether they voted for me or not since their safety will be my responsibility. Now, this is a George Soros prosecutor who was in Gascona. There was a couple of recall attempts to get them out of office before the election. They all failed mysteriously, but now he gets fucking destroyed and the fucking vote. I'm saying so that made me put into question. What were those recall, what were the environment around the recalls and where they fucking actually legit? Again, the people are truly speaking out. Well, what's happened, dude. A lot of what's happened here is that independent attorneys, like Yoder, Mike Yoder, a lot of other ones, Trump team, a lot of organizations that are pro Trump, pro America, pro freedom have put attorneys and poll watchers in these places. We learned in 2020, apparently, how they do things and now they can't do them. This is the real, we're seeing the real numbers now. I guarantee you, dude, if you went back to New Sims recall bid or the 2020 election or any of these other elections and we did what happened with the observations, happened then. The numbers would have been the same, dude. These people have cheated their way in. They've figured out how to fucking cheat. All these sorrows, finance people, like Kim Gardner here in St. Louis and these prosecutors all over the country, they've all figured out how to get these people in and they've destroyed our country. Now we've got to get them all the fuck out and we've got to start the fuck over. But the good news is that we have an opportunity to start over. We have an opportunity to build a country that's better than it's ever been, which I think is a great thing. Yeah, it is, man. It is. Dude, I was thinking about this. Clearly, we've probably all seen the total vote numbers and that there's anywhere from 15 to 20 million missing votes from 2020 to 2024. We all saw that. But amplify that over every election and every city across America, especially with the blue mayors, the big cities. That's what we're dealing with. That's what we've been dealing with through this entire time. And you're saying that on the local levels, the state level, that's the same thing. That's not just the presidential level. That's correct. So when we go back and look at how this happened, the reason it happened is because we took our eye off the fucking ball. The best, the brightest, the smartest people in the country are out building their lives, building their communities, building their business and have, you know, we've lost focus on that we all have civic duties to pay attention to, right? And when we think about how they did this, it's actually a good thing that they've done this. And it was actually a good thing that they cheated the election in 2020 because, bro, real talk had Trump won that election. We would have dealt with the same four years of shit that we would have dealt with between 16 and 20. And now we get a fucking, now we have all of America or the majority of America seeing that how full of shit the system is, how corrupt the swamp really is, how bad the media is, how bad Hollywood is, how bad all of these things are. And we didn't have that in 2020. So now we have a completely awake population. And so yeah, the last four years have been terrible and a lot of people need to be held accountable because there's a lot of unforgivable shit that's happened, okay? The biggest wealth transfer in the history of the world, people dying over Zoom calls, people being denied effective therapeutics. We could go down the list, etc, etc, etc, etc. Criminals not having to be prosecuted for crimes. Good citizens like Daniel Penny sitting in fucking jail. By the way, why are the J6 people still in jail? They should be out today. But my point in saying this is that you have to see the bad shit before you could appreciate how great the opportunity is before you. And so I actually think we're in a tremendous opportunity now because we have the majority of people seeing that how bad it really was and how, and willing to like, you know, pick up a shovel and start building what it should be. We wouldn't have had that had he won in 2020. Plus dude, now there's a chance for accountability. So I hope, you know, they go back and investigate this and get all this done. And if Trump's team was smart, I was thinking about this this morning actually, they would put in every fucking policy that they want to put in immediately, immediately, like the fucking first week. And the reason for that is because it gives us four years to see the effectiveness of the policy, which will allow people to become believers in that kind of a policy again, right? And then after he takes action, the more time we spend living in a productive environment. And that's, I hope they do that. Yeah, man. Now the other thing to look at too that I thought is interesting is that, you know, months before Trump even has taken office, okay? We are already starting to see, not, I mean, obviously we cover the antifa people, cool whatever. We're starting to see people in positions of power already starting to show their cards. Let's go to Massachusetts. Massachusetts Democrat governor vows to defy Trump's deportation plans, promises to use executive power to shield criminal aliens. The fact that she's coming out on this before it's even announced before Trump is even sitting in office, bro, clearly saying that she's going to be defying and sitting president's authority. Yeah, it's not good. It doesn't look good. So let's dive into this just a little bit. Massachusetts Democrat governor, Mora Healy has made clear she intends to use every tool in her arsenal to block mass deportation plans under a potential Trump administration. This includes leveraging executive powers and state legislation to shield illegal immigrants within Massachusetts despite federal laws. I'm a recent report from ICE revealed shocking statistics that highlight the grave consequences of the Biden Harris administration's reckless open board of policies. Now she went on MSNBC. Here's the interview. Let's check this clip out. If the Trump administration requested would the Massachusetts state police assist in mass deportations? No, absolutely not. But, you know, let me say this. I do think it's important that we all recognize that there's going to be a lot of pressure on states and state officials. And I can assure you we're going to work really hard to deliver. Some realities also need to be noted. And that is in 2016, we had a very different situation in the courts. And well, I'm sure there may be litigation ahead. You know, there's a lot of other ways that people are going to act and need to act for the sake of their states and their residents. There's regulatory authority and executive powers and the like. There's legislation also within our states. So I think that the key here is that, you know, every tool in the toolbox has got to be used to protect our citizens, to protect our residents and protect our states and certainly to hold the line on democracy in the rule of law as a basic principle, right? How wild is that? I mean, it's a good way to end up in jail. Like, you know, look, I don't think these people are realizing that we're clean in house. Okay, all this fucking communist shit. You say you're here to protect your citizens and why the fuck do you have these illegals? They don't want those illegals. Bro, go. If ever, listen, every single fucking citizen that voted for Kamala Harris or voted for these illegals should be required to host a family. I think so. Yeah. And you know, they won't. They have no fucking plans to the only reason that this woman's citizenship, everything says, okay, it's because they think that all the migrants are going to end up in Texas or California or Arizona, right? They don't think they're going to end up in the Northeast. So yeah, I don't even, let's see. Like, I would, I would raise you on that. And it's like, is that really what your citizens even want? They don't. They don't because dude, like when, like the polls, you know, that they poll people all the fucking time, like what's your thoughts on immigrate? Bro, most people, I want to say the last poll also, I was like 68% of them. Americans over 70% are not in favor. I know. You know what I'm saying? So like, you're, you're so worried about, so let's take, let's take, hold on, let's trace her bank account. Right. Let's see who's funding her. Who's contributed her campaign? Right. I bet you we find a whole bunch of people that are for the open, open, uh, border society or whatever fucking source, what's named the shit is. Yeah. I mean, it's just mom, like you're more concerned about a dick measuring contest than actually caring about your fucking. I think this is the wrong time to do a dick measuring contest with Donald Trump. The guy just got her rang for fucking eight years for literally nothing. He got his fucking ear shot. Okay. Like I don't think it's a good, like, listen, there are times to fuck around and there are times to push a limit and there are times to fucking stand up and say, fuck you. But I'm going to tell you this, when you stand up to someone who's gone through all that shit, okay, there's a great clip from pool hall junkies where Chris walk is in it. And he's talking about there's a lion, okay, and all these little lions and the hyenas and they all come and fucking here. Look, let's play the clip. This lion is the king of the jungle, huge mane up here. He's laying down under a tree in the middle of Africa. He's so big, he's so hot. He doesn't want to move. Now, the little lion comes, they start messing with him. He doesn't like this tail, but he doesn't do anything. The lion has. She starts messing with him, coming home, making trouble. Still nothing. Now, the other animals, they know this. And they start to move in. The jackals. The hyenas. The barking at them, laughing at them. They never toes, they eat the food, they sit in his door, they do this, and they get closer and closer and bolder and bolder. Till one day, the lion gets up and tears the shit that everybody runs like the men eat everything in his path. Because every once in a while, the lion has to show the jackals. That's what's going to happen. So this woman who thinks she's been, this is what I'm talking about, the false ego of these people. They think they're at the fucking, they're in a position to behave the way they're behaving because they behave this way for so long with zero accountability. So they've shot this dude, they've put him through law fair, they've fucking raided his house, they've embarrassed his family, they've done all these things. This dude is going to rip the fuck out of these people. There's a book that Trump wrote. I've read every book about Trump. There's a book that he wrote called Think Big and Kick Ass. They call it something else now, they rename the title, but the book was called Think Big and Kick Ass, it's original version. There's a fucking chapter in the book about revenge. Okay, there's a whole section about revenge. This guy wrote a book and wrote about revenge. It's part of his identity. So for her to stand up and take this fucking on, she's some hard ass. Okay, when I guarantee you, they're taking notes. Bro. And here's the other thing, two people got to remember, bro, is that again, just like that propaganda machine didn't fucking stop on the fifth, these fucking migrants have not stopped just because Trump's got elected. Oh, they're watching you. In fact, there should be a whole bunch more to come through. They're already started. Yeah, they're already started. Check this headline out. A legal migrants rush to cross border before Trump takes office and institutes crack down. You got large groups, hundreds at a time are fucking flooding the border. Everybody's trying to get in. Do you guys think that just because Trump got elected, that the administration currently is going to do anything to stop it? No, but I do think Trump has enough clout with him coming back, that if he were to say, hey, close that fucking border right now, I think they do it. No, he fucking needs to, man, because if he came out and said, hey, I know I'm not president, I think you guys need to close the border. I bet they would do it. The border patrol endorsed him. Yeah, they did. They did the union did. Yeah. Yeah, man. So I mean, whether or not they have the resources to do it, that's a different thing. But I think if he, I think whatever call he makes right now, people are going to fall online. Primitively listen to it. Yeah. I mean, if we cover yesterday about the world leaders and stuff, there's already talks now that a lot of these wars and stuff will be done before he even gets in office because it's a shit that he's working with before he even does not only that, he comes out, Z-Shiping comes out, says, you know, Trump's coming back in. I can't wait to have peaceful relationship with, with US again. All the countries are saying that because they know this dude does not fuck around. Yeah, bro. But yet you got this fucking nobody knows governor. You know what I'm saying? Like openly saying like, no, I'm gonna, okay. All right. I agree. All right. You know what the citizens are saying, bro, all the California, bro, listen dude, the people are done. The fact that we have leadership that's willing to finally stand up for all this shit, the people now have courage to stand up to it themselves. We're gonna see a lot of people start handling business in the streets when it needs to be handled. People are not afraid, they're not going to be afraid to step in. They're not gonna be afraid because they understand that we're getting back to reality. When you turn the world upside down and create a scenario where someone like Daniel Penny could potentially go to prison, people get afraid to intervene, which allows these people to run unabated through society. And now that we have leadership coming back where people understand there's gonna be accountability, there's gonna be more people stepping up to be accountable, being, you know, especially the men and they should. You see someone fucking shoplifting, you should beat their ass. You should do that's what the fuck we do in America. And if you have to arrest people, you know, and you're a police officer and you walk in and someone is stealing and the citizens beat the shit out of them, you should give the citizens a high fucking five. You have a mistake of saying call me next time. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, man. Guys jumping on this conversation, which, bro, I think most of the cops are that way. I think the cops are afraid to do their job because they're afraid to get fired or held liable or hurt. Yes. It's fucking bullshit, bro. We gotta take these motherfuckers off the leash, let them do their fucking jobs and force the fucking laws and this place will be cleaned up in snap. Yeah, you wouldn't have to worry about criminals rights because there would be none because they'd be so fucking scared to do the bullshit. You know, bro, listen to fucking to commit crime. Listen, man, I'm not saying, I'm just saying we need, we need to clean it up. Everybody knows it and everybody's on board with it. Guys jumping on this conversation, let us know what you guys think down in the comments of that being said, I third and final headline headline number three, wanted to bring this in because I don't want people to forget. We don't want people to forget at all, but it is interesting. We made this comment, I think yesterday, but now there's actual proof behind it. I like to bring this back up. Panic mode. Top five big former CEOs hold emergency teleconference after Trump's landslide victory threatens their grip on America. So let's dive into this a little bit after former president Trump's massive election victory, the top executives of big former were reportedly scrambling to protect their influence over US health care. Sources indicate that the heads of five major pharmaceutical companies held an emergency teleconference on Wednesday to address the potential fallout from a Trump administration that is vowed to disrupt big farmers hold on America. New Jersey, Assemblyman and advisor to Robert Kennedy, Jr. Jamal Holly shared the breaking news on Twitter Wednesday stating, sweet red quote, sources tell me top five CEOs of pharmaceutical companies are holding an emergency teleconference at 1 p.m. A lawyer has confirmed that everyone is in a state of panic. Now why would they be freaking out? Why would they freak it out? Right? Well, because they're doing bad shit. They're doing really, really bad shit. And they know that that shit's going to either get exposed and they're going to be held accountable. This headline reads, RFK, Jr. declares war on big former vows to clear out entire departments at the FDA and push for health reform. Now, this is something, I don't think we've given him enough lie. We haven't really talked about that much. Like what RFK's like place is going to be in the administration. Like where we would hope him to be at. But you know, obviously, this ought to stop into the article a little bit. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. known for his relentless stance against corporate influence and health policy is now taking direct aim at the entrenched bureaucracies within the US health agencies. As a possible future Trump administration of point E, RFK, Jr. has laid out a plan to rid the FDA and other key federal agencies of the deeply rooted corruption that prioritizes corporate profits over public health. Recall that Trump said that if he is elected, Kennedy will work on quote, health and women's health in the nation's food supply saying Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. we have and he's going to work on health and women's health and all of the different reasons because we're not really a wealthy or healthy country. Trump said during his rally in Nevada, he said quote, I told Bobby, I want you to take care of health. I want you to look at the food and the food supply and what we put on the food and all sorts of you can look at it, but let me handle the oil and gas Bobby. Sounds like a good, good, uh, that's a good, good trade off there. Now, RFK posted just a couple of days ago on Twitter, he says quote, on January 20th, the Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride from public water. fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders and thyroid disease. President Trump and first lady Melania Trump want to make America healthy again. And then they tell you it's great for your teeth. Right, right. And like, listen, like average age of a fucking life expectancy is going to go to like 120. Bro, bro. Yeah. Now, he had this interview. This is San Luis. Let's check this clip out on MSNBC. You say clearing out the corruption in your terms. Would that mean clearing out the top level federal service workers that are currently at the FDA and CDC? And some categories, I would say. What does that look like? Yeah. And some categories of worker, their entire department is like the nutrition departments that FDA that are, that have to go. They are not doing their job. They're not protecting our kids. Why do we have fruit loops in this country that have 18 or 19 ingredients and you go to Canada and it's got two or three. Would you eliminate any of the agencies? I'm not, my, do eliminate the agencies as long as it requires congressional approval. I wouldn't be doing that. I can get the corruption out of the agencies. This is what I've been doing for 40 years. I've pursued all those agencies. I have a PhD in corporate corruption and that's what I do. And once they're not corrupt, once Americans are getting good science and are allowed to make their own choices, they're going to get a lot of health here. Yeah. Now, bro, I can't wait till they do. Listen, bro, they're going to make food real again. Yeah, man. You know what I'm saying? They're going to make the food like it is in Europe where we can eat regular food without being unhealthy fat fucks. You know, people go to Europe for a month, bro, and they fucking go all over the place and they lose weight. You know what I'm saying? They eat, they drink. Dude, there's all, people don't understand this. There's all kinds of addictive chemicals in fast food and the food, the process shit that you get at the grocery store. This is coming from someone who has food addiction, you know, who I still have it. Like if I have three or four days of eating bad, bro, I go off the rails. I'll gain 50 fucking pounds in a fucking month. Okay. This is a huge deal for America. And we're going to see people getting shape. It comes down to like, and leads back to what's really going to make this country great, which is the individual, right? And we can't have a great country with unhealthy individuals. What he, what RFK is doing is, is very foundational to the quote unquote, make America great agenda. You know what I mean? If you don't have a healthy individual, how are you going to have a healthy country? If you don't have strong individuals, how are you going to have a strong country? If you don't have intelligent individuals, how are you going to have intelligent country? If you don't have wealthy individuals, how are you not going to have a wealthy country? None of these things that we want in society can exist until we as individuals become them. And that is a big thing that health has to do with that. It's a pillar of that process. Yeah. And one of the biggest issues and like, it's a very easy to just look at and say there's something wrong. I mean, even just globally, right, as far as like this, the humanity health situation, it's a tail-tale sign when you go around the world and you look at the health leaders around the fucking world that is supposedly responsible for the health of their citizens, it doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. You look at America. No, it doesn't make sense. It makes perfect sense. It does make, it makes perfect sense, DJ. It makes perfect sense. They want you fucking fat. They want you fat so you could be sick. They want you sick so you buy their fucking medications and require them. This is all part of the thing. They want you to be a fat, uneducated, poor, supplicating, dependent human being that has to beg the government. Oh, please, sir. Man, I have another cup of porridge. Right? That's what they want, bro. Yeah, man. You know, I'm just, I look forward to the day where instead of good old Ralph, okay, we got rip and fucking shred it. Bro, he's 70 years old. He's fucking yoked. I love that guy, by the way. Which one? This guy? No. RFK. I just, I love him, dude. No, no, I don't agree with all his views either. Yeah. In fact, I disagree with strongly with some of his views, but I feel like he has good intentions. If his responsibility is health, I can trust. I believe that he's going to do what he needs to do on that. I believe he has good intentions. I believe these people, I know fucking, I know some of these people, I know Tulsi Gabbard. She's got great intentions. Good human. No, like legit, good human. RFK, I don't know, but I feel like he's a good dude. I mean, it seems like it doesn't feel like he's got bad intentions. Terrier motives. Yeah. I mean, dude, Vivek, we know Vivek. Vivek's got good intentions. These are good people. These are people that give a fuck. JD Vance comes from fucking literally the trailer park, okay? You got great intentions for America. You know, Donald Trump, a guy who's given up the biggest billionaire playboy lifestyle, fucking coolest shit you could ever imagine to help us and you, even if you don't like him. These are people with good intentions, bro. And I feel good about that. Yeah. Well, it's interesting because again, I mean, they want to keep pushing this division. They want to keep the scare attack. Again, the machine propaganda is still alive and well. And so it's, it should be no surprise that we find articles written like this, the true danger of RFK juniors role in the next Trump administration is already clear. It's not about the fluoride and the water or even really vaccines. It's about pushing conspiracy based conspiracy theory based accusations. That's what it's about. Yeah. Because this dude doesn't do his research. We don't know the truth. He only wrote a whole book about fucking Fauci shit. Bro, that's one dude. I can't wait. Bro, I cannot wait. That guy deserves literal, like literal dismemberment. Like he's killed more people and disrupted more lives and created more crimes against humanity than he's the most evil person alive, in my opinion. He's pretty fucking evil, man. Yeah. He's pretty evil. So I mean, this is going to be interesting. You know, we know there's some other people in some spots that we can't really talk about just yet. You know, but I'm happy about RFK, RFK's role specifically. I think it's going to be huge for the country, man. Yeah. Guys, jumping on this conversation, I just know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck. If we're going to article in, we talk about it. Get one of those two options. Okay. Now, I feel like this has happened before. Not a big fan of it. I know you're not going to like it, but it is what it is. Pythons invaded shock man's toilet twice in one week. Not the steak. You want to crawl all over you. Wait, that sounds a little, it went that other thing. You know what I'm saying? Get that other snake all over you. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Taylor night. Taylor night's telling herself there. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. I didn't even see that part. I just, huh, slithering number two. An Australian man found a python coiled inside his toilet twice in one week, although finding someone's left over business inside the toilet is repulsive. It might be preferred to find a defecation rather than a scaly reptile hissing at you. Hervy-based snake catchers in Queensland, Australia received a call on October 22nd to remove a coastal carpet python from a toilet. Quote, the homeowner contacted us as he found the snake when he went to use the toilet, drew God-free toad newsweek. There was a female that was likely in there to soak its skin before shedding. After extracting the reptile from the toilet bowl and pipes, they posted an image on Facebook describing the encounter. Quote, it managed to get right into the S bin so we had to cut the pipe under the house. Poke from one end and flush from the other. The company wrote, and eventually got annoyed enough to come out and see us. And Jonesy took one for the team and dove on in there to grab it. And so this is the first time that it happened. Holy shit, dude. Fuck that. Fuck, bro. No fucking way. That's the first time it happened. All right. Bro, what do you do? No fucking way. No, you're right. I don't like it. Yep. Now, that was the first time it happened. And then a few days later, I burned that house the fuck down. Just burned the house. Yes. The house is burnt down. Yeah. Did you see that thing? No, it's big. It's a big log. I got a story about big logs, but what? I do. Leave them one like that? No, I wasn't me. But that's just a few days later on October 25th, the Australian residents heard a hiss from another unwelcome guest inside the toilet. The python, which was of the same species as the first reptile, but of the different sex was wrapped inside the bowl until Harvey Bay snake catchers made a return visit to remove the cold-blooded animal. Here's the second one that came out. So yeah, I mean, why are they getting snakes inside their toilet, dude? You got to burn a house down here, the whole house. Yeah. Yeah, man. That one looks like a lot lower. The males typically are. Oh, they are. The females will be a little bit bigger. That's the female. That's the male. Fuck that. Yeah, no. See, I went into living Australia, bro. They got all kinds of fucking things. Every thing that's there is massive. The deadlenders. And deadly. It'll kill you. Yeah. I'm not tough enough living Australia. You, my fuckers, are different. I have zero incentive. Yeah, the fact that you let your government do what you do to you. You guys are way tougher than us, bro. What the fuck you guys are doing? Yeah. Fuck that. I couldn't, I just felt like the snacks away. We have a good buddy of the snacks. The snacks. Yeah. I have a point. The snacks of Australia, they're weird. Oh, one of them things. One of those ham-tams. Ham-tams. Yeah, well, so I was talking to get to, like, we have a buddy, a mutual buddy who listens to the show. The guy that built the V8 engine. Yeah. He's an Australia. And he sent a caripagage of snacks to me. I mean, I don't know why he would send him to me, but they were sent. And I didn't want to be rude. So I, you know, I, I tried a couple. He didn't send, he didn't send something for me too that you just happened to try. Maybe. The Tim-Tams are fire. Yeah, that's what Tia Claire says. She loves those ham-tams. Tim-Tams are fire. But that was the Vegemite. I can't get with that. What is it? It's a vegetable paste bread, right? It's fucking disgusting. It's nice. It's not chocolate though. It's not, it's not chocolate. It looks not like Nutella. It's, I thought it was Nutella, bro. And I took a big ass bite and I almost peaked. Would you like fork it out? Yeah, but I'm like, oh, it's chocolate spread. It's hot. So you know you're fat when you fucking use a fork on the, on the fucking peanut butter and shit. Joe, use a fork. Use a fork or a spoon. Use whatever's in the fucking jail, bro. What do you use? I use a fork. Yeah. I'm just a little bit more comfortable. I fucking forked that shit right into my mouth. Yeah, man, they got some roots next. Is that weird bro that you use fork in the peanut butter? I mean, how do you make sure you get a lot of it? Do you use spoon or knife? I feel like most people use spoons or a butter knife or a butter knife. I have fork. Hmm. Yeah. More, more scoop and power. How? It goes through the holes. Bro, I'm just telling you, just try it. Don't try it. You get fat. Look, bro, fuck Australia and your fucking snakes. And your camps. Yeah. Yeah. Bro, what would you do though? No, I would burn the house down. I do listen, man. I got, I like animals. I don't like killing animals. I had to kill a fucking snake in my house. Yeah. And I fucking, it was a copperhead. I felt like shit, especially because after I cut its head off, it looked at me for like 40 seconds and it kept sticking its tongue out and shit. And I was like, sorry, man, the danger knew to bro. Copperheads to do it. I don't think they're in a different class. Why didn't one kill the ducks? That's what I'm saying. They're the dogs, right? They're dangerous, bro. And I feel bad like killing any, I'm not an animal like a abuser or anything like that. Like I fucking love animals. Like if that was a, you know, psychotic pedophile, you know, I have no problem throwing right in the fucking woodshed, but, um, I think I'm going to be a little bit more Yeah, I, you know, when it comes to snakes, man, I don't fuck with them, dude. Yeah. I feel you. I don't, I don't go around them. Whatever they are. Check the toilet before you see that. No, that is now the snake's bathroom. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it was a hint like real question of like yours. Do you check the, I always check the toilet before I say that. Do you check it before you say that? I don't know. You just go in and just sit. Well, there's one time I checked it when I was in high school. This is a true story, bro. Chris knows it too because he was there. We went, we went in the fucking bathroom and at, at the on the high school and there was a fucking poop in the, in the fucking toilet, dude, that I like I had never fucking seen. I almost, I think somebody made it and like put it in there because it was like, and I'm not fucking exaggerating. It was probably that big around. There's no way. It was a size of a softball around and it was about a foot long. Oh my God. And I don't know, like I think someone like made it and stuck it in there. But anyway, they had put a sign on the fucking door and it said, do not flush because it was so impressive that, and we went to all boys high school. So like naturally it's fucking, yeah. But it was worth it. It was worth it. I went and looked at it, bro. And I never forgot. It's fucking me. That was about 17 years old. I'm still talking about it. It was a world record. Nobody knows who did it. Who's responsible? It looked like that snake but twice as big. Geez. Yeah. Yeah, fuck that man. Fuck that. So thumbs down on this one. No, I mean, yeah. Of course. Yeah. Thumbs down on Australia. That's how I feel about it. And Vegemite. Yeah. Vegemite, man. I was going to go there. Yeah. No point. Nope. It's over. Yeah. Well guys, Andy, that's all I got, man. All right, guys. Don't be a hoe. Sure, sure. Yeah. Never sleep on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck up, bro. Fuck up, stole. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch, booty, slow. Got a own bank, bro. Can't fold. Doesn't know. Handshot, case, cloak, cloak.
