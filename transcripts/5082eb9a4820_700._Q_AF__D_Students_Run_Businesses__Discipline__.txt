What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society and local and motherfucking reality. Guys today we have Q and AF we're going to start the week off right right now you could submit your questions to be answered on this episode a couple different ways the first way is guys email those questions into ask Andy at Andy for sell it.com thanks DJ old children yes you can also go on YouTube on the Q and a F videos and drop your question in the comments and we'll pick some from there as well now as we go through the week we're going to have shows within the show we're going to have CTI tomorrow that stands for cruise the internet this is where we put topics of the day up on the screen we talk about what's happening we speculate on what we think is true and what we think is not true and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world all right other times we're going to have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes and we're giving you some real talk and then we have occasionally 75 hard verses 75 hard versus where someone who has completed the 75 hard program comes on the show they talk about how they were before how they are now how they use 75 hard to get their shit in order and they talk about how you can do the same all right now 75 hard if you're unfamiliar is the initial phase of the live hard program which is the world's most popular mental transformation program that you can get for free an episode 208 on the audio feed again that's 208 on the audio feed we just started YouTube about a year ago so it's not on YouTube all right now there is a book available called the book on mental toughness it's available at Andy for seller dot com it's a great book we're sold out if you want to get that book I advise go on there and pre-order it and we'll ship it to you when it comes in we typically go through the shipments immediately when they come in so if you want that book go over there and order it it has the entire live hard program top to bottom in and out it has 10 chapters on mental toughness why you need it how to implement it in your life and then we have case studies from very successful people who have used mental toughness to become the recognized names that you know them for so that's the the layout that's the lay of the land now we have this thing called the fee you're gonna notice something different about our show we don't run ads all right I finance this show right out of my pocket and the reason I do that is because I don't want to listen to some corporate fuck tell me what I can and can't say it's called real AF not tell me what to say AF all right so in exchange for that I ask very simply that you please share the show we are constantly dealing with censorship and shadow bands and traffic throttling because we talk about real subjects here all right so if the show gives you value if it makes you better if it makes you think if it gives you new perspective if you think it's worth listening to please do us a solid and share the show if all of you just brought us one person for every episode that you listen to we'd be the biggest show in the world and we be able to change the culture going on in society and make the world a better place all right so don't be a hell share the show right all right man hey what's up do we're almost at 500,000 on the two bands not bad for a year it's not too bad at all man yeah it's been a grind it's been a grind well I mean if they weren't censoring a fuck out of us it would probably probably be way further than that yeah shit fucking so fucks pull update a lot of people been asked about the pool oh yeah a lot a lot a lot of a lot of people well so when it rains it pours that's the that's the saying yes I got a level or attempted to get the level today they had to take 14 inches on one side yeah so it wasn't even close to it wasn't close at all no it wasn't close 14 inches and you know I called the 811 you know the dig right yeah trying to be a responsible home on and they came out walking my shit up that's good and we were in a good area right the pools perfect spot so we thought yeah the guy and it's not his fault I blame myself but I got those I got that that in rounds sprinkler system yeah you destroyed one of the lines it was right there like right as soon as he went in all right so so we have to have an intervention all right here I'm gonna tell you something you're not gonna like it okay but that pool was a fucking mistake you just need to take that pool and put it in the trash it won't fit I'm gonna have to buy to get a dumpster to fucking you need to take you need to take that pool and set it on fire okay all right and then you need to take grass seed and put it in the spot the Dan dug up yeah and forget all about it yeah because this started out as a $300 deal and I'm gonna tell you and anybody listening will tell you yeah that a pool is never a $300 yeah fuck me alright it's kind of like a boat you rent boats you don't buy boats all right because they are just a hole that you throw money in you can rent pools a swim you kind of my pool I got the coolest fucking pool in the world there's a pretty cool pool yeah I would put on my pool against anybody's pool on the fucking planet more than 300 bucks and you're welcome to come fucking swimming at anytime all right yeah so take the pool burn it plant the grass back and just fucking forget about it it's one of those things see the problem is two man my daughter Ryan though she's she's like on my ass yeah about this pool she is she is on my ass she's mad black woman mad little black woman but she's a fucking three foot three foot three foot tall fucking piece of terror is what she is bro she's fucking hilarious bro she's on my ass right now so it's like I mean it's just like I can't just like the

headache we'll see man yeah we'll see yes that's the pool update me I know a lot of people are asking but I'll go with you yeah to get the metal pool where do you I don't even know where the fuck you get those from you get them at tractor supply never been oh man try to splice sweet I never never been there what like what do you what do you they have they got like all the farm stuff like anything you need for farms for farms for ain't like rural area stuff anything you need it's like a one-stop shot like it's like a long for farms guys fucking sweet like food and shit in there too they got everything they got animals you get that's where the ducks came from no shit yeah I know I want to go yeah it's awesome I'd be that just want to go just just look yeah it smells good too it smells like a farm like hey I don't feel like farm smoke it pig farms don't smell good but the rest of the farm smell good what they smell like like hey oh and like horses and stuff hey hey all right that's enough of that let's make some people better today let's do that let's let's stick to what we're good at here not pools yeah guys Andy question number one let's get it Andy what should take on the saying that a students are led by b students managed by c students hired by d students I feel like there's a bit common denominator among business owners being these d students that they talk about so what what what's your what's your thought process on that what have you ever heard that saying yeah definitely is there any validity to it I don't know you know like here's if there is this is what it is okay I know guys who are very successful in school and they're very successful business guys okay and we have to be careful just like we talk about generalizing people we have to talk about generalizing types of people when it comes to to business so I know people who are very successful it did very well in school I know people who are very successful I'm one of them who was terrible in school here's where I think the validity is in that statement is that typically people who are c students or d students it's not that they're not intelligent it's that they pave their own way in life they make their own rules they're not good at following directions and because they're not going to following directions they often find other pathways that people don't see that are so used to just going down the line one two three following the framework right and if we examine what the education system really is and we take a step back it is not education it is indoctrination okay it doesn't make you intelligent to have a degree from any school it does not education is not equal intelligence right okay so I mean educated people will tell you that it equals intelligence but it clearly doesn't it just doesn't and they like to say that because they invested all this money all this time and they like to have a moral superior order over everybody else but it's just not true I know people that have PhDs that are fucking idiots okay here's the thing when you go out into entrepreneurship and you go out into business there is going to be a way to do things that is usually outside the norm if you want to be successful it's how you innovate processes how you not just products but how you innovate processes and how you innovate the delivery of a product and how you innovate the marketing of a product and that requires you to see outside the framework of what everybody else is doing and that's where I think the advantages for those kind of students because a lot of DNC students are dumb fucks okay but there's a lot of very intelligent DNC students like I was who test very high on tests but I can't stand to sit here and learn from some dumb ass who's driving away in a beater right to meet when I was 14 years old I recognized that right so I never did good in school because I'm like bro why am I listening to this guy when he hasn't really done anything but talk about the thing right and when we look at the education process you know it's really a test in an indoctrination into following directions so that you understand how to operate in the real world and most people need that most people have to be told one two three four five six seven there's nothing wrong with that but when you think like that I think it does put you at a disadvantage to be able to innovate processes innovate products innovate marketing innovate the competitive advantage that you're going to need to create so that's my take on it I don't think one way is better than the other but if maybe maybe there is a little bit of truth to there's definitely some truth to it for me okay so go out and build something real go out and build something equitable go out and build a real company go out and fucking use the tools that you can learn from some of these coaches that are just part of the puzzle right like you can learn how to get fit you can learn how to create a funnel you can learn how to run ads you can learn how to do these things and then use those things to create an equitable business so that later on in life you have a you know nest egg that you can you know borrow against or liquidate or exit and have something for your retirement dude so you know that your people that your teachers you know if you're in college and you're listening to some guy who's never done shit bro be very careful what you take the heart and what you don't you know what I'm saying like people have to be living what it is they're trying to teach you how to do if you really want to use their advice to go be successful so to answer the question dude you know there might be some truth to it but I I know people who are successful across all ranges there's just some people that are just good and super intelligent and they're able to pass the test but they're also able to see outside the box right you see what I'm saying so if you're a C or D student out here that's not something to celebrate and say fuck yeah I'm gonna start a business yeah no what I'm saying is is like you got to be careful what you say because a lot of these college kids and high school kids that listen to this shit they they will hear that and then they will just quit trying like dude even if you think that it's pointless to do what it is that you do in a standardized school environment it is very important that you try hard because that trying hard and that practice and that discipline will translate over into something else so don't just say hey fuck it this is pointless say hey I'm here I've got to complete this is what I have to do I'm gonna do my best because that will condition you to having the habits that you need outside of that environment even though that environment is not producing the result that you want that makes sense makes perfect yeah make perfect so let me follow up with this so what are because I mean you know obviously with the school system it is more of a what to think not how to think right which is what's really necessary in the real world yeah now this thinking outside the box you talk about the innovation side of things what what would you say are some other common denominators amongst entrepreneurs like things that you know I mean you've met a shit ten of them right like I mean what are what are some things that you know all of you guys you would say you had in common outside of the thinking outside of the box well I think first off and foremost all success watchpreneurs are unwilling 100% unwilling to accept the status quo for their life all right they're not going to be like everybody else no matter what it takes no matter what it takes doesn't matter that's the first thing the second thing is that they all have big dreams they don't just think small they don't think realistic like when you teachers and your friends say oh have realistic thoughts have realistic goals yeah if you want to be a small little peasant that's a good thing but all the people that you look up to that you want to embody and you want to fucking be like those people are dreaming so big that most people can't comprehend it and because they dream big the actions they take are naturally bigger which even if they don't reach the actual dream that they have they will be so much further along than everybody else that it's a success anyway so those are two things I think relentless grit and fortitude and endurance mental toughness is 100% a requirement to get past you know the level of quote unquote mediocre and average so most of the people that you are successful dedicate an extreme amount of time to intentionally put them themselves in uncomfortable positions like the 75 hard and live hard program so that they can build that resilience that grit that fortitude that mental toughness to get through the path because the path only gets harder it never gets easier and that's a myth that people have people think oh once I get here it'll be easier no the higher you go that you're competing against better competitors and it gets much fucking harder it's harder for Michael Jordan to play high school basketball or fucking pro basketball right you see what I'm saying right it gets harder so you have to build the skill set and you have to build that mental toughness to go down the path effectively I think they have that in common uh I think most of these people are highly dedicated to self education meaning they're reading books they're listening to podcasts they're taking notes but then what makes them different from everybody else it does those things is that they actually take those lessons and apply them in real life so the application of the lessons that all of you guys consume but most of you don't apply they do apply religiously so I think those are some common things uh most of those guys are fit most people who are successful are somewhat fit uh and I know there's exceptions to that you know when you look at like you know Trump or fucking Elon you know they're not super fit guys but they're also so far past the point of like that initial grind phase that it's not really that important anymore to them you know I'm saying and I think they're the anomaly most entrepreneurs that are successful in this day and age are taking very good care of their bodies and their minds and a consistent basis um why is that yeah because it's it's your tool this is the fucking tool bro your tool is you so if you're going to battle with this being your tool don't you want this tool to be the best possible thing your mind your body your spirit these are these are tools bro so they sharpen that I think another thing that a lot of these guys have in common is that uh they don't keep losers around them for any amount of time bro they don't allow drama in their life they don't allow gossip in their life they don't allow people who drama and gossip in their life they don't allow distractions their circle is small they associate with other people who think like them who have goals like them want to win like them and they cut everybody else out they're very hard to get to um so those are some things that I would say are in common there's a lot more to you but those are off top of my head yeah for sure man I love it I love it uh well guys Andy question number two Andy I'm 16 years old and my question is about motivation and success what have you found to be the best form of motivation for achieving success I see other people winning but I sometimes look at my environment and I can't connect the dots on how to make that a reality in my life how the fuck can you look at your situation that you're currently living and not be fucking motivated if you can't look around at your current life and say fuck this sucks and be motivated for more bro you can't do it you should just quit go do something else because your existing situation in life should be enough motivation to get you started now motivation when you start is cool right it feels good but the reality is motivation is not the key to the castle bro discipline is the key to the castle because there's going to be lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of times in fact the majority of the time that you are not going to wake up in the morning and say fuck dude I really feel like going out and get my balls kicked in all day that's not going to happen so you have to say hey I'm going to do this regardless of how I feel I'm going to execute even if I'm having a bad day even if my dog died even if I had to do this even if this shit's going wrong my shit is getting done day in and day out and that is the fucking secret sauce about winning it's not motivation but motivation feels good and motivation is valuable especially when you're in the beginning so if you can't look around and say fuck dude my life is fucked up I want way more than this I want better than this and be motivated to go down the path bro you don't have it you don't have it that's it you do not fucking have it you should just accept your reality like all your friends all your family go sit on the fucking bench and watch the game where everybody else is going to go out and kick ass because you don't have it if your current situation doesn't motivate you that's the fucking facts of the matter why do so many people look for external motivation like what do you what do you think the disconnect is well there's a fucking you know in society bro there's and there is a disproportionate amount of value placed on motivation compared to discipline people think that it's motivation they think oh dude let's go do this right and they don't understand that it doesn't matter if you feel like doing it what matters is is that you do it and that's the biggest key that most people can't connect because dude we hear this term motivational speaker okay so this is why I don't like speaking really dude even though I'm great at it you know you go to this event you pay fucking 500 bucks the motherfucker tells you some shit you walk out of there you're hyped and you go home and you know do anything okay so events are great but you should go to events where they're gonna teach you one two three fours these are the steps to do it because if you don't have that intrinsic motivation to do it to at least get started you can't start so that's assumed that you have that right and then you have to work on your discipline you have to work on your ability to execute when you don't feel like doing it and that's what the live hard program is so important um you know I don't know a single person who wakes up every single day and says fuck I can't wait I can't wait to go you know get my ass kicked like because that's the reality of entrepreneurship it sounds absurd right I can't wait to go work life dude it's life bro yeah it's life it's hard it's fucking grind it's grueling and because we have all these entrepreneur bozos on the fucking internet who never built a goddamn thing talking about you know how easy it is and how cool it is and how it's awesome you're getting all these kids sucked into this game of entrepreneurship when in reality only eight percent of people are entrepreneurs and only one percent of that eight percent is actually successful at it it is a very hard career it is the hardest career you could ever choose in your fucking life so if you think it's gonna be easy fun and you're gonna have freedom and all this shit you're drinking the Kool-A they didn't true you're in for a rude awakening the shit I tell you and the shit anybody else who's built something real will tell you is that you have to fucking go hard every single day no matter what no matter what you feel like no matter what's going wrong and your shit has to get done and that's it that's how you get there so I don't really you know motivation for me dude is not a thing anymore I don't even think about it I don't I don't wake up and think man I don't feel like doing that or whatever because it's irrelevant and once you live the discipline lifestyle for long enough motivation does become irrelevant and it's almost comical when people bring it up like bro that's very amateur way of thinking and I don't fault you for thinking that way because that's how everybody thinks but what we have to do is we have to shift your mindset from it from I got to feel like doing it to it doesn't matter if I feel like doing it I'm gonna get it done anyway and that's what winners do that's how people build amazing shit that's how they become great and that's how you it's gonna be no different for you yeah so you're saying this so so using motivation or or feeling the need to need motivation that'll get you going a decent amount but at some point you got to you got to cross that line over to this other animal mindset of of it doesn't matter how I feel what's your life gonna look like if you don't do it what's your life gonna look like if you don't fucking go out and build what the fuck you want to build that you have this little vision in your heart and in your mind of what your life should be like and what are you gonna feel like if you don't go do that what are you gonna feel like in a year five years ten years 20 years when you die what are you going to be saying because I could promise you bro that dream ain't going away that dream was placed in your heart and in your mind by God it is your purpose and you are obligated to go build it and for you to go build that it's going to require executing when you don't fucking feel like it so you better just go out and figure this out right now it's discipline it's not motivation look around your life if if you can't go from looking around your life then just expect your life to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and in 20 years you're gonna be saying fuck I should have fucking went I should have went and did that and 20 more years past that if you don't do it then you're gonna be saying fuck I wasted 40 years I wasted my life fuck that's what's gonna be that's gonna happen to you go ask someone who's 60 years old if they regret not following their dreams I promise you if you get in to be honest they're gonna say yeah yeah fuck man that's real shit man I know it's real shit bro that's where most of these people fucking fuck their lives up yeah they think like you got a field like bro I walk in here every fucking that probably out of the seven days a week that I come in here there's probably two of the days that I feel like it and I have the greatest fucking company in the world bro I work with the baddest ass people I don't work with a bunch of Karen corporate fucks I work with badass mother fuckers that give a shit yeah and it's still hard because our goals are so big okay so it doesn't matter if I fucking and I'm tired or if I don't feel like it bro I have to do it and so like dude you guys have to quit valuing this thing that all these nerds on the internet call motivation and start realizing what actually matters and what matters is is do you have the capacity to execute at a high standard when you don't feel like it especially when you don't feel like it because when you don't feel like it is when everybody else quits and that's when you widen the gap between yourself and everybody else so let's say those four days why don't feel like it I'm competing against Joe down the street and when he comes in on his four days that he doesn't feel like it he does half ass shit but on my four days I'm executing at the highest level because I've developed that skill set of discipline do so over time I'm going to widen that gap further and further and further and further and further and further and further away from that dude and this is how the game works it is legitimately a mathematical equation how many days did you win how many days did they win that's it it's math bro it's not magic it's not mystical it's not success fairy nonsense it's not luck it is fucking math how many mother fucking days can you win at a high standard especially when you don't feel like it because that's when everybody else quits no I fucking love it man I love it guys Andy R third and final question question number three Andy Andy I have been grinding for the last five years and I'm about to purchase my first really nice car I've been working my ass off my family's good kicking ass at work my question is how do I know if it's the right thing is it just an emotional purchase I've been putting off going to the dealer for three days now I can't really pinpoint why did you deal with this when you bought your first nice car and if so how did you overcome it well first of all I didn't buy my nice car until I was 11 years in business not five all right I don't know where the fuck you are but I was doing very well I was making seven figures when I bought my first nice car okay so there's that okay um so let's let's reevaluate where you're actually at are you making over a million dollars a year in income because if not I wouldn't buy shit and I would take all that money and I would dedicate it to building your cash flow building your company building your career because every single fucking dollar that you don't do that with is more time that's going to take for you to get there okay so where are you really at do you want to buy this car because you think it's going to make it look successful or do you want to buy this car because you're a car of Fishingado and you're passionate and it's something that you love that's what I am okay I don't buy I don't even show you guys my fucking shit okay I love cars I love driving it is important hobby to me it just so happens to be expensive so but the truth of the matter is is when I bought my first car I was making over a million bucks a year I was 11 years in business and you guys see all this bullshit on the internet and you think you need to have this shit and I know this is the answer that you probably don't want to hear but this is definitely one perspective now another perspective which is also true is that you need to touch and feel and experience success along the way to keep you going to keep you understanding that this is how my life is going to turn out and it needs you need to touch it you need to experience it now you don't necessarily have to buy a car for that you can rent a car you could go on a trip you can go see the houses whatever you want to do but there is truth to experiencing that but this fake it till you make it mentality that the internet creates is completely false these kids that go out there and buy these cars and they're front in this shit it's only a matter of time before they don't have many more I mean dude I've been doing the internet games is 2012 you know how many people I've seen come and go with a fucking you know a couple cars and then they're bragging and they're talking all the shit in the next year they don't have shit they're talking about you know what they're doing you know what they say you know what I decided that you know these cars are just too materialistic for me and I'm kind of over it you know I just want to be be a little more humble and other things are more important to me just like I talked about on last Q&A F where I talk about people who take their dreams and they take what they have currently and then they try to say oh this is what I actually wanted right so usually what these guys do is they go out they buy these cars they front on the internet they stop making money they lose their cars and then they come up with a fucking story about how they never wanted them in the first place which is completely fucking bullshit much happier now you don't want to be the motherfucker to get the cars and then has them disappear you don't want to be that guy bro so I would evaluate what's more important to you is it more important to feel cool and look cool or is it more important to build an actual business I would argue that it's way more important to build an actual business now you might be making ten million dollars a year and I don't know that no and if you if you are you know they're you got a little more freedom to indulge in things like that no you know there are there are guys out here who will say you know you should never buy a car that's worth more than fucking 20 grand or whatever right well you know I disagree with that you know that's what it is like why the fuck do we do all this shit right why the fuck if I work 25 years oh it's so I can fucking roll around a badass shit that I enjoy but have you paid your dues yet that's the only question that's a question that only you can answer yeah so I would evaluate where you are be honest with yourself about where you are um be honest with yourself about your income and if you've got a stretch and finance that shit out just to like dude don't do that don't put yourself in a vulnerable position especially in the early days and I know your five years in you think you're not in the early days you're still in the fucking early days bro so that's my answer to that yeah let's just talk about rewarding yourself in general right like what what have you found to be the best way like how do you reward yourself for for the hard work you put in you know when you when you've been planting for for so long and you stress seeing those those those sprouts come up a little bit right what that's the reward the reward is seeing the progress the reward is looking at your business and saying oh man I did $14,000 today oh man I did $32,000 day oh man we did 80,000 oh we did 200,000 oh we did five million of that you see what I'm saying that's the fucking reward bro because that business is equitable meaning you can borrow against it you could sell it you can exit it and it's worth exponentially more than what you're going to take home and payroll so that is the winning for the actual winners the actual operators who love business the reward is the winning all the other shit doesn't mean anything bro I could really like as much as I love cars I don't give a fuck you know what I'm saying like as much as I love my house and my properties I don't give a fuck I like winning winning is fun I like seeing things go from my ideas to paper to in person in life and sprout and create and win that battle that's that's the reward bro and you guys get caught up in this and by the way I like material shit but you guys do get two caught up in this materialistic shit and you don't understand that the game is not about how much material shit you can acquire it's about how much progress you can make so instead of building your value in what you can acquire what you can buy or what you your perceived lifestyle is you should build your value on what your real successes and what your real progress is otherwise you're going to end up like one of these fucking clowns who has the shit for a minute and then doesn't have it and then like you know what you're all afraid of is getting laughed at then everybody laughs at you so don't be that guy all right well some some extra sauce for this is getting some some extra extra sauce for Monday morning juicy juice yeah let's do it guys any question number four uh what's up Andy and DJ I got a question uh for you all that I've been noticing in my work environment I'm 24 years old not a hoe um I work as a junior senior high school math teacher and I'm also the dean of students uh of the junior senior high school uh yeah that's fucking great 20 young man that's super young you know one of my best teachers I had was young when I had him was super young yeah his name was I talked about him on show for Kevin Walsh my teachers are old yeah he's he's uh luke Walsh's dad you know the basketball player oh no shit yeah so Kevin taught us uh he had this class called current issues which is the inspiration for what we do now right at bro we we man I'm sorry Kevin I love that dude he's such a good dude but we were such little fox like I'm surprised he and beat our asses but dude hey I took what you taught we're doing something with it bro number one show ready there we go appreciate it bro there we go but yeah dude uh that's a that's a young man that's young man um now since I'm on the administrative team at the school school culture is super important to me one of the things that I've started to notice with my boss the school principal uh in the veteran teachers uh is that most of them will take the initiative to get something done which is great however 90% of the time they will not relay or communicate that information with the parties involved causing mass confusion between staff members and even myself my question is when do you take the initiative on something that will involve multiple people the multiple parties what is the most effective way you have found to communicate that with them I'm all about taking the initiative on things that I know uh and I know that's one of your core values and beliefs within your own businesses uh but from what I am seeing is that pieces on the chess board are moving without any explanation as to why they are moving uh I understand I'm very young to be in the leadership position like this I have a lot to learn but am I looking at this from the wrong perspective or is there a true issue here uh interesting to hear your thoughts well first of all man you know let me say this leadership is a lifelong learning process so you're gonna you're gonna be getting better even when you're 44 okay um I feel like I learn new things every single day and I've been leading big teams for a long time and this is probably the first time that you've led a big team and so communication is a huge deal huge deal um to set the standard for communication at least in the beginning you almost have to have a micro management role you have to basically say hey this is what I need this is what I want you to do and back in the early days when I was setting this up I'd actually write this shit out on a piece of paper and make them sign it so yeah so like I would say okay here's what you want here's the process all right so I used to do this thing I don't do anymore where if I sent out a group text to everybody they had to reply back um that they confirmed it they received it and they understood it and that was so that later on if they didn't do it I could say well hey you replied back to this you said this right so like that would be the process that was in the paper I would say all right here's how we're gonna dictate directions here's how we're gonna do things here's the process for this if I text you this is what the response should be if you understand it if you don't understand it text me on the side ask me the question we'll figure it out um so really dude in my opinion I think this is a matter of getting you know all the graybeards and the old dogs to really understand how you're gonna run things which is just gonna require some clear communication and some assertiveness on your point which can be intimidating when everybody else is much older than you you know when I was in my 30s or I'm in my 20s I had a lot of people that worked that were older than me and um that was a unique situation because for some reason people think that if they're older than you they're automatically more skilled or talented than you uh and that's just not the case so that's what I would do I would take a piece of paper I would say this is how I want it to flow and I would sit down with all of your people and I would say okay that I'm trying like you know you're you're let's say the the lady who's 60 years old who's been there for 30 years right sit down with her say Mary look I'm trying to get everybody coordinated so that we aren't just moving chess pieces all over the board and we've got a cohesive movement that we're trying to create for these kids so that everybody can get what we need him to get and right now here's what's happening certain people are doing it this way certain people are doing it this way and it makes everything not work your jobs not working my jobs not working so I've come up with this little solution on how to get everybody on the same page and this is what it's gonna look like and you line it out on the piece of paper and you're gonna say it then you're gonna show it to or you're gonna say now do you have any feedback for that or anything you think and this is in a private setting right not because if you start this in a public setting it'll start all the chart in her bill I think this I think that I can't run shit by committee okay it's if you run a team and you're fucking running it by committee you're gonna fucking lose you will you will end up with such vanilla bullshit this is why most companies end up getting bad in the beginning the run by a founder the run by a close knit group of team then they get bigger and they get all these corporate fucks involving their company and then they sit around a table and they eliminate everything cool to be safe and it ends up with a vanilla product vanilla marketing vanilla fucking processes and then you end up losing so sit down with Mary go through the list ask her for her feedback say hey this is what do you think where can we improve and I would go to the people that you trust the most first all right go to the people who you know are going to have good ideas and tell you the truth first because they're likely going to point out the holes in your processes quick that way when you go to the lesser trusted employees or the lesser body employees the teachers they will they will those holes will be covered so they'll be less static there you know what I'm saying yeah yeah and then you sit down with them you say okay uh so this is what I expect I'm gonna have you sign this and I'm gonna have everybody sign it uh that way we're all on the same page and your great teachers your great employees are gonna say fuck thank god I'm so tired of this shit being all over the place most employees are teat in this case teachers they love clear cut communication there is nothing worse than wondering what the fuck is going on okay everybody here has been an employee at some time do you guys not hate that because I fucking hated it I want to know what the fuck is going on and I want to know exactly what to do and not only do I want to know exactly what to do I want to know exactly what to do so that I'm valued so that I can move up in my career alright so you as a young man you need to realize that most people crave clear concise leadership and by you sitting down and doing this you're gonna build that framework for your team and yeah you're gonna have some kick back and yeah you're gonna have some mistakes but you address those individually as they happen okay so like let's say you set you sign these contracts and everybody fucking goes out and starts to do it and then you got one guy who's a problem you don't take the whole team like you guys are fucking doing this I used to do that when I was younger and it was the wrong move yeah because then it makes an issue for everybody so you go over to Steve over here who's stuck in the old ways you say Steve you sign this contract bro this is what I expect this is what we're gonna do and if you can't do that I'm gonna have to let you go or you're you know you're gonna have to go somewhere else yeah and you know he'll either get in line or he won't and if he does it that's okay just find somebody that will and by the way when you bring new people in to a culture that already exists in a system that already exists there's no pushback because that's just the way that it always was so after a while this just becomes the way and you don't have to do this formality of actually setting the framework does that make sense okay I love it I fucking love it guys Andy that was four don't be a horror
