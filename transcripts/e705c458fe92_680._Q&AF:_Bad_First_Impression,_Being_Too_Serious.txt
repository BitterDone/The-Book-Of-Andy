let's do announcement man guys make sure you jump that out jump the other announcement is we have come to a based off of yesterday's conversation we have come to a very solid decision that black people do not pay more for their phone bill the white people now bullshit bullshit the YouTube people on the YouTube commented they're all liars are 100% they're all liars 100% fact liars calling black people liars I'm calling those black people guys those new blind I didn't say that no man yeah then it's it's true all right it is true I listen and like I'm sure there's very it's not true it is felonious hey people spoke to three people three people all fucking liars yeah it's what it is man all right let's let's make some people better today let's do that we got some great questions lined up here guys Andy question number one Andy I have a friend who just met his girlfriend's parents he feels like he completely screwed it up what advice can you give him on how to recover that how do I fix a bad first impression that dude I just quit yeah just move on your screw dude yeah dad's never gonna like you mom's gonna hate you forever you're gonna get probably beat up by the dad you know harassed I just quit yeah fuck it dump her dump her ass all right what's next question hey look man everybody understands what it's like to fuck up a first impression dude you got to understand man like sometimes it takes five six seven times to actually warm up to people people have different temperatures about social relationships you know I'm one of those people that it's gonna take me four or five six times and you know when you're dating some dudes daughter I'm sure it's gonna take more than once and oftentimes these little goof ups that we have that are awkward in the beginning become the jokes and they become part of the glue that makes the relationship actually work you know a lot of my friends that I'm really good friends with bro I didn't like when I first met him at all I actually and it's interesting because the reason I like him is because they were like me and you know I don't like me but uh but look for real dude like I think that's normal you know especially when you're a young man uh there's a lot of pressure on that you want to do a good job but like bro everybody's awkward in those situations it's just awkward hey dude I'm here to bang your daughter like it's just fucking weird man it's weird yeah so like um I wouldn't worry about it dude I would just you know keep going and do better next time and I'm sure you will and and these little these little goof ups will be funny stories one day man you know we're we're gonna mess up first impressions all kinds of times um but I would also say this you know I think a lot of people put a lot of effort into creating a good first impression that is very out of line with how they really are and that's equally maybe even more uh negative than having a mess up in the first you know meeting that you have with someone yeah because here's what happens you know you pretend to be really good and we see this in relationships a lot right each person's trying to be the best version of themselves and put on the best front and you know they start to like each other and they start to get along and then six months later the the fucking pretending stops and you realize holy shit this person's not anything like what I thought they were and they're realizing the same about you because you guys are both trying to trick each other and to like each other and that's that's damaging as well so I think a good mix of good manners you know uh treating people with respect and authenticity about what your thoughts are who you are um and just keeping it real as the best way to to create a good impression uh over the course of a short amount of time yeah do you are the fundamentals I guess to first impressions are they the same uh with any relationship specifically I mean again your entrepreneurial you've been in business for you for you know two and a half decades are are our first impressions in business are the fundamentals the same yeah especially in the beginning dude um you know when you get established and you've done enough things your reputation precedes the actual meeting you know so like when you're established and you you're doing well people have a preconceived notion of what you're going to be like so really what happens is when you meet them it usually either solidifies what that is or it disrupts what that image is and uh either way it works in your favor because these people already know about you and so it's them trying to endure themselves to you not you trying to endure themselves to them and it allows you to be more authentic more real which creates a faster bond with people um in the beginning it's not like that nobody knows who you are nobody gives a fuck you're just another name another face and uh it's important to figure out how to make a good impression and that's going to come simply in this day and age simply from doing some old school things very effectively you know when you shake someone's hand shake it firmly not overly firm don't try to crush their hand but a firm manly handshake not some dead fish dead look them in the fucking eye and say nice to meet you you know what i'm saying uh try to remember their name you know some people are not good with names and they have to figure out name associations you know they're they're if you go read Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence people it's a really good book for this kind of situation um and it's basic but society has eroded so far uh in terms of interpersonal skills because everybody has their face glued to a screen that to stand out make a good impression is actually pretty easy nowadays it's just called being a normal human being so you know don't be afraid you're not even a reason to be afraid of anybody shake your hands and nice to meet you and here's another thing when your intent is good inside of your heart and you have good intent you have nothing to be afraid of man like if you if you have good intent for people what are you fucking afraid of them finding out you see what i'm saying so if you're afraid and you're nervous what what are you afraid nervous for yeah what are you hiding yeah or are you just not comfortable with with the skill set of talking to people and if that's the case then that's going to come down to reps that's where you bring out that trick that i tell you guys all the time about going to the grocery store and meeting three people as a game as just reps having a conversation with three random strangers and then leave it and doing that on a daily basis bro i did that day after day after day after day for years on top of a retail uh business model where i was meeting people i didn't know all the time and if you're young and you can get into a retail situation where you're going to talk to you know 30 people 40 people a day it's worth taking that job even if it's not your main thing because of the skills that you're going to learn so a lot of people won't do that they're too good for that they're you know i'm not going to work retail motherfucker dude let me tell you something the reason i am who i am is because i spent all that time on that retail floor talking to people getting to know people spending time with people shaking hands having conversations with very limited amounts of information and connecting with people that's an invaluable skill set that supersedes any other tool or any other hack or any other type of income strategy that you might have if you can handle people effectively you are at a massive advantage because you understand psychology you understand how people respond you understand how people respond online because they're very similar at what they do in person it just gives you a very deep understanding of how to relate to people which is going to benefit you in every area of your life it's going to benefit you at your job it's going to benefit you in your business it's going to benefit you with the opposite sex it's going to benefit you with um same sex yeah sure dude same say whatever man it's going to benefit you in all your relationships you know uh everywhere so i would put the time in investing in that skill and the reason it's you know it's just like anything bro the scarier the shit the more valuable it is because the less people that will do it so when you think about like like being able to walk up to the woman of your dreams without hesitation that's a valuable skill bro because that might be the one you see what i'm saying otherwise the people who don't have those skills they just take what they get they take the friendships they get they take the the shit they get at their job they take the relationships they get and they don't actually go out and create them intentionally and then they wonder why they're surrounded by all these people who aren't at the level that they want their friends and their relationships to be at you have to be intentional about it because the people up here that you want to be around they have to be intentionally created and brought into your life and that means you have to be comfortable hey i'm Steve nice to meet you this is what i do what do you do what are you into you see what i'm saying like you have to be able to do these basic things and most people just cannot do them and if you could get yourself in a position to do them bro you're to mass advantage over everybody else i love it i love it guys any question number two when i saw this question at first i was like okay with the fuck is this but then there's actually this is a really good question here okay all right hi Andy uh Andy i am struggling with being too serious i compete in dog sports uh dog sports okay all right like we're the dog run through the tunnels i think so yeah jumps okay um and at the level uh and and the level i am training to compete at would be the equivalent of a super bowl uh the best of the best all of my extra resources are dedicated to achieving this goal uh one way or another i have had some success and wins but i'm still paying my dues to get where i want to be my coaches called me out a couple of times saying that i'm too serious and i need to let loose i know she is right as my seriousness is starting to affect my newest teammate my young upcoming dog in a negative way i am having a hard time knowing how to not be too serious while still keeping my foot on the gas i usually have no problem laughing at myself or my dogs when we make mistakes and i'm no stranger to learning from failure and pushing forward but how do you balance being serious about a goal while still being able to let loose and enjoy the process well first of all i would say this the fact that you're too serious and that you need to bring it back a little bit in your mind that's better than someone who's not serious at all that needs to up their game so you're work you're you're in a better spot than those people um when someone tells you do let me tell you something i i am an intense person okay i don't think that's a surprise to many people um i want to win real fucking bad and i take it real serious and when i go on stage and speak i'm serious i'm not fucking around okay and if you've ever seen me speak you fucking know that's true it's a completely different thing all right and i'm serious about success i'm serious about winning i'm serious about helping you win and i got a critique one time from someone i respected who told me that i was too serious and i needed to bring it down and for like two years i tried to like listen to that advice because i respected that person and you know what happened i fucking sucked okay so when we when we have people telling us we're too serious we have to consider what the source is and why they're doing that and it's not for everybody to be easy and relaxed and fun and carefree and i realize as a serious person that you may look at other people and you think what's wrong with you well some people are just built for the fucking fight bro some people are built to win some people are built to go hard and people that aren't don't understand that they're never going to get that they're always going to tell you take it easy why are you so uptight why are you so aggressive why do you care so much you need to laugh you need to smile you need to do this because they're not wired like you they're never going to understand it so if you think that you need to be less serious that's one thing but if you're just listening to people around you i wouldn't listen to them i would do your game i play your game i'd be who you are and i'd be comfortable being who you are because serious people change the fucking world serious people win championships serious people get inducted into the hall of fame serious people cure cancer serious people build innovation serious people create all the real shit in society now that's not saying you can't have an unserious side when i'm not competing when i'm not in business and i'm not on stage and i'm not doing things that in my opinion are very important i am pretty relaxed i'm pretty much a guy that fucks around a lot and talks a lot of shit and jokes around and that's the that's the yin and the yang of my personality yeah over here when it's game time and we're on the field i'm gonna fucking kill you dude okay right after the game we we could be joking around having fun it's not a personal thing i'm just i just want to win and so my advice to you would be to consider if you really feel this way or if people are just telling you that you are this way and decide if that's true if you feel that you are this way and you think you need to change a little bit i would consider compartmentalizing where you're serious and where you're not and then also realizing that dude we're all gonna die all right these people that you're doing the sport with that you're around these are your fucking friends like even my competitors like people that i compete with the own other companies i talked to these motherfuckers on the phone we talk shit we goof around we last night i spent two hours on the phone with two different owners of big supplement brands that you guys would know and the whole time it was just talking shit being cool being friends and it's it's okay to compete with someone and still be friends with them in fact real winners want to be friends with the most competitive people to drive them because they understand that when those guys win big it drives you to push harder and win more and it's like for me when i was younger and less mature it was a personal thing like i wanted to burn your fucking house down bro i was offended that you even thought you could compete with me i would be pissed off that you even showed up to fucking compete the fact that you think you could compete with me fucking pissed me off okay and that's how i thought about it for a long time and i ran really hot and the problem with that is is nobody wanted to be cool with me nobody wanted to fucking invite me to the parties and for good reason right and when i started to realize is that i got older is that it's cool when other people win and it's cool when they do big things because it inspires me to go out and compete with them and i don't have to hate them i don't have to dislike them in fact i value them very much because of the inspiration that they provide okay so when you get into like the upper circles of success in business people are supportive but also competitive and i know that's hard for for younger people to to grasp but my point here is that maybe you need a perspective realignment around the people that you're competing with and realize that you're spending all this time in this community these are your friends yes you're competing so there's no reason not to enjoy it and laugh and you know when you fuck up you can say oh well fucked up you know and i think that i think that in itself is a point that people need to be comfortable with too is like hey when you don't play good you just say i didn't fucking play good you know hey when you lose hey i had to take an L there it wasn't you know i didn't plan on that and if you just own your shit there's less pressure you know what i mean so i would consider those perspectives and you know if you want to be happy and you want to win and be happy you you have to be inspired by the people you compete against and if you want to win and you want to be miserable you could just stop on everybody's throat all the time and fucking have no respect for and whatsoever but the problem with that is is that when you get ahead of them they don't inspire you so you get complacent and they end up passing you so it's very very important in my opinion to be inspired by winning and also be competitive with people who win and i think that's that's what creates a symbiotic relationship amongst people who are competing like all my friends dude like people i'm friends with i'm trying to beat them they all know they know it they know it yeah and and they're trying to beat me and i know and you know it and and the cool thing is when they when they do something that beats me i could say hey which by the way ain't very often but i could say hey what'd you do there and when i do something good they could say hey what'd you do there and we help it's probably like jujitsu bro like how you guys all help each other get better it's the same kind of thing if you got like that's one thing i'm thankful for like all my friends the people i talk to who are in my industry or just other entrepreneurs that's how they all operate it's not this like it's not this like cut off your head mentality it's the personal mindset yeah yes we want to win but there's a there's a it's not personal it's no ability how there's no ability in it yeah i think so yeah yeah so so i would encourage you to maybe think about all those things and you know maybe when you're in the competition yeah be serious but when you're you know friends with these people be cool with them and realize that like you don't want to go through this whole process of your sport and get to a point where you don't have any friends afterwards eventually your time's gonna end you're gonna want to share you know memories and talk with these people and they're all gonna hate you if you're dick you know so i don't know those are my thoughts yeah um let me let me actually this too because you know you said you know you did follow that advice right and took you two years and you said in your words you were shit during those three years right how did you one become aware that okay i've been off yeah and then two what did you do to get back on what did what did you do to decide it i just made a decision i decided you know what this motherfucker don't know what he's talking about i'm 10 times better when i do this so fuck him i'm gonna do what i want yeah and that's it like like like you know dude we got to be very careful how we take advice because people will give you advice for all sorts of reasons and i know the reason i got that advice the reason i got that fucking advice was because i'm so fucking good at what i do that when i tone it back a little bit people appear to be better so i'm not down with that like you you get what i'm saying yeah like bro like if you're if you're truly competing with someone there are people that will give you bad feedback and you got to be able to fucking determine is this person giving me real feedback or is this person trying to make me easier to beat for them you see what i'm saying so that's that's the game though bro you got to be able to determine that yeah fine you know and whether that person wanted me to pull back so that i was easier to compete with or whether they thought that was genuine i don't know but i know this i know when i said hey fuck that i'm gonna do what the fuck i want to do i got way better and you know zoltan talking to zoltan uh he he understands that very well uh when he was at the house we were having this conversation about you know how victim culture has created this mentality where everybody has to tone it down everybody has to you know have balance and everybody has this we're talking about that and he's like bro but the world needs warriors too man that's your feature that's right and that's what i'm built for i am built for the fucking fight and there's just nothing i can do about it and every time i try to find peace somewhere else it doesn't work my piece is found in the battle my piece is found in the process my piece is found in all the other things that everybody else tries to avoid and i've just had to come to terms with that's how i'm built and how i'm wired and when i'm in that fight i'm much happier and there's a lot of people that are wired like that that get told by society it's too much it's too intense it's too that yeah it is too much for those motherfuckers because those motherfuckers are drinking beer and they're fucking driveway on a fucking Coleman cooler talking about the glory days now of course it's too much it reminds them that they're shit and you're not so fuck them i fucking love it man let's get to our third and final question andy question number three uh hey andy i recently opened up a martial arts gym in the city i've been practicing martial arts specifically jiu jitsu for the past 20 years things are slow and i haven't been able to attract too many people to the gym my question is how should i market my gym to increase and attract attention to my gym much love to Chicago so we're talking about i guess on the ground market and how do you get the word out when you got something when you feel like you have something look man they're it's so easy to get the word out now like honestly this question is a little embarrassing dude because back in my day i had to walk to school uphill both ways right and five feet of fucking snow right okay i look real talk the thing is guys is that it is actually a lot easier right now and you need to understand that the tools you have are some of the most valuable tools that have ever been created for building a small business you have the ability to geotarget an actual area and do online ads for fucking basically nothing to attract people into your gym you have the ability to do things that people have forgotten about like mailers mailers work really well right now because nobody uses them okay um you also have and by the way i didn't have this shit just so just so we're clear i didn't have the money to do mailers and then the money to do advertising i spent the first three years of my fucking business going door to door saying hey i'm Andy we sell fucking vitamins if you ever need vitamins come down and see me right like for real dude over and over and over and over again and when i got to the end i started over at the beginning and i went through again when i got to the end i started over at the beginning and i went through again and you know what happened people in the neighborhood started to know who i was and you know what they did when they need a vitamins they came and saw me now a lot of people don't like that story because they're like fuck i don't want to do that but what are we accomplishing by doing that one we're entrenching ourselves in the community two we're getting reps with people which brings it back to the skill set we talked about earlier in the show three it's basically free because you're not missing out on any opportunity cost because you don't have any business yet okay so between the ability to go door to door which people don't like doing but it's a super valuable thing to do because dude people don't do it anymore so like when you do it it stands out right especially if you got cauliflower as you tell me come and do you get to your my guy i got a choice dude come but you can buy that with the technology we have on social media the technology that we have through digital marketing the technology that we have through techniques that um you know don't necessarily get thought of right away and then our ability to go door to door to door like bro there's there there's no reason you can't build this not only into a successful jujitsu gym but there's no reason that you can't turn it into the best gym in your area so we got a quit looking for the reasons we can't and we got to start looking for the reasons we can anybody can make anything work bro it's just what are you willing to do and the answer needs to be fucking anything because it's that hard that's how hard business is business is not a game it's not a it's not something everybody can do it's not something that it's not a fucking side hustle like the internet makes it seem like it's just this thing that it isn't and you have to be willing to do whatever the fuck it takes to get what it is you're trying to create and that means anything so whatever you have to do to meet people if you got to stand out on the corner and you're fucking ghee doing fucking kicks and shit i don't fucking know you know i'm saying breaking boards or whatever the fuck you guys do you know putting people and laying down and rubbing your balls on people i don't fucking know you're grabbing a blab built in the common beat his ass like put a sign on the corner and say if you could take me down i give you a free membership like i don't fucking know dude like there's so many ways to do this that like the question is like to me it's like come on man well let's talk about that though because i think this is an important part right and i don't know if i if i'm using the proper definition or wording here right but i want to call it like passion projects passion companies where you know this guy spent 20 years you know training jujitsu bro uh-huh that's zero years in business and so like thinking yeah just because you're really good in jujitsu that's right you know i'm saying so like can we just touch that because i mean business is its own unique skills it's a whole different skill but dude we see this with doctors we see this with lawyers we see this with people who are passionate about a skill set but don't necessarily no business so yes that's a great question by the way you have to you have to understand that while you're you have expertise here you don't have it here and this kills a lot of entrepreneurs because not just because they realize they don't know business but what happens is is once they know business they think they have what i call the Midas touch which means if i'm in nutritional supplements i think i can go be a restaurant tour i don't know shit about fucking opening a restaurant bro i know how to eat at a restaurant i know how to drink at a restaurant and i know how to have a good time at a restaurant but i don't know how to run a restaurant right right and so what happens is people think because they get a little success with their jujitsu gym that they can go open a sandwich store and an ice cream place and then you know a fucking break whatever dude right and and dude that really kills a lot of entrepreneurs too so i'd be wary of letting your brain convince you or letting your ego convince you that because you're an expert in one area that you're automatically an expert in another area that's just not true and a lot of people get killed that way and then just have an open mind like this is a this is a skill set go out and read every single fucking book on entrepreneurship that you can find i'd start with Seth goden read every set goden book because Seth goden talks about how to guerrilla market he gives awesome stories there's a store there's a book by Andrew Sirnovich called word of mouth marketing which is amazing there's a book called guerrilla marketing that you can get all three all of Seth goden's that one book by Sirnovich and the guerrilla marketing book those books right there will give you tons of ideas on how to create buzz and business um and and i think after you read those three books you're gonna have a clear direction on some things that you can do that are low cost uh but very effective you know ways to bring people in i love it man i love it well guys Andy that was three yep don't forget about tonight's apparel release 7
