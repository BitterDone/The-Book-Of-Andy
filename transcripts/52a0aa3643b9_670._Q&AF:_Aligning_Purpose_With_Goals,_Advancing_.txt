Welcome to motherfucking reality guys today we have Q and AF. For you submit the cues and we give you the AFs. Now you can submit your questions a few different ways. First way is guys you can email those questions in to ask Andy at Andy for Sulla dot com or you can go on YouTube in the comments section on the Q and AF episodes and you can ask your question right there in the comments and we'll pick some from there as well as we move through the week you're going to see different formats of shows. We're going to have Q and AF which is right now and then we're going to have CTI which is cruise the internet that's where we put up topics on the screen. We talk about what's going on we speculate on what's true what's not true and then we talk about how we the people have to solve some of these problems going on society. Other times you're going to get real talk real talk is just five to twenty minutes and me giving you some real talk and then we have 75 hard verses and 75 hard verses is where somebody who has completed the 75 hard program. Times on the show talks about how they were before how they are now we talk about how you can do the same that they've done using the 75 hard program and get your shit together if you're not familiar with the 75 hard program it is the initial phase of the live hard program which is available for free at episode two away. It is the world's largest mental toughness program ever and it's free. There is a book about this it's called the book on mental toughness you can go to my website and you for sell it calm you get the book it's not required the program is for free at episode two eight on audio feed only. But if you want to know the ins and outs and the ups and downs and everything in between the book on mental toughness is a great book it covers the entire live hard program plus ten chapters on mental toughness why it's important how to build it and what it will do for you and then some case studies on some very famous people and how they've used it to become the recognizable names that you know. So with all that being said we have this thing called the fee we're going to say pay the fee what that means is support the show all right we don't run ads on the show we don't run ads for the show we do not take money from companies and have them tell me what I can and can't say and will and won't do I pay for the show out of my pocket and I do that so that I can keep it real and not have a deal with any bullshit. So in exchange for that not spending 30 minutes of your day talking about a bunch of stuff I don't use I just ask very simply that you share the show we're constantly battling censorship and traffic bands and shadow bands and throttles and all these things especially when we talk about what's going on in the world on CTI and if you think the message is important we need you to share the show it doesn't get out without you guys so don't be a hoe show all right hey what's up dude it's going on my man oh yeah it's all with you oh you know nothing much nothing other other just beautiful Monday

been a couple days where I've been able to get the the Lincoln out and kind of crews with the top down and get some sun on my face and that feels good remember ready for the shirtless cardio session yeah me too bro that's I love that it's my favorite part especially when you come with me yeah right yeah so you know I'm kind of tired of looking like powder over here yeah yeah yeah I mean I gotta get my tan going it got a little light yeah yeah a little light I know bro I feel it I feel see through so I mean it could be where it could be like my dot yeah I think it's affecting my swag is that what it is yeah it was definitely affecting the credit score that's uh let's get into it man I got some guilt for you all right let's dive into this guys Andy question number one Andy I have recently made the decision to switch my mindset from trying 75 heart to doing 75 heart this decision and change of mindset has made me has made an unbelievable impact on my life in a very short amount of time I am a 25 year old business owner in my fourth year of business and recently discovered through this change of mindset that I have been operating the last three years without a clear understanding of my purpose thanks to you and 75 heart I was able to search my soul and find this purpose I finally find myself operating towards something bigger than monetary gain but I'm having trouble setting a long term goal that aligns with my purpose my question is how do I come up with long term goals that align with purpose how do you do that well look it's impossible to be driven it's impossible to be motivated and feel good about what you're doing if you don't have a purpose you know we have all these people talking about how burned out they are all the time right and really it's not burnout it's the fact that they don't really understand why they are doing what it is that they do and if I were to tell you hey uh come over here and just start hammering nails in the wall and just do that until I tell you to stop after an hour you're gonna be like this is fucking terrible but if I were to tell you hey uh we're gonna put all these nails in the wall because it's gonna be part of this bigger project that we're working on you would start to feel a purpose around why you're doing what you do and so having people uh clearly define their purpose is a big deal when it comes to feeling good about the work that you're doing and moving forward with speed with momentum with vigor with enthusiasm which is what creates the best work so it's super important that people you know figure out what the fuck that is because if you don't most people don't they live their whole life in this really miserable existence where they don't feel good about what they do they don't really understand why they're doing it it feels torturous because there's no real outcome to why they're doing what they do and most people never just take a minute to stop and say hey this is why I'm doing this and so I would highly encourage that for anybody at any age at any point in time in their life if they want to feel enthusiastic and happy about what the work that they do and also if they want to produce the best work now how do you figure out what your long term goals are you know most people think about their long term outcome and then they build their purpose around that you know what I'm saying so it sounds like this guy's doing it a little backwards okay but everybody I know that builds big stuff and does great things and it's happy in their life and fulfilled and excited they have a long term outcome in their mind and then they break it down into small steps in order to get to that that long term outcome so you have this big vision of what it is you're trying to create you break it down into step by step by step by step working it backwards from years in the future to where you are now and then you start executing that those steps this is pretty much second nature to anybody who's doing anything or has done anything this is how it works and and so I'm not real sure what he's asking when he's saying I found my purpose now I got to figure out my outcome because typically it's the other way around so what I would do is I would spend some time sitting down thinking about where it is you want to be what kind of life you want to live what do you want your life to look like get very detailed about it paint the picture in your mind over and over and over again through visualization every single day and then make practical action steps that will create that in the future over the course of the next five 10 15 years that you're going to break down into basically steps and then you're going to take those steps and you're going to break them down into you know what are my daily tasks that I need to do to move towards this goal and that's where a tool like the power list really comes into play if you're unfamiliar with the power list you go to audio episode number 16 and it will explain the power list system it's a free system you don't have to buy anything there is a journal of it on my website but it's not required you can use a notebook and it just explains how we do exactly what this person is asking so we break it down into critical tasks that we execute every single day that compound over time and end up creating the outcome that we're looking for but if you don't know where you're going it won't work so you have to decide where it is you're trying to go from the beginning before you really start to break it down into a plan to get there I mean like dude if if you don't know where you're going and you're going to get in your car and you think you're just going to find your way there how how how would that happen it wouldn't it would be impossible so we have to decide where we're going what's it going to look like and I would encourage you to develop that vision without limitation if you could be anything if you could build anything whatever it would whatever your mind could come up with think of that in the biggest coolest best most favorable outcome terms because what happens usually when people think about what it is they're trying to create they're in a place in the beginning where they don't have that much confidence and they don't have that much belief in themselves because they've never really built anything and then when they set out to try and build the vision of what they want to build they end up saying oh I'd really like to do this thing right but like I don't think I can do that that's not that's not really within my capability right and so they shrink the vision down to this like small vision and they're failing to understand how long life is and how much progress you can make in a relatively short amount of time five ten years and so you know and it's possible to know that when you're 24 years old or 25 right you don't really understand how quick things can happen because on a daily level a weekly level a monthly level progress feels slow but if you're dedicated day in and day out and you're executing critical tasks day in and day out the the amount of time in years is is relatively fast so you know people underestimate the amount of work that they can do in like five years right and they overestimate the amount of work they can do in six months which puts them in this like like unfavorable mindset which is just not accurate with how things really work so I would encourage people to sit down create the ideal outcome what would that look like what would it look like if all of your dreams came true what would it look like if you took that company that you're working on or that position that you're working in or that company you're working for what would it look like if it was like ideal like if you could walk in there and say holy shit this is the coolest thing ever what's that vision and work from there because if you go after that vision the chances are the outcomes going to be very favorable to what you're trying to do because likely you're going to fall a little bit short that's just the way goals are most people don't ever actually achieve their big goals they just get pretty close pretty close is still fucking amazing right no so that's my take on that you know get clear on your purpose get clear on what you're trying to do on the outcome break it down into small actual actionable steps on a daily basis and execute and and eventually that'll come to fruition I love this let me actually this because I feel like you know especially for younger people man like just in general purpose I feel like it's either one or two things like it's people either like overdrive it right or they severely under diminishing like it diminishes value right and I've heard you mentioned before you know that that purpose evolves right and so can we just like touch on that a little bit especially for somebody that's 25 years old it's like you know the purpose that you may have now maybe your real purpose right now mm-hmm growing 10 years it might change yeah well typically when people first get started their purposes are more selfish and that's not a bad thing that's okay right you don't you you're having trouble paying your rent you live in a place you don't want to live you're driving a car you don't want to drive you don't have the lifestyle that you want to have and so typically most people will start with that level of purpose I want to take care of myself I want to get myself to this place and they will focus on that that's okay all right because what happens is once you start to take care of those things you start to realize that the purpose is bigger than yourself and you start to understand that this is actually not about me now this is about other people around me and so the purpose generally shifts from in the beginning of the success journey whether you're an entrepreneur or an entrepreneur or whatever it is you're trying to do to their selfish reasons I want to live a better life I want my life to look like this I want to do these things and then as you achieve those things you start you go through this like process where you know you start to realize well I got all these things now now what and people will typically go one of two directions at that point in time they will either say I have everything and I'm bored and I'm miserable I'm depressed because I did all the stuff I wanted to do and then they do not reevaluate the next step which causes them to go backwards and it causes them to lose the progress they have made become miserable become anxious become depressed and you know sometimes just quit all all right this is why we see so many people who get a little bit of success and then they fall off and they disappear or they pick another path and then other path is they evolve their purpose they say okay I've got I've got my bills paid I'm able to eat okay what about all the people around me what about this what about that and they start asking bigger questions those bigger questions lead to a bigger purpose that typically is outside of self all right it becomes selfless and this is why I tell people you have to be selfish to become selfless all right you you can't just say I'm the selfless guy from the beginning and you can't even feed your own self you can't take care of your own rent you can't take care of your own family that's not realistic yeah but once you get that taken care of and you're comfortable it's time to reevaluate what it is you're trying to do what your purpose is and typically the biggest success success stories in the world they evolve from you know at the very beginning you know I'm taking care of me and then they go and say okay well I need a bigger purpose I need a bigger mission I need a bigger project to work on and then that project becomes so big that their purpose becomes big which drives them forward and it helps everybody around them yeah that makes sense absolutely I love it and it's also like too like it's like that dog and hunger that you have trying to know why you're in that selfish stage yeah it carries right over yeah the vision's big enough when you recalibrate and you move into the bigger purpose if that's big enough you're you're gonna actually be hungrier yeah because who are you more willing to fight for yourself or the person to the left and the person to the right for the right of you all right most people will fight for the people around them way harder than they will fight for themselves so it's very important to get to that point and then reevaluate not just fall off and think it's about you I mean we see this all the time if you pay attention to people you see this on the internet all the time people who will you know they'll become successful they'll they'll get some success financially you know their lifestyle will go up and then all of a sudden you don't really hear from them anymore where they go oh and then you find out two years later they fell off and they got addicted to drugs and they just kind of went and ruined their lives well that's because those people didn't take that next step they refused to understand that it's not just about them and they didn't expand their vision and when you expand that vision to start including all the people that have helped you get where you're going now you're going to war for a completely different reason which is much easier to go harder at does that make sense no I want to present most people will fight much harder for the people around them than they go for themselves yeah I think it's important to man just like last little thing on this is like you know people will hear you say that like okay you know you got to be selfish in the first in the beginning well Andy I mean you say and be selfish but like how is that a good thing right but it's like when you think about the amount of impact that that is generated the amount of trust is made from that actions of being selfish yes it's okay well it's real simple you have to get your body right you have to get your mind right you have to get your life right you have to get your income right you've got to get yourself right because yourself is the biggest fucking tool that you have to create this vision that you're trying to create so when you're getting that tool right there's all these people that are going to want you to go do this and they're going to want you to go do that and they're going to want you to deviate from the plan that's where the selfishness comes in you say no I'm not doing that I'm worried about this right then when you've built that and you've got some progress there and you have some momentum there you're able to now take that tool and expand the vision and make it selfless and that's where that's how that works yeah I love that man I love it question number two guys Andy question number two Andy hi Andy I've been working as an individual contributor and a senior role within the HR function at my company for two years I report to the director of my department who reports to our VP who then reports to the company's chief HR officer this year the chief HR officer is meeting one-on-one with everyone within the HR department to check in and discuss successes and opportunities within the HR area in which we work my meetings coming up in as an entrepreneur how can I add the most value to this meeting I feel so far removed from the seed level and I'm struggling to find the best way to engage with somebody at the executive level I want to make a good impression I enjoy working at my company and I aspire to grow my career here for many years to come what advice do you have to best prepare there's a couple steps here one become highly skilled at what it is your role is an execute and produce the proper result at the best level better than everybody else in your company okay when you're the best the truth of the matter is you get preference people know that's reality okay like you don't get preference when you're third you don't get preference when you're sixth you get preference when you're number one you get trust when you're number one you get respect when you're number one that's the reality so if you're running your job at a mediocre level don't expect anybody to put their hand out and try to help you along because they're going to assume you're not bought in anyway okay so you have to handle business first of your own responsibilities the second step there is to start anticipating needs all right if you want to move up then you need to start anticipating problems that the people that you're working for have and solving those problems before they're even problems okay there's nothing more valuable than than someone in the organization walking in and be like hey just so you know I found this and this and this oh and by the way I already fixed this and this and this these are done that's super valuable all right we talking we talking this you know frequently about what the most valuable skills are as an entrepreneur and it's sales leadership and then the ability to take initiative to take projects or problems and solve them without anybody above you having to put their hands on it and that's a huge key to moving forward you know when you want to move forward in a career it's it's not just do your job at a mediocre level that's not reality you'll never you'll never win that way that's the standard of what most people think most people think if they show up they put in their time they executed a mediocre level that eventually time will pass and they will become a winner that's not reality you have to fucking be the best at what you do you have to do it very well and then you have to do other work on top of that to create value for the people who are in the control of your path so that they say fuck dude DJ is on top of it he saw this and this and this he always sees these things he handles these things I don't have to babysit them I don't have to you know remind them I don't have to tell him that he has to be graded as shit and when the when the conversation comes up behind closed doors well hey we need another person here we need another person there we need we have an opportunity who's going to get it DJ is going to get it because he's already been proving that he can handle it so there's a vast difference between what people expect will move their career forward and what actually will move their career forward and like I said just showing up every single day and checking a box is dude you're you're committing career suicide through a thousand paper cuts you're just you're just going to rot and that's the reality in any organization you have to become undeniable and your ability to contribute to where when the conversation comes up for the opportunities your names at the top of that list and that can only come by you being great at what you do and then also learning how to anticipate the needs of the people that you're working with solving those problems and making it known that you solve those problems that's a thing too so a lot of people will do this initiative they'll they'll take on problems they'll solve the problems but they won't even let anybody know that they found these problems and they fixed them and if they if nobody knows then you don't get any kind of recognition for it so you've got to come up with a tactful way to communicate that you have to walk into your leadership and you just say hey just so you know I want to let you know I found this this and this and this and by the way I saw this and this and this this is what I did and I just want to keep you in a loop and then you walk the fuck out and you know what I say fuck dude that guy's got his shit together right you know he's worth more money he deserves an opportunity we don't want to lose that guy those are the conversations on the back end that employers have about their employees and you know it's very real like every single employee in the world once they're best people to be closest to them so we can move the the needle forward and a lot of people think it's about time put in or it's about you know how many years you have because they listen to their parents who worked in the old world or or honestly we're just mediocre people like I'm sure they're great people I'm sure you love them I'm sure they love you but I'm talking about a performance standard that's mediocre and they say well fuck dude I put in 20 years over there and they didn't do shit well yeah because you didn't do shit during your 20 years you bear you showed up and you existed okay so you have to work off this mentality of I have to be undeniably the best person in my role so where it's impossible to ignore that's what undeniable means impossible to ignore and when you're impossible to ignore you're valuable whether you're valuable here or there or anywhere else if you can cultivate this mindset where you were that kind of contributor you will get paid you will win and your career will progress and anything less than that you won't yeah I love that let me actually this from like from the entrepreneur standpoint you know when you started when when your business has started growing and you started okay now we have a leadership position that's in this place and then now that leadership position they have you know two teams and there's leadership inside of those teams right and the chain of command started growing what were some things it's like you made sure that you put in place to ensure like a good healthy chain of command a good relationship to where there was no like fear of like talking up or you know from employees that are on the well a lot of times yeah a lot of time well first of all anybody who's going to this is a great question by the way all right so your ability to communicate to the leadership as an entrepreneur is a skill that you must have all right if you cannot have a direct conversation if you cannot communicate to the people who are up the chain from you you are way less valuable you're not giving feedback you're not giving us anything to work off of and a lot of people because they don't want to rock the boat they will have concerns they will have ideas they will have issues they will have solutions but they won't bring them up and because they don't bring them up they don't get any value and then they sit there and they fester and they get upset and they get bitter and it's their own fault okay so you have to understand your ability to communicate directly and clearly to your leadership is a valuable skill set in itself so if you're sitting there in an organization anybody's organization and you're just like stewing well you're stewing because you lack the critical ability to have a conversation that should be had all right if you can't give feedback you're not valuable if you don't tell what the problems are you're not valuable if you don't bring solutions you're not valuable these are real things and people don't do this because they don't want to quote unquote rock the boat well that's a skill set that you have to have how can someone be valuable how can someone move up how can someone get a bigger position and more pay and a better career inside an organization if they will not fucking communicate you are you you cannot do it okay because as leadership we're looking out on the horizon and and you know let's just say we were in a battle and you're five miles over that way on the line and you're getting fucking killed that's a problem okay you're getting fucking killed everybody's killing all your guys you're getting shot and you won't say shit because you don't want to be seen as a rock in the boat well now not only are you not valuable you're a fucking liability to the team because you're getting motherfuckers killed because you can see a very obvious thing needs to be solved and you're not doing anything about it that is the opposite of the undeniable aspect that we're talking about so communication is a huge deal people have to develop it and it's a necessary skill for you to move up in your career and you know a lot of times in organizations people will say well the leadership they won't hear my they won't hear my feedback motherfucker you don't bring it right so they assume that you won't hear it so then they make up this narrative in your head and they say oh you know they won't listen to me they won't dissad they won't approachable when in reality they just didn't even fucking develop their own communication skill right okay so and these people go and they have this problem at one organization the next one the next one the next one the next one they have it in their relationships they have it in their friendships and they can't recognize that it's a them problem not everybody else problem most of the problems you have is a you problem that's reality so um I you know yes you want to foster a good environment for people to bring feedback but they have to understand very clearly that there's a difference between actual constructive feedback that helps what's going on or gossip drama bullshit and that's a huge skill as well if you're one of these people that just brings every single ounce of bullshit to the leadership without handling it yeah now you're even less valuable so there's a nuance here you have to know the difference between reality and real shit and you have to know the difference between bullshit and don't bring your leadership a bunch of bullshit that's gossipy and drama and this and that those things are your responsibility to handle all right the real problems go up the chain and if you can delineate those two things and you can effectively communicate you are far more valuable especially if you can squash the shit that's stupid and handle the things that are actually real and so this communication that so many people try to put on their leadership is actually an internal problem and when you examine their lives you will see that they have this problem in every single area of their life like I said they have it with their relationship they have with their friendship they've had it at previous jobs and they're going to have it at next jobs and unless you develop this skill set of one being able to tell the actual feedback to being able to solve the problems before you actually go to them with the problem three knowing the difference between bullshit and real shit unless you're able to do that you're you're not valuable dude like you're just a warm body hold on space so my advice to anybody out there that's sitting there and saying you know I don't know what's what bro are you doing all these things like really are you or are you scared shitless to say anything and do anything because that's something you have to overcome to progress your career there's no high paying high value amazing career out there where the person that's in it can't communicate it just doesn't exist what happened and a lot of people have this problem now because of social media right they're not good with people they're not good having conversations they're timid they're afraid they and dude you know we're talking in person communication here okay and and so like dude people will say well you know my leadership they don't they make it hard for me to get fit no they don't they just don't want to be bothered with your bullshit right they want to know that when you come in there it's real shit and so they you know we have to fucking understand that most of these problems start within us it's not out there it's us and if your leadership doesn't appreciate real direct feedback then probably you should go to somewhere where they do you know what I mean but the likelihood of that is why don't know I mean there's a lot of shitty organizations out there depends on if you're in the right one or not for sure yeah you know it's funny because almost think when you were saying that about you know like you see a problem on the front line and you're not saying nothing it's like people forget like hey listen that problem eventually the top chain of command they're gonna find out about the problem yeah and they're gonna say why didn't you do any how the fuck did you miss that yes and then it makes you look bad if you make sure stock grow weight low yeah yeah it's just a simple change in my mind man it's a different way of looking at it listen dude people have to understand we have to learn that most of our problems come from within ourselves and if we want to be valuable we have to work on those problems and fix them and not project them onto other people you know when you've worked seven jobs and you say no my leadership sucks it's not the seven jobs bro to you there's a common denominator that's right yeah I love it I love it guys Andy are third and final question question number three hey Andy do you think there is a point let me say this too before we get into that I think people don't understand how how it is that they progressed their career okay no one's gonna come and say hey you know you've been here for seven years and I really want your career to progress that's not what's gonna happen dude okay you're gonna have to beat this is how it works and in real life you are so good you are so undeniably good you could tribute so much you saw so many problems you are so skilled you are you are performing at a high level that you can walk in the office and you can say fucking pay me fucking pay me or I'm out that's the fucking where that your goal as a fucking entrepreneur is to build so much leverage in yourself that you can walk in and you could say hey this is what I do here are my stats this is what I've done and you could show it all clear as day I'm the best at what I do here I'm this I'm that I'm this I would like this opportunity and if I can't get this opportunity in a reasonable time frame I would I'm probably gonna progress my career somewhere else no and it's nothing against you guys it's nothing I love you guys but I have to progress my career and you know what's gonna happen you're gonna walk out of the room and the people are gonna say all right we got to find a spot for this guy this guy's a fucking killer yeah you know I'm saying the caveat being you better make sure your shit's in line well dude people try to do that when they don't really have right they don't have leverage right and then that's when companies look at people they're like okay yeah you need a box yeah right okay yeah like okay like yeah you know so it's your job is to become so great that nobody can ignore that nobody can deny it has to be actual data that shows that you have to have intangermles a feeling a cultural contribution being a leader being skilled being able to communicate being able to take initiative solve problems these are all things that drive your stock up and if your stock is really high you're in the driver's seat of your life and it doesn't matter what company you're with if your stock is high and you're good at what you do you can go anywhere and you can be successful then then the game becomes where do I want to play what team do I want to play on do I want to play on uh you know do I want to play on the bad news bears that loses every single year like the Broncos yeah yeah right do I want to play for the Broncos or do I want to play for you know the Patriots when they're winning Super Bowls right you know I'm saying right like then you get a chance now now you get to name your path and that's what people don't do that work they they want to jump in on the good team and then they expect them to be pulled along and that's just not reality average players don't go to the University of Alabama and get pulled along into greatness they they become great then they go to the team and then they have to work to compete against really great players as well so your job is to make sure you're great is that simple I love it man I love it guys Andy I'm starting to find a question hey Andy do you think there's a point in living a high standard that can be taken too far when someone ostracizes themselves from reality I have a buddy I speak to every day he's got me into your show and we're both currently doing 75 hard we were speaking about winners and losers where he mentioned some other people we know when when he claimed quote they're all losers this guy this guy and this guy they're just fucking losers the thing that frustrates me about this is he and I know we each have a lot of work to do ourselves so here in him act like he's better than others was frustrating and I was very really disagreed with him I took a second to think and definitively agree there is validity to what he's saying however one of the people he mentioned went to prison at a young age and turned into bodybuilding over the last five years this gentleman has gotten into fantastic shape and continues to follow the good path versus the bad path must still make an error as a long away I personally disagree that someone like this isn't a loser he may just not be a winner in the same vision my friend and I have do you believe there is room for different types of winners such as how there is an Andy Fercilla inspiring millions of people through his brands and words and then you have the iron cowboy literally running ultra marathons inspiring people through his work what would you say to someone that is going down the path of excellence that think thinks anyone who isn't working towards absolute excellence or simply doesn't even know what absolute excellence is yet is a full on loser what's the dynamics here this is an interesting question here well of course I mean we have to take into consideration where people start you're not everybody starts at the same place this is why you can't you can't really judge people off the result they're producing without considering where they started and the distance between where they started and where they are is actually what determines how well they're doing so of course there's different people that are great mother Teresa great right yeah you know what I'm saying but you need Duncan baskets like this what I'm saying Kobe Bryant great right you know Tom Brady great these are all different art forms of greatness you know Vince Van Gogh great you know any of these musicians great like they're not losers because they're not on the same path as this other person and I think it's important for all of us to remember this and I I we cannot judge people based upon our scale of what greatness means to us because it means something different to everyone you know somebody might be a great fucking parent which is extremely important right somebody might be a great entrepreneur which is also extremely important and different and while the entrepreneur may get more quote-unquote credit I would argue that the job of being a great parent is equally as important if not more important because it dictates future society all right so we have to look at all of these things and I don't think it's very I don't think it's a good idea or accurate to paint with a broad brush when it comes to winners and losers because we're all playing a different game we're all working on different things we all started in different places we all have natural strengths and natural weaknesses that are all different and as long as someone's trying and as long as someone's doing the work and as long as someone's progressing they're not a fucking loser yeah so so you know I used to be very judgmental about people you know but what I've come to realize is what I'm telling you you know we can we there's a lot of greatness in different levels but I will say this there are also fucking losers okay so maybe your friends do exist you're you can't there's a line here you can't find the good or the um you know you can't make uh you can't polish a turd all right that's what you can't do like some people just suck some people are losers some people are never going to be to their standard and and personally do when I look at like success being the pursuit of the fulfillment of your ultimate potential as long as someone's chasing that that's a noble thing because when you're pursuing success dude you've got to understand you can never actually fulfill your potential there is no end game all right if you start out on day one and you start pursuing what your potential is on day one because you lack skills and lessons and understanding your potential is X okay let's just say that now as you go down the path and you say I'm going to get to my ultimate potential and it's where it is on day one as you go down the path you're going to have hardships you're going to have lessons you're going to have things that happen that result in new skills those new skills will expand where your potential grows on the back end so now your potential is not X it's X plus two right or X times two so that that's why the pursuit is so noble because you can never really achieve it because at the end of your life if you've committed your entire life to becoming better and better and better and better and better and you developed this massive amount of skill set well now you're out of time so the potential of what you could be is never actually obtainable even though it's ridiculously great and that's where it comes in you know teaching other people bringing other people along teaching them what you've learned but I believe that that pursuit is extremely noble because you can never achieve it like and it results in tremendous good for you tremendous good for people around you tremendous good for society and so when we think of like what success really is we have to acknowledge that success in the ultimate form is actually unobtainable in the long run because you're going to continue to expand your potential the more skills the more lessons the more knowledge that you have eventually times just going to cut that off that makes sense absolutely there's something you're signing up for never ending that's right and that's the thing that's why like when people say an entrepreneur ship I'm going to retire by 40 no you're not made it you're not because if you do you're going to be broke by 45 all right the the entrepreneurship personal development winning this is an endless journey that lasts your whole life it's a lifelong commitment and too many people believe that there is a destination right and as corny as it sounds it is about the journey it's not about the destination and as you go along the journey and you learn more and more and you make more mistakes and you meet new people and you do all these things and have new experiences your ability to do more expands and so you know we have to appreciate what it is that we're working on here we're not working on a project that will ever actually be finished we're working on something that is going to continue to improve continue to get better continue to produce results not just for myself but for other people and and that's the way the journey works yeah yeah it's funny I was thinking when you saw about you know some people just lose it some people are just great at losing you know but I want to bring this up because I feel like you know anybody that's done 75 hard can attest to this too like there is there is a point in there where you do start looking around to people around you like fuck man like these people aren't doing it they aren't getting it like there isn't there is like a like I want to call it arrogance but there's something there like right like what is that that's called the truth yeah you're noticing that you're trying very hard and you're noticing that people around you are not yeah and it becomes very annoying because you're working your ass off and they aren't and they're looking at you saying what the fuck's wrong with you no what's wrong with you right maybe that's what this guy's going to work yeah like that's that's where he's at yeah so so you know it's it brings awareness to the reality of the situation and there are people in your life in every single person that's listening this life who are losers they don't try they don't fucking do anything to get better they just float through life they don't contribute to anything they don't build anything they don't create anything they're not trying to become anything they're partying their life away they're existing and by the time they're 45 they look 60 and then they're like well this is just my life this is what I got no bro that's a cop you chose this you chose all that shit your result of your life is your own doing you were just unaware that the choices that you were making we're actually going to have a negative outcome that now you think you are stuck with right so it's a lack of awareness along the journey you know the best thing you could do if you're 20 years old is to realize that it no matter what your friends say no matter what the the hippie hippie gurus say on the internet no matter what the fucking spiritual guides say on the internet uh the choices you make right now over the next 10 15 years are going to drastically impact what your life looks like and uh there's a lot of people out here telling people that that's not true you got your whole 20s to fuck off and you know what your 30s to fuck off and you could start when you're 40 that's true there's there's examples of that you know Henry Ford uh Colonel Sanders we go on and on and on and on and on those are the anomalies they are the exceptions to the rule they are not the rule the typical rule is if you fuck off between the ages of 20 to 35 your life's going to suck that's the norm all right so if you're 20 25 years old and you're sitting here and you're thinking like fuck do you that could travel the world and they can okay you can you could do a little bit of stuff enjoy your youth I'm all about it bro I'm not saying be a slave to whatever it is you're doing but you better take your life serious and you better make good choices because the choices you make from 20 to 35 are going to dictate the entire rest of your life they're going to dictate how happy you are how much money you have what kind of lifestyle you have who your friends are uh the quality of your life in general will be decided very strongly by the decisions made between that age range and you know what you can do certain things after that you can definitely do it but it's just harder to do you know yeah I fucking about it so I love it I love it man well guys Andy yeah three all right guys let's go kick guys this week don't be a hoe shut the show
