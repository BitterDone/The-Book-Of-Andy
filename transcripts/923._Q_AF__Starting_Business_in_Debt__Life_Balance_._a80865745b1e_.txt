That's right. That's right. Let's make some people better today man guys. I got some good questions here. We got some people lined up. Let's make some people better today. What are we doing? We started with a ride in or a call in what we got. A call in I have a call in ready. All right. Let's go. Yeah. We got our buddy Travis locked and loaded. Let's give Travis a call. Hello. Hello. My speaking to Travis please. This is Travis. Hey Travis. I was calling about your car insurance. I wanted to see if you wanted to say 15% by switching over to real AF. What's going on Travis? Hey man. I'll be going. What's up Travis? I apologize. I can't fix. I tried to fix him and I can't. I get it. Yeah. I can't fix him man. It is what it is. I'm actually drinking a great first form so I actually was calling for a little bit. I was just saying I'm not going to be a little bit more than a little bit. I'm not going to be a little bit more than a little bit. I'm not going to be a little bit more than a little bit. I think that made me way too happy. Way more happier than I was supposed to. Yeah. I think it did. That was good. Yeah. So Travis where you calling from man? Yeah. So I'm physically right now. I'm in Southern Wisconsin but I live in the Northern Peninsula of Michigan. Okay. The unclaimed territory. God's country. Yeah. So I'm going on. Yeah man. Well first of all I'm just a huge fan. I mean I'm a 25 but I've been listening to your show since I was 19. For every episode of MFCEO really. F all that read the books 75 hard for five times now. So this is awesome. My question spans from I'm I'm in the fitness space. I've been a personal trainer of a gym for a long time was a manager regional manager. I sell first form products and basically I'm getting the point. Now where I want to you know eventually own my business. A gym and you know I just have a hard time with the whole like going into big debt. I know like I've listened to you and like you know you. Couldn't really get the funding for certain things so you were using credit cards and you kind of start up small and stuff with where I'm at. You know I could potentially be looking at you know three four hundred thousand dollars in debt at 25 and. I'm just trying to think of a good way to look at that. Well look man. I think it's good so here's what I'm going to say you're going to have all these people that are going to tell you don't worry about it's no big deal. It's part of doing business you can borrow this you can borrow that you can build your business. I didn't like you said I did not have the opportunity to do that and I at the time was very frustrated that I wasn't able to get alone. I wasn't able to get any help. I wasn't able to have anybody finance me but here's the thing dude. If I had gotten financed with the amount of experience that I had I can admit now that I would have wasted that money away. All right I would have thought like most entrepreneurs do when their first getting started man I'm going to create this I'm going to go buy a Super Bowl ad and it'll make my company and I would have figured I would have went for the home run swing as opposed to actually building a solid foundation which is what. Not having the financing forced me to do so I actually got pretty fortunate that I wasn't able to borrow money when I was just starting out because dude if I had I wouldn't be sitting here right now and I could just tell you that's a hundred percent accurate now. That's my experience okay now you're in a little bit different space you have all this time you have all this experience you have you know what you're doing. And that is a different story when it comes to borrowing money to get into your own thing all right. You yeah yeah you have to understand that like dude debt is generally a part of the equation especially when you're in a scaling business or you're just starting out for most people. It's very very normal for you to have to do this but the fact that you're aware of it and the fact that you're afraid of it is a good sign okay because it's the people who aren't afraid of borrowing money it's the people who want to borrow the most it those are the people who end up bearing themselves the people who use debt properly to build and scale their business and are very cautious are the people who don't like having debt. And that's a really good thing when you get experience using it and as your business grows it's going to become something that you will have to have most likely hopefully because your business will grow so fast that you'll need the cash to do it. So for you dude the fact that you are aware and you're you're dead averse you're like I don't know I don't like this I actually think that's a really good sign. I think that's how you should think about it and I think that's going to force you to be very cautious about how you use that debt to grow and scale your business out man I think it's a very normal thing and I think where you you know where you have hesitation other people are just hungry to get it and that's what ends up screwing them bro they spend it on some big marketing campaign or you know they say like well. You know I'm going to increase my lifestyle and people will see it and then they want to do it so they tell all these bullshit justifications they really you know don't work in business so. You know that's how I think about it for you bro the fact of the way you ask the question about not really wanting to do it tells me that you're going to be responsible with any debt that you receive is there a way to do this without debt. For me right now no how what kind of debt is this it's just to like purchase you know a business yeah but and it's a business you know I'm I'm involved with I'm familiar with right so yeah so I you know another thing you know question was I know some people start a business and stuff are scratch but. This isn't a existing business so yeah I don't know if you need advice with that for you here's what you know you know the business does the business cash flow to cover the note the debt service absolutely okay well then bro you don't have anything to be afraid of you already know the business you're fucking doing what needs to be done you're a young man you have an opportunity in front of you I would highly encourage you to go for it if this is something that you believe in because. You know we only get so many chances in our life dude and you know I know you're 25 and you know you probably think you're going to get a gazillion chances but do I'm just telling you from a from a older brother perspective we get two or three chances where you got a fucking jump and go and one of them I tell you want one for me is very similar to the one that you're talking about. You know I was I had two stores to retail stores in Springfield Missouri I got a call one day from a guy that I knew that had five other stores. You call me on a Monday and he said hey man I'm closing my stores and I said he said do you want to buy my inventory and I said and I I stop for a second I thought. And I said why are you closing the stores and he's like well I'm getting out of it I want to go into this new thing. And I said well why don't you just let me take the stores I'll buy them from you and I'll operate them little did I know. The stores were fucking losing money left and right he lied to me about like what they did or I wouldn't say lie but just exaggerated. So he's gonna prop it up a little correct he sold it he sold it and you know we ended up in a situation where we had to work really hard to fucking make the business work but he called me on a Monday and by Thursday I had moved back to St. Louis to run that I was living in Springfield at the time and I fucking said fuck it I'm going we're going and that one move that jump led to us scaling out our retail company where you know we're still growing opening stores doing very well. But also it led to the birth of a bunch of other things considering you know the one that most people know me by which is first form so that wouldn't have happened if I hadn't jumped and this feels like one of those opportunities for you at 25 and I think you should feel real strong about it dude there's there's nothing that you let me ask you this what would make you more certain what information would make you feel better about it you know all the relevant information correct. Yeah I mean I honestly I do feel pretty certain and I'm you know I'm this is something I've had a plan for for quite a few years I'm very close with the owner right like very very very close and this has always kind of been the plan that's why I've stuck with this company for so long but now that it's you know getting close to time for this to happen I'm just like I you know I just want another opinion on it you know what I mean I've talked to a few people but yeah. Yeah bro if we look go do it you'll kick ass you'll be fine you this is normal I understand you know you get a little nervous and you maybe want some positive reinforcement bro you very rarely do I say hey go do it you sound like you've got to figure it out dude now I would just I would encourage you to go and go confidently. All right I appreciate that yeah brother anything else. No I mean not really here's one thing I will point here's one thing I'll point out to you that is a positive about what I think just as someone who's heavily in the fitness industry as well. You're you're moving into a very good space for what's happening in the world right now with the automation the AI and all the automation all the tech there's people are going to have more free time and they're always going to be around. People they're always going to want to train they're always going to want to consume they're always going to want to be fit at least a certain part of the population is and I think you're moving into something that that has a lot of good upside considering the timing right now so there's that too. Yeah I feel like for the I think this year for the first time in a few years since covid we're kind of bouncing back yep no covid was tough for Jim you know we were the first one shut down last ones open. Dean the cesspools it was awful bullshit but I feel like now people are yeah people are like oh that's all bullshit like actually I'm I don't have to be scared of anything really if I'm healthy right that's all there is to it so we're seeing an increase right now and the trends are good so yeah I feel super confident with what I do cool well go do it bro and hit us back up if you need more help as you go I appreciate it I brother thank you thanks for all the support. I can't thank you to Travis see it. Yeah man something you said that I think is really really important is not taking more than you actually need yeah and I feel like like that piece right there for somebody to just stuck with me because like yeah you can get you know let's tell you I'll prove you up to you know half a million bro listen we need 200 listen that goes in your personal life too yeah you and I have had those discussions a lot oh yeah what happened you this week no I had to cash out baby what happened hold on hold on hold on let's just this is a real life example is real okay do you mind if I know for okay so DJ wanted to go buy a very very nice house because DJs doing very well for himself and he's earned it all right but what did I say to you about the house why did I not want you to do it because there's going to be a lot of cost that come up yeah not going to be aware of or tracking that you know and there's not going to be one furnace it'll be fucking three that's right and what happened you this week my first one how much was it 56 oh wait okay and imagine that times three or four you see what I'm saying so we have to think things through and just because the math maths on the short term yeah there's a lot of things that happen in a long in a long term that we don't account for sure and so a lot of people especially when they're young and I really like what he had to say I mean he he sounded like he had a shit together it is a lot of young people will fucking take is they'll take an extra hundred or 200 or they're trying to get as much as they can and then they'll say to themselves well you know I only need 300 so I'm going to spend the extra 100 on me right you know I deserve it right just stupid shit stupid kid shit and it ends up fucking us you know what I mean oh yeah but the fact of the matter is is like when it comes to debt I'm very I feel very good about how I've handled that over the course of business in my life we are essentially debt free the that's not very common no that's also why it took so long that was the point I was going to make so like you know if he went out and started something from scratch bro he's five six years away from even getting the brand put together you know what I'm saying like to where people resonate so by getting this you got to look at it as time too you know as you get older you start to value the time as much as you do the money or the opportunity and there's a time value to this if he's 25 and he's got to spend four or five years establishing a brand that means by by the time he's 30 he'll be where he is basically right now but like have less time to do it you know what I'm saying so yeah it's it's a it's a you have to you know consider all the variables and as you get you know as you get older time becomes one of them and you don't want to spend five years doing something that could be done immediately if it's going to cost you a couple you know a couple bucks to get it going you know I'm saying at 100% man I think to and this is something else you told me to just just some finances and and and looking at it there's also something to be said to you about just being a little uncomfortable yeah because that's what's going to keep you fucking right it keeps you urgent like keeping your your treadmill you know it's all right comfort is something everybody should try to avoid if you're in business you should never try to get comfortable you should try to be uncomfortable yeah because that is the urgency that drives you you know I'm saying when you start making good money and everything's going good it's really easy to stay in bed bro yeah it's really easy to not to say oh everything's cool fuck it nobody blah but then before you know it they ain't cool you know I'm saying oh yeah so and sometimes when it when it gets not cool it takes years to recover that back so yeah I agree with that I think it's important to stay a little bit uncomfortable yeah that doesn't mean go out and fucking finance a Lambo guys are you gonna be very clear about this for sure no it's good another one in man let's get it hey andy and DJ my name is Kaden butts yes that's my real last name it literally is be used yes okay I've seen worse gonna be buckets yeah you know I'm 18 and looking to start up a landscaping company within the next year and I'm doing everything I can can think of to be productive I'm not trying to be a Billy badass or anything but I have a construction job I've been working for so I can grind save and reinvest little by little while also simultaneously learning the tricks of the trade I need to be the best I can be I work 16 hours a day most days with maybe two to three off days a month during which time I tend to find myself so far behind on personal tasks such as cleaning my house and several half finished yard projects my friends and family don't see me anymore which understandably frustrates them to a degree I'm it also has gotten to a point where I can confidently say I don't even know what day of the week it is half the time I know balance isn't an option in the beginning years which isn't a problem for me but I just want to know with your experience and just pure obsession over this business is there a point that you know you need to step back maybe take it down a notch p.s. the screaming freedom energy has kept me saying this summer looking for it to see it in the more stores up here in Wisconsin soon what we got on this man bro you already try and take a fucking break you didn't built nothing yet you already talking about balance when you ain't done shit yet bro you ain't even fucking started your business yet okay this is the way it goes I went fucking six years living in a different town only coming home for literal the day of Christmas the day of Easter the day of Thanksgiving and that's it I would drive three hours poem for the day and then that night I would drive back I did that for six fucking years I didn't have a day off the entire time now with that being said it sounds like you might have a little bit of an organization problem okay so you need to work on you know being organized with your time making sure that your time is well spent making sure that you know you're not saying oh I work 16 hours so the shit other shit just you know doesn't matter are you really work at 16 hours every day every day are you really doing that or are we just saying that we're doing that okay here's the thing when you're young and when you're getting started this is the level of commitment that it takes and all the things that we talk about over and over and over again on the show where your family and your friends and the people who know you say all these little comments like oh you're changing you know oh you know you think you're too good for us oh you're working too hard oh you need to take a break you're going through that right now you are dealing with the make or break time in your life right now because I'm going to tell you something bro and not many people will tell you this as you get older you will have more obligations you will probably have a girlfriend or a wife and then maybe some kids and then maybe some bills and then a mortgage and all of these things that will jail you up from ever being able to do what it is you're trying to do right now so you need to remember one you have an opportunity right now is an 18 year old man to make your self into something special and get where ahead of everybody else that you know to you have the least amount of obligations that you'll ever have in your life right now you need to utilize that and if that means that the house is a little fucked up then that's what the fuck it means okay we have these things called priorities and your priority right now is to make sure that for the next 80 years you are doing well and you might only have one or two times in your life where you could set that foundation properly and this is one of them so you are going to have to get more organized with your time you're going to have to understand that your parents and your friends and your family and everybody else are not going to understand you can try to explain it to him and you should but they're not going to understand unless they have gone that path then you're going to have to spend time with them when you can and that's reality and I don't know how to say it any other way but this is what it fucking takes bro you're going through the beginning phases of what it takes and you're learning why most people can't do it because they face all this external pressure they have their friends they have their family they have their girlfriend or boyfriend tell them that they should do it this way or that way and this way or that way is what the best thing is for them at the time not the best thing that it is for you over the course of time so we have to realize bro this is your opportunity and you need to make the most of it and if you want to build a landscaping company and you want to fucking make it a real thing 15 years down the road where it is legitimately one of the best landscape companies around you're going to have to pay your dues right now and that's it that's the reality and you know there's no way around it man I don't know what else to tell you yeah I mean to me it sounds like the powerless be perfect here and I think one of the the best things that I've been able to experience for the powerless bro is that no matter how crazy of the day or you knock off those things those become like those small wins a small as they may seem yeah are fucking everything bro you know maybe just making your fucking bed in the morning bro they compound dude you know and they compound they build your confidence they they set a foundation for you to believe in yourself and by the way if you use it right if you use the powerless the right way which you can get for free at episode 16 on real a feed if you use the powerless the right way you cannot fail it's the only system I know that literally removes fail failure from the equation it is the only system that does that if you use it properly you cannot fail and that's the fucking reality of it so yeah I would highly recommend using that yeah I think another thing to you said to it's like because I feel like there has to be some some some really honest reflection on what the actual inputs are here right because I've heard that I've had friends oh man I'm so fucking busy you know I'm saying like they people say that big that be word a lot yeah are you though no are you doing never busy is a word that people I'm not saying this guy's not listen I'm not saying he's not busy is a word that people default to when they want to explain what they've been doing when they don't have an explanation for what they've been doing all right what why are you late oh I was busy why did you why didn't this get done oh I was busy why isn't your why is your life look like shit oh I'm so busy how the fucking you be so busy when your life looks like shit you know I'm saying so like it is something people say as a defense when they can't actually explain what they've been doing um busy is for losers effectiveness is for winners and that's it and if you're really good you should be able to be effective without being that fucking busy and that's what the powerless does it gives you your life and it gives you the results that you want and that's the point of it the point of it is you always so much fucking time talking about how busy you are nothing gets done and uh the reality is is if you could get shit done uh in an effective way day after day after day after day after day you'd have a lot of free time to do whatever you want I mean the biggest thing that people say when they do 75 hard to just I can't believe how much time I was wasted before they're unaware of it yeah so getting organized with your time and utilizing a system like the powerless that helps you guarantee that you're moving forward is a must if you're not using it like real talk okay I've built my entire life on that fucking system if you listen to the show and you don't use that there's something wrong with your fucking brain you should even listen to the show why would you listen to what I have to say and and and all the advice I have and all the things about winning and all the shit and then not use the system that I tell you will fucking guarantee you to win when it's free you know what I mean so yeah man what no no yeah I mean that's it that's simple man it's real fucking simple these guys you know I find it interesting that this dude's like you know you haven't even started your company bro and you're talking about fucking back and off bro you got to put some other fucking ear plugs in and you get to listen to people that you don't want to be like they're going to tell you all the shit that they want to do not what you want for yourself and you're going to have to do that for the next 20 mother fucking years and then after 20 years past and you've got the you know the biggest most profitable coolest prestigious landscape company and you're you're making amazing money and you have a great house and all this shit everybody's going to tell you oh man you know I'm so glad that you know you did what you did and I'm proud of you and I believed in you the whole time and these are the same mother fuckers are going to tell you to take a playoff or or take a break or you don't go drink with them or go party with them or whatever it is you guys do that you know they these bro listen most people don't know what the fuck they're doing in their life they have no fucking idea they can't see further than five fucking feet in front of them the longest most people see is to fucking Friday night and if you listen to those people you're going to be the same as them you're going to be the mother fucker who spends his whole life going to the same restaurant the same bar drinking with the same people doing the same shit with the same amount of fucking money in your bank account and it's going to be you that pays the regret for that so you cannot fucking listen to these people because the truth is 90 fucking 8% of people have no fucking clue what they're doing with their life that's it real man that's real I love it man let's get our final one in let's get another one in here let's give Kiera a call hello Kiera what's up what's up what's going on I'm just like studying for like a pre nursing exam so like I'm just lost in on that right now yeah yeah I got Andy here what's up Kiera how are you dude you don't even you don't even know how like surreal this is you know and and you know obviously you know I don't know if the shit can be aired or not but I'm gonna say something like so for real so like last year I was at the lowest point of my life being basically like you know fuck life fuck all this but I was like you know I feel like the next approach like the the only approach and I need to do like the most like in saying shit I could have done is like 75 hard that was like for me was like locking down and doing that and that like I literally saved me because I was on like anti depressant and I was like really down and really numb and like very confused like super what I felt like sedated and like it really opened up like my life and what I could do so like I'm super blessed man hey you did that man I didn't do that shit you did that that's fucking awesome that's a huge fucking wind dude and I appreciate you sharing it but remember that's you that's all you fucking awesome man so what's that okay so like I mean there's like a little bit like more to that so when I was at like the lowest like I've ever been in my life like being hospitalized getting out being like on on med like just just super just super really rock bottom like I really hit rock bottom and I feel like that was the best thing for me but I had to move back in with um I guess I don't want to talk shit about this particular parent but I had to move back in with like a kind of emotionally abusive parent and it's it's been hard because I want to I want to get better but for some reason when I um like deviate from like kind of taking care of this person they shit on me when I'm not doing exactly what I want you know what they want me to do and and it's been really hard because I really I really love I really really love this person and they're very supportive when they're supportive but but I think they might have like mental issues and where they're like really really up and like really love me and then really really down when their maps are upset about their own life when they take it out on me and it's it's been hard because I've been like weaning off my meds and trying to like regulate but this person is constantly like shitting on me when like things are good but then it comes back really fast and then they should on me right then and there like it's always like a hot cold hot cold and it's been really hard mentally so I just want to know like what would you say I can do about that if I'm kind of changed to them financially well you know the first thing that you should do is try to unchange yourself financially so that if you decide that you don't want to tolerate that you don't have to and you can move away from it um with that being said you know there's a saying right hurt people hurt people and as frustrating as it is to deal with someone like that it's probably coming from a place of hurt and fear and maybe abandonment you know a lot of parents have problems whenever their kids grow up because they have made their entire life raising kids their identity and so when kids start to grow up and become adults it could be very hard for people to get a job uh and sometimes when they're afraid of losing you know they overcompensate with you know anger and things that aren't healthy and don't feel good and that's not your problem you didn't do anything wrong it's not you it's it's it's it's it's how someone has a lack of control over their own behavior And, you know, fuck man, I'm sitting here thinking about this and I have so many people that I've been close to over the years who have, you know, not my parents, but who have mirrored a lot of what you're describing. And so I really empathize with it because like, dude, when you really care about someone and then someone doesn't approve of you, it fucking hurts, dude. And it causes massive amounts of anxiety. And if you're like me, I like to solve problems. So the minute that someone gets frustrated, I feel like I have to solve it. And then when I can't solve it, it causes like massive fucking amounts of anxiety for me. And what's happened to me in my life is that people have learned that about me and then used it against me. And one of the things that I have found to be effective in dealing with people like that is to not, it's a pause. It's like a pause, okay. When they get pissed or they get frustrated or they get angry or they become disapproval or they say something, I just don't engage immediately. And then I'll let some time pass and then I'll engage later to correct the problem in some sort of adult way like, hey man, you having a bad day or what? Like, it's all good, but, you know, I could tell you frustrated what I know it doesn't anything do with me because I didn't do anything. So what, you know, what can we do there? At the end of the day, and I hate saying this because I know that it's really hard for people. But if none of that works, sometimes you got to distance yourself from people and move them out of your life. And at least for a time where they don't feel as comfortable treating you that way, because sometimes when you take a pause from people's lives, it creates an unfamiliarity where they don't feel as comfortable laying all of that kind of thing. And then you're going to shit on to you, you know what I mean? Some distance in between. So, fuck, this is a hard thing, man. And it's so, it's so different in every situation. But at the end of the day, here's the thing. You're coming into this world alone, you're going to go out of this world alone. And if people that are related to you treat you poorly, they don't deserve a spot on your roster. The bottom line. There's been a lot of people in my life who have probably unknowingly created feelings inside of me where I felt like they were holding me back or discouraging me or giving me negative energy or judging me in a negative way for the things that I wanted to do in my life. That I've had to remove from my life because like I just don't want to fucking hear it. And I'm to the point now at my age, we're really like the first time someone says some bullshit to me. I'm fucking out. Like we're not going to have a friendship. You're not getting in the circle. Like it's not going to happen. But when you're first starting to establish that, it can be really difficult because we care about people. And especially when it's like our parents or a brother or sister or cousin or family members that you grew up with, it can be hard. But at the end of the day, man, the truth of the situation always remains the same. And it's this. You only have so much energy in your day to do the things that you think are best for you. And to do the things that are best for you as an individual and be good at them, it requires most of your energy. When I say most, I mean like upper 90s percent, 97, 98, 99 percent to live a good life. And when I say a good life, I mean, you know, to have enough money to do what you want to do. I'm not saying, you know, you have to be a billionaire or worth $100 million. But, you know, to be comfortable, you have to be able to pay that price of energy. And when you have people that are pulling that energy out of you with really useless shit that doesn't mean anything because they're not able to control their ups and downs. Sometimes those people got to be limited or even removed out of your life. And there's nuance to it. There's, there's, you know, everything is a different situation. Everybody has a different story. But at the end of the day, I like the bottom line things and the bottom line is this. If you spend energy there, that's energy you're not going to have to build a life that you want. And that'll end up making you suffer long term. And so that's how you have to think about it. So all in all, you know, there's steps to solving this, right. One, have a direct conversation with the person, hey, I can't have you doing this shit. I can't manage your emotional ups and downs. It's not something I can do. Two, if they continue to do it, you create space. Three, if they continue to do it more, you create more space. And four, if they still don't get it, you cut them out forever if you have to. And the first step for you to be able to do that is get yourself in a place financially where you're not dependent on someone else. And that's another thing, dude. When, when people are, when people know that you're dependent on them, they will weaponize that. You know, they will say, well, yeah, they will say, well, what, what she can't do anything about it. We're gonna go. Yeah, what are you gonna do? And that's what would happen when she would, oh, I said she, but you probably know mother, but she would try to kick me out. Yeah, yeah. And dude, the minute you stop and say, cool, I'm out. She'll stop with that bullshit. Because she don't want to lose you either, dude. She's just, here's what I've learned, man. Most people are insecure, even your fucking family, even you, even me, even all of us, we all have insecurities. We all have situations, you know, and emotions and things that don't make all the sense all the time. And when we act out, it's usually because we're scared or because we're, you know, angry. And it usually has nothing to do with the other person. It's frustration that gets vented into the other person. And when the person finally says, yeah, well, cool. Usually that's when people change their behavior. So, you know, listen, I know this is a hard thing. But at the end of the day, you got to choose yourself because your mom isn't going to take care of you for your whole life. She's not going to be able to. You're going to have to take care of you. And you're going to have to eventually take care of her. And, you know, these are things that are reality. So, you know, man, I feel bad that you're going through it, but it's not something that is uncommon, you know, I think most people go through some kind of shit like this in one way or another, especially when they have ambition, especially when they want to break the generational cycle of the same old shit, you know, because dude, people will feel all kinds of ways. They're going to lose you. They'll feel ashamed because they create an environment that you want to escape from. There's just all kinds of shit, man, and all the shit you're doing that they didn't do. That's right. And sometimes parents and family are the biggest fucking haters, dude. I hate to say that, but it is, it is the truth. I've seen this so many times in my career. Doing, you know, personal development where parents, I'm very lucky because my parents are proud of me, but not all parents are like that. And, and it's sad. It makes me sad, but you got to pull your shit together. You got to get fucking strong. And you got to realize that this isn't that they don't love you. It's that they're emotionally incapable of managing their own shit. And, it's not a you problem. It's not. And when they respect you, when you go out on your own, you start doing some things. They'll start treating you differently. So, yeah, that's fucking hard, man. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's especially hard because, look, and, and I wanted to send a knowledge to it. I mean, as a, as a Dominican, it's, it's kind of like the stereotype that, like, you know, our parents, like, beat us, like, whenever we ask a question, they're always quick to temper. Like, it's, and it's funny that I say, like, you know, our parents beat us, but like, it's, it's so, it's so common, like, to the point where they make literal skits about it. But, like, I, like, I don't think at the thing is, I'm not that type of person that doesn't take it to heart. It almost seems like everything that she says about me is, is so pointed and so hard not to, um, I'm head of, you know, I hate to fill myself under the brush, but I've had to restart 75 hard a bunch of times last year because, you know, I burn the house down and give anything to me or say, I've had to too. That's normal. You're going to have things that are coming your life and disrupt you. The biggest thing you can do is get back into it the next fucking day. You know, and by the way, I got my ass beat growing up. I turned all right. You know what I'm saying? We come from a family. Yeah, not a lie. Yeah. Sometimes it deserves. Yeah. Well, every time I got my ass beat by my parents, bro, I'm gonna tell you right now. I fucking deserve it. Yeah. But like, I just use chocolates, right? That's the joke you were getting to. Yeah, pretty much. Anything heavy enough to reach you. That's correct, bro. Yeah. That's correct, dude. I did it. Yeah. I mean, look, I actually think people should beat more of their kids. We'd have a better society. That's real. Absolutely. Absolutely. I see it at, you know, I still, I'm kind of, I'm not in that, I mean, I don't know. Do you all know what publics is? Publics? The store? Isn't that like the paint store? No, it's a grocery store. Publics are a grocery store. Yeah. Public. But anyways. No, listen, don't listen to him. His brain is cooked. Oh, yeah. I like, I like, I just one thing I gotta tell you very before, you know, for leave. I kind of want to roast you on something. But, um, so like, I'm not at that upper echelon of like basically like shopping at Whole Foods. So I still shop at Walmart. And I mean, I still be seeing like kids get their ass beat. And I'm like, Bravo. I see the way they're acting. I'm like, there's no way I would not like throw you know what I do. Respectfully. You know what I do when I go to Walmart? I beat other people's kids. I just grab them. Fuck it's spanker ass. They're paying their looks at me. All crazy and shit. I'm like, somebody's gotta do it. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. But the amount of times I wanted to like, I don't know if you'll get it like pizza pie these kids, you know, throw them in the air, spit them around and, you know, grow them to infinity and beyond. If too many times. Pizza pie. I'm a pizza pie. That's right. What DJ got hungry? The pizza pie. What would my movie? The pizza cutter. That's right. We be the tag team Mario and Luigi. That's right. Yeah. Well, hey, listen, the thing is, is like, dude, you got to root your identity and approval in yourself. That's something you got to work on. Your pet your parents shouldn't have at how old are you? I'm 25. So yeah, my tender old age of 25. Yeah, dude. You. It's the only parent I got. So I love her. I understand, but you also got to think healthy of yourself and good of yourself and, you know, realize that, you know, when people say things that are not nice to you, really does have anything to do with you. It's the truth. Have you read the four agreements? I know I have not. Go read that book. Go buy that book today and read that book. It's a good book. The four agreements is you don't take things personal and it does a good job of explaining why. And I think it'll help you sort of separate your identity from needing the approval of, you know, anybody else. So there's a lot here. Okay, but here's the deal. You got to continue to work on yourself, continue to develop confidence and belief in yourself. You've got to have hard conversations with your parent. You have to behave appropriately to protect your energy. And if that means creating space, that's what it means. But you're an adult and your identity and your value and your worth should be based in what you think. That's what someone else thinks or says. And because when we give that responsibility to other people, even if we care about them and love them, they can hurt us very hard and very bad. And it doesn't even have to be true. So, you know, you got to be able to, you have to be able to look at other people, have such a strong identity in yourself that you can look at other people when they say things to you and be like, that's true, right? Like, that's the goal. The goal is, and if it is true, you know, you say, okay, well, that's fair. You know, I don't know how to hold them a book. Yeah, that's fair. I need to fix that. But you should get to a very balanced point about what the truth is and it shouldn't make you angry. Like, I get a lot of people to say a lot of things about me, right? But when they say things that are completely untrue, I laugh. I'm like, all right, well, whatever, man, you know, it's not going to, I don't let it affect me at all. I don't let it affect what I think of myself, how I see myself. I don't dwell on it. I just look at it and I say, yeah, that's not true because I'm very in tune with who I am, what I believe. I know how I live my life. I know what my heart's like. And no one can shake that. And that comes from establishing identity in your own actions and results, not on what other people think. And, you know, this is going to be a process for you. It really is. It's these are tough things. So somebody that didn't give a fuck would say, I just cut him out. But at the end of the day, it's, I don't think it's that serious. I think it's just, you know, you're, you're becoming you are an adult. But in her mind, you're becoming an adult. And she's behaving poorly about that transition. That's my take on it. What do you think, bro? Yeah, no, 100%. It's one of those things that's unfortunate. It's going to suck. There's no, it's not going to be all friendly at night, like, but it's necessary. I mean, you've had situations like this. I've been in that same, I'm just now getting out of that. And like, I mean, that's been my entire life up until 30. So I mean, it's one of those things, man. It's necessary. But when I first met you, you were having a lot of issues. A lot of those, yeah, a lot of issues she's talking about. A lot of those in a suck suit because, like, I mean, like, just like in your situation care, like, you want better. You want to do really awesome things. You know, you talk, you're going through nursing school, like, that's a great heal. Yeah. And that's a hard time to go through on its own in a perfect home. Yeah. You know, I'm saying so it's like, you can't allow any other unnecessary stress in there. You don't have the time for it. Yeah. And like, when you say, oh, I had to quit 75 hard because of this or that or this, that tells me that there's a boundary that is being violated or there's a boundary that's not set. Because replace 75 hard with your nursing program. And now she causing a fit that causes you to miss key elements of nursing school and eventually fail nursing school. Right. Now you're fucking up your shit for real. Right. So there has to be a boundary as an adult set. And that starts with a very simple conversation that happens when that person is in a good mood. Not when they're in a bad mood. Right. When you need to have a conversation about someone's behavior, it's usually better to have it when it's not in the heat of the moment, but it's more so like, you know, everything's cool. Yeah. So I hope that helps, man. That's, that's, that's hard. But I think everybody goes through this in one way or another, especially when they're trying to do things that are outside the room of what our parents have done. So I'm sorry you're going through it, but dude, this is part of the price. Yeah, honestly, it's. I've come to realize, you know, all the times that I've. And it's for the very poor excuses whenever I use any arguments, which is, which is terrible. I hate saying this out loud, but saying that I've gotten to an argument with my mom or a fight. And then I just chose to fuck off the whole day, like me doing this, like me thinking about my future, me taking, securing, trying to secure my future. I realize that those are very, I'm not in high school anymore. I can't be like, oh, fuck my mom. I'm just not going to do homework. Like, I'm full for that. Like, I'm, which, over that. So I definitely know how to delegate my time. If she's acting up like, oh, wow, I'm going to go have a car. I get out. I study elsewhere and let her be in and at home. You, you just got to realize and not let that affect you in the moment. You know, being able to deal with things not going our way. That's part of what the 75 hard programs about. It's about being able to deal with the things that come up throughout our day and not get distracted and be able to build enough discipline, grit, fortitude, mental focus, mental toughness to push through the events of the day to get done what we are needing to do for our long term and short term future. And, you know, being able to recognize that, or you say, well, you know, I shouldn't be fucking off the whole day when someone gets mad at you. Yeah, dude, you got to fix that because real talk, there's going to be something every day. If it ain't your mom, it's going to be something else. And you have to learn how to deal with that without letting it totally derail you. And I'll be real like, I struggle with the same thing that you're talking about. Like there is times still to this day in my life where I get so angry and so pissed off that I will fucking fuck off my whole day. That doesn't happen every day. It doesn't happen every week. It doesn't happen every month, but it still happens. And it's because it's a process. And, you know, it's going to be a lifetime commitment for you, especially as someone who takes things more personal to understand how to not do that and let it go. And the quicker you can do that, the more peace you're going to have. So you got this here. Yeah, I think so too. You got this. I sent you some links to that book for you too. Okay, thank you so much. I just, I just saw the link, but there's just so many factors going on in my life that are kind of like shit. Sactories like my car broke down on me. I just got a second job so that I can be homeless, make more money, get out. Like my test night, the really big exam is coming up in one week and I've had so little times of study. This is all, if you like, you know, as things is all assigned for me to, I bet I need to work my fucking ass off to get the fuck out. And you do that that I want to live. That's 100% accurate. And let me tell you something else. There's a lot of motherfucking people that come from a much harder situation that you are that have done everything that you want to do and more. So remember that when you think, oh, man, because it us as humans as individuals, we tend to think we've got it the hardest out of everybody. And it's just not true. Everybody's got a hard shit. It just appears in different ways. And you have to understand that this is part of the price. This is part of the test. And you are seeing exactly correctly that you need to do these things now when you're young so that you don't have to do them at 40. Saying, oh, you know, I've got finally get my life together. So you got this. I think that's a much for answering this. Definitely not going to let you know, I don't know how to say this politely. You know, the nicest demon I've ever known, you know, probably now. You got it. Well, cool. Thank you. All right. Here. Bye. Yeah, man, that's a tough thing, man, but it is so necessary. And at the end of the day, man, you got to understand that it doesn't matter who it is. It doesn't matter if it's your best friend. It doesn't matter if it's your parents. It doesn't matter if it's your siblings. It doesn't matter who it is. If they are pulling away from what you are trying to do with your life and not contributing to it, they don't deserve a spot on the roster. Because the achievement of life goals is one of the hardest things that you can do. And it doesn't matter if it's being a nurse or if it's being a CEO or if it's being an athlete or a musician, being accomplished or anything takes time and energy and work. And we can't have that energy pulled away by people no matter who they are. If we're serious about getting where we want to go. And for most people, that's going to mean you're going to have to cut quite a few people out of your life over the years. You know, the people that I associate with today are not the people I associated with five years ago or ten years ago or twenty years ago. It's just the truth. Yeah, there's a few, but it's not many because we're always growing. We're always evolving and we're always moving up the ladder if we're an ambitious person. And as we go through this process, what ends up happening is all of these people that take away from us, get replaced with people that contribute and push us forward. And then when you get into that spot, it's a different life, man. You know, you're not having conversations with people at dinner who are questioning what you're trying to do. You know, you're not having family events where people are like, oh, you're still going to nursing school. What are you going to do? Fucking, you know, blah, blah, blah. You know, we get all these smart-ass comments and eventually those comments are replaced with people that are like, hey, man, what you got going on? Oh, you got that. Hey, dude, I know this person. They can help you out with this. Let's get here. The conversations completely change from people pulling you back to people pushing you forward. And unfortunately, most people never get to that point because they quit before they ever get there. They don't realize that you end up being surrounded by people who care about you, who want you to win. And guess what? Most of those people are fucking related to you. They're not related to you. So you haven't even met him yet. Look, bro, exactly, exactly. And for Cara, you know, she's 25, dude. She's going through a transition period where her mom, she sounded, her mom sounds like she's bipolar. That's what it sounds like. But I'm not a fucking, you know, in a place to diagnose that. But at the end of the day, she's got somebody who's dragging her down a path that she can't afford to go down at this point in her life. And whether that means having a conversation and having it stop or whether that means never talking to her again, your life is that important. It is that fucking important because you only get one. And sometimes people are fucking stuck with shitty ass parents, bro. That's just it. You know, that's real, man. That's real with guys. Andy, dude, that was three. Yep. Hi, guys. We'll catch you on CTI tomorrow. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. Different sleeping on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck a pole. Fuck a stove. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch. Booted slow. Got a own bank road. Canked folk. Dusset note. Hit shot. Case closed.
