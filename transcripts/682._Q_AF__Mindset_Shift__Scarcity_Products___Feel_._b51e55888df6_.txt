we got a we got a special guest coming back on this week yeah 2.0 yeah I'm excited yeah that's gonna be a good show yeah a lot of good things man everything's good yeah everything's good cool anything new with you nope like the hat oh yeah you like that like the hat yeah I like it too that's why I'm wearing it yeah it's giving like some some some Tom thanks I'm the captain now yeah yeah yeah somebody told me I look like that guy I don't think they do yeah they did they told me that who told you that the guys out there the fucking assholes out there he's the call I had a nickname back nobody called you yeah sweet man we're gonna see some some cues yeah let's do it we got some A's let's get it guys Andy question number one Andy you don't know me from a can of paint but I just want to say thank you and that I appreciate everything you have done for me and my family you were truly doing the Lord's work brother so you've talked about how when faced with decisions weighing out something when you have to act you don't look at it as what happens if I do this but rather what happens if I don't and I love that and I've been shifting my mindset towards that more lately my question is with this mindset have you found that you have taken on more risk over time and have become more risk tolerant I'm sure you don't say fuck it let me get into anything that comes my way but is there such a thing a taking on too much for one risk or too many risk all at once would love your feedback on this yeah dude of course that doesn't mean just go roll the dice on every single thing that comes your way but when you train yourself to look at things as what happens if I don't versus what happens if I do and these things go wrong you remove a fear barrier that most people can never get through because most people will say well what if I do this what if I do all this work what if I try this and it doesn't work and they convince themselves that they're going to work very hard they're going to try all these things it's not going to work out anyway so it's not worth the path to go down and what they don't realize is that you can't really lose if you decide to go because you're going to go down the path and you're going to face obstacles and that obstacle is going to teach you a lesson and when you get through that first obstacle you're equipped with a new lesson you get through the second obstacle you get equipped with new lesson third four fifth six seventh eighth ninth tenth you start to get all these lessons and you accumulate new skill sets which allow you to escalate the path much more effectively so by not going and talking yourself out it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of never gaining any skills and never making any progress and so I think that's one of the biggest things that holds people back what if I do all this shit what if I sacrifice all this effort time energy money money into this project or into this career into this business or into this organization that I'm trying to build and it doesn't work out and so they don't go and so yeah while there's there's for sure you know you could take on too much risk for sure you could take on too many things that are risky at once for sure those are real concerns but they're not prevalent enough to concern yourself with what you should be concerned with is what is my life going to look like if I do not do what it is I know I need to do and the answer is going to be frustration disappointment regret and bitterness over the course of your life so you have to understand if you don't go do what it is that you know you're supposed to do and you don't become what it is you know you can become eventually you're going to come to a point in life where you're pissed off and you won't have the time back to go back and redo it so yes of course you can do too much but I don't think you should be concerned with that I think you should be concerned with not doing enough because that's where most people error yeah I love that let's flip this a little bit right because you also talk about this ladder of success right and and everybody's goals should be you know moving up those rungs is it easier or harder for you to say no now than it was say 20 years ago 25 years ago and in terms of when it comes to these decisions or offerings or opportunities is it easier or harder now to say no to things than it was 20 years ago well it's easier because one I can identify the opportunities as if they're going to work or not work a lot more effectively too I have less time for opportunities so if they don't have an equal upside to what I'm already doing I can't say yes it doesn't make sense mathematically so yes it's easier to say no now because I have limited time limited energy limited resources because what I have going on and I'm also able to recognize when things are are a good opportunity and a bad opportunity much better than I could in the beginning but that's that lends itself to what I was saying a minute ago right so if you never go and you never go down the path ever how can you ever learn to recognize what is good and what is bad and so what people end up doing is they end up just falling into the trap of being like their high school or their college buddies and just kind of let life float by and eventually that catches up with them you know they get to be in their 40s and their 50s and that's when they totally give up you know they they're fat they're out of shape they're like fuck I've wasted too much time and a lot of those people never recover you know what I'm saying and they kind of just waste their whole life away and it's sad because that's not how we're supposed to live as human beings yeah I love that man I love it this is a second question uh this is it's a little windy but but it's a really really good question uh let's let's switch focus here guys Andy question number two uh Andy congratulations on selling out your American freedom gear so quickly I tried jumping on it and everything got wiped right from under me which leads me to my question as obviously you have experience with this very topic I'm in its fresh in my mind how do you give the best customer service to potential buyers if your product sells off the shelves as fast as you put it up for sale online and the restock won't be available for months for context my husband and I run a directis consumer black angus beef business in southern California you're yes your favorite state and we have limited amounts of bulk freezer beef available throughout the year our business has grown slow and steady and it takes about two years from start to finish to have beef done correctly to fill the freezers um and because of this slower growth I've have time to share our story as ranchers and share a lot about the beef and cattle industry and people love that on social media um have a great email list that connects potential buyers with our business um and they love to seem to get to know us as ranchers um and having that presence online within the community um people are more focused about their food and where it's coming from so we're getting a lot of a lot of uh good I guess spark you can call it um and it's great because we have a large audience to sell our beef too it's a blessing in a curse though so when I send out an email that we're about to ready get ready to sell our beef we sell out in a few hours um and this past week we sold 11 whole beef in under four hours and we received many phone calls text and emails from frustrated people um we've been waiting to purchase our beef for six months to a year almost and they are in disbelief um and discourage mentioning that they're going to be shopping elsewhere if they cannot get their hands on our products um so how do we unpack this like how how so how the I guess go back to the question how do you maintain those potential buyers when you have such an exclusive product that moves so fast how do you how do you maintain well first of all you got to do a great job with the people that are buying okay and what it sounds like to me is you have a really good opportunity that you're not recognizing which is to build your brand equity around the scarcity of your product so ideally right now in this position you should be working on how to scale your your supply so that you can meet demands but in the meantime it's not a bad thing that you have such demand because it creates more demand and more demand and more demand and um you know while people might be frustrated and while they might be angry it only creates a scenario where people want your product more and it drives the value higher in the consumers brain so because you don't have the capacity to serve those customers right now you should be leaning into the uh scarcity of your product to build the brand equity while you're working on the ability to scale up operations to fulfill the demand that you have and so how would you create good will between you and the customers that can't get the products there would be things that you could do to get those people engaged and you i'm not going to do this for you right now but you would have to be creative and come up with a way to keep these customers engaged into your brand over the course of time a company that does this very well is maker's mark i love maker's mark even though i haven't had a drink of whiskey since 2018 because i get wild as fuck all right and uh it's not good for rancher yeah it's not good it's not good for me or anybody else yeah and uh but i love maker's mark and if i drink whiskey that's what i always drink and if you sign up for their email list um they have a really cool email list process where over the course of the year they send you newsletters and little gifts like just goofy shit like socks or a stocking or just stickers or cool shit that is like low cost to keep people engaged with the brand so if i were running your company i would create some really strong branding like you say it sounds like you're doing around the ranch around what you do around why you do it and how you do it uh with a strong logo presence um i would come up with you know six times a year where you either send out a um a newsletter or some sticker packs or some sort of reminder like hey we're still here uh i would i would create a preference program right now based around uh your your regular customers where they can like get preference when the when the product comes available um these are all things that you can do to make this a little bit better for your brand but ultimately at the end of the day not being able to fulfill the demand for your product isn't the worst problem in the world if you leverage it properly right so when you when you continue to sell out and you continue to sell out and you continue to sell out yes people get mad but when they eventually get it how much extra happy are they you see what i'm saying right so this is this is a way that you can leverage in situations where you can't fulfill the the demand uh that will actually help your company's image and the eyes of the customer yes yeah i never you know and it's funny because when i was reading this question like fuck like but you used to get you given this answer it kind of mind fuck me because you would think man like you're getting all these emails and texts and it's like but on the same side we see the stuff too like even with the yeah i mean dude people get pissed but like but what you're saying is that that's not necessarily a bad thing i mean it's not a great thing but it's not the worst thing in the world if you handle it properly right you know what i'm saying like sometimes when people are upset dude like people are vocal okay and people that are vocal are also vocal when you do the right thing by them so if they're pissed off you can usually switch that around into a positive situation by over-correcting it to where they're singing your praises out in public so how could you do that and that's what you need to think about how could you take these customers who want to be customers but can't be because you can't fulfill them and make them bigger fanatics of the brand right how could you create more demand how could you create more excitement and that just take some creative thinking if i was able to sit down with you for a few hours i'm very confident we will come up with an effective strategy to do this yeah it's funny too because like i think to like scarcity there's a lot of businesses or companies that operate on just solely off of scarcity right you look at like Ferrari right like the fucking brand new car that's coming out there's all gonna be so many of yeah that's right and there's there's a lot of people that come up and they categorize their customers in three categories they have they have top VIP and then regular and for you to be able to get the the bad-ass releases like the new sf xx you know 90 that's coming out like bro you got to be a VIP or top customer and that means you have to have history and it means you have to have been loyal and that's a way they control demand around their cars and you can do the same thing with your meet you know i i actually think you're in a really good position to leverage that if you're you know you've just got to figure out a way to you know connect with those people who aren't getting so that that way whenever you scale up your ability to fulfill the demand they're still wanting your product yeah i think it's important too i'm gonna actually this because we got to be very very clear Ferrari can do that you don't see pre-est doing that and so the difference in the quality of that product it has to be fun yeah this typically only works this typically only works for premium products yeah you know like like it can work for gimmicky products like things that get trendy um but typically this really only works for in demand premium products um you know there's things in history that i can think of like fucking beanie babies like these little stuffed animals people used to collect and shit that were like bullshit right but people will get fanatical and there's always cases like that where there's there but still dude that's limited release shit you know what i mean and anytime you have limited release shit there's it's an opportunity to create uh scarcity demand yeah i love that and that's that's something that's something that we go more in depth on in arte syndicate too if you're looking for like more in depth information on things like that arte syndicate is something that you guys should look at it's arte syndicate.com i love it uh let's get to our third and final question guys uh Andy question number three dear Andy i'm a 27 year old that is basically fucked off their entire life with drugs and partying last year i had some near death experiences and have completely changed my life since then uh with working out and eating healthy and staying sober my question to you is what advice do you have to someone that has the anxiety of starting to late i know this is a sunk cost fallacy in a way and i still show up to the fight every day i'm in the best place mentally and physically but i still find myself with the anxiety that i am behind i feel like i know the answer but would really like to hear it from you you are behind you are behind you fucked off for seven years you are behind you should have anxiety and you should have urgency and you should want to go and you shouldn't try to run from that anxiety because that anxiety is telling you hey bro it's time to get your fucking ass in here so yeah you are behind because you fucked off happy that you recognize that i'd stay sober i'd get your fucking ass in shape and i'd get focused otherwise by the time you're 40 you're gonna be broke as fuck working at Wendy's so that's that's the truth um and that anxiety that you feel is a great driver for ambition success and creation and so many people want to eliminate every single feeling that's uncomfortable and every single feeling that you know that they don't want to live with and they ignore the fact that these things are trying to tell them something we live in a totally fucking pacified society where every single mother fucker wants to be in zen state all the time well i'm gonna tell you what bro these zen state mother fuckers don't create anything they don't build anything they don't become anything and eventually they have to come to terms with they fucked off their whole lives you're lucky that you've only fucked off to your 27 and a lot of people will say oh well it's not too late it's not too late it's not too late but you are behind okay so it's time to get your ass in gear it's time to get going it's time to make whatever it is that you want out of your life make that start happening and that's gonna require you to become the best version of you which means staying sober which means getting fit which means getting educated which means stopping filling your mind with mindless bullshit and start filling your mind with shit that's gonna make you better and if you do these things and you go out every single day and you check off win after win after win after win you'll be able to catch up to everybody else pretty quick because while everybody else may not have been fucking off the way that you have been they still only go half speed so if they're going half speed and you can pick it up to to actually execute a full speed you'll catch and pass those people but you should have anxiety you are behind and you need to get shit together that's what i would say i love it yeah let's do it one more man guys any question number four yeah uh high Andy i'm a 24 year old who recently joined my family business one year ago uh we are a contract manufacturer doing about five to ten million a revenue per year uh the company has been around for 40 years 10 million that's a pretty big disparity is it five or is it ten it's like double the amount like seven we're doing one to 50 million here yeah uh covid bro i mean the biodynamics i don't uh but growing up i worked in the business from the age of 12 to 18 on the weekends and summers so i have a very intricate knowledge about how we function in our products uh during cover the business hat staff and issues and wasn't able to meet customer expectations for quality so our reputation has suffered since i joined the team my main task has been helping to organize our production improve quality and improve communication within the company between different departments and we have really stepped up our game in a short amount of time uh now that we have finally gotten to a better place what is the best way to rebuild our reputation with old customers who stop working with us because of previous negative experiences also what is the best way to facilitate new business-to-business relationships i do a lot of cold calling and emailing but i have little success uh little success and usually don't get a replies are any strategy in the way i can present the company to potential partners so two part question here well first of all yeah you should call those people up on the phone and say hey i'm Steve i'm the see i'm the president of the company i wanted to apologize for how we handle business during covid we had this issue this issue this issue we were battling these things and i wanted to talk to you to earn a chance at getting your business back please let's have a meeting or let me call you or let's have a discussion but i want to at the very least no matter if you come back to us or not i wanted you to know that we're better than that and we're going to do better than that moving forward and you own what you did and you tell the truth and you try to earn the business back one by one there's no fucking big uh there's no one big move you can make to correct that you have to correct those relationships one by one by one it takes effort it takes authenticity and unless you're willing to call these people and genuinely own and apologize i wouldn't even do it because if you do it half-assed they're going to think even worse of you so that's the first thing the second thing is is that typically b2b business is referral business so what that means is however you're servicing your other b2b customers you're going to need to do so in a way that completely exceeds their expectations so that the service is so good whatever it what do you say to it do you even say contract manufacturing okay that you do such a great job with those companies that they are willing to either talk about you or share a story or do a testimonial about you to help your business so story sell bro and the best stories that sell that bring business or stories of exceeding expectation and go in the extra mile and doing things that a company typically wouldn't do and if you're not willing to do those things you're going to lose to someone who is so that would be my answer on those things uh you know make sure that you call those people get them on the phone don't just send them some mass email don't send them some mass text don't send them some mass mailer this is how a lot of people fuck this up dude i bought my first rolls rice in 2014 and they sent me a pre-printed thank you car with a fucking signature stamp on it and it was a four hundred and fifty thousand dollar car all right and had they not sent the postcard i wouldn't have thought anything i was just like cool i got a rolls right but because they sent a postcard to me and it was such a fucking like we don't give a fuck thing it actually made me angry you see what i'm saying and now i love rolls and i still own a couple but it gave me the perception that they didn't give a fuck yeah and it was it was it was it was kind of like a letdown because i had worked very hard to get to that point to be able to buy that you see what i'm saying uh yeah and i would have been better off had they just not sent me anything or acknowledge anything because i was happy in the first place so if you mass email these people or mass text these people or mass mail these people and do so in a way that shows like you're trying to basically just fucking half-asset you're not going to get those people back okay remember value comes from inefficient action and when you take inefficient action people value it because they understand it takes time energy and resources to make that happen so i would sit my ass down in my fucking chair and i would call every single one of those people and say exactly what i just said you should say and that's what i would do and you're gonna get some nose you're probably gonna get some fuck use but i bet you're gonna get some yeses too and that's going to be important for the business i bet you're gonna get way more yeses than you think people do not take ownership people do not do these kind of things anymore in business and when you do them people will value them and appreciate them and and that's how you do business long term you build relationships now that's a lot easier to do in a business to business situation like these guys are in then it is in a direct to consumer situation like my companies are but we still do things like that in our direct to consumer business when we fuck up if we fuck up and we have a situation where five six hundred customers are affected which happens by the way that happens okay because we're putting out thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of orders and sometimes there's like sections like within those order streams that give fucked up okay then we get the wrong tickets or we get something happens or and that happens and you know what we do we call those people up and we say hey man we your shit got fucked up we're sorry we apologize here's what we're gonna do to make it right and we do that one by one and we do that we promise you if you're in b to b we're doing tens of thousands more transactions than you on a daily basis and we can do that so i know you can do it too yeah well so you you touched on something you know you're with the Rolls Royce story is that because i never really thought about it like that but i guess there is like this preconceived like expectation yeah of the cut like of the company that the customer will have yeah depending on the quality i guess that's right and like i never even i never was ready if you're a premium product you better back this up with premium relationship building or to finish everything has to be premium yeah okay and that's that's a big deal for you to think about with your business do you have a premium product and shitty service like most people do and they think that their product so good that they can have shitty service well that's a pretty fucking weak ass way to think about your business because what if you had great service what if you had great relationship building how much better would your company actually be but a lot of motherfuckers are just lazy they're just lazy operators are their second generation or third generation operators they don't know what the fuck they're doing they don't value what they have they don't feel personal responsibility for their employees so they'll say well you know our products are so good you know you can just fucking wait and bro eventually that sizzles out like eventually people get sick of that shit which is why in the first question with the state people you guys need to be fucking making sure that you could scale up to meet that demand that scarcity thing that will not work forever eventually people will go somewhere else because food is a commodity bro like I don't give a fuck if I'm eating western sizzler or fucking you know de Braggas from fucking I'm eating right I'm gonna eat either way and if I can't get you shit I'm gonna eat something else all right so the scarcity thing will only work to propel your brand to a certain level and then you better scale it up to fill that or you will lose the opportunity does that make sense yeah absolutely absolutely let me actually this too on the B2B side you know because I feel like every single city has that group right of like the entrepreneur business groups right like all the guys that go to the same bar together they all know each other's business and what companies they run is this something that you you know I mean is that would that be a recommendation too like maybe try to get into those those fucking patio bars or well it's always good when people know who you are yeah because their friends might need a contract manufacturer somebody they know so yeah getting to know the local entrepreneurs or the competitive entrepreneurs across the country or across the world is a good idea because dude there's always opportunities for collaboration or emergency situations where people need help you know in our situation like we do manufacturing but we can't always take manufacturing so we can we can you know we have to fucking say no a lot right but we'll say hey what about you can go over here to this guy you can go over there that guy you can go over there to this guy and you can do this correct yeah yeah and so it's always a good idea to have good relationships with your competition because eventually you'll be doing business together now I'm sure some of those circles though like I know I don't know about every city but like I feel like I feel like for me that would be difficult because I feel like you know with this city there's some like I'm not gonna call it snob mentality but like it's the khaki pants with the fucking like I just don't know if I could fit that crowd we mean like like you couldn't fit a crowd it's gonna make you millions of dollars okay yeah no shit right you start thinking different yeah right you by the way you don't have to fit in with the crowd bro when you walk into the fucking crowd they should be asking how they're gonna fit in with you okay you shouldn't be trying to be like them you should be who the fuck you are and let them wonder why the fuck you're so different that's the whole thing that's the whole play that's why your social media sucks that's why you suck that's why nobody knows who you are no one gives a fuck you are not you but anybody in general like you guys are too afraid to be authentic and you want to be like everyone else so like what you're saying is oh the khaki pants and fucking the khaki pillow you know the khaki clothes I do yeah but the point is is that uh yeah I don't give a fuck I'll show up wearing whatever the fuck I want and if they don't like it I don't give a shit you see what I'm saying and then that makes them say why does this guy like that why does he like that he's not wearing his dickies he doesn't give a fuck right that guy's cool right well how can he not give a shit how can he not I want to be like that right it's an authenticity is an attractive trait and so like you shouldn't be looking at these groups like how do I be like them you should be looking at it like hey I could build relationships with these people and build friendships with these people but it doesn't define who I am or what I wear or how I behave I'm still me you know I think one of the things that makes me me is that people come in here and they hear me talking plain language and they see me wear plain clothes and they're like how the fuck did this moron fucking do this well maybe I'm not a moron maybe you're just making preconceived judgment based upon my appearance and my vocabulary which is quite high I just choose to dumb it down sir big-hunger standing I love it yeah I love it man I love it well guys Andy that was three yeah that was four that was four don't be a whore
