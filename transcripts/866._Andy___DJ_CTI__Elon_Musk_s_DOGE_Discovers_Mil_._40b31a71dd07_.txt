What is up guys you're listening to Andy for salad here and we have bruised the internet You've never heard the saying the whole enchilada? No, not like that because you got a little half enchilada. We got a little tamale. If we were you, we'd be saying I'm giving you part of the enchilada. Yeah, not enchilada over here. Yeah, I'm saying. No, dude, I got we got we got a good good look at you there's tequito. Tequitoes are good. Yeah, I'm going to give you the half tequito. If it were Dave, he'd be saying I'm going to give him the egg roll. Spring roll. Yeah, spring roll. Spring roll. If you're me, I said a canole. Isn't that about the same size? No, you don't even know what I'm talking about. I don't know what canolees are. Those are like the pastry, like the crispy pastry feel with like the white shit. Oh damn. That's right. Well, I walked right into that one. Yeah, all right. All right. DJ Lo's canolees. Actually don't actually don't like them at all. That's a fucking lie. No, it's real, bro. I don't like the canolees. They're not good. I'm never and like listen, like you know, I could tell from looking at you, bro. Bullshit. No, this is a total lie. It's not. Canolees are above the line for you. They are not below the line. I've listened full disclosure. I've tried one. But I don't think it was like like an original, you know, I'm saying like my momia canole. I think that might be the difference. That sounds racist. What? That sounds racist. Well, I mean, it's historically accurate. I'm good with like food and fucking, you know, culture shit, right? This man like canolees. I agree. I'm not here to hear this. How is that racist? Mama Mia. I love experiencing like other culture's foods. Yeah, I made a steak last night. I did like an Indian twist on it though. What'd you do? So I took a shit and washed my hands before I try to cook it. Dude, that's fucking wrong. Z-Shine. You're gonna let him disrespect your culture like that. He said that joke twice. I'm here already. The joke was kind of funny. A lot of things. He said it's funny. It's funny. It's funny. This is one of the things he said before the show started. Just to test the temperature. Got it. And that said it's funny three times. So it was not funny. So is that what happens before I come in here? So he tests all the jokes out. So then we filter out the worst one. So he tries the best ones which are still bad. Yeah. And then he doesn't like three or four times. Because like when they don't laugh the first time, that's the indication to tell it again. Because they must not hurt it. You hear me? You're right. Got it. That one was good though. You like that one. Yeah, you laughed at that one. That's good. I laughed at you. Yeah. No, man, we got a packed show today, man. We got a lot of stuff to talk about as usual. But I wanted to do some like, going in the time machine with you for a minute. And reminisce just a little bit before we get to our main headlines. Because I saw this thing come this headline. I'm not going to show you here. I saw this come out and I'm like, damn man, like times have just changed. You know, this headline, it's not, I mean, listen, I don't condone it at all. But Ohio teacher pleads guilty to sex with student, right? And we've been seeing like, this is a new thing, I guess. But I'm just trying to understand like bro, like, what was this like, what was this energy when I was in school? You know, I'm saying like bro, like these teachers you should now, like bro, all my teachers, I don't know. What are we talking about? You don't got to end up the headline here. Yeah, well, yeah, this, this Ohio teacher. She was having sex with a student. Oh, it was a woman. Yeah, the woman's woman teacher, sex with a student. Um, no, Ohio, yeah. And she claims that her husband had neglected her. But she pled guilty on Monday to having sex with her student. Her husband neglected her. So she had sex with a fucking child. Yeah. But I'm just, like, I'm just curious, bro, because like none of my teachers look like that. Am I teachers all look like fucking this or miss fucking Trump? What's it? Who's that lady from Matilda? I don't know Matilda, but that you haven't seen Matilda? Okay, now hold on, now hold on. That is a fucking classic movie. Have you seen it? I have seen it. Okay. But that's not a movie you'll expect any to see at all. That's a classic. That's a classic. That's a completely like miles away from your circle. What's it about? It's about a very brilliant kid who's in a school and the principal's very strict about it and she's a brilliant, but it's like a kid movie. Okay, it's up to with Sam lot and shit, bro. All right. Ain't up there with Sam lot, but that's fine. No, I'm saying like that genre. Sam lot. You know what I'm saying? Sam lot and Matilda do not go in the same fucking sentence. Sure they do. No, they fucking know only by someone who's a moron. Let's ask the people. All right. Now Andy, they say a lot and Matilda belong in the same category. The same like the little rascals. Like it's all in the same fucking thing. Well, listen, I don't want to get fuck with by that lady. So I kind of get it. My teachers look like that. Let's keep it on track. But that's what my teachers look like, bro. I agree. I think that's the problem. I need to bring back like the masculine lesbian gyms teachers and they wouldn't have any of these problems. Look dude, I'll be real with you. I see this happening more and more too. It's like recent bro. Like it's my thing. And like the women that are doing it are somewhat attractive. They are. And if that were a man doing that, it would be like, it just shows you the double standard society. Yeah bro. Like if that were a man doing that, they'd be throwing his ass into woodshipper rightfully so, by the way. But if women do it, every half the people, three quarters of the dudes are like, fuck yeah. So it's definitely one of those weird societal double standards. Yeah. Dude, if this should happen back when I was in school, I would be pushing the charge the kid. You know what I'm saying? That's how bad the teachers look. Yeah. That's the truth. I agree. I'm talking about the kid in jail, man. It is weird, though. And like, just blame, oh, I was neglected by my husband. Come on, come on, lady. Come on. Come on. But dude, it is weird. What are you doing as a 30 something year old, a Traffy? Well, there was another one that just got accused of that, who was pretty attractive. Very young. Yeah. And she fucking was also married. And the mom found the exchange in the kid's phone and then called the cops on her. And one of those teachers got fucking pregnant by the student. Dude, I don't know. It does seem like it's happening more and more. And it is weird. Like what? What's causing it? Why are women doing that? Yeah. It's it's it's it's that was not something that women the teachers, unless it happened back then and we just never heard of it. Yeah, right. But did you guys ever know of any teachers doing that? But again, I mean, like back then with our teachers, nobody's banging about that shit. You know what I'm saying? I'm like, yeah, but dude. You know, I don't know, man. It's I mean, look. It's sick. She needs to go to jail and needs to watch it for sure. I don't understand why people like I don't understand it. Yeah, no, I don't get it. Like why the fuck are you in a track that like go back to that lady? How old is she? 42. Okay, she's Emily Nutley. Yeah, she's not terrible looking. You know what I'm saying? Like she's not like a hideous wench. Yeah, right. Like you can't find a dude that's over 15 years old to fuck with. You know what I'm saying? Like I find that hard to believe. Yeah, that's difficult. You know, so like the she's definitely into some weird shit. And I think a lot of women get fucking get off the hook for being into that weird ass kid shit because they're women. And you know, and like, dude, it's, you know, if you ask the kid that 50 he's gonna be like, fuck dude, I'm not mad at her. But like, bro, remiss is Nutley. Yeah. It's just, I don't know. And then you look in the comments, dude, and everybody's like, fuck yeah, bro. Like I'd be all about that. Like that's it. That's it. That's equally a secret. Would you excuse that same behavior for a man? Absolutely not. Nobody would. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. There's a lot of double standards in society between men and women, dude, that like are very unfair, very, very, very unfair. And everybody knows them. That's the part that's in there. And then they deny it. And then just act like a dad. Like it's not real. Yeah, it's bullshit. Like, and dude, I'm not even advocating for fair. That's everybody else. I'm fully aware that shit's not fair. But everybody else wants to talk about equality and fairness and all this shit. Well, you know, I mean, there's a lot of double standards to discuss. This is definitely like one where, like if that were, if that were you, you, your life would be over. Yeah. And I mean, their life is ruined. I mean, she's gonna go to fucking jail. And yeah, I mean, she's got a register. She's like a sex offender and all of that good stuff. Yeah, she's gonna be listening on the Ohio sex offender registry as a tier three sex offender. Is she going to jail? Oh, yeah, facing up to 10 years. Not enough. Not enough. Which, sorry, Mrs. Nettley. You know what, dude? I agree. Yeah. Yeah, it is what it is, dude. You got to hold people with the same fucking standards. It's just is what it is. And while, you know, like I think it also, I think it's interesting how people will look at young men and say, oh, well, you know, they made the decision and they wanted that. That, that, that, that, that. Well, you don't think that 15 or 16 year old girls are just as manipulative. You know what I'm saying? Like I would actually argue that it's probably easier to take care of, take advantage of a 15 year old boy than it is a 15 year old girl. Because 15 year old girls have already started to get male attention from all their peers. And, you know, they've started to navigate how to, you know, deal with that sexual attention from so they, they understand sexual discipline much earlier than men. Some men never figured out because men are typically the people pursuing sex. Not being pursued. Yeah. And then when the first woman that comes and shows them, you know, any affection or any sort of like sexual interest, they're going to jump on it. Right. There's this. Yeah. I mean, like, so it's a, it's crude. Yeah. It's just look, man, we need to have fucking laws that people are held equally accountable to. And, you know, I personally, when I think when I see this happen and I see women doing this to young, young men, and then I see the comments. To me, it's, I think it's fucking, I think it's fucked up. Yeah, it is. And this guy's telling us what you think down in the comments. Let us know with that being said, man, let's get into our crews. Let's cruise the internet with all the plethora of headlines we have for you today. Yeah. Yeah. Sponsored by very foreign screaming for you. That's right. Yeah. I'm halfway through this game because he shot something was wrong with me. No, there is. He's like, you're you and drugs today or something? I said, no, it's just the first foreign screaming. Well, thanks for the, thanks for the read. Yeah. Yeah, I got you. All right. So what we got, let's give it to these headlines guys. Remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find them all linked there. Check down in the link description below and check them out there as well. That being said, let's get to our first set of headlines. Let's cover some doge updates. Doge. Doge has some updates. This is how I read Elon Musk's doge. Discovers millions and taxpayer dollars wasted on unemployment claims for fake people. Shocking. I mean, we've seen it. They were collecting social security checks and shit. Now, unemployment's apparently been compromised to no one surprised. Elon Musk's doge revealed in a bombshell finding that millions of dollars and unemployment claims have been going to quote unquote fake people who haven't even been born yet. Some not even in this century. Here's a tweet coming straight from doge saying an initial survey of unemployment insurance claims since 2020, revealed the following 24,000 people over 115 years old claimed almost $60 million in benefits. 28,000 people between one and five years old claim $254 million in benefits. And then 9.7,000 people with birth dates over 15 years in the future claimed almost $70 million in benefits. In one case, someone with a birthday in the year 2154 claimed $41,000. Well, that must be better than Trump. That's who that is. Yeah, he came back from from time. He's came back to the future back to 1890 wrote a book, right, then was teleported to now where he's about to conquer the world. Didn't want to take daddy's money. Yeah. I mean, that's obviously bearing Trump makes sense to me. Yeah. You know, that's the rest of them, you know, have no excuse. So we're talking 400 million dollars in, uh, in, in, you know, bullshit. Where did money go? Where did it go? Where did it go? Where did it go? You can't tell me that we can't track them. The like we, you guys can track every single dollar down to the fucking dime of an actual citizen, but with forensic audits, but you can't figure out where this goes. Let's see where it goes. I know where. Yeah. Why aren't we telling us? Where's the full disclosure we were promised? And by the way, if you didn't get the reference, the reference is, um, there's a lot of people that they bear in Trump's a time traveler. And Donald Trump too. And they, they're here from the future to save the world. It's reasonable. It's kind of crazy. No. It's not crazy. It's, it's true. No. I think the, the, the, the, the, the extent that people try to go to just like, I don't know, that's how that's together. You know, you know what I figured out, dude? People want to think and talk and put things together, but they want to do nothing about the things that are obvious that need to be done. Crazy. Yeah. You know, you know, I must treat it, uh, treat it out saying your tax dollars were going to pay fraudulent unemployment claims for fake people born in the future. This is so crazy that I had to read it several times before it sank in. Um, now, doge, they've obviously still been doing their thing. Um, but that's not even what people would matter out. They're, they're, they're, they're concerned about the economy and they're concerned about the stock market. Um, and it's interesting because you know, it's been, uh, it's been a, it's been a while. A few days and, um, uh, there's been some ups, been some downs, stocks soar after strong demand and treasury action and tariff policy. Uh, this came out yesterday. Um, Wall Street surged Wednesday after a blowout 10 year treasury auction helped calm fears of the financial crisis delivering a shot, but to doomsayers who predicted foreign investors would flee, flee American assets and protests of President Donald Trump's trade agenda. And President Trump announced a pause and tariff hikes on some countries. Um, so there's been some wins, right? Um, a new bill just got passed in the house today. Um, it was a house bill that voted for a measure advancing President Donald Trump's mega agenda, including tax cuts. Um, after fierce Republican infighting. So it passed in the, again, in the house, 216 to 214 14. I don't believe any Democrats voted for it or any communist voted for it. Shocking. Um, you know, but here's the thing again, I guess today things were great. Everything was looking good. Out of the deal, Trump pauses tariffs on countries that didn't retaliate causing US stocks to skyrocket. Um, China's now at 125% I think they actually up even just before the recording. That's like a 140 or something like that. Um, and so you got that going on. Trump put this tweet out or this truth out yesterday, uh, saying based on the lack of respect, uh, respect the China has shown to the world's markets. I am hereby raising the tariff charge to China by the United States of America to 125% effective immediately. Um, at some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the USA and other countries is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Um, and it's interesting because you know, all the communists, all the left, people on that side of the aisle, they get pissed off at all these tariffs and stuff going in saying they're going to destroy it and it's interesting because a clip has been circulating. Um, and uh, let's check this out. Yeah, please. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, they've been talking about tariffs for decades. How far does China have to go? How much more repression? How big a trade deficit and loss of jobs for the American worker? It says to the Chinese that their unfair trade policies have got to end. It says to the Chinese, this is a shot across your bow. Reform because if you don't, there are going to be dramatic consequences. How come when these Democrat elites want tariffs, everything's hunky and jewellery, but when President Trump wants tariffs, all hell breaks loose. Do you see this double standard? I love this guy. Who have an hell that is? That's really nice. I appreciate that question. No, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, everybody knew you had to do it, but they never had the guts to do it. It does take guts. It even takes guts for our country to go through it. That's why I say be cool. They were saying about, see, just be cool. It's going to work out. It's going to work out and it's, uh, it's working out. I can tell you working out, maybe faster than I thought. But I said it's, it's, uh, it's going to take a little conditioning. It's a transition to, it's really, I think it's a transition to greatness. It's going to be great. It's our country is going to be, there'll be nothing like it. And people investing in our country, they're going to do better than they've ever done before. What? Not, I mean, so it is interesting. I mean, that was them back in 96, um, when the percentages and the amounts were way less than what they are now, but now they're going to get such a bad thing. Yeah. Was that before they were bought? Maybe, uh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, all we got to do is ask anybody who's against the restructuring of the international tariffs and trade agreements. All we have to do is, is look at their bank accounts. All we got to do is audit where they're getting their money because they're benefiting financially, some way, shape, or form period. And if you're not benefiting financially, then it would make sense that you would want the United States, America to be independent strategically from literally every angle and self sufficient from every angle, pharmaceuticals, fuel, GDP of all different products. And what we actually have here, manufacturing, what we have here though is, and, and, you know, people are like, well, if the manufacturing comes back, it's just going to be a bunch of fucking robots. Yeah. Okay. Maybe that's true. However, uh, the reality of it is, is that allows us to be strategically secure so that China can't say, Hey, guess what? No more medicine. Hey, guess what? No more, uh, microchips. Hey, guess what? This or that? And it removes us from being the mercy of other countries that don't have our interest in mind. And that strategic advantage is a massive advantage. And what Trump's trying to do is get us back to that point where we are dependent on ourselves, uh, on our own production capabilities, on our own people, on our own technology. So that China does a control it. And what's happened over the last 20 years is China has become the epicenter of manufacturing, uh, and that's allowed them to control the other countries that deal with strategically at their whim. You know, oh, you know, we don't. They don't like something that somebody's doing. They can just make it very difficult for them to even get any kind of products. So, you know, it is what it is, man. You know, look, what he's doing is going to temporarily cause some issues. Nobody's denying that. But just like taking your fat ass and getting it in fucking shape, guess what? You're going to have to be uncomfortable for a little bit before you're comfortable. That's the reality. And we have had leaders in place for a long time who have sold America out for their own personal gain and profit for their families gain and profit to where it doesn't serve the America people, which by the way is treasonous. And that's been going on for decades. And Trump is trying to fix it. So of course, there's going to be some lag time where we go from one way of doing things to another way of doing things. All right. When you switch jobs, when you go to the new job, you're not just automatically smooth. It's rough. You got to learn. It's there's a there's a like it's just the laws of nature, changing things. Go you go through a phase of discomfort. And let's be fucking real. How many of these people are actually experiencing any discomfort? Okay. Most of them aren't. Most of them, the prices of things are going down or they're choosing things that have not gone up, which is exactly what we're supposed to be doing. When you see the price of something in the store, go up three or four times. And there's an alternative there that has made here or somewhere else one of these other countries that's not imposing any tariffs, which one are you going to buy? Okay, which takes the power away from China. But all of these other countries saying, no, we are going to have fair trade with America. And we're done taking advantage of everybody saying that because they have to we have the leverage. We are the biggest consumers on the planet. They all have to work with us or they don't have an economy. By the way, China's the same and Trump knows that. All right. So the reality of this situation that we're dealing with here is that if China does not come to the table and and give us fair trade, then all the other countries are going to be working with us and not with them. That's reality. So what he's doing is he's using Zishu Pings own ego and bravado and need to be this, you know, like, you know, how he walks around like he's the boss of the fucking world against him. All right. So this is very smart chess move. And since most people who are criticizing this have never had a negotiated fucking deal ever on anything in their entire life, they don't understand it. Okay. These people are afraid to talk to people and fucking person. So I don't really care if they're fucking upset. No. It is another thing too. Like I've also thought about this and you mentioned it, like, you know, bringing a manufacturing production back here and like, oh, you know, we're just going to replace those robots. Well, I mean, here's a brutally honest conversation. I've taken a long time thinking about this, bro, but like, here's the reality, in my opinion, a lot of Americans are lazy. Yes. A lot of America, like, and we are lazy and we are greedy at the same time. And those two things can't go together. Now it's lazy and entitled at the same. You know what I'm saying? Like, like, we're, so we want the best shit, but we don't want to actually do anything to get the best shit. So it's like, what the fuck do you think is going to happen? Well, that's where all this talk of oppression comes in. Well, I haven't been able to succeed because this or I'm that or I'm this. Or I'm that. Well, you didn't succeed because you don't fucking pay the price. That's it. That's it. It's a, it's a, and it's a truth that we're going to have to come and turn it. Okay. But that truth culturally has made America weak, which is why we talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion because to switch the culture from an entitled lazy, unwilling culture, we have to switch the way that we behave and make it cool to be the opposite of those things. And the way you make it cool to be the opposite of those things is by going out and building your life and your, your community and your business with certain high standards and living those standards. And then when people bitch at you about, you tell me, each shit. Okay. So it's very simple. The reality is is Trump's removing the power from China and re-sendering it in the United States. Most people can't understand that. But he's doing it and it doesn't really matter what they fucking think. It just doesn't know. Now, you mentioned something else about the people, you know, pissed off at all of this. Like one of the other things that came up is when Trump put out that truth, saying like now is a great time to buy or whatever. You see that, right? Well, they got a bunch of people's paintings in a bunch. Let's check in with Adam Schiff real quick. Let's check this clip out. How concerned are you with this market fluctuation? Are you concerned that there could be members of the White House that are benefiting from it? Absolutely. I'm writing to the White House to demand who knew in advance that the president was going to once again flip flop on tariffs. And are people cashing in? There is just all too much opportunity for people in the White House and the administration to be inside of trading and you can't put a pass them for a minute. So we're going to try to find out. There's a good chance though to ignore you. Right? Should there be some other independent investigation of this? Well, I think Congress should do an investigation into this. But we're going to demand the answers from the administration. I think you're right. They're likely to stonewall, particularly if they've been engaged in corrupt insider trading. But they won't be able to hide it for good. I mean, we know is in the administration. We can look at eventually what people are buying and selling. This will come out, but an administration that has their own mean coins and is already engaged in self-interested dealing when Elon is dozing agencies that are doing oversight of their own businesses and that kind of corrupt climate. You have to assume the worst and we're going to try to find out. That's going to come back to buy them. Yeah. Are you going to investigate it? All right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. You know, I was jumped in on this bandwagon too. AOC, AOC jumped on it. She's a AOC for one says what everyone is thinking about Trump, Tareth Madness. So she's put out this tweet. Um, uh, yesterday saying any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I've been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor. Disclosure deadline is May 15th. We're about to learn a few things. It's time to ban insider trading in Congress. I think it's time to ban any trading in Congress. Period. Yeah. Nancy Pelosi in 2021 trader of the year. And she's, she's the trader of the year and the trader of the year. Bro, she's at 700% return right now. Yeah. Where, where, where's, uh, where is a Schumer's portfolio? Where is Schiff's portfolio? Let's see it. Where, where are the, you know, let's see who's, let's do see the train. Let's see this. I agree with them. Let's see the first thing I fucking. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see it. Let's see all of it. Let's see it. Yeah. Let's, let's, I'm down with it. Yeah. And then when we find out who's been doing it, we get to re-confiscate and redistribute all the profits. Just like you guys have also been saying. Yeah. It was redistribute the rest. Yeah. I'm cool. Yeah. I'm, I'm cool with that. You know, but here's another thing I want to bring up on this. How, how the, is that a real cover? I was going to say like it should be how do they make Nancy Pelosi not look like a zombie? Yeah. She actually, she's all right there. I mean, she doesn't look like she's dead. Now she looks like a zombie. Bro, she's bad right now. Yeah. She's pretty bad right now. Yeah. Not bad enough. Not bad enough. But, but here's the thing, Eddie. On the last CTI we covered talking about China and, you know, all of this situation. You mentioned something as like an alternative possibility, something that could happen, right? You mentioned about how China could just, you know, take all of our IPs and just go do the shit themselves. Uh-huh. Here is a new article that just came out from New York Post. Articled headline reads how China has amped up its factories and is threatening to crush United Industry, United States Industry with a new tsunami of cheap products. Yeah. When we yesterday I told you that. I told you that's what they would do. Yeah. That's the only strategic move. Yeah. And they just invested about $2 trillion. Yeah. And their stuff within the last couple of years, which makes me wonder like I think they knew this was coming. Right. Like they knew that you know what I'm saying? They like this was their failsafe. Well, of course, they've been ripping everybody off for two decades. They know eventually people are going to say enough and they want to be prepared for it. It's just wild, man. It's wild. Um, and now everybody's talking about it. And there is another thing they're doing too. They started dump our fucking bonds. Have you been seeing that? So this is another response. I guess, you know, I didn't think about it, but you know, China holds three quarters of a trillion dollars of US debt. Um, they're the second largest foreign holder after Japan. Um, and they've been selling off and cashing in on their bonds of debt that we have with them. Um, and I mean, again, three quarters of a trillion dollars. That's a fucking lot. You know, I'm saying to be pulling out real relatively quick. So, and I don't know the, you know, political tactics behind it. If it can be stopped or whatever the case it is. Um, but it is something to definitely keep on the, the horizon. Um, but as of today, the Chinese one, uh, falls to lowest levels since 2007 after Trump tariffs kicked in. So again, how long are they going to write that out? It's working. Yeah. How long are they going to write that out? It's working. If Zichipin doesn't come around, there will be a revolution in China because of this. So it is what it is. Or there'll be an actual hot war between the United States and China. And it'll be a physical war. Yeah. That's, that's what I mean. Yeah. It would be a fucking not a cyber fucking. It'll be a real one. Like it'll be a fucking legit. And a scary thing about it is scary to think about at this point. I don't give a fuck. Yeah. Fucking let's do it. Yeah. Let's fucking do it. I'm fucking. I mean, yeah, I'm tired of fucking talking about it. You know, these motherfuckers talk about this shit all the time. Let's fucking go. That's how I feel about it. But I mean, I like orange chicken. Listen, I'm, I'm just like, I'm tired of people fucking with everything. Like, okay, then let's fucking do it. It's concrete. Yeah. We would concrete. That's my own. Like, dude, if I was in, bro, like that would be my only rule. Any war we get into when we win. We're taking the fucking land. That's the way it's always been. It's how it's supposed to be. Yeah, I don't. Listen, I don't really care anymore. I'm tired of these fucking elite fucks all playing with our lives and playing with our incomes and playing, you know, God to everybody else. I don't fucking care. That's a little bit on this, man. There's just fucking stock markets. Something interesting. I looked at. So the stock market is completely overinflated with fucking foreign cash. That's what people don't understand. When the, when, when things got really bad. Okay, the last, you know, four years were Biden and people were paying $12 doesn't for eggs and all this fucking bullshit. The crap, the fucking stock market didn't go down. It went up. Yeah. Tremendously. Why? Because it's propped up with foreign money, bro. It's overinflated. Like the number that we have in the stock market is not reflective of an accurate American investment, you know, portfolio for sure. You know, and dude, you have China should be banned from buying property here. They should honestly be banned from investing in our stock market. We should just say fuck you and take the hit all at once and never fuck with them ever again because they will go back to being a third world little fucking shithole country like they like they have been for fucking thousands of fucking years until they started figuring out how to fucking steal all of our shit and everybody else is shit. And so if it were me, I'd be doing the same thing Trump's doing. And only I'd be more aggressive. I'd say, oh, yeah, by the way, now I'm taking all your fucking property here. No more ownership of fucking anything by Chinese nationals in this country. Period. You got citizen citizenship in China. You have, you have companies in China. You do business in China. Fuck you. Make them feel it. They'd be over. They would be over. They come crawling with their hat in their hands saying, okay, we're not as tough as we said we were the rice hat. Yeah. That's right. I mean, that's what it is. What is what? Yeah, I don't. It is what it is. They'll be back to eating fucking crickets and shit. Bro. It's crazy. I want to show you like two year point though. Right. So I got some free shots. You guys listen to an audio. I have to come check this out on YouTube. But look at it. People think China's like kick an ass right now. Like, I also think that they're good. Like, bro, people forget that's a communist country. It's a communist country. They have slavery over there going on today right now. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? They've genocide it. Plenty of people over there like not like fucking 56 to years ago. Like, it's not only that. If their whole ideology is different than the United States, they actually do this part right. Okay. They care about China. They care about China and they care about Chinese people, which is fucking how they shit. Yeah. That's okay. We don't do that. And that's our fault. That's not them. That doesn't make them bad. Okay. I'm going to call it as I see it. There's a lot of shit I don't like about them, but they do that right. And we don't do that right. We're over. And by the way, why don't we do that right? Oh, it's because they are allowed to invest in our shit over here, corrupt our politicians, corrupt our media, corrupt everything that's going on, drive these ridiculous fucking political culture, uh, destroying narratives into our schools, like the trans narrative about kids being able to choose their gender or, uh, you know, pumping our, our kids full of bullshit stuff while they teach their kids mathematics and combat. Okay. We're the idiots. All right. And we have to fix it because I'm going to tell you right now they are willing to lie cheat and fucking steal to stay ahead of America. And we don't do that. They don't do that. Americans don't say, Hey, you know what? Like this is the relationship. Like men will really understand this. Okay. Most men have a friend or two that they could call at three o'clock in the morning and say, Hey, I need you to fucking be here. I don't need, I need you and I asked me any fucking questions about it, but we got to take care of something. I need you. They're going to be there. And then they're not going to say shit about it ever to fucking anybody. Okay. China does that as a country. Okay. They say, Hey, you're Chinese and you're part of China. We're we're going to take care of it. And we don't give a fuck what we got to do to do that. That's not how they operate over here. Over here, we operate on idealism. We operate on the world as a nice place. The world is not a nice place. Those people do not like us. They do not want us to do well. They the only reason that we aren't speaking Chinese is because they would ruin their country trying to come at us. All right. We have lost the understanding that as a culture and for a lot of different reasons that the real world is a very hard and cut throat place. And our culture isn't built for that anymore. And there's is. And so, you know, until the United States gets back to the understanding of we have to do what we have to do to take care of our country first. It's we're going to continue to suffer. No matter who likes it, no matter who is it. Like bro, and yeah, it's we don't owe China fucking anything. We don't owe any of these countries anything. We owe our own citizens and our own people the best possible country that we can offer them. And I believe that mean personally, that means zero dollars to fucking anybody. Now, Trump doesn't share that same opinion because we are still sending money to other causes like Israel. But I just think I think we need to be a lot more extreme with the the road. I'm on the other side of where most people are. Most people are like, oh my God. Look what he's doing. And I'm like, no, he needs to do that like more. We need more of that. Not 140. We need like fucking 410%. Yeah. We need we need you to ruin everything they're doing unless they're willing to play completely fair, which appears to be what he's doing. You know, and that's going to caught that's going to you have to be willing as an American to eat a little bit of that. You have to be willing to say, hey, I'm going to fucking pursue this and see this through for the next fucking six months or whatever it takes so that my kids don't have to deal with this bullshit because you guys what Chinese people are doing that over in China. Bro, they're fucking I mean, they're hunkering down as much as they can. But they're they're bought into it mainly because if they're not they get killed, you know, I'm saying, but like they're in on it. No, bro, they've had China's had so many generations now of this kind of government to where the people have grown up and they think it's the only way. They don't understand. You know, their culture is very disciplined and they're very fucking organized and they're very intelligent and they're very loyal. And which I can't blame them for. That's how you're supposed to do it. We just haven't been doing that because they've been subverting our entire education system, culture, news, media, politics to their advantage. And that's why things and by the way, they're not the only country who's been doing that. Israel's been doing that too. Okay. So we have to cut out those influences in our country at any means. And the Trump administration hasn't done that yet. And like, dude, if you really want to get people behind you and you really want people to understand, then go all the way here and say, Hey, no more fucking money to any of these fucks until we're fucking good. And then people are going to be like, Oh, all right. You know, but there's just all this, you know, this Israel shit's really losing a lot of a lot of Trump doesn't understand how much of the base he's losing over the every time he brings up the vaccines and the Israel shit. Yeah. Just wanted to throw this in here real quick, finishing up to your point, 2020 to 2024. I mean, people smell blood with all the bullshit we had going on. They they fucking went all in. I mean, this is S&P. Again, you know, man, on fucking 2020 to 2024, you see the fucking boom, right? Same thing on the Nasdaq. Same thing on the dial. Right. I mean, so broke. Yes. Yeah. You're not going to convince people. They're just going to have to wait and see. Yeah. Because it's it's above most people's ability to strategically think to understand what the play is actually going on here. Like what's going on? Like they can't understand it. And then they have the media who's partially funded by both Israel and fucking China in different ways. Saying completely different messages. My my my main thing here for everybody is just to see. Look at who's bitching about it. Okay. These are the same people that told you COVID was going to fucking kill you. And you you're a bad person for, you know, breathing, fucking air. It's the same people who told you that if you didn't post a black square, you were a fucking big. It's the same people that, you know, if you didn't post to Ukraine flag, you were a trader. It's the same people that said, you know, Trump is a Russian agent. You know, it's a it's the same. It's the same. It's the same. It's the same. So why are you listening to those people at all about this? Yes. They they don't know what the fuck they're talking about. These people hear things and then repeat things. That's all it is. They don't comprehend any of it, you know, and good times make weak men. And that generation. Did what the fuck they did. And these hard times are going to make strong man. We're already seeing that with a lot of the young, the young, Gen Z men who are completely rejecting leftist ideology and political correctness and embracing truth and masculinity and being a strong, financially independent, gentlemen warrior of an American citizen. So they are in listen. It's the cycle. It's an 80 year cycle. There's a whole book about it called the fourth turning. It's there's another book about it called hard times make weak men by Stefan and Ario like the those are the weak men. And I hate to say it, you know, but we have a generation that are, they're pissed off that their investment account is now getting fucked for decisions that they did or didn't make that have made the country harder for everybody. And that's a reality. Okay. So I'm not trying to hear that shit. That's real man. Guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, let's go crew some of these comments. You're still getting kind of lit up a little bit for what? Well, let's see. LV Pierce says the amount of shit DJ got for days of thunder. And you're telling us Andy has never seen Lion King. Yeah. Cause Lion King is for babies. No, Andy, no, it's not. Lion King is for children. Well, I mean, so a sausage party. That's for children. No, it's not. You ever see a sausage party? I don't care. I don't give a fuck. Is that maximum today? Yeah. So I don't care what the fuck you think about me not seeing Lion King. Yeah. Just say it and get some some well, it is what it is. You should watch it. Yeah. I'm not going to say it. Well, it is what it is. You should watch it. You come back crying. Now, you're be singing a circle of life and shit. Like it'd be great. Be what? Singing a circle of life. What's that? The main thing, it's the circle of life. Listen, I only watch movies where people die. People die. The animals die. The animals die. Yeah, I'm talking about people. Oh. Okay. All right. Next one on that topic. Just a nobody. 74 says BS and he doesn't have fun. I see what you drive to work every day. You have fun every day. That's fact. That's fact. You do have fun. That's fact. That's fact. I have alpha fun. Alpha. Alpha. Alpha fun. All right. Last comment comes from at Mike Lowry. The Mike Lowry one. Foul she needs to predict a wood chipper in this feature. Yeah, or we need to predict one in the future. I think it visualizes it. We need to manifest it to manifest a wood chipper in the future. That's how that works. I think it's a big, big, big thing. I think it's a big thing. I don't even like driving nice cars, bro. I just do it because nobody else does it. You know what I'm saying? Because I'm alpha. Got it. Got it. Got it. All right. This next. This last comment comes from at Mike Lowry, the Mike Lowry one. I don't know how that works. Yeah. We can't wait for everybody to figure it out. We'll do that at the camp. Uh, yeah. Yes. Yes. Guys, we're a part of the. I can't wait for the bat. I can't wait for my. I can't wait for the part where we cry together. Yeah. That's what I want. I want to. You know, in the in the hot tub. Naked. Guys, we appreciate you. Yeah. For being real ass naked fans. Yeah. Yeah, man. All right. Um, head on number two. This is an interesting one. China for some reason has been on the topic. Um, and so, you know, there's a lot of interesting stuff happening. Um, but let's go check over on Ukraine because there's been an interesting update over there. Um, Beijing is allowing Putin to its recruit Chinese fighters to join its war in Ukraine. And 155 have already signed up. Apparently, these are the reports coming out from Ukraine. Um, that Beijing is allowing Putin to recruit Chinese soldiers to fight against Ukraine. Vladimir Zelensky has claimed. Ukrainian President says that 155 have already signed to battle in Moscow's forces after revealing that his country's forces have captured two Chinese men fighting for the invading power. He told reporters in Kiev. Uh, that Russia was recruiting Chinese citizens via social media and that the country's officials were aware of that. So there was this video that got, uh, released and started circulating around. Let's check it out. So let's see. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. And hold what? What a commander. Ooh. Mm. Mm. Now, I just. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. I do. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's fairly six of, uh, they've been coming to Ukraine for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we have a couple of things to do with the air. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. assess whether the recruits were receiving instructions from Beijing. The Chinese issue was serious. There were 155 people with names and passport details who were fighting against Ukrainians on the territory of Ukraine. Zalinsky told General was during a brief in Kiev. So he's also saying that Ukraine had information that there were significantly more Chinese citizens still among the Russian ranks adding we are currently clarifying all the facts. So it's interesting because again, China they're not new to this. They involve themselves in everything without directly saying they're involved in everything. They got hands in all the buckets. You mentioned a couple of slides about education and the media. The craziest thing to me is I feel like a lot of people all will, China is our biggest threat. China is our biggest threat. But it's like it's so it's interesting because you know every single day more and more stuff is coming out. This new headline this the story is starting to get some get a lot of attention. This headline reads why former Green Beret congressman wants to ban GNC protein powder and vitamins from US military bases. Have you seen this? Yeah. So so this is interesting. Let's dive into this a little bit. A popular American wellness store could be the next target of congress as companies with links to Beijing face the wrath of the Republican controlled US government general nutrition centers better known as GNC is a manufacturer and retailer that sells health nutrition and fitness related ingestible products like powdered vitamin supplements herbs minerals and energy products. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania it was initially an American company. But since 2020 it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbin pharmaceutical group which is a pharmaceutical manufacturer owned by the Chinese Communist Party. With this revelation, a North Carolina congressman and former Green Beret told DailyMail.com he is now making it his mission to get all the GNCs removed from military installations. Let's check this clip out. I'm here for brag the center of the universe for our special operations forces and earlier this week I introduced the military installation retail security act because we found out that GNC is fully owned by the Chinese Communist Party and is operating over 80 facilities across our military bases in the United States. That's got to stop but here on for brag there's not just one not two not three but four locations right here on Fort Bragg alone. Maybe that's so the Chinese Communist Party can better serve our most elite special operators. If I have anything to say about this and I do they're not going to be here for long. Now the implications of you know well guys I mean I happen to know a guy who happens to own the one of the largest independent American owned sports supplement retailers. I know a guy. The guy's name is me. So why don't you guys give me a call and work some shit out. Get old supplement super stores on every military base. I promise you I will serve the military. We won't we won't do whatever they're doing that you don't like which I'm not even sure about what it is yet. What there's the point of the matter is why the fuck are you guys working with China instead of working with American companies like us should have been that way. Yeah. Now I mean what they're concerned about is the collection is the collection of data whenever a veteran or member of the military purchases something from a GNC on the base again these are your Fort Bragg again that's like the fucking hub of special operations. Yeah. These guys are all you know using protein they're all taking supplements and stuff like that like they go to those retail locations. Where does that information go? You know what I'm saying and like it clearly goes to China. You know what I'm saying is like I mean that like I can understand the concern behind that like that would be a major concern. And it's an easy solution. Get them out. Get GNC off and call up this YouTuber podcaster dude. That's it. You know and we'll handle this business. Yeah. I mean yeah. I mean it seems like a very easy easy easy fix. It sure does. And by the way we'll do a far better job because we are far better. And I'll fucking right it walk right in GNC headquarters and tell them that they're fucking face. So it is what it is. It is what it is. Yeah. Now officials with the Department of Health and Human Services and the FBI tell Daily Mail they are cracking down on any company that has links to the CCP and supplies Americans with food, pharmaceuticals, vitamins, cosmetics and other things that go into our bodies. That will make sense. It would be very easy for them to I don't know do stuff. You know I will say this and I think this is not a for those of you that don't understand the supplement industry. I don't think there's any reason to panic or anything. Most of those products that they sell in their outside of their own label which I'm not sure about are just you know they're smaller supplement companies that just sell their products through GNC. So it doesn't mean that those companies are bad or compromised right. Yeah. Most of those products are made you know under certain regulations here in the United States and that's what they're selling. So like I you know as much as I'd like to say yeah I don't go in there. Yeah right. It's not the truth. Not like that for me. I don't see that being the issue with the threat. What I see being the issue is just again the what information are they able to collect. Yeah. You know I'm saying to me that that's what poses a well. I mean Pat Harrigan call me bro we'll fix it. I'll work with you hand in hand. I'll show you exactly what we can do to fix it. I'll be sick. We're getting fixed in fucking six months. Yeah. Why does the lens look like he's grabbing some boobs because I don't know. Yeah it's just interesting man. I don't know. Go back to Z. Go back to Z. Yeah. Like does his face make your angry when you look at it. He just looks like a real live South Park character. You know I'm saying. Yeah. I like who do you like better Putin or Z? Oh I'm coming bro you know I'm a Russian asset bro. Me too. Yeah I like Putin better. Just because Putin seems to just be cooler bro. Like this dude goes fucking like fishing with the shirt off and shit. You know what I'm saying? Like let's catch his fish bare handed. That's alpha male shit. Z ain't catching fish. You know what I'm saying? He's catching. He's like you. Parking. Parking cats. That's what I'm saying. I'm fucking quack wacks. I'm not a fan bro. I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan. They ducks. That's what I'm saying. I like ducks. Can't trust nobody he's duck. Yeah. They cats too. Keith. Yeah. You know like that to you. Yeah. So can't can't get down with that. Yeah. Look dude. It you know if Z rides it too long bro it's going to turn into a bad situation for Chinese people and they will there will be consequences. Yeah. It just seems to be like a lot of scrutiny. They don't have the leverage in this deal and they have enough leverage to cause a little pain but they don't have enough leverage to win this. And it is what it is. It's it's going to it's going to it's going to embarrass him which which dude here's what we're dealing with. We're dealing with two guys who have massive egos who the worst thing in the world to them is to not be embarrassed which means one of them is going to ride it all the way down to the bottom and the one with the leverage is going to win and the Americans have the leverage and that's what it is. 100% man. Yeah. I was jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think. That being said let's get to our final set of headlines. Let's do some trolling. Trolling. Trolling. Man the communist got lit up. The who? The communist. Oh the fucking left is dude. These last couple of days they've been getting lit up. Really? Yeah man it's been about fucking time. It's been pretty bad. By who? By regular Americans man. Good. Let's check it out. The first one. Shut your fucking mouth. Tim Walls heckled and booed by military veterans in Minnesota over his stolen valor. You see these videos going around? Nope. The Ups and Tampon Tim. Shut your fucking weird looking mouth. Shut your sperm carpet. Yeah. That's what I call your sperm receptacle. That's a good one. That's good. Yeah I thought of that all in my own. Yeah right now. Yeah you got heckled man because he's been lying bro it's coming out so walls never deploy it. He abandoned his battalion after they were deployed to Iraq so he could run for Congress. Tim Walls introduced himself at a 2006 veterans event as a retired command sergeant major which is a lie. Here's a clip. I'm Tim Walls and I'm running for Congress in Minnesota's first congressional district. I'm a retired command sergeant major. I spent 24 years in the Army National Guard. I spent the better part of two decades as a public school teacher. I'm a small business owner. I'm a father and I'm a husband. I intend to come here to Washington to provide authentic leadership. To worship him. To worship. I mean he looked actually I think he looks more more homo sapien there than he did than he does now. I you know I don't know I can't comment on that. You can. Okay well he always looks the same level of homo sapien. Yeah bro look if I saw that dude what is that 2006? That was 2006 yeah yeah I mean they still had digs. Yeah you know what I'm saying wait till I get in office just wait all you kids you still have dongs I'm gonna cut them off. Yeah not for long yeah got dogs not for long yeah Tim Walls. No more dick cheese I know they got in Minnesota. I don't yeah. Peace. Yeah no that's Wisconsin. Oh okay yeah same thing no Wisconsin is way better than it is it yeah in Minnesota. Oh yeah so he lied about there are the only people that drink more than people in St. Louis and Wisconsin they drink a lot. Oh fuck yeah really they like to drink. Huh they like to they like to drink they like to ride snowmobiles. EG's I guess yeah they like Packers football. You know they got a lot of lakes you know Minnesota's got a lot of lakes. It's nice up there man is it yeah I don't think I've ever been yeah it's nice I want to go to the Harley spot the Harley headquarters up there yeah that's in Milwaukee though yeah it's it's so nice and that people don't pay attention to politics apparently. They're out there busy shredding the shredding the nr shredding the nr yeah that's what they're doing up there yeah shredding the nr you know narlie shreds you know they got fucking homo sapiens in that's where all when Southboro I'm convinced but um nevertheless uh you know he lied about his rank in 2009 an a farewell message to soldiers actually deploying to Iraq um he claimed that he was again a retired command sergeant major as he sends a farewell message to soldiers deploying um but uh but nevertheless he decided to do this little event um and a lot of veterans showed up and here's the uh exchange you Stop Hey, oh, there's some passion in here. It's not like the sea shots are fucking mouth. I mean, look, man, you know, those people have every right to be upset. You know, you lied about your fucking service. A lot of these guys lost their buddies, lost their friends, their family, and quite honestly, a lot of them were realizing that what they lost them for wasn't actually what they were told they were losing them for. So not only was the mission that they went for, not the exact mission they were told they were going on, which has caused them to all feel a certain way. They're proud of what they did, but they're not proud of who they did or why they did it for. I mean, there's a lot of things that go into these people's mind. And then you have this fucking guy, you know, pretending he's one of them. Yeah, right. Even though he fucking abandoned them before the deployment and then goes votes for them for them to be deployed. It's crazy shit. It's crazy shit, but he wasn't the only one. Let's go to CNN, check in with CNN. They had a hot little exchange as well. CNN Scott Jennings takes personal shot at XMS NBC host Tiffany Cross and he did on their debate how relevant are you? This was good. Scott Jennings. He's like their, you know, Republican dissident basically. They bring them in. He's very smart, very educated, very intellectual, very witty as well. But he got into a heated back and forth exchange with Tiffany Cross on the panel discussion Wednesday night during which the pro Trump commentator reminded the former MSNBC host that she was like, go from her gig at Comcast on cable network. Check it out. And you cannot just go and say, I like it. It's mine now. It doesn't work that way. Well, that is what they're trying to do. And then this new world water. Yeah, absolutely. When they're looking at Greenland and say, I like it. I want to take it for mine. That is a very common. You are. You are. You have never ever said we're going to go to Greenland and quote colonize it or steal it. That's crazy. So you're irrelevant. I'm talking about the president. You got fired from your job. You can't change. If you want to engage in personal insults, but you lack in the legitimate point, you make up for it in personal input. I don't. You do. The point I am making is in this new world order. We are looking at countries, whether or not they're an adversary or ally, it is being determined on what kind of deal we can get. And we cannot govern. We cannot legislate that way. We are increasingly isolated on the world stage. So if you want to engage in personal insults, I will reserve that for your party who are not isolated. This will. Yes, let's reserve the personal insults for one party or the other. Like get the fuck out of here. That's all they got. Well, you started it. Yeah. Not only that. Why the fuck are you arguing against the strategic dominance of the United States when you're a fucking American? What are you fucking stupid makes no sense? Yeah, makes no sense. Let's let Russia come take fucking Greenland or China come take Greenland instead. Let's let them do that. That be fine. Yeah. I'm sure the people of Greenland would appreciate it. Anybody is going to colonize it. Why not be us? You know what I'm saying? That's my position. It's a strategic geographical play. Okay. It's about she's right. She says, oh, the new world order. This side, yeah, you're right about that. That's why it's more important to fucking make sure that people can't come here and do things to you and your family. Like why would you argue against that? Because you're stupid. Real talk. Like you're so caught up in your political correct resistance to quote unquote, the bad guy that you can't even realize a strategic move that's going to benefit you and your family. Okay. You can't argue with that. No. I mean, it was kind of a low blow. What he said, you know, but it was funny. He said it first. Well, you're not relevant. You're not even in the office. No more. He's like, well, I mean, you got fired for the job. I relevant. Are you? Yeah. I mean, far. Yeah. Notice how she puts her hands right up in his face, too. Yeah. Like, dude, like, bro, listen, lady, you got you got got it is what it is. Imagine someone putting their hands in your fucking face like that. Yeah. I know. I know. It's bullshit. But you know how else is learning that lesson? Anderson Cooper and good old Bern dog Bernie Sanders. What they get into it? No, not them. They just got fact checked by one of their own. Yeah. Anderson Cooper gets brutal work. Woke fact check live on air while introducing civil rights attorney. Anderson Cooper is suffered an embarrassing moment as he hosted a town hall event for Bernie Sanders where he misgendered a civil rights attorney. Let's check this club out. All the backup center Bernie Sanders. I want to introduce Grace Thomas. She's a local civil rights attorney. She's a Democrat. Great. They then pronouns actually. Thank you. Oh, he made Senator Sanders polling and turnout data indicate that racial demographics are turning away from the Democratic Party. But of course, you see Bernie's face. They created that. Look at his face. Oh, fuck is even. Even Bernie that fucking like dude, he even knows his bullshit. Dude, that's funny. I'll tell you what, dude, there's times where I like Bernie Sanders. Same. Yeah, there's like these times where I'm like, bro, Bernie's pretty funny. He's got some good shit to say. And then there's times where I'm like, this guy is fucking fucking crap. Bro, that's so funny. First of all, like, like in the way she said it was like, you should know. Yeah, right. You should know they they them actually, they them energy. They know you got to listen, lady. If you want to get they them, you got to cut all your hair off the diet blue. Yeah. And then you'll get yourself a couple face piercings. We couldn't tell. Get yourself some unemployable tattoos on your fucking forehead. And, you know, and then the, the stereotypical glasses, you know, the Rachel Maddow glasses. And you wear all that shit together and everybody to get your pronouns right. Yeah. Wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't be misgendered for sure. Fucking fucking day them. They them. What the fuck is they them about you? There's one of you. It's just one. Okay. Now you argue. Yeah, there's I mean, you're pretty big. You know, there might be a one and a half. But like, bro, they that like who really thought this up? Like they them. Yeah. Like I can understand the all our retarded. God, dude. Like I can understand the, the, you know, a man wanting to be called a woman and a woman wanting to be called a man doesn't make you a man or a woman. But if you want to play dress up and pretend that's cool. Nobody else has pretend with you. It's mental illness. You're not fooling me. It's a tension to. I don't think you're fooling yourself. You know, what what is they that all in Bernie? It's they them actually. He's got to be like the meme of fucking a fucking a April. Like this has to be the meme of April. Well, yeah, it's good one. They them actually. Yeah, man, but that's not even a lot. Dude, it's fucking face is pretty funny. But that's not that's not that is a good face. Dude, that's great. But it doesn't just stop there. If you had to capture his face, what would it be? What the hell is even that? I don't know what he's thinking, bro, but whatever it is, I bet if he said it, it'd be funny as fuck. Dude, that's like, I mean, because Bernie's at the old man age. You can say you can do zero consequences, right? You just had a slip up there, man. I just never understood that they them thing, bro. Like it doesn't make sense. They them. Like a what how what level of mental illness do you have to have to decide that you are multiple people? Isn't that a isn't that schizophrenia? Yeah. Like you can't see the movie split? No, that's a good movie. It's great. Now we can agree on that. It's great. That's a good movie. Yeah, you know, but I mean, that's that's what you're doing. Yeah. And he belonging to mental institution. Bro, what's worse is like the Zerzays and like to me, that's a whole another dimension. You know, I'm saying, like, what does that mean? Bro, that there used to be mental of silence that were filled with people like this. Getting the body worse. It was better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like completely like inverse. You know, I'm saying the amount of hospitals compared to the amount of people that need them. Yeah, it's fucked up. It's a them actually. But it's not that's not all that's fucking getting in the ringer right now. All right, because I'm sure Bernie's going to get some claps off of this. But I gotta go to Mark Zuckerberg. He's in the fire. Oh, he got he's getting out to him. He's getting it to Mark Zuckerberg faces potential breakup of his meta empire and FTC antitrust trial. This is a big one. It's a big one. It's big. It's it's it's big. Well, I mean, look, bro, they have them not to them. I'm not trying to be an asshole towards fucking any of these guys. Yeah. Well, look, bro, you know, they're they're this happened in the 80s with telecommunications. Okay, and they deregulated and split it up. There's too much power. When you have technology conglomerates like Google meta, you know, fucking the new ones, the fucking what's the AI? The snap talks and the fucking what's that company? NVIDIA. The fucking you there. These people control the public square. Right. Okay. We we couldn't have anticipated 30 years ago that every communication and every, you know, form of of community would be controlled by so few people. Okay. And these people have become incredibly rich to where some of these companies are worth in the trillions of dollars. All right. That's never happened before in history. And that power structure is very dangerous as we saw during COVID where they all coordinated. They all linked up. They propagated wrong information that cost people their lives. They've interfered with elections. And unfortunately, you know, the reality is is that the upper lens of the upper ends of capitalism. It becomes unethical and that's the truth. And you can be a capitalist and understand that there is ethical capitalism and unethical capitalism. And when we cross the line when the power starts to become so great that really, you know, everybody's at the mercy of these people to enforce our quote unquote rights, you know, across these platforms. And well, that's why it's like that they allow them to get that. Oh, it's been done intentional. Well, 100 like that's why they're that big. So they could fucking yeah, instead of having to worry about reaching out to 20 social media companies. You got to reach out to fucking three people. Yeah. And it's done. No, it's intentional. Yeah. It's fucked up. But I mean, they're facing their their their at risk of losing a lot. Because right now, Metta's worth about 1.3 trillion dollars. And they're estimating their ad just on ad revenue alone in 2025. They're estimating to to be about 32 billion dollars just an ad revenue. You know, I'm saying so I mean, like they're they're they're definitely not only that like they control markets by what they allow to be advertised exactly. Exactly. Exactly. They don't just control speech. They control commerce too. And then you throw Amazon in there. Amazon has completely decimated the mom and pap small businesses. So, you know, and people say, oh, well, you know, that's free enterprise. You know, it is, but it's not when they're not paying their portion of the taxes or they're controlling too much power to where they can literally regulate what's bought and sold, what is what is said and not said, observe these people in real time and abuse their technology, which we've been shown that they do over and over again through the the usage of fake bots, you know, what Snowden talks about, you know, the tracking, the using the Patriot Act to spy on its own citizens through the device cameras. Like, bro, it's out of control. It is. It is. And the interesting thing is like this anti-trust case is going through they're in the trial. And at the same time, a big what what come out and has to do with China again. Like, I don't know if I'm out. I don't that wasn't my plan to have China be the theme of the show today, but they are whistleblowers, uh, tell Senate committee that meta undermined it US national security to cozy up to China. So this just came out. I'm a whistleblower on Wednesday told congressional lawmakers that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and other executives lied to Congress as meta actively tried to help China develop artificial intelligence in an effort to win favor with Beijing. Sarah win Williams, who detailed our experience at meta in the scathing memoir careless people testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on crime and counterterrorism that she witnessed Zuckerberg and other executives repeatedly undermine US national security and betray American values. Let's watch the introduction. I got the clip a couple clips here. This is Senator Josh Holly, uh, basically introducing her. Check this out. And this is a hearing that Facebook has tried desperately to prevent. Facebook is one of the most powerful companies in the world. It is one of the most powerful companies in the history of the world. And they have stopped at absolutely nothing to prevent today's testimony. They've absolutely gone to war to try to prevent it. Our witness today is a whistleblower and not just a whistleblower, but a long time executive at Facebook. She worked directly with Mark Zuckerberg and Cheryl Sandberg Sanders and the the Facebook brass. She was a part of the Facebook brass and they have gone scorched earth to prevent her from telling what she knows. They've sued her. They have sought a gag order against her. They have big courts to take her book off of the shelves. They tried to get it stopped from being printed in the first place. They have threatened her get this with $50,000 in punitive damages every time she mentions Facebook in public. $50,000 every time she mentions Facebook in public, even if the statements that she is making are true. And even as we sit here today, Facebook is attempting her total and complete financial ruin. They are attempting to destroy her personally. They are attempting to destroy her reputation. And I think the question is why. Why is it that Facebook is so desperate to prevent this witness from telling what she knows? Well, let's dive into it. This is our opening statement. During my time at Metta, company executives lied about what they were doing with the Chinese Communist Party to employees, shareholders, Congress and the American public. I sit before this committee today to set the record straight about these illegal and dangerous activities. Metta's dishonesty started with a betrayal of core American values. Mark Zuckerberg pledged himself a free speech champion. Yet I witness Metta work hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party to construct and test custom-built censorship tools that silenced and censored their critics. When Beijing demanded that Facebook delete the account of a prominent Chinese dissident living on American soil, they did it. And then lied to Congress when asked about the incident in a Senate hearing. The willingness to censor was not the only troubling thing I witnessed. I watched as executives decided to provide the Chinese Communist Party with access to Metta user data, including that of Americans. Metta does not dispute these facts. They can't. I have the documents. As recently as this Monday, they claim that they do not operate their services in China. Another lie. In fact, they began offering products and services in China as early as 2014. That hasn't stopped. Their own SEC filings from last year show that China is now Metta's second biggest market. So she's blowing the whistle, man. Yeah. It's interesting that a citizen, a woman who's from New Zealand has more courage than any Americans that have a new work in that office and protecting American values and interests more than anybody that works in that office. That's interesting. We haven't seen American whistleblowers from the CIA or the FBI or any of these other big companies come out. We see a couple, but not many. But then in these people are supposed to have taken an oath to this country. And here we have a woman who is from a different country who is doing the duty of American citizens to look out for American interests. That's interesting to me. For sure, dude. I mean, it's going to be interesting to see what accidentally happens to her. You know what I'm saying? She's got to be careful, bro. Yeah. She's got to be. Not because I think Metta's going to do anything. China. Listen, it disrupts power structure for them to deregulate these tech companies. Right. All right. Crumbles. Yes. They do not have the government has figured out how to weaponize social media and the internet against us. Not just our government, all governments. And these social media companies have to work with all these different countries to be allowed to operate. And what did they say that China was what? They're second biggest or they're biggest second biggest second biggest user base. All right. So these guys, you know, when when a little favor here and there comes through, you know, and you know, they do it. And they shouldn't be. And so, I don't know, you know, I think we all know what needs to happen to all of these these big anybody who's been alive, who's older than 40 understands that these monopolies and power structures have to be deregulated and split up. And until they are, we won't even have a thriving economy the way that we've always had it. Our economy depends on what Mark Zuckerberg decides. Like he decides what ads run, what ads don't run, what companies get to run ads, right? How is that? I thought we had free enterprise here. I thought we had free market. You know, it's a private. Well, you're arguing against it because you has free. Yeah, we don't allow monopolies. Right. You know what I'm saying? Like is it okay that Amazon is a multi, you know, trillion dollar brand in terms of worth. What's Amazon worth? They might not be there. They're probably close to a trillion dollars. Okay. No. Yeah. One point nine two trillion. Okay. So one point one point two one point what? Nine two. Nine two. Almost two trillion. Okay. So almost two trillion. All right. Do you think that that's okay that that Amazon controls that much of the market? Do you think it's okay that every every small business that used to operate independently now has to run through Amazon to even get any traction and then Amazon's allowed to decide where that product ranks on its page or if they make a competitive product, a cheaper price to take away from that perk. Like how is that which they do? They do that all the time. Yeah. Right. So how is that what this country wasn't intended to be? It's not. And nobody ever came in and really thought this through before they just ran with it or they thought it through and they did it on purpose. And that's you know, it could be one thing. Yeah. I mean, it appears to be, you know, when you look back on the operation life log and then look at the date that that ended, the CIA operation life log and then look at the date that Facebook was founded. Just look at that. Yeah. You know, so what are we what are we doing here, man? You know, of course these companies need to be broken up. It's good for the economy. These dudes are still going to be richest fuck. They are wanting to hang on so they continue to have the God power that they've had. When a reality, bro, it's not going to make one fucking difference to any of these guys to Zuckerberg or Bezos or fucking Elon or fucking any of them to have their businesses broken up into different aspects so that we can have a competitive marketplace. No, they made it all already. Yeah. Yeah, dude. Like it's power. It's not money anymore. Yeah, right. You know, and that's where we get into these powerful people doing fucked up shit because they're bored and they can. You know, and I don't know. Yeah, that's wild. Man. That's wild. Guys jumping. I mean, bro, conservatives and people who are outside of the realm of public opinion are still dealing with massive censorship issues. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. He's still going. Well, she's doing the right thing for sure. And it's just, you know, it's frustrating that somebody from another country is doing it not around citizens. Yeah. It's real man. Guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think, man, with that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show as always. If thumbs up, or dumb as fuck. That's where we bring in a topic. Yeah, it gets one of those two options. All right. You're going to like this one. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thumbs up, or dumb as fuck headline reads, Barbie announces creation of LeBron James's own ambassador doll. I don't get it. So what is it? All right. Let's dive into it. And all likely hood, LeBron James will not be holding the Larry O'Brien trophy at the end of this year. However, if it's any consolation, you can comfort himself by holding the Kyn Baceter Barbie doll created in his likeness. Barbie has announced the creation of a new doll in the likeness of NBA star LeBron James, the first of Mattel's new Kyn Baceter doll series. So, um, Mattel, yeah, Mattel owns Barbie toy company. Who owns Mattel? Let's keep going. Yeah. Here's the clip. Let's check it out. This is LeBron getting and receiving his doll for the first time. Check it out. Oh, he dope. Oh, that's so cool. This is so dang old cool. He was promised me. It's in the baggie. Oh, my goodness. Just a kid from African got his big headphones. Now we official. Yeah, it fixes bad. The headphones are staying right there. Okay. Now we ready. I mean, he might need to do a little left and lays look a little skinny little fray all the little fella. That's dope. I mean, at least they made him have a little sauce. You know what I'm saying? A little sauce. I mean, LeBron does have some swag. He does. Yeah. Yeah. You know, he's he's he's up a little bit on his shit too. Just a little bit. You know, I don't see him reading the first page any books lately. You know, you know, it's fine. He's he he I don't see him wearing the glasses and being like a the mr. activist that he was in the past. Yeah, the intellect actor. Maybe he's coming back around. I mean, he has a merciless on though. So I mean, yeah, well, dude, you know, there's a lot of dudes doing that. Yeah, you know, it's I don't get it. You know, it's funny when he was when the doll was spinning on that little fucking thing. You know, reminded me of some of those fucking funerals we've talked about. Where they stand? Fucking shit. That's kind of funeral. I want man. That's what you want. Yeah, I want you guys to stand me up and like play some cool music and dress me up cool stick my hand out. I can shake everybody's hand.

Look, it's a good action figure. That's cool. So ever the salesman, the doll also features gear from several of James's sponsors such as Nike Dunk, high retro shoes and beats headphones. Yeah, I see those beats. So the doll is going to be available in person or online April 14th. They're retelling for $75. $75. Now I looked up some some some research here. The average Barbie doll because I buy him for fucking Ryan about 20 bucks. So I mean, that's a decent little markup. All right, that's cool. Nice little collection. What's your favorite Barbie? I know you fucking play. And you don't go there. Come on, dude. There's nothing wrong with playing Barbies with your daughters. I don't do that. That's a lie. I do T-time. I do T-time. You do T-time, but you won't do Barbie? Yeah, I'm doing fucking Barbies. I do T-time though. That's because you get to eat some. In it. You get the little biscuits. That's right. That has a cool little case, you know, you don't fucking play you don't play Barbies Ryan. No. You make her play by herself. She plays with Addison. Addison's not old enough to understand Barbies. Oh, you be surprised. Really? You'd be surprised. Yeah, but I thought that was cool, man. It has a nice little case. There was an update on the story though. Yeah. All right. So you know, they got the little brond doll out, right? And apparently you can now buy them in a set. It'll come with his white Barbie doll. And they're going to have a mix a little baby. That's not you're making this. But then he leaves. He leaves the mom. She becomes a single mother and has to have to go to Gorton get child support payments from the brond doll. Where did you get all these pictures, bro? He lied to me. Oh, fuck, man. He told me he was going to take care of me. Oh, man. Hey, my baby. You pull the string on the back. That's what he's saying. Oh, shit, man. Oh, bro, that's some funny shit. Hey, you know what, though, by all accounts, the browns, pretty good dude. Family got. Listen, I don't like his politics. I think he inserts himself and says some dumb shit. And I do think he, you know, when the brons being cool, he's cool. He's still a cool, you know, MJ, though. You fucking you young bucks that think that's a conversation. You're wrong. I don't give I don't care what stats say what is a different level. Yeah, he and MJ. Mm-hmm. See, we're going to start some comment wars right now. Yeah, they're going to get pissed. Yeah. Well, it's fucking people get mad about it, but it's true. It is true. That is true. Dude, LeBron would say that. LeBron would say that. I think he's sift some paint, because I think he's like, well, he thinks he's got a little ego. You know, I'm saying like, you know, high off with his own supply. Does he? I think so. I think so. I don't know if anybody's ever. I like those pants he's got on there. That's a fucking good look. I got a suit like that. Barbie did too. Barbie liked them. Yeah. Oh, bro. That's so funny. Shit. Oh, man. Guys, I'm wrong with you, man. LeBron's going to come kick your ass. You know, about fuckers like six, eight, three bills. Yeah, you're some big dude. Don't be worried about me. You are by the little baby, baby. Oh, man. Guys, Andy, that's all I got, man. Yeah. What do we say in here? Thumbs up? I think the dollar's cool. You know, that's a little much on the markup. You know, I'm saying, but yeah, I mean, good for you. Yeah. Good for you. I wonder if the doll is going to flop like he does. Oh, man. We got to see the sales. We got to see the post sales. We'll keep you guys up. Bro, there's something wrong with you. All right. Yeah, but thumbs up. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, that's all I got, dude. All right. That's all I got to you. Don't be a hoe. Shut the shop. Never sleep on the flow. Now my jury box froze. Fuck up. Fuck up. Stole counting millions in the cold. Bad bitch. Oh, that's what got her own bank road. Can't fold. That's a no-hint shot case. Close.
