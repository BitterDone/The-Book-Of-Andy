protein yeah very noticeable man thanks very very noticeable so what's been going on nothing man just you know I was at the convention it feels like a lifetime ago by the way the Republican convention was like three weeks ago to go yeah Trump was shot at five weeks ago doesn't it seem like it's like one thing and then another it seems like they're playing ping pong it's like the the Trump assassination attempt then announced Kamala then the RNC then the DNC right you know what I mean now I'll tip for tack yeah I had to wait wasn't even two months ago yeah like you know what I mean like so it's just things are moving fast but uh but no I've been home a lot more travel in the state during August which is a time and then we'll go back in September for a few weeks and then October doing

the people that you're in the state that you love yeah so I don't get and I kind of you know that's the arena you know I signed up for it and so I'm just in the mix you know me yeah well I'll tell you what dude it makes a stand proud here in Missouri yeah bro it is when we talk about fighters like people that represent the people like that like you are the example yeah you're you're him you know I'm saying you know a lot of great it's not just from a Zarian and Bailey's following up right behind him dude we have some him yeah he's doing great yeah we do I know and I don't know I don't know

and then yeah Andrew's doing a great job so Missouri is kind of leading the way on this stuff yeah very kind of low key under the radar and some in some well you know it is bro we don't put up any BS around here that's right so you guys are killing it here man yeah it's great to be on campus here yeah I mean whether it's the the supplements or these delicious drinks or the apparel you guys are killing it yeah it's cool man you know we're trying to keep the American dream alive for families in the community and a lot of times people are like why don't you guys move well first of all we're right here in St. Louis I know it's hard for people to believe but a lot of people really like St. Louis and we don't mind that you don't like it you know but it's you know I think for us it's become more about really becoming a sense of pride for the community you know supporting the community you know we had effort so long when ads are bush and then when they when they kind of sold out to an imbev you know we kind of lost that for a while and I think you know we're doing a pretty good job so far of really trying to fill that gap and I feel like the people in St. Louis are really showing us a lot of love so it's it's really cool man it's good it's cool to see when you go to a cardinal game and you see the first form yeah from the loo and pride that's a cool thing to see and I know what you mean my dad worked for the brewery my uncle that worked at the brewery you know I was that kid that show up to school like a spudsman Kinsey jacket on you know yeah you had pride yeah so this cool that this is here yeah it's it's fun man I appreciate that yep so what's up with you dude oh you know hey it's a lot of interesting stuff happening not there is there is some some dots to be connected as always man before we get to that though guys make sure you guys are paying the fee yeah guys don't remember don't forget we don't take ads on the show we finance the show ourselves we talk about the things that we're not supposed to talk about well the internet doesn't like us talking about them it's the things we all should be talking about but we need your help getting the show out you know we don't we don't run ads on the show and I want to listen to what someone thinks that I should or shouldn't say and so we rely on you guys to share the show so remember to pay the fee and don't be a hoe sure the show all right well with that man let's go ahead and get into some of these topics I wanted to bring this first thing up because I feel like whatever we say at this point is just true I could just happen yeah you've been tracking on the bowling stuff oh on the start on the the turn of the astronauts we're just the company oh yeah okay yeah yeah I'm trying to narrow it down yeah but those astronauts that we covered who originally went to space for eight days will now be stuck in there until 2025 in the deep end of the pool apparently shut up the real they're not getting out until 2025 now going was supposed to be rescuing these guys and it's not happening so let's dive into this a little bit Boeing employees are humiliated after NASA announced that two astronauts who have been stranded on the international space station by the company's troubled starliner space capsule will have to be rescued by Elon Musk is upstart rival SpaceX when work it told the post butch Wilmore and SUNY Williams who went up to the ISS in June for what was supposed to be an eight day mission will have to wait another six months until a SpaceX crew dragon spacecraft can carry them safely home because their original ride is leaking helium and has problems with its thrusters the Florida based staffer with Boeing space programs at the decision was the latest blow to the aerospace giant which is already suffering backlash from a slew of commercial flight incidents earlier this year quote we have had so many embarrassment lately we're under a microscope this just made it like a hundred times worse said one worker speaking on the condition of anonymity quote we hate space space X he added we talked shit about them all the time and now they're bailing us out that sucks that's pretty funny dude that sucks man we imagine be it up all the space station alright and you're watching the news for the last year and seeing all this shit that Boeing is done and like not done apparently right and you're like fuck they're supposed to come get us like that doesn't feel very reassuring but think about this but like even taking a step further I'll still take Boeing over fucking SpaceX though yeah they must come to get you motherfucker they must be Democrats I still vote for Kamala even though nobody voted for right yeah yeah they're gonna rip those Boeing bumper stickers off yeah yeah man like well there's a lot to unpack with that I can't imagine first of all being six six in a capsule anyway would freak me out any chance we need a lot of stranded in space but I don't know man like so I actually serve on the space and science subcommittee of the commerce committee so we're it's really interesting we're dealing with all you did this is where you're right now it's your fault but but now like this commercial space endeavor is like like China's in this for real too they're talking about like mining asteroids like the stuff that like this is the next phase and the first of all the first shots of the next war are gonna be shot in space so like we got to be better at this than everybody else and I think having a like a layered system where we have innovation where it's not just the big players right like if we want to win you're gonna need all but and you're gonna need Boeing we want Boeing to be great because there's a lot of employees here in St. Louis right right um they're in competition for this next generation fighter um we're fighting with the Air Force to make sure that's out there so we win you know this we got to pivot to China so there's a lot going on but also you had the picture of NASA like literally just today I saw there's like this DEI struggle session video that got leaked that NASA like you know to apologize for being white it's all this crazy stuff like how about we work on like getting people back to the moon yeah Mars is opposed to like this cultural Marxism that NASA and a lot of I mean look our military's done it too dude they had a shutdown 17 shifts that true that true yeah look the Navy the Navy is down 30 percent in man out for recruiting and so this is look when you when you divide the room by a press or an oppressed people some people might say you know what maybe I don't want to go do that you know so we still have a great military we love the people that serve but these political people at the top are pushing this ideology that's super divisive is no place in the military military supposed to be like this great meritocracy it also has no place in NASA whose only mission should be getting people to and from space safely yeah so it's no using the best people yeah well dude that's meritocracy is is what this country is truly supposed to be about man and if you're not good enough to do it guess what you're supposed to do get better oh get better and you know people have abandoned this mentality and it's it's really frustrating because like in theory a lot of these people believe this stuff they think oh we should have this many of these people and this many of these people and this many of these people but at the end of the day it doesn't work in reality it what works in reality is competition meritocracy who's the best if you're not the best how can I learn to be the best and this is very important because it's not just about like airplanes being safe it's about the pride that an individual has and their ability to accomplish and develop and become better you know a lot of people feel very empty inside because they're never given the opportunity to truly compete because they're awarded things based upon where they come from or what gender they are and dude that really takes a lot of people's individual pride away from them it's it's really sad because you know when I look back in my life or when you look at your life you know the things the things in all of you guys the things were most proud of are the things that were difficult that we overcame accomplish right and if we if we take that away from people because we want to have a certain representation we're cheating people out of the ability to develop and become fulfilled as individuals which takes away the national pride that we should have as a country on an individual level you can't be proud of yourself can't be proud of your country well it's also the real problem with identity politics is it it boils everything down to one thing like you know like each one of us are like layer there's a bunch of different layers so it's like you know yeah I'm a Republican yeah I'm white yeah I'm Catholic I like pork steaks I like beer I like you know I work working out I like watching the carton there's a lot of things that I like right right right there's a lot of things that define you in this kind of race essentialism this obsession with it is what's driving people apart most people of their lives they want to get along with other people they don't give a you don't give a shit at all about that's right if the race of somebody else or if they're a Protestant or they're Jewish don't give a shit about that stuff they just they actually just want to accomplish things and the people seek commonality yeah naturally you know but I think you see these forces that don't really want people to to come together I think I think people are getting smart though I think people are seeing it and they're and they're they're starting I think we're going to see the panel and swing back so much that people totally ignore this this identity shit and start to come to get I'm seeing it yeah I was just sucks that I only took airplanes falling out the fucking sky to get there look man you know listen well look bro we got to be real about this you know we as human beings in the history of humanity have never faced a weapon as powerful as the internet and social media in terms to create propaganda so this has been a giant experiment the last 10 years 12 15 years which really hasn't gone well I would argue that as much benefit as the internet brings it's it's brought more division than that and more isolation and and less fulfillment you know people are not as happy because they're not going outside they're not doing the things like you and I did growing up like cooking support skate stakes on the grill listen to jack buck call car does gain I'm playing with a ball yeah do we need more of that and you know you get anybody in those situations it doesn't matter if they're black white gay straight doesn't matter where they come from bro you're getting along it's fun about it what you really you build friendships and in connection with people you share a common experience with that's why sports was always such a big part for me because I didn't care man you were on my team yeah like and I want to go win the game I don't care who's on like you're on my team yeah and let's go win and you compete together and and I think whatever it is like that's how people build relationships so if you're if you're segregating people think about that like getting back like segregating yeah then then you're not going to actually have those common experience that's what's flawed about yeah dude it's it's almost interesting too like did I send you that I think I sent it to you that rfk tweet where he talked about what matter really man yeah I got it that's good okay I mean dude I've talked about that for many many years and and what we're really talking about here is we're not talking about going back to 1847 we're talking about becoming dominant we're talking about working as a team we're talking about development of individuals we're talking about working together as Americans you know we're not talking that's not when the media has completely weaponized that term to make it seem like oh yeah we all of us white dudes want to go back to slavery like bro it's insane and we we have to get past I think people are getting past it I really feel seen through the stuff first yeah well because it's unnatural man and like that that's the thing it's like you know any major changes that have ever happened in any civilization always came from the people and this like the D.I. stuff this this this like that it come from us that didn't come from the people right so it's a very unnatural thing which is why I think people are realizing now it's like I didn't ask for this shit yeah did you ask for this no nobody I who at yeah and that's where the like that's where the understanding that like this is an intentional play that has been put on society to get us divided and segregated and it's not natural it's falling apart though it's not that because like we said it would yeah just like those bowing doors yeah well uh guys jumping on this conversation let us tell what you guys think down in the comments with that being said man let's get into our headlines headline number one so we got to talk about it we got a little anniversary today not one of you know it's not a birthday or anything like that um and it's uh you know one of the docker's parts of I guess our history as a country man but let's talk about it uh hell on reach three years ago a terrorist attack killed 13 US troops newly released emails show Biden admin was aware of the chaos that led to it um so yeah not a very not a very happy subject to start with it's interesting because we actually one of those service members were actually from St. Louis church myths and um or yeah we met the we met the the the the parents you know like great family amazing family you know and and this I think was a really big lead up to I guess the the fall of America on the national global stage if you will um and uh let's let's get into it man so you got newly released emails show top Biden administration officials discussing the chaos of the Afghanistan withdrawal in the days leading up to the deadly terrorist attack that killed 13 American soldiers three years ago today uh the messages obtained by watchdog organization the functional government initiative and shared with just the news show that former Pentagon spokesman John Kirby was fully aware of the chaos on the ground in Afghanistan despite later saying he didn't see how the withdrawal could have been done better on August 16th 2021 10 days before the attack Kirby sent out a state department report detailing breaches and flight line insecurity at the Hammond Karzai International Airport or HKIA uh in Kabul the report made clear that US forces were quickly being overrun there uh quote do continuing to surge to theater but at the moment further breaches cannot be fully prevented at current force levels the report said noting that quote uh the Taliban have been increasingly positioning near HKIA access points uh the report also noted crowds of people swarming American airplanes prior to take off with some even trying to grab onto the aircraft as they accelerated down the runway for departure those are videos and images that were you know i'll never forget that yeah it's impossible to get that image out of out of people's heads quote hundreds have flooded the flight line and in at least one case have forced themselves onto at least one US military and other civilian aircraft crowds them uh continue to run alongside planes including military aircraft the report said um also on August 16th Kirby was asked by speech writer Warren Bass about an appearance from defense secretary Lloyd Austin quote unless you're itching to get him to the podium this could well be the first time the SD uh has been out in public since the collapse in Afghanistan bass wrote quote at a minimum he'd need to start with a serious topper on the Afghan chaos uh quote Warren warm words are good will want to do a spray given the circumstances Kirby replied um so you have all of that happening um you know obviously what's a spray i believe that's like a clean out of like the narrative basically okay white kind of white washing it out a little bit making it palatable um or in you know lawyers words nine to nine to nine everything's fine um and and obviously again ten ten days after all of these emails are going back and forth um that's one of the nicest suicide bomber uh attack the abbey gate entrance of the airport killing thirteen american soldiers and around 170 uh Afghan civilians um now with that going on again we know what the response was from our country from our administration on this matter um and how those service uh members uh families were treated by this current administration um and so it's me with them by wouldn't meet with them didn't meet with them at all no and then he and then when they were there he checking his watch like you got somewhere else to go it's like it's so insulting and in fact the the schmitz family i they've come out to dc even and do the this is how great people they are they um come with the honor flight folks so like they they are helping you know veterans of of other wars and and escorting them around and kind of giving back and they lost their son to this you know just perhaps the most one of the most embarrassing moments in our nation's history and uh yeah and Biden's checking his watch well so then it should be no surprise that on the you know three year anniversary of of this terrible thing that you know somebody shows up to lay a reef um at allenton uh cemetery and someone does not let's take a guess at who made their appearance and who did not make an appearance um headline reads trump honors thirteen fallen heroes from afghanistan withdrawal at allenton um and uh so yeah so trump trump showed up later reef here's a quick video we Preson so So you have that and meanwhile, we say this real quick. Yeah. We haven't had anything that presidential in years. Yeah. Like that almost made me emotional watching it just because we've had such a lack of leadership and such really just spit in the eye from our leadership towards this country. Like it. Yeah. And let me tell you something, man. Like I've pisses me off. I've got to know him. Obviously, President Trump say whatever you want. That man loves America. Yeah. No doubts America. And you hear half this nonsense from Biden and Harris now. You know, this is a, they're pushing an ideology that is antithetical to what it means to be an American. It really, I mean, that's the starkest contrast. So all this bullshit after the, they hate America, dude. They, they, they don't believe in me. We were talk about equity versus equality. I mean, she's talking about, I mean, this is Marxist stuff. Yeah. Like that's who they are. Like they don't really apologize for anymore. So yeah, to see a president lay a reef down like that. And by the way, I don't know if you have it. There's another headline today, which is from the AP, of course, which is now woke. That says Trump tries to tie Harris to Afghan withdrawal. She was bragging about how she was the last guy, last person in the room with Biden. I mean, she wanted to be known as somebody who is a close confidant and of Biden now, the media is willingly allowing her to try to distance herself from all the, you know, bullshit they brought on the country. It's really, it's crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy that anybody would buy it. Look at that. Dude, what are you talking about? A month and a half ago, you guys were laughing at her. The people that are now saying, oh, come on. She's a hero. You guys were laughing at her. You had your face in your, your hands saying, holy shit, this is the worst. This is a disaster. And now you're all trying to pretend to cheer for her like she's some kind of savior. When let's be real, dude, she is a world class piece of shit. That is it. We have Biden too. When was the last time we've seen any of the leadership, whether it be the president, vice president, press secretary, any of the people show any respect for this country at all. We haven't seen it in years. And like, dude, I love this country too, as you know. And watching that, having my, my dad's dad, who he never even met, who was killed after he fucking stormed at Normandy, and he was killed six months later, never even met my dad to just see the simple sign of respect. It's like, you know what I'm saying? Like it feels like America's supposed to feel even in the wake of this being a total tragedy. You know what I mean? Yep. Yep. I haven't felt that long time. Well, listen, it also, we're naive. These dictators around the world, they smell weakness. Yeah. And there's a reason why Russia didn't go into Ukraine when Trump was president. There's a reason why North Korea was backing up. There's a reason why China wasn't saber rattling with Taiwan. There's a reason why Hamas didn't, you know, brutally attack Israel like on October 7th. And then Trump meant business and they do not know who he wanted to figure out. Don't respect this administration and F, that Afghanistan was the was the poster, man. It was the, it was the red light that went up, said, hey, okay, you could do some shit. Yeah. And we don't, you know, the administration doesn't have their shit together. Bro, it's, it's such a frustrating thing because it doesn't matter what side of you believe, right? Like if you believe Russia, you Ukraine, or Palestine, or Israel or anything, right? wanted to smoke nobody wanted it dude because they realize it's like it's like your dad coming home from work like we're gonna tell dad when you go for work oh shit everybody's kept in line you know the sand and and do the world needs that that's why they hate this man what's the story with uh with all money you know it was a salamon where you sent him a picture of their fucking house oh yeah yeah joe he says he says we know where you live yeah and if you you know basically you do the other on you're gonna find out yeah and he like here's here's where you here's where you're at at nine o'clock at night yeah and he got up he got up and walked out the room yeah he's got up and left what would you do yeah you would go home and you would say hey let's leave these shoes alone that's just waiting till yeah you would go home and tell your team you'd be like this yeah it's we had a good talk man everything's good don't worry about that anymore totally for it he said yeah we're all good uh but I mean listen and here's the thing you know there's definitely some transitions going I think the more people are realizing that you know it's not even just common and biting like it is the Democrat party um our complete liars and they have lied about everything um and now you start seeing this massive uh exodus from the Democrat party and we're even people that you know maybe not call themselves a Democrat but definitely a more liberal than most conservatives um you're starting to see this you know a bunch of people jump ship um rfk to be won yeah um this just happened um over the weekend uh rfk junior trump to announce another democrats joining his campaign as well um so uh during this week's broadcast of fnc's or fox new sunday um now former independent president candidate robative uh Kennedy uh junior said he anticipated more democrats coming along to support republican presidential nominee Donald Trump Kennedy who endorsed trump last week suggested the support was partly based on the former president's desire to make america healthy again uh quote wall street journal has this hosha and breamset uh quote they say it's uh to a double edged sword essentially that it may help president trump to pick up some of your followers if they're willing to go over there uh but they warn about what you would do uh in his administration they say this rfk junior if he's anywhere near the health care or environmental agencies in the trump administration look out mr trump's best response this to thank rfk junior for support make no promises about the future by all means avoid joint campaign appearances you've already had one well you have others will you campaign for president trump um to which can it be replied yeah i'm going to be campaigning actively i think president trump is going to make a series of announcements about other democrats who are joining his campaign and you know i want to make america healthy again and so does president trump so those are objectives um and he did make a really really awesome statement on the mega a mega topic which you alluded to earlier Andy um which i thought you know i mean obviously i felt like you had a great point but i mean that was a very very well-worded representation kind of summed it all up i'm everything that you have been talking about i'm here's this whole statement that Kennedy wrote the phrase has troubled liberals who think it is a call for return to an america before civil rights gay rights and women's rights but i have a more generous interpretation one that is truer to my experience of Donald trump as he is today quote make america great again recalls a nation dreaming with vitality with a can do spirit with hope and a belief in itself it was an america that was beginning to confront as darker shadows could acknowledge the injustice and its past and present yet at the same time could celebrate its successes was a nation of broad prosperity the world's most vibrant middle class and an idealistic belief though not consistently applied and freedom justice and democracy it was a nation that led the world and innovation productivity and technology and it was the healthiest country in the world i have talked to many trump supporters i have talked with his inner circle i have talked to the man himself this is the america they want to restore guys what else we got on this topic we could have used that clarification about seven years ago it was what i'm a man like you know i'm saying i'm just saying you know i've always understood that that's yeah absolutely yeah you know but that we've allowed the media by not explaining it to our fellow neighbors uh like hey man this doesn't mean let's go back to these times where nobody had any rights and it was only this way or that way but it actually means like let's get our team together man let's stop losing let's go back to be in the national champions you know what i mean that's that's what it's about and everybody has a role in that and everybody has a place in that and um i think it was just a very very well thought out well-worded description that for sure long overdue well let's think about like actually what happened when he shocked the world right in one in 2016 what happened after that we had a secure border right when he left office we had a 45-year-low in illegal immigration right more people were making more money and it didn't matter your race it didn't matter your your class whatever everybody was making more money we're more prosperous we didn't have all these wars poppin of around the world we were energy dominant we were expert like those are regardless again they want to make it about joy and all this nonsense that's like it's just fake emotion and people's lives that's what they were experiencing that's what it means to make America great again right yeah it doesn't matter who you are you can achieve in this country and what they want to do now is act like Kamala Harris had nothing to do with any of this stuff she was the most liberal senator in the whole senate more liberal than Bernie Sanders she picked a guy who was like the lockdown king in Minnesota that literally was prosecuting people for you know uh... something outside the shooting them with paintballs i mean this is like this is a radical group and it is amazing what the media is willing to do with their trump derangement syndrome what they're willing to do to cover for her she has not had an interview in over a month and that's when she gets exposed if you if she's in an interview right you start asking your questions about her positions she looks ridiculous because she's you know she can't explain them the radical to begin and you've got the media sort of covering for her and i guess they think they can pull this off for 70 days my hope in my belief is the american people are going to see through all this right but she went from the least poppio she was less popular than joe biden you look at some of her numbers now based on some of this polling which is bs by the way because they're over sampling democrats now but her favorables have gone up because and the Harris team sees this now so they're going to try to hide her in the basement like they did joe biden in 2020 so the real threat to democracy of course is the party that's tried to jail their political opponent keep guys like robert f kennedy off the ballot on democrats i keep trump off the ballot on the republican side throw a guy in prison for the rest of his life sensor americans and now act like you shouldn't believe you're lying eyes on who this person is well dude isn't that what isn't that what george or well wrote about 1984 yes you know i mean this is exact like do he's rolling over his grave being like i fucking told you that this is supposed to be a question yeah dude uh you know what's interesting is these people that say oh trump's a threat to democracy i'm voting for kamaila when kamaila didn't have a single person vote for her not one to be the the can't you can't come at me with this nonsense that trump is a threat to democracy when not a single person voted for kamaila Harris to be the presidential candidate and sound very democratic to me oh it's insane it's not like it's unprecedented yeah like they've memory hold you know the fact of trumping you know the attempted assassination that day in the fist pump which everybody at that point was like this is over yeah he's gonna win yeah and memory hold that and substituted now for this thing about kamaila as being some phenomenon like she's a known quantity and it's not good yeah that's right i mean but they they can't do it like they're just gonna try to hide this thing but the good news is information's way more diffuse because of podcasts like this and a lot of other things people get their information other than cbs nbc yeah those guys are dead bro that you know what i think though too is rfk like they're trying to keep this guy is like i think rfk is in serious like jeopardy to be completely honest because maybe even more than trump because we all know how powerful the farmer industry is and the farmer industry funds the fda at nearly 50% of their funding okay this guy's trying to get in there and stop that shit and he's trying to actually make our country use real food do all the shit that they've been manufacturing that hurts us as a country he's trying to fix all of that and that's where the most money is made and so i'm really concerned about his safety um you know them saying oh well trump should run away if he wants to make uh what did you say the health and human services no that he's the perfect guy for that if you want to actually build this uh country the way that it's supposed to be healthy not overly medicated you know the amount of medications that are prescribed today are insane and nobody wants to talk about it because everybody's making so much money you know so this guy stepping in the way of a lot of people's income and a lot of the people that he's stepping in the way of have a lot of money and a lot of resources so uh well he doesn't even need to have like what's the impact of all this like politically like it doesn't need to be huge but like there's some polling already that shows like basically the rfk junior supporters are breaking now because it was endorsement like two to one in swing state so let's just say he was going to get three to five percent somewhere like in pencil vanu man that thing is like a point yeah right so it can actually make the difference and i think i don't agree with him on a lot of stuff i agree with him on some stuff but i do think what he represents are people who were who are like distrustful and they should be of a lot of things and he was giving voice to a lot of those things and i think the election breaks down in some ways more than republican versus democratic it's like the dissidents versus the establishment right and he fits into that category of speaking truth on some things right and i think that that you know in this kind of realignment that's happened you've got now a multi ethnic working class base of the republican party which i feel very at home with that's as you know you and i that's how i grew up yeah and so when i was at the convention i was like man normal people Hulk Hogan and kid rock this is my kind of convention you know it's very different you wouldn't have seen that like years ago so i think i think it's a good thing that he's he's come on board i think it's a good thing we talk about unity all the time Tulsi gathered like i don't agree with her on everything but like the fact that Trump's reaching out i think it's a good thing i think the difference between people like rfk and Tulsi which i love Tulsi but yeah obviously we're gonna have disagreements about how we can see that's american dude right that's like hey man i think we should do it like this why they we should do it like this and i think the difference between these kind of democrats and then the marxist democrats yeah is that their intent is genuine yeah they might not see it the same way that i see it or you see it but but they don't shut down the other side no they're they're intent is i want the best outcome for the country so do i yes exactly dude and that's what the the whole entire political system has lost and i think to your point about the uh them pumping up kamala i actually because like dude we i've we see this in the in the the interviews and things that were we're tracking for the show but i think people have realized how much worse their financial situation is and when they go up there with opra and you know uh what's that girl's name the the rapper mega and the stallion and all these things and they go up there and they give these speeches that are like touchy feely and feel good because let's be real some of these people are excellent speakers and they're up there making these promises and it sounds really good and it sounds very american but they've witnessed this not go this way over and over and over again i actually think that by them doing this overly uh pump up of kamala it's actually exposing them for for exactly who they are it's blown up in their face it's fake and yeah and i think if there's one word to describe her it's it's fake or phony whatever yeah that's who she is she's and i think that's right i think they're going to get exposed on this because there's no depth there like there's there's nothing and i think we've talked about this before uh covid like that covid times really revealed like who these people are and it isn't about anything other than power and control and so their willingness to like sub out a candidate without any votes that's just about power and control because they want the permanent Washington the permanent um establishment these agencies to run your life and now you get to a figurehead kind of president so it doesn't even really matter anymore and if you actually care about democracy you should be really worried about that right but the media isn't because you know it's about trump and that convention they had they mentioned trump's name out of whatever several hundred times it was their only talking and acting like she's not the incumbent like this administration has destroyed livelihoods because of their ideology like and and people are making less money and you know they're not as safe and all those things that are the reality they just want to try to have a side show here a little bit and distract people and when they go up there and they say joy and unity and all of these things and all of these people have seen the different these people are not stupid they think what that we're all stupid and they think they think their own voter bases stupid and their own voter bases starting to get insulted about the amount of you know fake shit blatant lies yeah like I like after that because like when I watch the DNC I was definitely like damn dude I hope people don't buy this but then I watch people's reaction who are Democrats and they're like yeah well those great speeches aren't going to help my pocketbook right and I'm like all right now we're starting to understand here yeah we're on it man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments of that being said let's go crew so I got a couple here for us I love how

episodes from laf with that being said let's get to our second headline let's talk about some freedom of speech here uh this is a very interesting bizarre story that's coming out right now let's dive into it headline number two reads uh justice Europe style telegram CEO Pavl Duraugh arrested due to lack of moderation on platform this is insane telegram founder and CEO Pavl Duraugh was arrested in France on Saturday after his private jet landed at La Boisier airport french media reported Duraugh was arrested under a warrant related to quote various violations of his encrypted messaging service according to a report by Le Mans the 39 year old who became a french citizen in 2021 is expected to be brought into court on sunday french authorities are accusing Duraugh of a quote lack of moderation involving telegram the messaging app is reportedly under attack in europe for the viral uh circulation of false information uh quote telegram has shielded itself from state moderation rules at a time when the european union and united states are putting pressure on major platforms to remove illegal content the mall reported um frances uh OFM I in or office to combat violence against minors interestingly enough issued a warrant um as part of an investigation into quote offenses ranging from fraud drug trafficking cyberbullying organized crime glorification terrorism and fraud the source told the french newspaper quote enough with telegrams impunity my french investigator said uh Duraugh who doesn't often sit down for interviews uh spoke with tucker Carlson in april telling the former fox news host that the russian government was the first entity to demand that he censored speech he is a russian he's a native russian um to censor speech uh via his own platform vk um in an effort to quell protest in the country uh quote uh we were requested to ban these protest organizing communities and i refused duraugh explained uh but that did not go too well with the government um now tucker Carlson did comment on all of this um uh two days ago saying quote uh pavl uh duraugh left russia when the government tried to control the social media company telegram but in the end it wasn't putin who arrested him for allowing the public to exercise it was a western country a by-dem administration ally and enthusiastic nato members that locked him away pavl duraugh sits in a french jail tonight a living warning to any platform owner who refuses to censor the truth at the behest of governments and intel agencies darkness is descending fast on the formerly free world um and then he linked his uh video to that interview um now it's interesting i didn't know much about this guy i am familiar with the app um and uh it's a it's a fairly large app a lot of people uses they have over 900 million active users um on this platform um now you look into mainstream media for for more uh information on this guy and of course it's the typical thing try to dog him apparently he has like over a hundred biological children or some shit um which all right i mean i don't even do that it's impressive yeah it is definitely impressive i mean it's been working he's got that low body fat bro he was pay low taxes um you know but there there was an interesting person that chimed in on this uh conversation um do you guys remember uh uh vennman into an occernal vennman um vennman uh he he gave a very interesting warning to musk um says that musk should be nervous after telegram CEO was arrested retired lieutenant colonel Alexander vennman who made waves as a key witness in the appeasement trial against former president trump um this is the guy that lied and helped with the still dossier oh yeah just for reference um issued a warning to elan musk on sunday after telegram messaging app CEO pavel duroth was arrested in france um here was his uh comment uh his tweet he says uh while duroth holds french citizenship is arrested for violating france law that has broader implications for other social media including twitter there's a growing intolerance for platforming dis info and malign influence and a growing appetite for accountability musk should be nervous um i think you should be nervous it's what i think you should be nervous fuck face okay uh we've been dealing with your bullshit for years and years and years and years and years and and and if you think there's not a bunch of citizens making lists of people that should be nervous and that you're not on it you should probably fucking be nervous about that yeah i'm sick of these people bro this is what yeah what's scary about all this is this is actually what they want like they want people arrested yeah for i know free speech and in um well the Missouri versus Biden thing that would kind of lost it i filed when i was a g and Bailey did a great job is uh exposed it here like it doesn't matter like there's nothing like think about it there's no they were willing to throw the other parties candidate in jail they're willing to silence millions of americans because they want absolute control right and if you eliminate descent which is what this is yeah right if you eliminate descent it makes it a lot easier to go do that that's right so i do think that you're gonna see more of these efforts particularly in europe but thankfully in this country of something called the constitution right which is supposed to prohibit this um but we better stay on guard i mean i just actually sent a letter out to google and facebook friday asking what are what is your criteria now what are you doing because we're approaching election season right and so they can say all the right things as long as they want to to really get to the critical time when a lot of people are making their own decisions and so the american people deserve to know this um but this is scary stuff um i posted about it to you on my socials um it's uh people should be aware of this because this is where it's all headed if you don't have enough people stand up and say no way yeah dude i think this is a hundred percent him trying to intimidate people like zuckerberg musk and all the other platform owners end of continuing to play along with the government yeah you know and if you watch zuckerberg's interview and i know a lot of people don't like zuckerberg i don't like a lot of the shit that he's done but he seems to be moving in a better direction at least a little bit um he's still got a lot of problems with censorship on his platform but if you listen to his rogan interview that he did he made it very clear that like hey this wasn't us this was them telling us to do it and we had to do it and i would bet you that if we once this is all come full circle and all the truth has really risen to the surface we're going to find out that he's been threatened with arrest himself that's what i think we're going to find out well you had literally elvis chan which is a hard name to ever forget who was an fbi guy in northern california go to these social media companies and say get ready for a russian hackenley operation and he talked about it being hunter Biden laptop so they had the laptop they knew it was real the act of like it was fake um and time yeah ahead of time yeah and then once the story oh you're saying they told fucking facebook it was three bumped it yeah actually so it's interesting so we were going to take the depot of chan i'm convinced that one of the reasons why zuckerberg came out and said that is because it was going to come out that there are these meetings that were being held between the fbi and social media companies right by the way this is not some vast right wing conspiracy oh this is actually happened right that you were on this yes it wasn't for that case and if it wasn't for twitter files you wouldn't know it had ever happened that's what's scary about it so like that's why i think pushing back against all the stuff actually matters because zuckerberg starts to hear from the other side right like all this stuff gets exposed the best thing you can do is shine a light on the stuff because these guys operate the best in the shadows and through intimidation because they know it's wrong yeah yeah because they don't want people to know that they're trying to influence the stuff right but that's right but now in europe i guess you got people actually being arrested um and i do think that if the democrat i mean that's again man this election is so important i don't make it all about the like but like because the ideas matter a lot but they can't get away with this stuff no you know i mean like there has to be a consequence to it all and if they can just actually keep going about doing what they've been doing that's a bad sign for the country for sure for sure for sure i say there's just even on the matter of just free speech because like i'm familiar with telegram we did some work uh back in 2020 uh during the george fluid protests and uh was able to do some work and telegram was heavily involved on that right and i think it's very very important especially for you know the red white and blue conservatives when we talk about free speech we have to really understand what that means right like it's not just i can say whatever i want it said you have to listen to ideas that you don't necessarily agree with a thousand percent and that's what's so important and so like wow you know i may not agree or like that you know people can go on these apps and say these crazy things and have these ideas and collude and conspire like like little kids transition uh second their gender right i don't like that right you know i'm saying but and you know like and these groups like they were using telegram as one of the main sources to communicate and and put together these large protests that affected us here in saying Louis i'm sure other places around the country you know but it's like ultimately though like it's still free speech and it has to be protected and so like while i may not agree with what you're saying you have the right to say it you know and like and should there be consequences for of course but guess what that stuff's already in place i can't go into a movie theater and you'll fire right like i can't incite certain things like those things are in place but at the basis of it you know if we're going to say that we want free speech we have to respect for everybody i agree and look the the um the idea behind that is that in that marketplace of ideas the best ideas went out so you you you combat speech you don't like with more speech right and ultimately you try to win the argument you can only do that if you have a platform by which you can do that which is why they got section 230 protections because they weren't acting as a publisher picking and choosing there were supposed to be an open platform like the old school town square right right we're looking at Douglas or on the same stage on the same platform talking and trying to convince that is the whole basis of it all so the minute they start kind of picking and choosing you don't get to be a platform anymore that's the heart of the private side of the debate but the government has no business no business telling you what you can hear what you can say or what you can think that's that's crazy so yeah ultimately you protect people's right to say things you find really objectionable terrible abhorrent like you protect that because it might be then this time but it's you the next time right and that's the scary thing about tyranny like it just starts steamroll and man and if you're in the way you might have been cheering them on in the five yard line but now they're on the 20 in your next yep so dude and it's it's interesting because these people will call anything they disagree with now hate speech or disinformation yeah that's right yeah and they'll try to get it like categorize as some sort of violation of law like bro just because you don't like what I'm saying doesn't mean it's hate speech I'm not a criminal yeah and I'll give you some hate speech if you want it yeah no shit well and dude I'll I want to be honest like the this guy here like coming out and like sort of threatening like that like I think they're forgetting where they are who they are and I also think they're forgetting that they have names and addresses and if you guys continue to push on people the way that you push on people there's going to be people out there to fucking understand that like I can't believe this guy would stand up in a public forum and even say that after literally being one of the the the key players and the downfall of this country in the last five or eight years and saying dude well think about that for a minute like and the tide has switched like yeah they they had an Obama proved it they they spied on a presidential candidate right bro they made up dossier about and like we again we memory all this stuff if this was a Republican like Richard Nixon went down for much less than that but like it's it's totally cool because because we don't like Trump or you know it's a Democrat like it's insane dude think of the damage that's been done to the country because of that narrative it went on for eight years it made the country completely divided over a fake dossier that Hillary Clinton had manufactured because she got a slap on the right dude it's insane well think about it if there is if you read or if there would have been a report of some central American company or country where the opposing party leader was spied upon and they tried to discredit him and they tried to impeach him and then they tried to throw him in jail and then they tried to bankrupt him and then you know like you would be like our state department would be warning us about that place like be careful don't go there because you don't really have a system that you can trust right and so this is what they've done they've done all of this I think that's why we've kind of crossed the Rubicon guys I think we're no longer just debating and why this stuff's so important for people to get involved we're no longer like Tip O'Neill, Ronald Reagan arguing about like marginal tax rates which are important debates to have this is different this is about total control it is about I will tell you like if we talked about my first 18 months one of the things that's most and I stood up and objected Chuck Schumer tried to have some bogus rules on this impeachment thing from New Yorkist I was centered to the set up as I object which means he couldn't do this sham thing which was 22 times in our nation's history if an impeachment came over to the Senate there was a trial every single time except this time because Schumer didn't want the news cycle so all the Democrats voted to just dismiss the case in regardless of what you think about it he was supposed to either be voted on to for removal or you know acquittal that didn't happen so don't think for a second if they ever get 51 votes in the Senate and they got the House and Kamala Harris gets elected they'll in the filibuster and they will pack the court they will add DC to the union they get two extra senators for that this is about permanent power that's right it's about permanent power and they are ruthless look they just that's what the immigration is about it about immigration yes tell me tell me in people into voters they're already working on that yeah right and they just literally did a coup on the sitting president of the United States to put in somebody who is wildly unpopular but they can fluff her up here who didn't get a single vote and by the way never made it to Iowa when she ran yeah like you know like say what you want about Bernie Sanders or or Trump or Obama they had a grassroots kind of following like people are inspired I mean I'd agree but they're inspired nobody was inspired by Kamala Harris like she didn't get to Iowa now so like this thing is all it's it's like a I don't know it's like a matrix development development and they have to lose like they can't win doing this so they look man I think they're gonna do anything that they possibly can legal illegal doesn't matter to keep Trump from coming back and I think we fight of it yeah and and dude that includes blacks one events that includes you know it wore like they tried it all they're trying it all and uh so a lot of the stuff you guys talk about which is what I think is it would be fascinating which is why I'm obviously doing everything I can for Trump won't have a second like this would be the second term right there's no reelection knowing what he knows now I think he comes in and is the ultimate disruptor and that is exactly what we need right now we need a real reset because a lot of times quite frankly Republican or Democrat they come in in this continuation of the administrator state like it's gotten bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and I think he's uniquely situated certainly be my pitch I think he's willing to do it to come in and totally change the game right and that's a big deal because you got a lot of people coming at you but here's a thing they're coming at him now right it's actually like they've tried right they've tried to take him out and now I think it's his opportunity to sort of like fix things and they know that that's why they're terrified of this thing because they know if he gets in like there's going to be a massive disruption and that is a good thing for the country right like real people I think also you know they're trying to paint Trump as this you know ridiculous dictator character and I think they should be considering themselves fairly lucky that it is Trump and it's not someone who's actually way more extreme than Trump because this is the kind of situation that does birth someone who is so extreme that they can they can destroy the country as well and so you know I don't believe that Trump is that guy I think in fact my criticism of Trump is that he's not extreme enough which is probably a good reason why I'm not president you know I'm saying because like dude I would do a lot more shit than he's doing but you know the thing the street and he is I want people to understand it won't end with Trump no people think this is unique to him yeah whoever look what they were doing to JD Vance yeah listen JD and our friends we came in together he everybody's you know a lot of people are familiar with his story he me grew up with nothing like he's a normal guy like say which like he's a normal dude in this whole like he's a weirdo is like actually is a very um insulting to America yeah still be in way to kind of turn the table on a guy that's normal right that's what they're trying to do and so it's him it could be me it could be anybody who's in those positions like they know the playbook now right and so it's not going to be just with Trump this law fair thing is real they've utilized that they weaponized the justice department and you really need somebody in there I think is going to change that dynamic otherwise I agree it's you know I agree I thought they liked weird stuff like the left that's the irony of the they don't think that's they don't think that's weird yeah I actually think the fact that they call JD Vance weird is a real insult to the salt of the earth Americans that exist in this country these people are still out of touch bro they don't know what a working class family looks like they don't know what it's like for you know someone to grow up in a trailer park or to be split into different families their whole life they don't understand that shit bro these people are completely out of touch and when I hear them call him weird what I hear is we think all of you guys are weird yeah well you're the deplorable that's right right you guys are trailer trash America and we're the elites that's what I hear yeah guys jump it on this conversation let us know what you guys think about this down in the comments let me tell you guys get your third and final headline guys at number three doctor Fauci doctor algae Fauci do you guys hear what happened to him again the monkey pox no West Nile West Nile was in the monkey pie I mean I think there needs to be a change in the name well what would you call it I don't know the WN virus I think that's offensive to people who live in West Nile region I agree yeah you probably make this a movement right now yes um but yes so doctor Anthony Fauci hospitalized for six days with West Nile virus so former coronavirus are Anthony Fauci was hospitalized for six days after contracting the West Nile virus they spokesperson confirmed Fauci the ex director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is recovering at home after returning from the hospital and is expected to be okay the spokesperson told CNN on Saturday while most people 80% who are infected with West Nile virus you're not experienced symptoms the CDC said that approximately 20% suffer from an array of symptoms like fever head and body eggs vomiting diarrhea and rashes around one and 150 people with the virus develop more serious symptoms that impact the central nervous system and experience illnesses like uh it's a facalities oh what is an insul cephalitis yeah insul in syphilitis in syph in syphilitis in syphilitis in syphil okay i'm going to be aligned in office space you like a naga naga not gonna work here anymore so like man it got me uh around one and 150 people with the virus develop more serious symptoms that impact the central nervous system and experience illnesses like in syphilitis or meningitis about 10% of people who develop those severe illnesses die according to the CDC now phalgias 83 is at a higher risk to get worse symptoms due to his age quote there is no specific treatment for West Nile the health the health agency said but listed rest fluids and pain medications as methods to relieve symptoms the virus is most commonly spread through mosquito bites though it is not clear how phalgias contracted according to the Department of Health and Human Services over which 2200 cases are reported in the US each year i'm going to apparently there has been a larger uptick uh in the area around New York City um now it's very interesting that this probably some of those mosquitoes are like loose with Bill Gates mosquitoes yeah for sure it's definitely the gates for sure for sure i'm surprised you don't have monkeypox though with all that astamouth he does just saying sorry i mean i got to be thinking man because like you know phalgias have really been in the news lately and you really haven't heard much on covid but i thought this was interesting that this timing of this article and these next two articles i'm about to show you guys it's very very interesting um apparently covid cases uh they are on the rise just in time for more boosters to come out i can't wait i cannot wait um and not only that this now this was really interesting because uh just a day before this headline this headline comes out by administration will restart free at home covid 19 test program oh sweet like we forgot about them uh just manufacturing the the data numbers with the PCR with upcycle PCR tests bro let's just forget let bring in this bet and you know they say free but we are paying for it um everybody's paying for the Biden administration next month next month interesting timing what so just two okay got it free free stuff huh free stuff i wonder if they're doing the fries and the burgers oh man because i definitely get a booster for that yeah we have the Biden administration next month uh we'll relaunch a program for every american to order free covid 19 test through the mail um they can get that along with their ballot for the election um administration officials said during a briefing Friday that households will be able to order four free tests uh through the covid test dot gov website once it launches again in late september uh the test will be mailed directly to people's homes quote these tests will help families and their loved ones stay safe this fall and winter season and avoid the uh the winter of death and destruction yeah because we know because we're still waiting for that i'm not what was it a plague of the unvaccinated doesn't that what he called yeah i'm not even here right now i died three winters ago yeah um by the way like it's it's i mean it's it's about to talk about stuff getting memory hold they were boarding up basketball hoops bro they were filling skate parks with sand yeah like you couldn't like they were you know like an arrest of dudes on the beach walking outside without a mask on bro that dude a walls was shooting people they do you know this yeah i need a tip line remember you could yeah but they were the fucking police we're going up and down the street shooting people of paintballs that were in their own yards oh my god get in your house that's insane it is it's totally insane it's insane um and so you know we talk a lot about these buttons that they can press right like that i mean there's war there's you know um cyber attacks which i think they ran multiple tests on the last few months uh but we talk about these you know big red buttons that they can be present i don't know if this is uh one that they're pushing just to see what the reaction and what's the response going to be from people if people are buying it i don't know um but they're definitely uh they definitely seem to be on track just in time for the elections guys what do you guys got on this man oh fucking hate this guy yeah light your foul che candle again you supposed this guy to like your foul che candle uh yeah i did we took we took his dep deposition and again i don't wish you know any ill health of x including w in virus which i think is what we should call it now but this guy in in a deposition that lasted all day was as squirrely as you can get i think it's only the second time you ever as deposition taken the one the one big takeaway other than saying i don't recall like 178 times or something was i may have told you the story before the court reporter sneeze or sneeze yeah and he told him to put a mask on this is in november of 2022 like this wasn't like march of 2020 which by the way we showed him an email we asked him you know do you think mass are effective he's like oh you know yeah yeah yeah well here's an email that you sent to a friend of yours in april of 2020 when she said hey i'm getting on a plane you think i should wear a mask he's like now they're not effective at all like this guy is the biggest charlatan phony um right he lied to people he was getting on tv and he just loved the attention i think that he loved yeah and you look at like guys who were in these county offices even here or whatever like they just they loved being in front of you know the camera telling people what they could do or they couldn't do yeah and um there's nothing new about that particularly in the history of the world but we i don't think we've seen anything not in our lifetimes well i think like that here i mean looking back dude the mask thing was a it was an exercise and compliance that was a that was a we want everybody to see that everybody's with it and all of the people that disagree with it had to do it so it made it appear like it was a real thing if they hadn't have put that pressure on the masking thing like that you would have seen that two out of every ten people were wearing a mask because everybody who was wearing one was like this is bullshit right so it was to create a perception that everybody believed that this was going on and then we just saw them build it from there on you know the next thing covid ended the next day was Ukrainian flags everywhere yeah the Ukraine thing next thing is Palestine uh is really next thing yeah and and and people like the truth is this guy was telling people don't see your family for Thanksgiving yeah bros there's people that still do that right like they were like it's it's insane and we're talking about how the media like it's a dissidents were establishment we talked about the prop and up Harris remember what all the so-called fact checkers and verify teams were doing like if you said masks weren't effective because they weren't and there was no peer reviewed study that said they were that is what they chose to cover to try to humiliate people who came out and said things i mean this is like that's the kind of corruption when people talk about like once you see you can't unsee yeah i think more people DJ to your point are seeing this stuff now and foult you was like the head of the snake for sure fucking rat man fucking rat guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the calm they tried to give me a PCR test when i was in the hospital both times this last month just really really yeah i was for those of you that don't know i had a couple medical issues uh with i had a monkey box no i didn't have the monkey box i'm trying hard to get it but it just hasn't happened yet uh no i had a little intestinal obstruction from some some food that i ate but either way they tried to give me the PCR test i wouldn't let them do it no yeah remember do you remember they had the people forget about this down to every night they would show COVID numbers or something yeah case numbers and they would talk about children in the ER with COVID what they didn't tell you was there were kids and we had neighbors like who had a broken arm and they went to the ER for that and then they required a test and they tested positive they weren't sick from it no but they wouldn't let them leave by the way until they tested negative which is a little or wellian but anyway they would put that in the numbers of kids in the ER with COVID and they would think well there's this pandemic of kids getting COVID which was totally bullshit but while they do that there was an incentive to do that they were getting a they're hospitals got paid more with every positive case the that hospital stood to make them fifteen twenty thousand dollars off yeah we had Russell Saraski on talking about the PCR test you know that the fucking guy who invented the PCR test magically died right before COVID started and then on top of it the PCR test is adjustable so if you turn the cycle rate up outside of the range where it's actually effective it'll detect anything so anything when you turn that up like any microscopic trace of anything which we all have in our bodies at all times will test positive they were testing people who were killed in automobile accidents right at post-mortem and then counting it as a positive test and then they were saying they died of COVID yes yes there was 30 thousand people forget that dude like people have completely forgotten the amount of bullshit that happened during that time like bro it was crimes against humanity dude brother was a I remember the story of I believe it was in Detroit somewhere in Michigan there was a medical examiner who will so blue on this she said that you know she had two bodies that came in they were together right same same issue they came in she read the death report from the hospital so these people died of COVID right she unzips the body bag and in her report she said it is very clear that these people died from GSWs which are gunshot wounds and they listed those people as COVID death yeah yeah and they wouldn't you if you tried to push because we did a little bit with COVID or for COVID like died with COVID or for difference with with with COVID or from COVID or from COVID yeah yeah or from COVID boy they didn't want to get into that conversation because that had to do with money yeah that's right it's ridiculous man it's ridiculous my daughter had asthma attack on Saturday so I had to take her to urgent care and the first thing they tried to give her was a COVID test brother I've been in I've you know I have a fib so I usually end up in a hospital once twice a year with a fib and I haven't been asked to take COVID test until this last time like that for a couple of years now they haven't been doing it now the sun they're doing it again so when they were like again I don't really love all this but it's important like for historical purposes the quarantine policy remember like if you were in a classroom first of all kids like you were more likely to die of a lightning strike than you were of COVID right so like it was you were more twice as likely to die of a dog attack but like those are the real numbers but the truth is these kids were being quarantined for two weeks two weeks out of school once they let them back into school if someone in their classroom tested positive like they didn't even need to test positive themselves this stuff was like totally off the rails and this is the United States of America right we're going to be trusting the science trust the science that science so yeah not that not that not that that male female science yeah that's not that's not the science yeah yeah he's fucking assholes man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck that's what we bring our headline there we talk about it it gets one of those two options so with the science theme let's stay on top of that our thumbs up or dumb as fuck hell on reads company will freeze your dead body until it's reanimated years later but it comes with a hefty price see what we think about this guys freeze freeze drive don't don't dumb dumb as fuck is that yeah bro 10 Williams did this I think Walt Disney too does need to do this well that was cryo I think this is a little they they changed the game on this with a little bit all right so let's stop let's dive into this uh new york post article reading chill out a height I love the the dad jokes they put in there they're great what I'm not chill out yeah oh of course I laugh at it a high tech startup is give fucking wrote that a high tech startup is giving people the option to cryogenically freeze that corpses and hopes that they may be revived one day in the distant future tomorrow bio a Berlin based company is charging a pretty penny 222 thousand dollars 222 thousand six hundred and three dollars to be exact plus a 55 monthly membership fee no way the monthly fees got me there's no way yeah so it's well first that's a very specific number like why is it that like 22603 you can make us the $3 yeah let's just make it flat but this yeah the yeah let's put bodies and body parts on ice uh brains alone cost 83,473 quote personally I believe that within my lifetime I'm currently 40 years old we may witness the safe cryo preservation and reanimation of complex organisms co-founder Fernando um a zevdo uh fero finiro told the daily mail quote for some the primary motivation is the fear of dying cryo preservation of offers them hope and a sense of security providing a potential path to extend their lives so far the company claims that six people and five pets have gotten the big chill and there are 650 people on the waiting list uh with an average age of 36 uh quote none of them are expecting to die anytime soon he told the daily mail um how does it work tomorrow bio offers what they called field cryo protection in which they begin the cryo preservation process immediately after a patient is declared legally dead uh using our retro fitted ambulances which function as mobile surgery rooms the company claims to be the only one worldwide to do so uh uh penino penero added that a corpse's bodily fluids are replaced by quote essentially medically when the air is doing this what yeah what I did all the one was a sandwich man but the the replace your body fluids by quote essentially medical grade anti-freeze uh to keep them uh to keep from irreversible code damage the temperatures are dropped to around minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit over a little more than a week before the body is stored in a long steel container containing liquid nitrogen for long term storage uh if a person is successfully revived after the captain american procedure and their investment hasn't been fully used in the treatment uh they get the remaining money back tomorrow bio sites a successful example of similar treatments to preserve a rabbit's kidney here is uh this is a picture inside of the ambulance that they have it's especially looks like they got a person in there looks like they got something in there yeah um yeah i i don't know about this i already gave my answer man didn't change after there's dumb details yeah i agree and if any freeze from penero man that sounds a little yeah i'm i'm okay on this how are you gonna do it no no no i'm i'm i'm not i don't think i'm with this dude i think we i think we we legitimately live in a time where i think people are age erick and i i think we will see people's life expectancy drastically extended in our lifetime i think people will by the time we're older we will see people living to 120 130 years old hmm i actually am not convinced that's not the normal lifespan of a human being and that we are potentially squashed into a life span that makes more sense for the medical industry that's my personal opinion but i know that's crazy but i mean the stuff they give us is just as damaging as it is as it is helpful and uh i was talking to zoltan from five finger who's a brilliant dude and he was he was like on that thing as well he's like bro all we got to do is just keep keep alive and they'll keep us alive but if you look at like people who take care of themselves who are 70 years old today versus like when we were kids like it's a pretty big difference man i saw something um so i'm 49 i saw something like will for brinley was my age during when he made cocoon that's what i'm saying dude so like a lot of these people who like when we were kids you know 45 years old was like you had gray you were like an old man and now there's people you know that are in their sixth like uh your buddy who used to be a cop who was out there training he's 60 years old uh Kevin yeah Kevin my 60 years old bro he's jacked i'm like dude what well yeah black don't crack but like i'm just saying yeah i'm just saying man that dude's a specimen for 60 years old that's unbelievable he's in better shape than almost anybody i i know so like it's gonna be interesting where this takes us but like i'm not i mean let's go back to the picture of these guys you believe those guys that was my fuckers playing call a duty bro and i was like a by the way kind of looks like a burger place yeah that's right it does they don't even have like doctor and shit written on the jackets now these those are paid actors yeah i'm not with it man you gotta if you're gonna sell me you better look a little smarter i'll say this too and we gotta be careful you know cuz i know like i do believe what didn't he Disney is uh crowd preserved yeah but here's a problem the native of Missouri by the way is he really yeah well here's the issue with that we're i mean cuz he was old when i mean he grew up in a different time in america right you gotta be careful waking him back up oh yeah that'd be that'd be a whole shock well he's dude no shit i'm just saying he saw some of these Disney movies now he might be freaking out bro well it is it is true what's all these boys doing my movies oh god it is true that Walt Disney was rumored to be racist and anti-Semite you can see waking up be like what the fuck haha just got be careful oh man i'm saying got be careful dude imagine wake up especially if this guy's waking him up oh man i'm just saying just imagine that there no thanks like by the time i'm done i'm done bro i've had it's like this yeah i got a shot clock and i don't know what exactly it is but i'm good um hopefully the the the values between this world and the next that we're all there do a brother cast in heaven some yeah i'm also a i'm a believer so it's not like i'm not afraid of that right i'm not afraid of that yeah so i wouldn't want to stay here man like i'm i'm actually kind of looking forward to that that other time you know all right well we don't don't i
