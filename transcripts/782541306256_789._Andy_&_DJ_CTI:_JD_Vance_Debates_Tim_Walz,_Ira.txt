job my real job the YouTube and yeah YouTube and podcasting it's so crazy to me that like people don't take like two seconds to like looking to shit you know it is what it is man yeah I don't care just comes with the territory look man I you know it makes no difference to me what people think or don't think yeah you know like if they don't know what I do that's fine that's better that's probably about yeah I'm excited about the new msco project coming up you know I'm really excited to get back into personal development still going to do real a f and cti and all that but you know I think we've accomplished our mission of waking up society and what's going on in the world I think enough people are seeing it and we need to get back to actually providing the tactics on how to win which is what I did before the show a lot of you guys don't know you know me from real a f you don't know that I have a number one business podcast in the world called the mfceo project from 2015 to 2020 I'm going to start that back up because I do what I think is required and was necessary what I think is necessary now is that we have a whole bunch of young people that don't know how to win we're going to teach them how to win business and life so I'm real excited about bringing that back yeah no there's going to be fucking awesome yeah that's my that's my bread and butter bro that's what I like doing yeah you know seeing people go win helping them win well it is needed man you know I think once we get the soil of this country back right in fertile it's moving that direction yeah yeah I'm good there you know we're still going to do this but my point is is you know I've been with holding tactics for a number of years because I've been doing this consume with this and I'm sure you learned a lot of new cool shit too for sure we're operating a totally different level but the thing is is you know because I haven't been doing it there has been a lot of people who are not qualified to teach things teaching them there's a lot of people that are full of shit there's a lot of people who are lying there's a lot of bad information out there and when I start this back up you're going to see those people with their way just like did it the first time right so because not quite honestly none of them done what I've done yeah it happened so you know we're going to teach people how to do things like that let me excited you know it's going to be awesome well dude I was I was thinking you know about old age and like you know when I get old I'm talking like 90 okay not like you know 45 or anything like that like old old you know I'm saying but like just things that like I don't want to happen to me was that supposed to be a joke no no I'm just like like so you know I don't count 45 is old yeah it's not it's not no yeah 90s old like 46 to 90 like that's all that's all that's all now but do I was thinking like you know the things that I don't want to happen to me man like I don't want to go do a nurse at home yeah I don't want a nurse at home I don't I don't want like to have to do hospice I don't want any of that shit man and unfortunately that's exactly what they're doing the fucking Jimmy Carter right now bro did you see them will him out for his fucking birthday no oh my god bro is bad Jimmy Carter willed out to watch military fly over in Georgia as he celebrates 100th birthday with friends and family bro this is so bad dude like listen like I hopefully my kids see this shit maybe but like don't do this shit to me don't be willing me out a little fucking blanket on my lap it won't be me motherfucker I'll be gone I won't do it to you yeah I promise don't be in the woodchipper bro just get me out of here man like fuck but let's dive into this a little bit man despite his grandson saying he was limited as he turned 100 Jimmy Carter split his birthday in the sunshine enjoying a military flyover at his Georgia home Carter the first American president to reach the century mark was able to watch a flyover of four f 18 jets and several vintage planes that grace the skies over planes Georgia as part of the town celebration per CBS news though even the high school that that he went to or he graduated in 1941 high school still open the kids of that generation now they're like they were celebrating I mean cool all right but like here's a problem let's watch the clip man man well he looks dead right there man that's not gonna do that I mean at least his no man not for me either bro no man I don't plan on making it that long anyway bro like I got I got way too big of a mouth I dig my heels in on shit and like it's it ain't gonna happen for me one way or the other dude I see the thing is I feel like people who always think that like they always send a live the longest night ain't coming me you know who's saying you be fucking 105 no way no plus I'm big dude like big people won't live that long this room you know I'm saying you don't see any dudes that are hundred big dudes what the fuck you looking at me for me I'm just saying you don't and the bigger they are the shorter they live and basketball players they fucking don't live very long because they're so big bro my tumbo yeah dekemi my tumbo bro 58 58 years old man yeah yeah cancer ranking was that what it was yeah yeah jeez but yeah I mean I don't know I think it's just and I don't ever want this shit to happen to me I'm getting rolled around in the fucking I don't want it no no no guys jumping on the scum oh I don't know what you guys think with that being set man let's get into these headlines we got a lot of hot and heavy stuff coming we got cocks involved roosters that is so remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to andyfacela.com you guys can find them all linked there without being said let's get into our first headline this is more on a serious note there was did you know did you see there was a a murder at the vice presidential debates last night did you see that oh yeah yeah yeah yeah JD Vance fucking destroyed us I actually didn't get to watch it I had a couple buddies over at the house when we're smoking cigars talking so I didn't get to see the whole thing I saw some clips though it was bad was it it was bad yeah I didn't I didn't I didn't get to see it was so bad I mean dude I don't you know the clips can be cut so many different ways it's like hard to know unless you watch it it was it was bad it walls even hold his own no are you just say no no like like legit like like legitimately I went like I wouldn't say that my expectations were high but they were definitely not that fucking low you know what I'm saying like it's worse than you thought he would he did 10 times worse than I thought he would like I thought he would be able to least you know engage maybe have like a little bit they were building them up beforehand because they were saying oh you know walls is not going to be like that he's going to be sharp he's going to be this that's what I'm saying dude and he delivered ass cakes bro really it was bad it was bad and like everybody's on him so let's talk about this uh send him to JD Vance's regard for the facts appeared to help him outperform the sugar coated whimsy of Minnesota governor Tim Walsh during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate at least that is the opinion of those pulled immediately after the showdown by CBS news which hosted the forum now I think it's important to we we've already talked about it we've covered it we've exposed it the fact of how these polls are completely bullshit right completely bullshit um but you go to CBS's poll this is what they say they give vant JD Vance 42% over Tim Walsh 41% with 17% of the liberals saying it was a tie that means they know he lost they know he lost yeah they just a 70% they're so they don't want to say so yeah they're so fucking ignorant um now bro it's just prideful thinking like we have an ego problem in this country like dude you have to be able to make good decisions in life whether it be politics or whether we business or whether it be your fitness or whether you have to address the reality of the situation and if you continue to present yourself as you're correct and you continue to tell yourself that you're right that only makes a situation worse so it takes a certain amount of humility to be successful at anything in life that's why it's absurd when people look at successful people and they're like oh remember where you came from you're not humble you don't even know what humility is bro you got to be good to be humble you can't just say you're humble and you're not any good you know so like we have to have as American citizens some better decision making by putting ourselves in a situation where we we say hey am I wrong here am I seeing this wrong and I do that I do that constantly like when I have opinions on things I will ask people who were some I'm like bro am I am I seeing this wrong or is this and we're not getting that from a lot of people in this country we're getting a lot of people who just hate Donald Trump so much that they're willing to dig their heels and at the expense of everything else in their life their quality of life as a whole and that come that's that's ego bro well we know they're trying to cheat right and I think that's the other like that's the sinister part behind you know CBS doing this type of bullshit pulling knowing that walls got fucking destroyed yeah right and so for people who didn't watch the debate or didn't see all the debate they see this poll like okay well I mean he must it can't be that bad we're we're still in good shape right but knowing the entire reason they're pushing the stuff out there and so that when they cheat you know it seems realist it's more it's more believable yeah you know like no dude he got fucking hammered now you want a realistic poll but you go to NBC right and there even they're saying five to one that walls one okay I'm not surprised I mean but it's just like bro these people hire actors to come and do this shit they hire actors to interview on the street yeah you know so like what I'm not surprised about that what are they gonna do what are they gonna do put six truly undecided voters up there who are gonna call it out really is they're not gonna do that because it's gonna make everybody in the network look stupid it's true now a lot of the mainstream media they have at least been pretty honest with it you know politico saying JD Vance controlled the debate until the end the Republican candidate was clearly better prepared it's a lesson for Democrats well dude what I did see the part I did see was the closing statements I saw JD Vance's closing statement which was amazing and then I saw Tim Wallace closing statement which was dog shit and he was on there saying we're gonna bring back the politics of joy it was it was insane now what the fuck does it mean shit it's just some shit they're trying to say to get people to you know listen to them it's just talking points they make up yeah the moderators also got slammed so this was a CBS hosted debate moderators were destroyed so let's dive into this a little bit political pundits ripped CBS news anchors Nora O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan for biased moderating during the vice presidential debate now we've seen this with the other two debates that we've seen hosted by mainstream media where it's completely bias they fact check one side don't fact check the other side and JD Vance called them out on it let's let's watch this clip thank you governor and just to clarify for our viewers springfield Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status temporary protected well well well but thank you senator we have so much to get to I think it's important because the economy thank you Margaret the rules were that you got to make a fact check and since your fact checking me I think it's important to say what's actually going on so there's an application called the CBP one app where you can go on as an illegal migrant apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand that is not a person coming in applying for a green card and waiting for 10 years thank you senator thank you senator for describing the legal process I mean like that was pretty much it the whole debate dude who are these people these these people that think it's okay just like you're a fucking news reporter bro you're not an expert no you're not let them talk you know like oh that's enough said that's enough senator in terms of that never that sort of disrespect is new like I feel bad for young people watching what's happening because for my whole life up until the last four years I've never seen anything like this I've never seen moderators cut people off and correct the correct the candidates and all this shit like bro you're in you're supposed to be a journalist you're supposed to find out the actual information not propagate your point of view because this guy's pointing out the holes in the game like it's absurd dude I mean just let the people like let the people decide let the people here hear what both like you know I'm like like yeah what is that so oh it's dangerous because it's going to expose the fact that you guys are full of shit yeah we're just out of this fucking clip uh in response some walls he uh falsely claims that the by Biden Harris migrant mobile app has been on the book since 1990 how how is the mobile app exists before smartphones the same way he was in fucking tenement square yeah during the fight I saw that clip too you know what I'm saying like dude like the guy just clearly lies man body body language experts they they all hopped in on this and they said that his entire demeanor the out entire debate was of a person that lies yeah I mean like no shit yeah bro the clips I've seen have been real bad now I was giving him the benefit of the doubt because I didn't see the whole thing you know like I said a minute ago the clips can be clipped in however which way but the clips I did see he looked bad and the clips I did see he seemed like he was completely honest heels trying to deflect you know like when they asked him straight up what do you have to say about tenement square he gave this like two three minute answer and then they had to ask him again and he's like well that's what I said like he still couldn't say like you know what I was young I exaggerated the story I apologize I take responsibility for that and that's that's not reflective of my character and I'm sorry yeah right so super simple you know what he you know he everybody can fucking relate to that because everybody's exaggerated before everybody know right so like run balls still falling that's right I get it I caught I caught jaws when I went you know I'm saying off the dock with a piece of corn right right you know like dude there's all kinds of every anybody could have respected that and another clip I saw that I thought was really good was when walls was talking about how his son witnessed a shooting and dance turned to him and was like hey my condolences for that that's that's horrible nobody should have to see that like there I will say this there was a civility amongst them that was refreshing to see even though from what I saw walls did very poorly and advanced it very good yeah that at least that it wasn't like this Hillary Clinton-ish because you'd be in jail punchy shit you know what I'm saying like it just wasn't the same it just wasn't the it was better well you know you know I think when I was looking at walls you know what I saw I saw a guy who knows what the truth is knows the damages of who he is on his running ticket he knows the lies that are being told and he knows he knows what the truth is and he's having to go out there and fucking completely say the opposite of what's true and and he knows it's not true bro you know it was crazy I saw someone post you know Tim all seems like you know the the happy grandpa that's just in over his head like he's too and I'm just like bro this is the game they play right they play like they're friendly and warm and just stupid and they're they're like Biden's just a nice old man he just seen out this is the game they play because they want you to feel that way about them they want you to say oh he's just a good old guy who you know sometimes he miss speaks those these people put that act on it it should be easy for anyone to see that's been paying attention Biden comes in he makes all of these decisions that screw up the country okay he inflates the currency he opens the borders he leaves a bunch of our equipment Afghanistan he sends $180 billion combined to Ukraine and Israel he depletes our strategic oil reserves etc you know we could go on and on and on and on and on removes energy independence we go on there's a million more things he's done that are intentionally destructive to our country and to the citizens quality of life in this country and people look at him and they say oh he's just dumb he's just seen how he's not with it if that were an intelligent person if that were a I don't know let's say somebody who people respected as a smart person making those decisions their perspective of what that person was doing would be completely different because they would say wait a minute that's an intelligent dude he's doing this on purpose this guy's attacking our country he's attacking us that guy's a trader the only way they've been able to get away with this is because they put people like this up at the front people who seem innocent who the average person can have empathy for and it can relate to and say oh that's my uncle that's my grandpa or that's this because if they put someone up there that was super sharp you would see right away the destruction that they're intentionally causing and this is part of the play you cannot look at Tim Walls and say oh that's like my uncle who's just a nice guy and he's kind of stupid I'm gonna vote for him anyway because I think Trump's an asshole like dude you can't do that yeah fuck your uncle yeah dude these people are evil people that pretend in your face and do different things behind your back and if you watch their actions it shows that consistently now I don't know if this was like a miss miss like you know miss stated uh statement that Tim made but he also made this very interesting statement where uh he said that he was friends with school shooters um now I listen I watched that clip he misspoke okay what he was saying was I was friends with the families of victims of school shootings that's what he was saying yeah like and then this I don't listen it's a five second clip but you take it out of context that's what I'm saying like dude listen uh you know I'm not with that like I'm not with I don't give a fuck if I like him or I don't like him I'm not with the manipulation of somebody's words but got you to bury them yeah that's not okay I am anti-cancel culture you have never seen me hop on and say hey fuck these guys let's bury them it's wrong it's wrong for this country it's wrong for everybody involved because everybody has skeletons in their closet and we have this this attitude now because of social media where people don't necessarily have a lot of power in their lives where they want to flex it on people and ruin their motherfucking lives for shit they didn't actually do okay or didn't actually mean and so I watched that clip yeah and I don't like Tim walls I think Tim walls is a total piece of shit however what he meant was and I watched it was hey I'm friends with the families of some of these school uh shooter victims that's what he meant here's a clip for context for everybody for everybody at home watching and listening here's a five-second clip that was taken and ran with so I've become friends with school shooters I've seen it look the NRA I was the NRA guy for a long time they used to yeah so that's a clip yeah but he also there's more context that because he was talking about how his son witnessed the shooting and that he's talked to the families that was just a that was bullshit yeah so look I'm gonna call it as I see it here I don't care if I like them or not no that's respect me holding that against him I mean like Donald Trump took it and ran with it and like and that's that's the I like that you know I like this this tweety put uh the truth that he put out the tampon Tim just say he has become friends with the school shooter he isn't even qualified to be governor let alone vice president walls and Kamala do not have what it takes well I don't disagree that they don't have what it takes dude but like you know we did okay look this kind of comment coming from Trump and I like Trump mm-hmm all right but just because I like him doesn't mean I'm gonna say everything he says is right this perpetuates this cancel culture shit yeah because what's happened here is the left had the cancel culture forever and now it's swung to the right and people on the right they've never felt that power before so we have this we have these people on the right who are now abusing their power of canceling other people even people who agree with them and that's not cool man like we have to stop this at some point in time because what's happening here is that the smartest most successful most intelligent people are not sharing their opinions at all and if we want to solve problems in this country the successful people who are smart intelligent who have built things because that's what we need to run the country we can't just have you know Joe Blow in the fucking White House we need someone who's built shit who runs shit who knows how to run the world's most important organization if we can't allow our smartest and brightest people to have opinions because when they have opinions we try to ruin their lives or ruin their business or ruin their families what we're gonna get is a bunch of shit like we've been getting okay so at some point this stuff has to stop and I don't like the Trump said that because it's just not it's not true well like my thing and by the way let me make this clear I'm voting for fucking Trump yeah I'm gonna say it but I could be critical of Trump and still vote for him well I think too like I mean it's important to realize guys like how long did they run with you know there was very fine people on both sides yeah it's exact same thing you know I'm saying it's supposed like to your point it's like yeah like like I'm sure Trump yeah you're filling the power of the cancel culture you know you will did right but like we like the not just Trump what I'm saying is is he's setting the example for everybody else right to take how many of these talking heads on the conservative side take every single headline and just blast at the fuck out and try to be first and then it ends up being wrong it ends up being some nuance to it these guys are no and bro I like these guys okay I know where their heart is they want to win they're on my team fucking get it I'm not talking shit I'm saying there's a more responsible way to communicate things and we have to understand that if we continue to allow the penance swing back and forth in society we end up with the polarization that we see right so we have to quit punishing people especially the people that we agree with for things that they do that are missteps you know what I'm saying like dude it's it's we can't the dick and this is why I say it's a designed weapon cancel culture is a designed weapon it's a social weapon and the purpose of the weapon is so that people who are intelligent who have solutions who have opinions who also have things to lose will not voice their solutions or opinions or get involved and that means that we end up with people who aren't experienced who aren't the best the best and brightest the people in Washington DC like AOC hasn't done a fucking thing why is she there like we could go through and by the way there's people on both sides professional politician is not a career it's not supposed to be a career this country was built on it being a representative government meaning people who are actually doing things in real life take a break from what they are doing to serve as the leadership of the country they are not there to get rich they are not there to make hundreds of millions of dollars politicians net worth should not be able to go up at all via these deals that they do there and that's become the game the game is get in there you don't have to have experience will fund you and you'll make all kinds of money just vote the way we want the corporate greed and the corporate government and the big donors and big lobbyists control our government right now because we're not a representative government if we were at somebody like AOC could never get elected because she doesn't have a track record right so like do this is all connected and we have to understand for it to stop cancel culture has to stop because we have to allow our intelligent operators who have opinions on both sides of the pendulum to voice their opinions and solutions without facing you know the repercussions of destroying their livelihood that's real shit man it's real guys jumping on this conversation that's not what you guys think down in the comments with that being said man we got some really good comments today I will say this I didn't know much about JD Eric Schmidt knows them their friends Eric said he's just stud I will say this I'm sold on now oh yeah yeah I mean I think Trump made the right move yeah plus he's only 38 you know yeah as a killer bro yeah can't comes from nothing put went through on GI Bill fucking went to like this guy I mean like the Americans do it he really is and I think that's why Trump picked him yeah because he is the American dream he's another version of it yeah you know what I mean yeah for sure well I mean he's just fucking relatable man like that's the but that's the trajectory that's the path of everybody wants the America dream bro everybody wants the opportunity we like whether or not someone executes on the opportunity that's on you but we want the opportunity should be open and it should be wide open and like he said last night poor people should be able to go to the grocery store and get nice meals they should be able to afford a home you shouldn't have to be mega rich to live a good life in America and that's what he's fighting for and I agree with that like bro we shouldn't have people that are you know can't afford homes but they got full-time jobs and then they got to take other two other jobs to even pay their shit that's not how we should be dude so we're way off track here man anyway yeah man guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think that being said man we got some hell we

keep liking keep commenting keep subscribing makes you guys hit that bell notification on the youtube to stay up to date with the latest episodes uh from L.A.F that being said it's dive into headline number two um gotta talk about it world stage uh the the global pools getting a little hot right now um guy that's that's dive into this little because people are peeing in it it's a lot of pee in the pool yeah no pee in the ool yeah and there's pee in and shit in the pool yeah right now yep um let's dive into it uh head on my IDF I ran his fired missiles at Israel huh let's let's correct this um it's not I ran it's a run well you talked to any fucking I know how to pronounce it I know but like dude all you know honeys or honeys from Iran yeah it on okay like every time he says that he like tells DJ to fucking say it right well I do it all we have lots of friends that are Persian from that area yeah they you offend every time you say I ran well I'm just trying to keep in mind for like you know like say it say it right away can you say it yeah it on no it's it on it's a run you're not fucking Aaron it's it's Aaron how you say it there is he shine it on you don't see see you say it like that there's a dialect man nothing changes a little bit all right say it the right way it on okay whatever she's just saying I ran fucking I ran to the store I was trying to like make it like more palatable I ran to his fired missiles yeah it's a run it's the run is fired missile it's better than Helene yeah I got lean Helene I got shit on about that yeah okay sorry I'm not a webster dictionary we're aware it's hooked on phoenix man um Iran has fired missiles at Israel all residents ordered to bomb shelters so this was a very interesting development that uh started yesterday and uh let's dive into this a little bit so uh Iran had launched missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening local time um as Israelis throughout the entire country were ordered to take cover in bomb shelters until further notice now the idea for release this this image um every single one of those red pins uh was a confirmed hit uh from a rocket okay it seems like a lot that does seem like a lot and in total they're saying that it was somewhere roughly about 400 missiles that were launched but here's the the thing here's the thing I understand uh that there is a term in war it's called a fog okay there's the fog of war right where things happen and because of this fog we're not really truly able to see what's actually happening um and that like that benefits both sides right because like you know obviously if you're a country trying to portray strength you don't want the other side to know what's really going on and how bad things really are because you're still trying to put you know portray this this strength right but they release this um and then they say in a statement uh a short while ago missiles were launched from Iran from Iran towards the state of Israel you are in this is the message that they're sending out to their citizens you are instructed to remain alert and precisely follow the homefronts command instructions uh in the few in the last few minutes the homefront command has distributed life-saving instructions in various areas across the country the public is asked to adhere to homefront commands guidelines upon hearing a siren you must enter a protected space and remain there until further notice the IDF is doing and we'll do everything necessary to protect the civilians of the state of Israel um and then they updated that you know uh last night uh the IDF spokesman rear admiral uh Daniel Haggary told his railees at roughly 8.30 pm local time that the Iranian attack had ended and that there have been no injuries or deaths uh he urged the public to exercise caution he said uh Israel were response to Iran quote in the place and the time we determine uh ending saying we have plans all right now they're claiming that there was no injuries like okay no deaths school but there were no injuries okay and the the part that's interesting about this again you look at this picture i mean from Bethlehem televive demona hebron yeah i mean like the entire maps filled with these blimps and i have it like it's just very hard for me to believe that not one person was injured just from the the missile attacks alone it's very hard for me to believe that now i have a source that was in televive at the time when this stuff happened who sent me a video here's a clip uh now context here well let's just here's the clip now the important thing to note here i mean israel they have an amazing uh defense system called the iron dome right they've taken attacks countless of times for many proxies over the last year the eye what do you mean why do they keep getting attacked i mean you're you're bomb 40,000 people well they say you always you know started on 10 sat hypothetical questions hypothetical question yeah why do they keep getting attacked yeah um but here's the thing man like you know they've they've taken missiles before the iron dome is is it has supposed to been impenetrable it failed yesterday um which is why we see all of these hits on the country and then again my source sends me this i saw i saw a clip last night not a clip on the internet but on it was on they were talking like i woke up at like real late night and was on tv and they were saying that the the US military helped shoot down a lot of these yeah that that's actually uh that's absolutely true um US uh destroyers they were firing ballistic missiles to help because the iron dome was failing um here's a clip from that this is on a US navy destroyer you'll see it launcher very in second and we sent off the shit ton of them um in helping uh to defend israel now with that going on again this being the first time the iron dome fails um there's some interesting things that are happening that i think is very important for people to pay attention to um at the same exact time all that is going on israel begins its invasion of lebanon right so you have israel a country lebanon speaking comahairis in terms so israel is basically a country right and lebanon's also another country okay and the countries you know they don't really get along all the time right and for having an argument they're having a little disagreement right these two countries that exist right in the context of existence and um israel just invaded lebanon right like with no declaration of war like no heads up they invade it and um they're starting to have issues there uh they're reporting that seven combat deaths so far um as uh fears mount over a wider conflict um you have the united states obviously involved in some way shape of farm they're firing ballistic missile interceptors to help defend israel against this aronian uh barrage barrage um um and israel is now saying that they are vowing um to uh have a massive response to aron they did that back in april but remember it was like a it was like uh they shot him into the desert to like like remember that when the shots of missiles in back in april but they intentionally did not hit anything yeah and then israel shot back and didn't hit anything either um so now i mean this is a pretty a massive escalation um a force um and it's interesting um because i've been talking to some some some friends of mine um in different places and there is a very likelihood that this will definitely start world war three because there's big names that are being involved you got russia you got china there's multiple fronts here that we are being spread across and weakened as a country militarily um and obviously i mean you can have your own opinions i believe i know you are the same belief it's intentional right like to weaken this country militarily um and it's interesting because i don't know if you saw this but just today we're now sending warships to go meet with china and russia um because we have russia and uh chinese navy are now encroaching more on alaska um this just came out today and so you have all of that going on but the interesting thing is the position of this administration uh you have Biden um saying that uh he will not support a strike on a rion nuclear site which is what israel wants to do right now um so i thought that was interesting um but so he he's not supporting these strikes because these strikes do not benefit um or harm i should say the united states directly um but you want to know a strike that he does support our ports being shut down half of our ports in this country being shut down he supports that he supports that no problem uh he's made a statement saying quote uh they made incredible profits over 800 percent profits since the pandemic and the owners are making tens of millions of dollars from this Biden told reporters on wednesday that's time for them to sit at the table and get the strike done um because that destroys the country so yeah he would definitely help support that no problem um and we're already starting to see some uh disruptions from those shutdowns that you know we're not even 72 hours into their uh the strike at this time and what do you got on all of this man i i i say the same thing that happened when ten seven happened we shouldn't be fucking doing shit in the middle east we shouldn't do anything in Ukraine we should be worrying about our own country our own country is dilapidated decrepit divided and disgusting and it needs a lot of work our infrastructure is crumbling people are starving in the inner cities there's more homeless now and there ever has been we have an open border we have a terrible economy and we are still the only country that works all this time and does all these things to have our tax dollars set somewhere else like i've said many times before there is not a single dollar that should be spent with israel or ukraine or anyone else until this country looks like Dubai from the east coast to the west coast from the northern border to the southern border our whole entire country needs to be prosperous filled with opportunity we have good health care we've got less taxes we've got prosperity happening these are things that need to be happening here before we ever consider getting involved and it doesn't matter who i think is wrong or right in these other conflicts because i care about us i care about our people and our people are hurting right now and we're sending the money that should be sent to places like ashville and you know the other parts of the country that are just completely fucked up right now instead of sending them overseas and i just that's my point i'm an american first person i'm not i'm not an israel person i'm not a middle east person i'm not a ukraine person i'm not a russia person i'm a fucking american person that's what i care about i care about our people i care about what's going on here and i think this situation is very dangerous uh because like i've been saying they want to start as much disruption as much conflict as they can before the election to keep Donald Trump from becoming president again because it means that all of those people are likely to face accountability for the crimes that they've been committing and so what i see happening which is what i think people should be very worried about and concerned about is that if this turns into a full blown war between israel and a bunch of other you know Arab countries which what that's what will happen if it cracks off right and they can't use NATO because the israel is not a NATO ally right so we have 20 million migrants 80% of which are military age males here so who's to say that these muslim men these Arab men these African men who are coming from these Chinese men who are coming from all over the country through our open border who are already here who's to say they aren't ready for a part of an attack if this were to crack off okay and you have on shan ryan's show like i mentioned the other day you they're talking about a potential ten seven style attack here in the united states where the migrants the military age migrants are armed and they are going door to door kicking doors down and shooting and killing american citizens if that happened in all the places where these migrants were and our military is at alaska and you crane and middle east and they're all over the place what what happens you see what i'm saying and i think we are i think this is what i think i think our current administration is bought and paid for by china i think they've done everything they can do to make our country weaker to make our country more susceptible to conquering and i think there's been an international plan that is led by the world economic forum that flows down through china and through our enemies and the plan is to make america fall and the plan is to legitimately overtake america and if you think about how you would overtake america how would you conquer america it's not going to be like rolling up on the beach like you see in normandy it's not going to be uh you know tanks and airplanes crossing the southern border from mexico or from canada into that's not how it's going to be it's going to be sneaking people in and then having them attack and if they had a omnipresence attack across the whole country are our people prepared for that i don't know i know some people are but if this breaks off the way that it looks like it could there's intelligence that says that that's the kind of attack they're going to play here so i think every american citizen needs to be very concerned and be very prepared uh to defend their own home and their own neighborhoods from a potential attack like that because dude uh those people are here they are not coming here they are here they're not getting they don't have to get guns they have them yeah you know i'm saying like and and the fucked up part about it is that like when you pill it all back um we americans we paid for them to get strategically in our country because they're applying these motherfuckers in deeper into a country this tax problem that we have in this country has to be solved dude it is not okay for american men and women to work most of the year for the government only to have the government take our money and spend it and wander it through other countries causes every single tax dollar that comes through our system should be spent on this country period no exceptions and i don't see how anybody could disagree with that i just don't you're okay with working till august for the government and you get to keep from september to december is anybody okay with that because that's the reality of most people when you add up all the taxes that they have to pay and then knowing that from most people are not even aware of that uh no no they cut they go around say i love america it's free the fucker you talking about dude you pay more taxes than you get to keep no i don't i only pay 30 percent i only pay what about all the other tax what about all the other tax that you're what about your sales tax what about your your property tax what about uh you know the tax you pay to own shit the tax you pay to sell shit what about tax on gas tax on food tax bro that's we that's all we get everything's that yes and dude the government intentionally sends the money overseas so that they can scrape half of it to themselves how else do you think these people come into office worth nothing and leave worth hundreds of millions of dollars okay so who is okay with that that should be the the founding commonplace for all american citizens to come together is that we are all being raped financially by our own government at our expense and zero benefit to us that has to change bro this this shit like trump coming in and saying oh we're not going to do tax on tips no we shouldn't be doing tax on a lot of shit bro like let's get to the point you overspend the money your people steal the money meaning the government not trump's people you guys create the situation where there are people can't even survive because of how much you take out of their pockets and then you act like you you know like it's no big deal it's no big deal it's no big deal that are are people are being taxed to death and they can't eat it's no big deal that inflation is causing the price of chicken to go from four dollars to twenty dollars I don't even know how people are doing it to be completely honest okay so unless people come together and get smart and realize that we don't live in a free country the way that we are have been advertised to live in a free country nothing's going to change because we're still brunt we're in this brain fog wash about how amazing America is bro there's a dozen countries in the world that I can name off top my head that are much nicer than America she's most Americans have never been there you know what I'm saying so what how are we the greatest country in the world if we're taxed in the poverty and the opportunity to get out of that is almost impossible how how the what we've been sold is not what we've gotten and we have to get back to creating and demanding that what this country supposed to be about is what it actually is and that that is going to take us understanding that we are being lied to and we are being taken advantage of and we are being extorted people say oh taxation is tough no it's not taxation is extortion because if you don't pay it they put you in fucking jail right okay it's not theft it's extortion right it's you do this or we're putting you in jail does that sound free to you that's insane man no it's not just insane what's insane is that people don't recognize it people don't have the financial capacity or literacy to understand it which is also intentional why don't they teach you in high school how to have responsible personal finances why don't they teach you how to make money why are they teaching you how to do the square root of the sum of the equal of a circumference of a fucking circle instead of teaching how to manage your money you see what I'm saying like bro it's bullshit they didn't teach that shit anymore no now it's now it's all about like what gender you're gonna decide to be more math as races so of course there's that yeah man guys a perfect storm is brewing man yeah and I don't know enough about the dock workers to know what's going on but I do know and I'm pretty sure from what I've heard they're making like 200 grand a year the guy who was on TV saying weren't I'm gonna cripple the country like that dude makes a million bucks a year okay so what are we what are we talking about you know what I mean you know how many people are here making 200 grand a year not very many not a lot and so like dude it's just it feels coordinated it feels politically coordinated to put pain on the American citizens dude I think they're the no response to what's going on in Asheville by the way you got Joe Biden and Kamala on TV saying they're lying about that we're here we're there no no there's not they're not there and and they're like I posted this video on the internet on my story yesterday there's hundreds of people on the ground with helicopters that are being told that they go in they're gonna be arrested right there's black hawks and 3500 troops there that haven't gotten the orders to help yet okay that that was as of last night now maybe that changes by the time the show airs but it feels like they're intentionally not responding to that it feels like this strike comes at a very inconvenient time for the United States and also this shit going on in the Middle East and so we have to understand bro Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are not even in charge of what's going on this is coming from the globalist collective the world economic form collective the members of the world economic form the countries that are involved the individuals they are involved are operating a plan that they openly discuss that when you bring it up people say you're talking about conspiracy no they openly discuss this the leaders of the world go there and talk about how they have agenda 2030 and what they need to create a gender 2030 is they have to bring the United States from a powerhouse down to a third world country so that everybody's the same because that's the whole play okay it's about equity because there's one person's above the other countries will still try to reach that correct that that's correct so they're intentionally bring America into a third world status so that it can fit into the rest of the countries that are governed through the world economic form that's what's going on yeah man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments that being said let's get to our third and final headline we got low American hope here this is a really interesting headline let's dive into this headline number three reads California outlaws local voter ID rules now this was interesting okay this was definitely interesting so Gavin Newsom just signed a new law on Sunday this past Sunday barring local cities municipalities from an acting voter ID he completely outlawed it throughout the entire state of California okay California is one of 14 states that does not require voter ID at the polls according to the national conference of state legislatures so that comes out Sunday and from the I'm almost get emotional reading reading this next headline man because I think it's fucking amazing read this mayor of California charter city defines Newsom's ban on voter ID laws that law does not apply to us there is some standing up some some real American patriots what's California charter city so they're talking about hunting team beach hunting beach voters and this actually goes back from all the way back to March 5th let's dive into this man California mayor is defiant after government Gavin Newsom signed a law in direct response to the city's attempt to secure elections the saga began on March 5th when hunting team beach voters weighed in and passed ballot measure one the voter ID and election rules amendment according to ballot pdia the charter amendment authorized the city to require voter identification for elections and allowed infrastructure to support the initiative now in April California's attorney general Rob Bonta and secretary of state Shirley Weber suit hunting beach over what it called an unlawful voter ID amendment the two officials said without evidence that the measure of course who do you think is going to hurt who do they say hurts by voter ID people of color for isn't black people yeah you know so after the vote California state senator Dave how does it hurt those people explain that to me someone explain it to me how do you know what hurts those people allowing people to shouldn't even be here to vote and their own self interests so that they get all the tax dollars and those people get none okay I don't know how to say this I've said this 40,000 times all right black communities when they cry racism they should be crying racism to these people who do this because what they're allowing just like these people are starting to realize they're allowing all these people to come in that are not American citizens you are an American citizen and they're giving them the benefits that they promise you and the reason they're giving them the benefits that they promise you is because they have realized that that group the black Americans have an a large part woken up so they cannot rely on their automatic vote anymore so what are they done they then ported a whole another class of people that they are helping get established with the money that they promised our American communities are black American communities that's fucking racism bro they're intentionally impoverishing these communities for a new group of people that aren't even American citizens there is zero reason whatsoever other than the reason of treason that Gavin Newsom is signing a law like that dude the people are speaking they voted on this the people of Huntington Beach voted to have that in place they voted that's that's how democracy works what do you mean like hunt the people of Huntington Beach they voted to have the voter ID law put in yeah like they because everybody sick of a dude listen dude you know I'm saying yeah people are waking up bro like there was no black people protesting that fucking bill getting fucking pat like no you know what you know what I'm saying like they wanted this no this whole that listen it's always the same shit it's racist it's racist it's racist it's racist it's racist not everything's racist bro no in fact most of the shit they say is racist is not racist because they're covering up for their own racism it's disgusting um so cow governor news some sign the bill until last Sunday according to politico the new law will take an effect on January 1st that's the interesting thing um so unfortunately for Newsom company uh current Huntington Beach mayor Gracie van der Mark isn't about to quietly let Sacramento dictate the future of her city she questions whether the state even has jurisdiction over charty charter cities like Huntington Beach and the constitutionality of men's legislation quote the state cannot pass any laws that strip us of our constitutional rights van der Mark told uh LA uh is so that law does not apply to us or affect our new election laws they're saying they're keeping it good I'm sure there's going to be some type of legal battles in the court as there always is um you know but again who who would be for that Elon Musk chimed in on this uh he compared Newsom to the Joker after their voter ID requirements banned in California he uh put this tweet out saying wow it is now illegal to require voter ID in California they just made preventing voter fraud against the law the Joker is in charge I thought that was interesting because there is actually a weird fucking resemblance there between the Joker listen and these people are traders their traders to America they are communist insurgents who are intentionally and doing so in a coordinated fashion destroying the United States America and your livelihoods that's it that's the state of the current democratic party in the United States okay the current democratic party in the United States does not represent democratic values of any sort they are the party of big corporations they are the party of war they are the party of violence they are the party of high taxation they are the party against the middle class these those are all things that traditionally the democratic party was for and we have a lot of people like I said earlier in the show refusing to admit that their party has been hijacked by literal communist and Marxist and they are looking to destroy not just the republicans but you too okay so we have to have an awakening real fucking fast to understand what's happening here in the country otherwise dude you know we're not going to have it no I think it's just it's fucked up man because we go back we don't even have to go back that fucking farman go back to three years this is coming from the same state that was trying to force those same black people to go get vaccine passports to buy fucking groceries yeah but that wasn't racist you get a vaccine passport be kicking an ID you know so it's like and like I'm just I'm glad to see a an American patriot stand up every fuck the state every city should stand up to that every city in this country should require voter ID at the polls no matter what no matter what their governor says or anything like if you want to protect the country that's what should be happening and it's going to take people standing up it's going to take people doing things that are uncomfortable you know I saw something today that there's apparently a whole lot of border patrol that wants to blow the whistle and what's actually going on and they are saying that their wives are telling them not to blow the whistle because it endangered their household livelihood do you do you know what's really going to endanger your household livelihood not blowing the whistle continuing to go down this path so I hope if that's true I hope it's not true but if it is true I hope that the men who are being told that will explain that to their wives and their children and go do the right thing we need more people standing up doing the right thing blowing the whistle on what's actually happening if everybody were to come out and start doing it everybody would join in and then these people would be completely exposed that could have happened four years ago we could not even be here but because we have people in this country that lack the moral fortitude to stand on their fucking words and say hey this is not right like that gentleman that we featured last week who went in front of congress from the FBI and said hey this is what's happening they're not going to reel this in they're out of control that needs to be happening from everywhere the corruption is all of us every single person who considers themselves an American or a patriot you have to look at what's going on in your own situation and tell the fucking truth because if you don't these people are going to push you to the edge and then they're going to take everything from you everything yeah man guys jump it on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments of that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck as we're bringing headline in we talk about it it'll get one of those two options I thought this one was pretty funny talk about some bad-ass kids but the right thing coming out at the end our thumbs up a dumb as fuck headline reads alleged flash mob kids busted by own parents in 7-11 robbers all right let's see it so in Hollywood parents who made the difficult decision to turn their children over to the Los Angeles police department after discovering their involvement in a series of disruptive flash mob robberies and multiple 7-11 stores are receiving widespread praise Tiffany Brown local resident expressed her support for the parents actions quote they did the right thing because if you don't stop them young they could go pretty far with it she said at Tuesday's LAPD Commission meeting assistant chief Blake child confirmed that several parents surrendered 13 police stations on September 26th 28th and 29th in connection with the flash mob robberies quote on September 29th another parent turned their child in and that juvenile was also booked for robbery assistant chief child Erica community member echoed the sentiment quote the parents totally did the right thing by turning their kids in you've got to teach them young about what's right and what's wrong license clinical you should be teaching them before they're old enough to rob a 7-11 license clinical psychologist doctor David Swanson suggested that these parents likely acted out of desperation knowing they had just knowing they had just lost control of their kids quote when your kids are riding bikes running into stores stealing stuff it's clear you don't have a handle on the situation Swanson said these parents may fear that if this behavior continues it could escalate into more serious crimes leading to prison time here is a clip of those those robberies here so this was blasted all over social media and then I guess the parents of these uh sure it was better quiet a few of them recognize little little badasses and turn their asses into the police um and so that's into the L.A. they ought to continue saying the LAPD continues to ask for public assistance and identifying other teams involved quote even if you're young and think this is something fun to do with friends it's wrong Erica said it's better that parents reinforce that at home where you learn where you first learn what's right and wrong the teams were released back to the parents custody dr swanson added as uh that as miners the records would be sealed when they reach adulthood um it's uh he agrees it's better to address the issue now before it escalates Andy what do you got on this little little parent accountability i like to see it yeah i love seeing it but i mean this is why you got to beat your kids asses sometimes instead of just fucking putting them in the corner or telling them you know whatever they're like you know clearly for the last 20 years the the be a nice person and be your kids best friend parenting strategy has fucking failed okay this is what we see we see this everywhere it's happening everywhere and yes kudos to the parents who are taking accountability and saying hey this is wrong i'm not with this and teaching their kids a lesson that's a huge deal and needs to be happening across the board what those parents are doing is the same thing i'm saying to everybody else in all the agencies and all the police departments and all the sheriff's departments and all the the board of patrol you guys have to be standing on what you know is right not what you are being told what to do because that money that you are afraid of losing is going to be gone anyway so if we don't stand up now and blow the whistle on all of the shit it's not going to matter anyway guys so we need more of this we need more people standing up doing the right thing doing what they know needs to be done and that's sitting at home conflicted and and by the way when you're an old man and you're getting ready to die these situations that you refuse to speak up on are going to be the things that you regret for your entire life okay don't let that be you part of the reason i do what i do and say what i say is because i don't want to be the person when i'm getting ready to kick it that has to say fuck dude i was a pussy when it counted i was a pussy when it counted i should have said this i'm not going to be that person no matter how hard it is bro i'm not that's not what i'm going to do and i wish everybody would felt that way and would have some courage and stand up and talk about what is actually happening in some of these organizations that is corrupt that you see it's because do lots of people see this shit i mean dude we have a lot of people that reach out to us and they're like man you know this is going on but i can't say anything you can say something is it going to hurt is it going to be uncomfortable yeah temporarily but that temporary discomfort is going to bring long-term fulfillment and long-term benefit to you bro you'll be a hero dude take not only to to everybody else but to yourself at least yeah so like guys we have to start telling the truth and i will say this our our audience has woken up all right like compared to even two years ago or a year ago now i'm seeing it everywhere all right and i i think that's great uh but guys the guys in authority these guys have to start standing up and speaking truth man you know and otherwise the rest of the country is going to fall you know turning those tyrants in bro yeah turn them in and i think these parents are they're what parenting is supposed to be you know uh you know when i was a kid dude i got my ass beat that's real talk like you know people some people hear that and they're like oh well you know that's abuse you know it's it's not fucking abuse i learned what the fuck to do and what not to do i learned what happened and there were repercussions if i did things that were wrong and these kids these days don't learn that because they have all these feel good do good people in the world that are saying oh you can't ever do this or you can't punish them this or you'll cause this now this is what happens with that parenting strategy as a word this is what happens you end up with kids robbing stores you end up with kids walking down the street punching random people in the face you end up with kids cutting off their private parts and mutilating themselves because they have no fucking leadership at home that has to change so i appreciate what these parents are doing but reality is you can't wait till they're 16 years old start doing it yeah it's true so it's it's a good start it's a good start what's this flash mob okay you know upro we're the fucking do these people have finally time to do this shit with the flash mob so the flash robs any of it yeah yeah like you had too much time you should be doing something bro like if you're if you're meeting up to do a flash mob dance or whatever like and then you're complaining about why your life's not turning out is because you're spending time doing dumb shit doesn't mean anything i mean i've you i've you seen one in person like a flash mob i've seen one in my life you probably did it well i wouldn't know i wouldn't a part of i wish i would look look look i'm not trying to be the scrooge all right the shit's kind of fun i get it it's but i'm just saying man yeah what my point is is that people spend too much time on shit that doesn't matter and too little time on shit that does matter and that's why our country is fucked up that's where that's real that's real well guys Andy that's all i got man all right guys that's the show we'll see you again tomorrow don't be a hell sure sure
