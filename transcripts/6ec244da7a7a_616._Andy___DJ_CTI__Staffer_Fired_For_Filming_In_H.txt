You'll notice I don't run ads on the show I financed the show myself I pay all these fine gentlemen to help me put on the show out of my own pocket and the reason I do that It's because I don't want people to tell me what the fuck I can and can't say and I'm also not gonna lie to you about products I do or do not use if I ever did decide to do ads that would have to be shit that I actually loved I think you guys know that So anyway exchange for that I ask very simply that you share the show, okay? We're getting throttled. We're getting banned. We're getting fucked with all the time everywhere and you guys see it And the message doesn't get out unless you share it So if you think we bring good message if it makes you think it makes you laugh if it gives you a good perspective It's something that you think needs to be said, which are the things that we try to say Do us a salad and share the show. Don't be a hoe show the show. Hey, what's up? It's growing all me. Oh not much Well, we got some interest in topics. I got a few topics on my mind. Oh, yeah, let's get started with those How about topic number one? Quit listening to fucking idiots on the internet, okay? Who? Do not have the life that you want all right? I was just talking to a bunch of my friends this morning about this There's so many people on the internet now who are talking about all these hacks and all these things that they do and all these routines and they have all these things that you know, they're doing for themselves and every two weeks It's a new thing they're doing that you should do and they're saying it was such confidence and you know They've got podcasts headphones and a microphone now so that's they must be telling the truth. This will listen dude 99% of what you see on the fucking internet is bullshit, okay? And most of the people that you look at and you adjust your life according to their advice Most of those people don't even live that shit in the first place themselves All right, and certainly if their shit works so good they wouldn't be having to Change it up every two weeks and tell you about the new thing they're doing the reason they're telling you about the new thing They're doing is because a the shit they were telling you to do that they were so confident about doesn't actually work and Be they're trying to build a personal brand based around what's hot right now? so can we please just get a little bit more awareness before we I'll feel like shit because We don't live the the life of wholesome or balanced or Structured the way that somebody on the internet says like dude Let's fucking stop the shit like this should be common sense, but it's not common sense You know, I talked to so many people on a regular basis who feel like they're doing it wrong who feel like they're fucked up Who feel like because they don't do what this person says or bro? If you sit there and look at what everybody's doing and you think that's you're denying yourself your own gifts and your own identity Or in your own development in the first place because you're too busy trying to be like what everybody else is doing You can't even figure out what the fuck's going on with you. So like dude, let's use some common sense here Okay, if they're not living the life that you want and I mean the real life that you want I don't mean the internet life that they tell you they have I mean the real life They're not living that life stop fucking listening to them if they don't have that area of expertise figured out The one they're trying to teach you don't fucking listen to them and pay attention Okay, a lot of this shit is flash marketing bullshit And I see so many people and talk to so many people who feel like they're ruining their lives because of the information on the internet The information overload on the internet coming from other fuckers that don't have a figured out Okay, no none of these people have a figured out guys There's nobody that has a figured out. Okay, I don't even have a figured out. I got little parts of it figured out but Let's let's fucking like look at this, okay, and stop driving ourselves crazy and start listening to people who whose lives we want Not these people who pretend on the internet. I mean holy fuck dude It's like common sense man, and it's like the disease. So that's topic number one. You know topic number two I love how many of these fat Disgusting lazy jobless men Go out here on the internet and dog single mothers Yeah, right like that's a new thing the new thing is to dog out single moms bro and say they're worthless and they have no value And you know, they're a low value woman because they have a previous relationship and have children with a with a Listen That is fucking bullshit. Yeah, okay, and most of the men saying this shit are fucking low-life pieces of shit All right, and that's just these are two things that I noticed on the internet more and more and more that bother me Like this do my mom's awesome, bro Dude listen dude because they talk about these these high High this high-value man shit, right like to run too far. Which dude it is true Like you should work to be a high-value man But like most of the men I see saying this dumb shit They're not they're not even high value. No, you know what I'm saying They're they're also podcasters. We have a head. Yeah, it's the same fucking people. I just killed two two with one stone, you know, but like dude I Get so tired of the judgment on the internet as a whole, you know what I'm saying like it's just everything is judged to this maximum degree nobody can be You know just normal. Yeah, like just be cool man. Mm-hmm You know I agree man It's like you're you have to be see they're gonna go extreme extreme this way or extreme this way I saw this meme today and and it So I was actually I was looking at Sean Whalen's story and somebody had asked him and his in his story This she said I'm a single mother and I feel like nobody had nobody sees any value in me I don't have any value because of they're all they're talking about is high value women Like dude, I think that's fucked up that the internet makes people feel that way like you feel like because you had a relationship Earlier in life now you're like some sort of like trash. Yeah, it's bullshit And it's by a bunch of dudes who are literally fucking hunks of shit themselves who can't fucking pay their own bills We're fat as fuck who don't like stand for anything they go you know what I'm saying like Let's let's look at ourselves before we start pointing the finger who's got value in who anybody?

I just got to like the day one to win as much as I want to win Like that's that's it dude. These people are the matter. Yeah, this whole thing with like I like this guy So you like someone so little that you're willing to sacrifice your own fucking livelihood and your own existence and your own quality of life That's do you yeah That's stupid. It's a low low IQ fucking thought Yeah, guys tell us what you two guys think on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments hashtag bring back decency Let's know what you guys think Is on the ballot it is Yeah, absolutely is but uh, but that being said, man. That's right. It is. It is. It is. It's fucking right. It is. Oh, it is Yeah, yeah But that being said man, let's keep this cruise moving. We got cruise the comments Uh, this cruise the comment uh comes from d more empty Uh, he says I always listen to this during my a m lift y'all get me fired up I'm handing out wholesale fuck you today. Keep the truth coming guys really. F. It's true. A. Hey, here's some business advice You know wholesale fuck you. It's rare You charge a premium for that shit premium product. Yeah Now when everybody fucking now when everybody's doing fuck you you can wholesale it uh, but right now it's still a premium Stop giving it away free shipping or no Depends Depends I'm fucking loving it though, man. Yeah, I really do like there is something to be said about the That that feeling inside a culture that's coming back with the fuck you Yeah, dude, it's great because that's how it's supposed to be. I don't give a look bro Here's what it comes down to and this is a good lesson Not just for our country and our culture, but also as a person, okay When you dictate who you are and how you feel based on someone else's opinion of you You were always going to have anxiety. You were always going to have stress Part of the reason that depression and anxiety are so prevalent in society is because people are so afraid to be who they actually are and say what they actually feel And tell what they actually observe to be true because they're afraid of judgment Everybody out here is walking around on eggshells because of a but a small percentage of fucking assholes Who have figured out that if they leverage our own guilt against us and call us names that we will be like oh And give them the power that time is over. We're not giving you the power anymore So it is time for fuck you and the reason it feels so good when people say fuck you is because we haven't had that in like a decade But that attitude is what America's been founded on I'm gonna do me. I'm gonna do me the way I feel is best for me and my fucking family And I'm gonna speak the truth. I'm gonna say what I observe I'm gonna say and if I'm wrong I say I'm wrong But at the end of the day I'm not this or that or this just because you don't agree with whatever I say Some things are facts some things are actually things that should be talked about so we can solve the problems I mean do there's so much into this why everybody feels this way and the reality is at the end of the day if you say fuck you It's like the best therapy you could get. Yeah, you know, I'm saying like I fuck you a day keeps the liberals away. That's right. I fuck you a day keeps you saying too, bro Like a lot of the reason people feel so bad about themselves is because they take all the shit from people They should be taking it from yeah, that's a fact. Yeah, like pretending look dude. I'm not pretending. I will not pretend I'm not pretending. I'm not gonna pretend that a man is a woman and a woman is a man. I'm not doing it It's not gonna happen. I'm not doing it and and if you want to call me whatever names you want I don't give a fuck because at the end of the day that's my Assessment of my own value and integrity as a human being. I can't respect myself lying Because it makes you feel better, okay? So that's not just an innocent polite courtesy thing It's actually something that makes me discredit myself on the inside by admitting something that isn't actually true Okay, and then on top of it I'm reinforcing to these other people that If they bitch and cry and attack people enough they get their way Which is why we have the problem that we've had in this country So the reality is if you want to feel good about yourself be honest Say what you know tell the truth and if people don't like it don't give a fuck That's real shit. You'll feel a lot better dude. You won't need all this fucking 47 morning routine shit because you're gonna be like yeah, well, it is what it is I don't give a fuck and send the hearing rooms and yeah dude I I'm done fucking around like work at real a f's gonna get real real like real real like when we first started it Bro, we were kind of being polite, you know, I was kind of like all right. This is the truth guys, but we have to look at it This no fuck fuck that And fuck these people that's how I feel it makes me feel better. We appreciate you D more.

Yeah, we'll trade trade van goes in Cooper comes out I'm with it. All right. I'm with it guys are third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads US to suspend rail operations on the southern border due to migrant search Um, so this is CNN and of course, you know, they fudge numbers, but that's okay guys because I got you We got the real facts and data here for you Um, but you as customs and border protection will temporarily suspend operations at the international railway crossing Bridges and eagle pass and they'll pass so Texas due to a surge in border crossings by migrants The agency announced in a news release Sunday the cpb said the operational closures to redirect personnel to process migrants will start mondays quote cpb will continue to prioritize our border security missions as necessary in response to this evolving situation the agency said now Border authorities apprehended nearly 3000 migrants in del Rio, Texas and around 1300 migrants in el Paso on Sunday straining federal resources according to the Homeland Security official eagle passes in the del Rio border patrol sector in the past few weeks The bi administration is closed ports of entry to either vehicular or pedestrian crossings in eagle pass, Texas, Luke, Villa, Arizona and San Yasardo, California CNN previously reported now. This is what they're not This is what they're fucking up so They're saying that in the first 14 days of December more than 37,000 migrants were apprehended in the tusson border Uh patrol sector alone, which includes Lukeville according to John um modeling The sector's chief patrol agent now You hear that number you're like oh, all right, so they are apprehending people they are arresting people But here's the facts for you guys if we go to this uh this this uh evidence-based Assessment of what's going on in the border that was just updated and released um just in this fiscal year alone That's been 2.5 million Million Encounters of migrants crossing the u.s. Mexico border 2.5 million and 2023 just in 2023 that's the same and and they're happy with 37,000 the first two weeks broke That's fucking no it's an invasion man. It's nothing. It's an invasion. They're not even trying to stop They're not trying to know but well, there are some changes though. So let's let's talk about it So we have to remember that this is intentional. Mm-hmm. You have you have the state of Arizona Katie Hobbs who in my opinion shouldn't even be the in In the position of power that she's in Saying that what they're doing is fucked up. Yeah. Well, I mean speaking to this She just she just ordered her national guard. Oh, that's why okay to go to states warning. Yeah, so I mean that's what like Is getting to a point where like it's even those who are on their team trying to play ball is it's getting to the point where it's impossible for them to Why do you think that is? I don't know I think I know they're like the citizens outcry. Yeah, I think what we're seeing is there's I think what we're seeing is the end of The end of ignorance in the beginning of awareness for people who thought they were on this team Yeah, who are no longer on that team people who are truly The of the democratic mindset or even progressive mindset Who are not in on the plan so to speak are now waking up and saying holy shit This isn't just this. This is this other thing. Yeah, which is a planned destruction of our country and so I think what we're seeing here when we see people like Hobbs and these other Democrats speak out against the Biden administration is not just the Biden administration being abandoned I think it's bigger than that. I think it's they understand That what's happening is happening intentionally and they don't want to be a part of it because they understand what that is and what that is is treason Could do you think it part of that because I see I feel like what Hobbs that her situation might be even different than that But I think what she realizes is that The Accountability's coming and I think what she's seeing is that like the end like like The the public's acceptance of these countless lies the destruction of our country are our economy, right like She's realizing that she's on the losing side that she think a lot of you know, I'm saying like she was leveraged to be there I mean, dude, she stole her she stole her election from I think a lot of these people realize from Kareela You know, I'm saying so 100% okay. Well, here's my opportunity to jump ship You know, I'm saying and though the welcome me with open arms. Let me just yeah, it's my only chance. Yeah, we're gonna see this right Like the rats always jump off the ship when they realize it's actually gonna sink. Yeah So I think it's gonna be a lot more than I mean I agree and I think the only way to to truly tell if that's like how true that statement I just made was or is is gonna to it's gonna see how the how they react to her you know I'm saying like what the Biden administration does to her uh In response, you know, I'm saying like will they throw her into the bus? You know, I'm saying of course. Oh the election was actually You know, I'm saying like what's gonna that or you know, they're typical playbook, which is some sort of blackmail or some sort of and like Ship from the past. Yes, right. One of her staffers might get bugfucked or something. Yeah, or you know Whatever she's done in her past them and letting that come to the surface. You know, you know That's what these people are gonna you're gonna start seeing you're gonna see people jump off the ship And then the people who jump off the ship they're gonna start being made to look like they're these corrupt You know, and they are but and all of their dirt that was previously hidden by the winning side is now going to be exposed Yeah 100% man the other cool thing about this But I also think that what you're saying is true I think that those people probably realize that there's going to be actual real accountability and they're like fuck Okay, I can either be embarrassed and sassed it up against this or I can deal with whatever the repercussions are of being a part of it which you know By all appearances it seems to be treason and treason is traditionally punished by death eventually, yeah, so Yeah, I mean here's one of the other cool things that that are happening and spinning up right now and we've talked about this on the show many times You know, and I believe the direct quote and we have to find the episode But you know, we talked like man, where are the where are the people that live in these places? Why are they not standing up? Like where are the people of Texas not standing up and securing their own border like we're and we're finally starting to see some of that This headline comes out as border extremism goes mainstream vigilante groups take a starring role So this article just came out and there's now a bunch of groups that have spun up along the border in different locations in Texas something there is on Some even in Florida that are now standing up and trying to take back their communities and Uh, this article is kind of you know, it's weirdly written, but I'll just read a little bit of it It starts off saying the border wall arches over the steep slopes of the San Loren desert a vast row of brown still slats jump Judging up from the rugged terrain rippling with heat in the afternoon sun a man dressed head to toe when camouflage and carrying an ar style rifle huff sim puffs his Way up one heel and scans the horizon over the radio is comrades in herison aboard a recon a civilian patrol group report finding 31 migrants near a spot where they Uh, where the wall abruptly ends the remote area west of Nogales, Arizona called the California Gulch Is where fencing built during the trump era gives way to miles of open but unforgiving wilderness Um, and she's talking about this gentleman here. He's leading uh this gentleman here his name is Tim Foley is his name he's 64 years old and he's leading this uh this group of uh civilian patrols vigilancy patrolman um and uh, you know he he's he's going through it you guys His guys are all well supplied and resourced and um, they're starting to take back their own little communities man Um in Texas. Let's head on reads uh, Texas will begin arresting migrants under log governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign Monday, which is today is the time of recording. So um, Texas will begin authorizing state and local police to arrest migrants believe to be in the state illegally In granting state judges the power to order them to return to Mexico under a new law governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign Monday in Brownsville So there's the it appears to be some things changing Personally, I feel like this this law or whatever he's trying to trying to sign today is about two years too late Of course, but it's a great start I mean, you know, you could have been doing this. It's out of bus and farther into our country No shit, but anyone what do you got on this? I don't know I think it appears to be what you're saying I think what we're seeing is a response to them actually identifying what the public temperature really is and understanding that the public temperature is infuriating infuriated or whatever however we want to say that at What's happening and um You know, it's a it's a ratch jumping off the ship As opposed to taking a stand when a stand needed to be taken and while I agree that these are Moves that should be made these are moves that should have been made a long time ago and uh Yeah, I mean, I don't know why they weren't other than these people are part of the plan or part of And and now they're trying to save their ass. Yeah, you know, I don't know. I thought this was a pretty interesting um Stat here if you guys look at this chart if you're watching on youtube check this out This is basically showing uh the migrant encounters at and between ports of entry by country of origin So where these illegal migrants are coming from in 2020 It was roughly about 11 to 12 percent of migrants that were coming in were from other countries right the vast majority almost 90 percent Where either from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras and you jump to 2023 We're now almost half of these migrants that are coming across illegally are from other countries Um and less than 50 percent are from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras Just some interesting numbers man. Just to look at the transition here and you can't like I don't I don't feel like I don't know anybody that couldn't look at this and see well Know what you're saying what 2023 actually says is that More than half of them are from other countries less than half are from Of the total whole of 100 percent right of encounters are from Mexico, El Salvador So Mexican Mexican El Salvadorian, Guatemala and Honduras I represent less than half of the yeah, it's on a it's on a massive decline. Yeah massive decline and all these other countries It's an invasion dude. You can't tell me otherwise. No, it's an invasion. It's fucking happening and these people see this as Their next wave of how they're going to control the population because the population has Started to understand and become aware of what we're dealing with with our government Their solution is to continue to pump these people across Hopefully get them to vote for for their side in replacement of all the minorities that they were trying to Get or have gotten traditionally that are now awake And then also put those people in our police in our military to enforce whatever they decide they want against our citizenship, so It's very dangerous and there's other options too. There's other things that could happen too These people could be part and probably are part of terrorist networks legitimately That could be activated anytime. There's all kinds of disgusting terrible terrible things that are happening right now because people have been made to be a Afraid to be called names for pointing things out And that's at the end of the day. That's the problem people are afraid to say things are right or wrong because they're afraid of getting called Fucking names on the internet for saying them or in person for saying them. So If people don't wake up We will lose this country and that's reality and I think people should really think hard about what that actually means to them And what that will mean and when I say we lose the country I don't mean Democrats and Republicans. I don't mean just Republicans. I don't mean I mean Americans are going to lose the fucking country to a bunch of fucking tyrants and a bunch of people That don't long here and aren't from here And you could say whatever you want but they've exhausted that bleeding heart, you know Message, you know, these are not political refugees. These are not these are these are not fucking families These are not these are fucking military agent men that they're bringing here for a specific purpose that is not in the American people's interest no matter who you vote for and You know I know a lot of people are waking up but dude they've already shuffled, you know, I think the last number I saw was like seven and a half or eight million people across the border since 2020 That's a lot of fucking people dude. A lot of people that's it that's That's enough people to create an entire military of those people To enough people to get votes swung a certain way I mean Yeah, and by the way they're registering these people to vote when they come across So like I'm tired of the fuckery dude. I think most people are I think we're all tired of the fuckery We're all tired of them just doing whatever they want This is a small group of powerful people the media the the far left progressive politicians These big corrupt organizations that are all tied into the world economic forum manipulating our entire globe and our entire world and unless people rise up against them and resist at every contention point They're gonna get their way And it's a big problem for everybody else So You know people need to really try to recognize what's happening is this is not just conspiracy These are coordinated actions taken by some of the most powerful people on the planet To make life and quality of life harder for you Uh and better for them And that's that's it. That's what it comes down to and and they tell you that you know Your local entrepreneur the rich guy is the fucking guy doing it. No, he's not He's in the same boat as you Like these are these are the richest people in the world doing this these people are saying they're They're preaching you about climate change while they fly And private jets to Davos every single year and have meetings about these things You know like these are these are people that tell you decency But then like promote every form of degeneracy no demand And say it's normal these are people who talk about you know Democracy but then in every single action or behavior they have it represents communism Because that's what they mean when they say democracy when they say democracy They don't mean what you think of democracy. They they mean communism So I mean there's all these things you know they talk about you know It's not your way of life. It's their way. That's right. That's right And you're going to adjust and you have the CEOs of some of the biggest firms in the whole world saying that they're going to force behavior They're going to force this behavior through through the companies Like dude is just it's fucked up man Yeah, so guys tell us what you guys think of this conversation jump down in the comments below Let us know hashtag shut it down and tell us what you guys think So that being said let's get into our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck And I got a good one for you Oh, this one's good. Okay. All right. Here we go So uh Thumbs up and dumb as fuck as we bring your headline up to talk about it to get one of those two options So that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads Sciences claim They've had a 20 minute conversation with the whale And say it could pave the way for conversations with aliens someday Okay Let's hear this So it might sound like a scene out of out of avatar too, but scientists claim it's now possible To have a conversation with the whale following a 20-minute chat with a humpback whale in southeast Alaska The 38-year-old whale named twain spoke quote-unquote First-wing How they name twain man Y'all diggers got some crew Oh Where's his dad Bro I think they mean mark twain oh Oh Bro I know it's way All right, all right, let's just keep going Oh But it was so so twain Spoke with the researchers from the scti institute and uc davis by responding to a pre-recorded contact call This marks the first communication between humans and whales in their own language according to the team Looking ahead the researchers say the conversation could pave the way for interactions with aliens in the future In the study, researchers from SETI studied how wells communicate in the hopes of developing intelligence filters as part of the search for alien life. The science is broadcast a type of greeting call called a whoop drop through underwater speakers. When the call was played through the water, Twain approached the boat and responded with a greeting call of our own. Importantly, the scientists found that Twain was changing the frequency of our own calls in response to the researcher's broadcast. Here's the audio. I'm curious, I flew you. What's it say? Yeah, I think it's got some freedom. Man, listen, this is my thing. If we're going to be doing some technology, let's do some useful shit. I'm not trying to talk to him, bro. I'd rather talk to dogs. First of all, how do they know what the fuck it's saying? I just told you what I say, lady. It's like these ghost shows. All these ghost shows that are like, yeah, this is what it means when it does this. How do you know that? How do you know that? Typically, spirits do this. How do you know that? Is there a fucking spirit school that I don't know about? You know what I'm saying? I like the ghost shows because some of them, they got some crazy shit on them. Most of the time, these little experts they plug in and try to talk about it. You don't know any more shit than we know. You don't fucking know shit. They're like, oh, yeah, typically what you really do is this and this and this and this. This is how they respond. If you do this, it'll attach itself to your underwear and you can't get rid of it. It's like, dude, shut the fuck up. What are the whales and the water? What the fuck are they playing? They're not even speaking whale back. You know what I'm saying? I mean, I imagine being one of the whales. That's what I'm saying. You're in the water and all of a sudden fucking, you start hearing somebody talk to you. He's probably going back to the other whales and they're being like, dude, you're fucking crazy. You belong in the same town. You're in the same place with voices. Yeah, you hear fucking voices. What the fuck is wrong with you? Yeah. These are first, then these are also. This is exactly what I would imagine. These are the experts. Yep. Yeah. This is exactly what I'd imagine. Bro, imagine talking about this all day long and this, no, hold on. And this being your only fucking thing you talk about. What did you do today? I dropped the speaker in the water, man. I fucking turned on the water. I turned on the Wap Thump. You know, this whale came over. We had a full blown conversation, dude. Yeah. It was amazing. I said he's looking for his father. He said, where's the krill? I don't know, man. I just think we probably fucking pay those motherfuckers with our fucking tax dollars, too. Yeah. I get into you. There's some grants. Yes. There's some grant that's going. This is what people get to do, bro. They get to come up with some bullshit. They get to go pretend like they give a fuck. They get to go out on a boat all day and fucking watch the whales and smoke weed. And then fucking get money for it from us. He's gonna make it high. Yeah, he's high right now, dude. That motherfucker's perma-high. That guy smokes so much weed he's never now high. Fucking look at him, dude. You know, I'm just saying, like, these, that's the, that's their game in the system, dude.

Yeah, I think I'm gonna go dumb as fuck on this one. Yeah, I don't like it either. Yeah. I just don't like the people to do this shit. Like, I don't like the people who like game the system to pretend like they're doing something that matters. And they're gonna fucking solve these massive problems in society on our fucking tax dollar. Like these will be the, these people will be the reason why we can't bring Bluetooth speakers to fucking beaches anymore. Who knows? Somewhere down the line. Yeah. Whatever. Yeah. Double as fuck. Yep. Alright. Dio, say it. That's all I got. Alright. Don't be a hoe. Go to the show. We're from sleeping on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck a boat. Fuck a stove. Counting millions in a coke.
