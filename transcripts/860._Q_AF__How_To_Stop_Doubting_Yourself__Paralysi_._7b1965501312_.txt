have a show for today do have a good show man and I do got some good ones for you not surprised let's make some people better today guys Andy question number one hey Andy hi so I came to follow you a little over a year ago and dude seriously thank you I am 25 years young but I'm not doing a finding myself in a van thing however I am committed to just becoming the version of myself I know that I can become but here's the thing I second guess every decision I make even when my gut tells me something I doubt myself and overanalyze I want to be able to trust myself and my instincts uh instead of always looking to others for some sort of reassurance I know you consistently speak on the importance of building and having self confidence but I guess specifically how do I build that confidence in my own judgment okay well first of all you're 25 bro you you don't have a ton of decision real adult decision making experience uh let's be real you know and when you don't have all that experience it's natural to second guess yourself so we all go through this it's not just you we all go through a transition period uh where you know all the way up until maybe we're done with college we're kind of getting told what to do and how to do it um and then you know some people younger than others there's always you know nuance but typically when we are in our young to mid-20s we are learning how to make decisions feeling the consequences of those decisions and either building up our trust in ourselves or taking away and what I would say to you is that the fact that you're aware of this is a huge advantage because most people aren't aware they just continue to make bad decision after bad decision after bad decision meaning they're making whatever decision they need to make that makes them feel good now they don't understand delay gratification they don't understand thinking ahead of what the decision will actually produce down the road and the fact that you're aware of this at a young age is really really really really good it's a good indicator that you are going to build a very good skill set of making the right decisions when these decisions are to be made so you have to understand that your confidence and your belief in yourself is really only going to come after you've made good decision after good decision after good decision and then a few bad ones too right and then we learn from those lessons and then we become either very confident or we we stay unaware we don't get really beat down because the people who continue to make wrong decision after wrong decision they see life as something that's like happening to them like they are not thinking like I'm making this decision in November and then in December my life sucks they're not understanding that okay they're unaware so making bad decisions doesn't necessarily destroy someone's confidence it destroys their life so the fact that you are understanding that there is a decision to be made their consequences down the road that's a great thing but the way you're going to become confident in is by making the best decision that you can make now and then understanding you know what the result of that is with your own experience and as you get older and as you go through this process you will become more and more and more confident in your decisions and that goes for both your life and your career whatever else you're working on you know there's still times in my life knowing what I know about business you know where I'm like fuck I don't know fuck I don't know like what should we do you know and then we work out the options and we make the best decision and when we make the best decision that doesn't always mean it actually is the best decision sometimes you just have to make a decision see what happens and then make an adjustment which I would say is really how things actually work in life you know not many times have I made a decision when I was young that worked out exactly the way I thought it was going to work out what it did was it directed me in a right direction and then when I went down that path I had to make multiple pivots as I went down the path to really get where I was trying to go but the important thing the real important thing here is not even the question that you ask it's that you have to make a fucking decision okay most people will analyze and analyze and analyze and analyze and they never choose and because they never choose life passes them by and then they end up at you know 50 years old saying could a wood a shitter no you should just pick some shit and whatever happens happens you learn you know and and then you apply again and so that's the process of of development you know we make the best decision that we can make right now we listen to our gut we look at the facts we make it on logic there's very few decisions in life that should be made around emotion we make those decisions we go down the path we figure out if it's if it's working or not and then we make pivots and that's just how it goes man and I know that like you guys consume all of this information all day on Instagram from all these people who legitimately haven't done a mother fucking thing telling you how to do things and what the their philosophy is or this or that or this I would encourage you to listen to what people say who have actually accomplished what it is you want to do and live the kind of life that you want to live and ignore all these theoretical bozos on the internet who honestly don't know shit because if they did they would be not just writing memes on the internet okay um so make the decision make it the best you can go down the path when you recognize that the decision is not working which you have to be patient you make a pivot or you make a complete different directional change you don't make a complete different directional change until you've tried multiple pivots and you realize this isn't going to work right like a lot of people will ask me they say well when should I quit when should I quit my business you know my I've got this product look dude if you if you go if you go down the path and you figure out for real that that product is not going to get you where you want to go meaning you can't scale it there's no demand for it it's not a good strong product eventually you got to find a new product or you're just going to be trying to stick a square peg in a round hole it does not work so there are times that I don't talk about this very much but there are times when you have to make complete directional changes the reason I don't talk about it very much is because most people think that that happens soon when in reality you have to go down the path and try all the different routes it's kind of like a mouse and a mate it makes all right like you're like oh I know the cheese is over that way so I'm going to fucking go this way that didn't get me there I'm going to go this way that didn't get me there and then I'm going to find the way to the fucking cheese yeah and like if you don't go through that process with your product to the point where you have a really good understanding of why it's not going to work not just your emotional beliefs or your frustration or your anger or your impatience meaning you logically can say I there's not a market for this it's not going to be scalable it's not going to work out the way I want then you have to make a change and that goes for anything and you can plug product in with relationship you can plug product in with fitness okay you got to figure the fuck out and if here's what I say if one person's done it you could probably do it too so the decision making process and having confidence in that is is something it's one of those things that you have to do your best and work out the nuances to get where you're trying to go and after you do that enough and you make enough good decisions you'll start to trust yourself and you'll say I know how to make the right decisions I love it yeah I mean you talk like I mean it sounds like a lot of this is just being able to you know go through the time to build that perspective yeah absolutely is the important yes like my decision making ability now versus when I was 25 is you know the difference between you know starting at zero and and being you know an expert you're running circles around that guy oh dude no doubt because I have already made all the mistakes like dude if you're trying to get somewhere and you know like if I'm trying to get from here in St. Louis to LA and and over the last 20 years I took every mother fucking road well you know and then you ask me when I'm 20 years later you say how to get there I'm gonna say right like that that's that's the road right there don't go down this road yeah this fucking on by the way this ties into why it's important to learn from people who have had real business experience not just built real things but built real things in different environments you know like I was pre-internet then we were right when the internet came then we were when social media came then we were through the 2008 financial crisis then we went through fucking COVID now we're going through AI revolution like bro I've been through all that shit and we're still here we're still going there's a lot of valuable information most of it that I can provide that none of these other motherfuckers can see what I'm saying so it's really important that you know I'm not saying you just have to listen to me but I am saying that whoever you listen to needs to have been through all of those things because dude the real truth about being successful is the ability to adapt quickly right the ability to pivot quickly when things happen and you know that's decision making for sure like last little piece on this on actually very like very simple question here you know when it comes down to to decision making I guess what's one thing if there's an equation to decision making right the perfect equation what's one thing that is not in that equation usually emotions okay let's let's talk about it look there's certain ways there's certain times in your life we're making an emotional decision is okay all right but most of the time you want to eliminate emotions from the situation um for example you know I like cars so people will say well you don't fucking need those no shit I don't need those cars motherfuck I don't need a car I live four miles from work I could write a fucking bike okay but the experience that I get from the cars adds to the quality of my life okay so I am willing to invest money because my cars appreciate for the most part into that quality of life experience which is tied into my emotions right if I was unemotional about that decision I would write a bike because I could legitimately write a bike or if I maybe I could write a motorcycle or a fuck whatever right a scooter like I could if you're talking practicality you're correct I don't need any of those cars but it's fucking cool to have them okay and it makes my life more enjoyable to me I like driving I like performance driving I like knowing about cars I like feeling good when I pull up somewhere that I'm getting out of some cool shit that shit makes me feel good and you could say whatever the fuck you want I'm honest with myself enough to understand that so that's an emotional decision that makes my life better where you live people will say well you know you need to when you're young it's very important to make the correct logical decision about where you decide to live because you are working on accumulating assets and wealth for later in your life when I got to 40 years 38 years old I bought my dream house which is the house I live in now and it's fucking amazing it's probably like real talk it's probably one of the nicest properties in the whole fucking world okay it's a fucking real compound do I need that no but I love it because you know what I spend a lot of time there I spend most of my time either here or there and by the way did I need to build out this headquarters to look the way it looks no but I have to spend a lot of time here and I want to be fucking cool okay so those are emotional decisions that don't necessarily make financial sense all right for the amount of money that I put in my house I'm gonna get my balls kicked in when I sell it yeah it's not gonna happen but I don't care I don't care because I've made enough money in my life to not have that make a difference on what I actually want so earlier in life it's important especially to make logical decisions I would say under 40 years old logical logic logic logic and unless you're earning so much money and and I was in my earlier 30s then it didn't fucking matter okay but you shouldn't be stretching you understand right so we you know when you get a little older and you get some financial power and maybe a little extra it's okay to make decisions that are emotional if they make happier as long as you're aware that's it you have to be aware you know like most people just aren't bro they they cannot separate a logical decision from an emotional decision in which time which is appropriate you know so it's okay to make emotional decisions when they're not gonna hurt you and then they're gonna add to your life right but until you're at that point where it's not a financial strain to live the lifestyle that you want you should live very logical and be working to maximize you know what sort of of income that you actually have live below your means make smart decisions don't go out to eat all the time drive a car that isn't the one that you actually really like to drive those are all intelligent decisions as a younger person as you get older you start to realize well fuck I'm gonna be dead the quality of my life matters as well so I want to spend a little more money on the things that I like and enjoy you know so I'm not just you know it's it's weird to me this is I see like 70 80 year old people 60 year old people 50 year old people still living completely in that logic mindset and I you know and we see them online right like um you know Dave Ramsey okay and I like Dave Ramsey but he will give you know safe safe safe safe safe this is this is well due to eventually my fuck is gonna be dead yeah like what when do they get a taste of the what they actually want all the hard work they put you see what I'm saying 100% and let's be real bro he lives he has like a fucking 500 600 million dollar fucking office park you know like Dave lives in the nice house yeah so he gets it yeah you know but I think he's saying the same thing I'm saying just a different a different way for sure you know we we make smart decisions until we are in a place where we can afford to make emotional decisions I love that I love it man that's any question number two Andy I have a strong business mindset and customers and people in general everywhere tend to like me and trust me I know I'd be excellent at owning a biz oh you and everybody else brother that big set there are a trillion different business ideas that could make make money nowadays literally a trillion I don't have a tremendous passion for anything in particular so how does someone that is experiencing analysis paralysis settle for one opportunity and state of term to make money at all how do you know you didn't choose the wrong opportunity when the biz gets turbulent and bail on it I try not to be a hoe but hey old habits die hard okay well let's just break this down you don't know if you're gonna be a great business operator you have no fucking idea how old is that person didn't say okay it doesn't matter you have no idea until you know all right there's been people who have all the fucking check marks and all the attributes and all the special shit and they suck okay and then you have people who are borderline special needs who create amazing crush it dude I know a guy yeah I know a guy who could not fucking read or write that because he was a he was an executor he would just go out and do shit he did not think about it and he didn't have the brain capacity to think about it okay you just did shit and he built a company that was worth $200 300 million okay now he made some other bad decisions and that guy is now in prison yeah but it didn't have to do with fraudulent business he was running a good business but my point is there's guys like that everywhere all right so just because you fucking think you can do it and just because you know a lot of like people who went to nice prestigious universities like Harvard or Brown or Cornell they think they can do it but you know what the truth is the truth is there is a lot of motherfuckers with some fancy initials behind their name that never did shit all right so I don't really give a fuck what you think you can do until you've shown me that you can do it proofs in the puts so let's let's be humble here bro yeah you're talking about the most competitive fucking game that you could possibly play all right people are trying to take the food off of your fucking table can you even handle that can you even handle knowing that can you handle the relentless pursuit that other people have of you trying to take your fucking livelihood then can you handle it for fucking thousands of people okay you can't most of the time that's why the statistics are what they are 8% of people are entrepreneurs less than fucking 1% of that 8% is actually a millionaire or successful good all right so let's clear that out now I'm not saying you can't learn it I'm not saying you can't do it I'm not saying you can learn to be great at it but I'm saying if you think you're naturally great at it you've never done shit you're fucking fooling yourself so let's address that right up front I love it secondly when you're young I believe that in the entrepreneurship stage that we are in it's important for you to try a few different things examine what it is that you're into okay you might say oh I'm not passionate about this what do you do every day what let's start there what is your daily routine like what do you do every single day I get up I brush my teeth I take a shower I go to the gym I do this I do that what's the one thing that you can't live without that you find extremely beneficial to you and your day what is it and when you identify those three or four things how could they be made better okay and start thinking like that and everything that you see like when I go to a restaurant I'm not in the restaurant business but you've been to enough restaurants with me to know exactly what the fuck I do yep I sit at the table I order the food and I say they should done this should done that should done this if these guys were doing this they'd have five times much business yeah right I fucking do that I analyze how everyone does everything and that is a trained way of thinking that I've had for many many years because who knows what kind of idea will come from that so to say you're not passionate about anything I don't even think that's true I think there's things that you are passionate about you've just not thought about how you can make them better or how you could sell them as a product and I would encourage you to do that third of all you don't have to be passionate about fucking anything you could be passionate about making mother fucking money okay but I will say this that while that is cool when you don't have any money to start making money and you say fuck I love making money you will eventually get to a point where if you are doing it just for that you will be burnt out you will hate your life you will be miserable and you will be searching for meaning and purpose and something that you do and so the reason that we recommend people be passionate about things when they start is because there is a lag time where you start the business and where it becomes successful that is very hard for people to get through and most of the time the only reason people can get through that part of the business is because they actually care about what the fuck they're doing so if you are passionate about something that you are actually building a business around your chances of sticking it out during this lag time go up right all right so and I will say this even the thing you're most passionate about over the course of time you're going to go in and out of being passionate about that there's been many times in my life where I haven't been passionate about what I do every day and then got out of that funk and got more passionate again then back and forth and back and forth that's normal and a lot of people the first time that happens the first time they lose a little they get in that one of those funks they're like fuck I don't have this passion for it anymore and then they fucking quit and they got to go start over if you just stick with it dude it'll come back so we see a lot of people fail in that regard during those those those times when we don't feel great about what we're doing and just normal don't do that um but yeah man uh if I were you instead of saying you know I'm not passionate about anything I would say well I can't I need to really examine what it is I would like to do if I only had to do this every single day of my life for free okay and I can say that like I love helping people I love people getting better I like making people better with their finances with their fitness their mindset I fuck I do this shit for you yeah you know I love this shit um so even like for me even if I if you were to ask me like what would you do every day if you didn't get paid for I would still do the same shit I'd come in here I'd help where I can I do the show and you know I I would I would find fulfillment in that yeah and so you know um when you're in the beginning stages and you can't figure out what your passion is you need to get passionate about making some fucking money and you need to save that money so that you can roll it into something that you are passionate about whenever you do become passionate about it and then you can build a business out from there I love it now you started when you were 19 yeah how many what what were some of the other I guess pathways you tried before you oh fuck you with S2 I tried to I tried to buy into this uh internet yellow pages situation which because before listen before Google there was no way to search the internet so like everything back in the day was you had to pull out a fucking phone book and you had to like look for shit you know right okay kids now can't even comprehend that there was our book that had everybody's number everybody right and in businesses it would it would be categorized yeah right it would also be sorted by their name there was a yellow pages and there was a white pages the yellow pages was sorted by category the white pages sorted by name all right and you got two for free you got one of each for free at your house every single year all right um that is crazy to think about what they did second but okay that's all here on your full on bro but but when they when the internet started to get popular Google hadn't really matured into what it is today um and there certainly wasn't AI or anything like that so this dude created this thing called internet yellow pages and he sold out franchises I tried that didn't fucking work okay I had to go door to door to businesses and try to get him to sign up for something that nobody really understood was gonna be beneficial at all yeah so that was that was a failed thing um I tried an internet dating service that was a failed thing I tried uh fucking you know what is it about taming bands or something yeah taming beds couldn't get enough money to do it uh you know painting this drive some parking lots you know could never get enough money to do that uh on our own you know I mean bro I could go on and on and on I had a different fucking thing every single year trying to build something out from the time I was eight until the time I started you know with Chris s2 right and um so none of those things was I really passionate about except the baseball card thing that I did but you know I didn't know enough about I was only like fucking ten right but um but yeah dude I mean most of the shit and by the way I still know a lot of the lessons I learned through that process which allowed me to create the retail stores which which is what bore uh first form and you know it's no different than what I tell you guys you're gonna have to go through shit I just started when I was real young yeah you know so yeah dude there's a there I mean there's a lot of shit like I did uh I didn't nightclub promotion um for uh concerts when I was in college to try and make some side money you know and that actually worked out okay I made a little bit of money doing that um to kind of float me through you know not getting paid at the stores but I mean there's all kinds of things that honestly didn't work but there's also things that could have worked had I stuck with it had I stuck with it right yeah four hundred percent man I love it man well guys let's get to our third and final question mr. Andy guys to end the question number three hey Andy so full disclosure I'm not an entrepreneur I mainly listen to you for the other good stuff on Tuesdays and Fridays when we click uh but my best friend is and he listens to the show as well um he has been in business for like four years now making uh beautiful amazing woodwork I mean like seriously amazing stuff dining tables that he sells for like fifteen thousand dollars oh really dope shit and he is crushing it here's the thing uh the dude does it all uh from the production wood procurement marketing sales inventory concept design like a thousand hats uh we've been talking more recently about him hiring employees I see how hard he works runs around like a chicken with his head cut off and I tell him all the time bro you need help uh you're going to need help many hands like in the load etc but he stands firm and says I'm good don't need him because he is being a pussy and I know he wouldn't ask can you talk some sense into him for the love of our dear lord and savior all jokes aside I don't want to lose my best friend from a heart attack because he thinks he doesn't need the help much love from Detroit well look it depends on what his operational goals are you know some people just want to be artists like what he's doing is an art to him so when we think of you know business we have to understand that not everybody's trying to be a fucking billionaire not everybody's trying to be worth a hundred million dollars not everybody's even trying to make a million dollars they're just trying to not have to work a regular job that they don't get fulfillment out of so it depends on what kind of person he is and what his goals are because if he's just a one man operation making super high quality shit you know there's a lot of fulfillment in that in fact when we went down to see Jesse James Jesse James is an artist he's in his shop doing the work himself now does he have people that do other things yes absolutely but he is an artist and I think that and I could be wrong I think that he would do the shit for free and I think he would do it on his own and do all of it on his own and I bet he did for a long time and then you know he realized hey man I want to make some fucking money doing this so they expanded into an actual company due to honestly I think he's one of the best entrepreneurs out there that doesn't get the credit for being such a great entrepreneur I mean dude he's sold fucking like a like of some sort of bolt like billion dollars were the fucking apparel off of his brand like crazy like dude he's he's crushed it but at heart he's an artist right and he loves the work and he gets fulfillment from the work and so if your friend is one of these guys he might be doing exactly what he wants if you think that he's killing himself and he's saying fuck I'm so big maybe he needs to hire you know some some executive assistant or somebody a CEO or a CEO that will run all the business affairs for him so he can focus on what he does best you know there's lots of solutions to this problem depending on where he wants to take it but I just got to be real with you I mean some of my friends who are tremendous at what they do they're just artists that makes shit to sell and they fucking love that so if he if that's where he loves leaving the fuck alone you know saying yeah but if he wants to turn that into a business that does you know 30 50 a hundred million dollars it probably could easily be done you know you could build out a few people that would handle all the logistical shit in the minutia of running a business he could concentrate on what he does he could bring in a princess to help him and maybe as it goes you know help them learn how to do similar to what he does but I also bet the people are buying these tables because he fucking does them yeah so there there's a lot of ways to scale those out but ultimately he comes down to what does that artist actually want you know you know how many great photographers I know that could be fucking worth a hundred million dollars that just don't they just do one thing or you know sculptors or fucking people that work with their hands like bro these these people are built different than than you know most people and and the truth of the matter is entrepreneurship is also a creative art that's what people don't understand it's not corporate this this this this this until you get to that fucking way up level right where you're you're managing so many people there has to be rules set in stone but small small business I think is the fun the most fun kind of business because there's you can you get to be close with all your people you know there's a common goal you get to build a strong team it's fun you get there it's not like how the fuck do I go to dinner with fucking hundreds of people you know saying like I can't do that yeah but back in the early days when there was 20 of us or ten of us yeah we fucking a whole time is awesome my favorite memories of of building the company were those days um and you know it's just all the phase of life where you're at is he said all these uh no I didn't you didn't say yeah I mean look bro if you really care about him and you really uh you know you really think you can help him why don't you draw out a little plan for him you know on how you could help him why don't you say here here's what you could do to lighten your load and and even make more money you see what I'm saying so you know not everybody who creates is an actual effective entrepreneur you know um having the business sense and the marketing ability and and the brand ability and all these things those things you know they they they're a different skill set then making a $15,000 table that's amazing yeah uh so you know maybe taking some of that profit and reinvesting into team you know will help him scale have uh less actual workload and make more money I mean that's the truth that's what you're talking about and I'm very confident that that would be the result of streamlining what he has going on so it depends on what he wants to do bro um and if he wants to make more money than that I mean fuck dude you could take that all the way it just depends on where you want to go uh so I'd start with you know him listening to what I'm saying uh you evaluating whether or not that's what he wants him evaluating if that's what he wants decide where he wants to take the business and they make a plan from there you know because dude in the early days of entrepreneurship and I see a lot of guys do this you know they're they're in that creative mode where they're creating the product and they get so busy that they can't think of how to scale the business out because they're just running the business how you say I think you've described it before is like you're working in the business and you gotta switch to working on the on the business but but when you're the one creating the shit you know like like when you're the one baking the fucking cakes and people are buying the cakes because you're baking them yeah um that's a little bit different of a situation yeah for sure you know but people do it bro like look uh Katie's pizza who I use as an example people used to go to Katie's because fucking Katie made the motherfucking pizzas right now she sells pizzas in Walmart and they're fucking amazing uh many restaurants throughout St. Louis that have a very good reputation because guess what they're good and she was able to take her culinary skill set and scale that and you could do that with your woodworking as well and it could still be you know your brand whatever that's called there's all kinds of different ways to do this bro um and the least effective ways to do it all yourself and run yourself into the dirt you know you could probably do way less work by getting a little help you'll make way more money uh and build a much more successful company without sacrificing the fulfillment in the enjoyment or the brand quality that he gets from doing it himself so it's just about what do you want yeah you know what I mean like everybody thinks that when I'm taught and I am for the most part because most people want to make as much money as they can for sure but not everybody does some people just want to make enough some people just want to improve their life and give them some more freedom uh and then they want to live their life you know and it sounds like he's not able to do that because of how busy he is with work so you know I know I'm throwing a lot of different scenarios at you but you know one of those scenarios is the right one and if you if you really think you have good ideas for your buddy uh why don't you map it out and kind of show it and say hey why don't we do it this way yeah you know what I mean yeah I love it man dude dude this is honestly I'm I get excited hearing these questions for MFCO come back hmm bro we've been recording the episodes I fucking love it like I look that's my fucking wheelhouse bro you know I've been doing something that people want to do for as long as most of them have been alive okay I I'm the dude that all these other motherfuckers out here you know are trying to pretend they are they don't have the experience they don't have the actual business the most of most of them okay um the answer I just gave like that's not an answer that you would know unless you've been through it can't pull that out so like look man um yeah I'm excited about it too uh I'm excited to really switch from bring aware we all understand I think at this point in time that the country has issues that we need to take responsibility for to fix and the next phase of making you know this country what it should be is getting the young people to understand how things actually work helping them collapse that time frame from trial and error being 10 years now because of technology instead of 20 or whatever right uh down to you know a few years you know what I mean and just help these people become independent financially become fit physically become intelligent you know because the the thing is is we have to become everything that they tell us um that we shouldn't which is you know they want to make it okay for us being fat and sitting in front of TV and then getting sick and the reason they want to do this and being poor is is for control they want us to mega consume all of their things they want us to be dependent they want us to sit in front of the TV and eat a bunch of shit so then you know uh we're not only subscribing to the data and using up all the data but then we require their medications as well um the the big food companies are propagating this you know it all ties together dude and personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion to all of this shit and part of that personal excellence is is making a lot of fucking money which is what I love to talk about I love it so I'm excited to get it going too uh and by the way if you are wanting to listen to it it's not going to be on iTunes or YouTube it's going to be on a private app that we are going to notify people through my email

all the time I'm having a lot more fun doing that but real talk dude like I love the education aspect of personal development and entrepreneurship I fucking love it it's a part of my life I'm always trying to get better and I think I think I have a duty I feel called to help these young people especially young men um make better decisions and and put themselves in a position to be successful so I'm excited about it as well 100% man it's gonna be fucking great well guys Andy that was three all right guys don't be a hoe sure sure doesn't know here shine case closed
