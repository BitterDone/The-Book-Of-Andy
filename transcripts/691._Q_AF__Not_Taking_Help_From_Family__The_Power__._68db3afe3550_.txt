What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the realist say goodbye to lies the thickness and delusions of the world. As always we start off the week with Q and a f because we're going to get better this week aren't we? So this is where you submit the questions and we give you the answers now you could submit your questions a few different ways. The first way is guys email those questions into ask Andy at 80 for selling dot com or you can go on YouTube in the comments section of the Q and a half episodes and ask your question there will choose some for the show from there as well. If this is your first time listen we got lots of new listeners listen. We have shows within the show we don't just do Q and a all the time alright tomorrow you're going to hear CTI that stands for cruise the Internet is where we put interesting topics from society and culture we speculate on what's true we speculate on what's not true and then we talk about how we that's us the people have to solve some of these problems going on in the world. Other times this week we're going to have real talk real talk just short five to 20 minutes and me giving you some real talk and then we have 75 hard versus occasionally alright I don't think we have one this week but it's an occasional episode that is where we take someone who is used the 75 hard program to get their life in order. And we bring them on the show we interview them we talk about how their life was before how it is now and how you can make the same improvements in your life using the live hard and 75 hard program now if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard it is the initial phase of live hard and you can get this program which is the world's most popular mental toughness mental transformation program you can get it for free at episode 208 on the audio feed only we've only been you doing you two for about a year. So go to episode 208 on any audio feed and you'll get that program for free there's also a book available on my website called the book on mental toughness. And that's it Andy for so calm that didn't describes the entire live hard program 75 hard plus 10 chapters on mental toughness why you need it how to use it how to make it work for you in your life and some case studies on some very famous people on how they have used mental toughness to create the life that you know them for. With that being said we don't run ads on the show you're going to notice that's a big difference between other shows I don't take money from people to do this show because I don't want people have any influence on what my opinion is going to be and what I'm going to say we talk about controversial subjects and most people are okay with that but I love it and so does DJ and so we have this little deal that we make with you guys and it's called pay the fee and what it means is you know please support my company's but it also means share the show okay we're constantly battling censorship and shadow bands and traffic brought up and things like that and if you want the message to get out we need you to share the show so that's the deal alright that's what we mean when we say pay the fee so don't be a hoe show the show. Alright so man happy Monday yeah you just yellowed on yellow yellow what I mean the hat the drink you like yellow I do I like black and yellow you look black and yellow black and I cannot stand black we know we're where everybody knows this is a show. Alright what's up dude let's go and all man not much yeah it's a it's a great Monday gotta gotta great start to the week and yeah everything is good man yeah everything is good yeah yeah alright well let's get into it you want to make some people better you want to make some people better I do you know because that's part of the equation of how we get our country back on track we have to get better as individuals yeah we have to be the opposite of what they want us to be they want us fat they want to sit they want to stupid we got to be not fat we got to be healthy we got to be intelligent they want us to hate people we can't hate people we got to love people we got to get along we got to get fine unity and that comes from personal excellence and when I say personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion it is the ultimate rebellion because it's everything that they do not want us to be and it's our job to be it and that's what this Q and A F episode is all about it's about getting better by making us better it's by becoming more personally excellent yeah well let's do it man guys Andy question number one Hey Andy my father was and still is a very successful entrepreneur here in Texas he's a great man raised me right and I was blessed to grow up in private schools play all the sports I wanted the family vacations two times a year a lot of people will call the silver spoon treatment I am 24 and I want to get into entrepreneurship myself I had a talk with my dad and he wants to foot the bill for whatever I want to do I'm sure most people would hear this and be excited the only issue is I don't want the help I spent most of my life getting the daddy's credit card treatment from everyone and I don't want that to be the narrative how would you suggest I move through this am I being dumb not to take the cap but I know he's doing this out of love because that's how he shows it or should I stick to my heart and grind it out of my own well look man I think that's a very valid question I think I totally understand where you're coming from I think it's very important to our personal identities and how we see ourselves and our self-esteem and our confidence that certain things are done on our own and when you have a situation like you have which a lot of people would kill to have right or think so yeah yeah I could certainly understand the aspect and the perspective that you're coming from of wanting to do this on your own and so there's a couple of ways you could do this one you could do it completely on your own and and dude that's great I think you can do it lots of people do it two you could let your dad advise you and you could let him help you and you could give him a piece of whatever it is as an assailant equity part so that way he's not really giving you anything he's going to earn something from it three you could arrange some sort of loan that you have to actually pay him back and to get you started and things like that but aside from all of these things okay one of the biggest blessings that I've had in my business career was that nobody ever gave me money nobody ever gave me a loan nobody ever like gave us you know a small million dollar loan no dude that's what I'm saying and now there is some help along the way in certain circumstances for sure but here's the reality okay when you have a lot of financial resources and you're just starting out you are not intelligent enough nor do you have the experience to manage that financial resource effectively and a lot of people who start in business they say oh I don't have any money oh I don't have rich parents oh I couldn't get alone nobody believes in me good because that's going to force you to learn the skills that you need to learn and no different than an NFL player or a lottery winner or someone who comes into a lot of money if you have someone invested in you in day one and you don't know what the fuck you're doing I can promise you with a hundred percent certainty you're going to squander that money and you're going to squander that money away and put yourself in a hole that sometimes you can't get out of so one of the things that I'm most grateful for is that it was so hard that first 10 12 years I learned how to manage the money that came in so when I started making money I didn't just go crazy doing shit I continued to run things and we continue to run things on a we do a lot with a little that's what we do here we live below our means we we take small risks we we have exercise every single benefit every single technique every single thing we guerrilla market we do the small things and we have the attitude that we're not just going to throw money at the situation we're going to make the absolute most of the money that we invest to get the biggest return and when you don't know how to manage the money just like I was saying with NFL people or what happens is yeah you think that you're going to buy your way to success but you can't do that okay when people get a million dollar investment they like to spend it on marketing but they don't understand that there's a time aspect and a familiarity aspect to marketing so if you go out and you spend a million dollars over the next four months thinking it's going to propel you to the promised land you're going to look at four months and you're going to be like fuck I just spent all this money I didn't really get that much out of it because you don't understand that an effective advertising campaign takes time it takes familiarity it takes people time to absorb the brand and understand what's going on see things repetitively and because you and and do there's other things too you don't know how to stack inventory you don't know how to fund your labor costs you don't know how to balance any of your balance sheet or your profit and loss you don't fucking know because you don't have the skills so there's a big lesson in this and I believe that if you want to become an effective entrepreneur long term you're going to learn most of those lessons when you have to get creative with no money and still make it work the reason that I can coach people and help people and I'm good at it and the reason that people listen to me is because I have a set of skills that most people don't have that set of skills was manufactured from all of that time that we had no resources that we had to figure out the solution anyway so if you try to jump past that point in time because you get someone to invest in you or you get someone to you know give you money in some way shape or form you're trying to skip all of these important lessons and even if you do create a scenario where you find success you're probably going to make a lot of mistakes and squander the business away because you haven't learned the skillsets needed to maintain that cash flow and be responsible with those financial decisions so that's what I would tell you I would tell you that there's if you're going to get help that helps should be minimal it should be highly advised by people who know and it should be something that you pay back so that you can maintain your sense of pride and self esteem and confidence that you did this but also you're not eliminating the process where you're going to actually learn the skill set okay so that's my take on that question I I think there's going to be situations where you might need a little bit of money to get things to move but those things like I said should be under advisement that you should seek counsel on how to do those things when you don't know and you should be very cautious with your moves in the beginning so you don't put yourself in a hole that you can't dig out of yeah do this is a super interesting perspective because I feel like nobody here is this side of of that coin you know no both people look at you know the trust fund kids or whatever you want to kind of I'm not I don't want to call those guys this but you know I'm saying like they look at kids that are brought up in way better circumstances and feel like well bro you have it easy you have everything you need not understanding that like there's probably this dilemma and a lot of these guys's heads well yeah dude and the people who grew up without that they want to be that right that's just going to solve yeah right and it doesn't yeah it doesn't if you have no resources and you have to scrape your way through and you have to get creative be thankful for that because that's what's going to build you the skill set that's ultimately going to allow you to compete when I have to compete with people people have their hands full with me do you know why because I went so long without getting any help at all and some of these guys that I have to compete with they just started out how the fuck could that guy know what I fucking know can you can no matter how much can we couldn't know it yeah okay so no matter what business I'm in no matter what industry I'm in a lot of these skill sets are applicable across different industries so if I hadn't went through that first 12 years where I was getting my balls kicked in I didn't have any money in it anybody invest I didn't have any this shit if I if I hadn't gone through that how would I be able to compete now with people like that other people who have those things so you have to understand if you build this skill set your competitors that go out and get money they're not developing the same skill set that you're developing because you're doing it the quote unquote hard way and what happens is down the road 10 years 12 years 15 years down the road they might have some success in business they might have a decent business but they have not learned the skills that you have learned so and when all things are equal in the playing field is finally equaled out you have a tremendous advantage over that other person because they got an investor or they had rich parents or they had these things okay and that's not in every case but that isn't the vast majority of cases 98 plus percent okay and that's where you want to be because you want to be successful you don't want to be mildly successful you want to kick us you want to dominate so you want to put yourself in the best position and right now your first five six ten years that's fucking training camp that's going and practicing football and doing little league and doing junior high and doing high school and developing your craft getting to college and then graduating into the game okay now if you took someone who was starting out you know at 20 years old and they happened to run a 40 yard dash pretty quick and all the that's pretty strong right and they have the best equipment and you throw them on the football field against someone who started when they were six that guy's going to kick your ass and that's the same thing that we're talking about in business so when you don't have the resources in the beginning you should actually recognize that that's a blessing that will come to fruition later down the road which will allow you to be a better competitor and probably kick people's ass it's pretty easy because they lack all those lessons I think I think that's also cool is it's an important lesson here too just in the ability to say you know like no like I don't need it you don't send like I'm being able to be that advocate for yourself right because like I mean I'm sure there was a bunch of opportunities that came your way that sounded good looked really really good that you just had to say no two for whatever reason and so maybe is this also a certain time or he's able to kind of flex that lesson and learn that lesson yeah for sure but there's also a time aspect to life you know like if you can work for two or three years and get your skill set developed or five years get your skill subdeveloped and then your dad is willing to invest that might be a good thing but definitely not from the beginning bro yeah you know people to get money in the beginning here's what they do they go out they get an office they get a cool car they fucking get a business car they put their name on the door they name the company after themselves you know which is the ultimate ego move by the way stop naming your companies after your fucking cells it's not marketable if you want to exit it okay nobody wants to buy Joe Smith's company when Joe Smith is selling the company okay so build a real brand that is bigger than yourself and and dude you know I mean the bottom line is bro this happens all the time it's reality and I've seen it and I've been doing this long enough to know that the people who grind it out are much more equipped to win than the people who were given anything and you know if you get five six years in and you have a good grasp of what's going on then you might need to seek some capital or you might need to raise some capital or you're getting investor or get a line of credit or take some debt those things can accelerate your business tremendously I never did that and that's why it's taking me so long to get here okay so looking back from where I'm at now I kind of wish that like when I was 12 13 years in I would have done some of those things because I would have been where I'm at now seven years ago you see what I'm saying but on the flip side how much better of an entrepreneur am I because I didn't you see what I'm saying and dude I would personally rather have the skill set than the fast success so that I can compete at a higher level more effectively yeah yeah that's real man this was like I like I like this question it's a good question that's cool yeah and and dude if you're one of these people who looks at other people and you think oh they're rich they don't have any problems they're dad paid for everything blah blah bro those people have their own sets of insecurity they understand most of them that like hey man I was born into this and they feel guilty you have a fucking choice and that's right and so like dude you guys who fucking say that shit to people you need to like shut the fuck up because they can't help it just like you can't help it right that you got born the shitty fucking thing yeah this one of this man I love it well guys Andy question number two let's get to it hey Andy I'm 29 and I have just started my entrepreneurial journey I've been a listener of yours for four years now and outside of the 75 hard program I think the most crucial concept you've taught has been the powerless you've taught that after you've gotten your five critical tasks done the rest of the day is yours but I feel like since I'm in the beginning stages of my business I shouldn't have any time off my question is whether or not I should be taking time away from work after the critical tasks are done or if I should go harder at pushing my business further since I'm at the beginning stages of business okay it's a good question when you say when I say the rest of the day is yours I don't necessarily mean you go to the park and fuck off yeah okay now I might do that sometimes maybe I'll go for a drive maybe I'll do something I want to do but you're correct I've been doing this 25 years okay most of the time when I finish my five lists even to this day how many days you see me leaving early okay mostly really most of the time my power list is done by noon right okay so I choose to be here and I choose to go around and even though I don't have any quote-unquote extra critical tasks I choose to have conversations and to talk to people and to help people and to dig into what they're working on and try to solve their problems because like you I want to go as fast as possible but in those situations where maybe I don't feel like doing that that day I still count the day as a win if my five critical tasks got done because those were the most important five critical tasks that are going to move me forward over the course of time so this is a way for you to break out of what they call hustle culture right where you have to work 40 hours out of 24 every single day because those people are full of shit too nobody really works like that okay they say oh I get up at 2 a.m. and I'm up to 1 a.m. and I sleep for an hour and I do bullshit bro you're a fucking liar okay and secondly like anybody that does that like if you go against me I'll fucking kill you I'll fucking kill you yeah okay with five critical tasks today because you're gonna be able to do that for a year or two years I'm gonna be able to do five critical tasks until I fucking die and these are not tasks like hey you know time I choose these are like hey call this manufacturer talk to this you know person that's gonna open up this channel of business have call this you know what I'm saying these are things that are gonna move you forward and if you do those consistently over the course of time the cake's gonna bake just fine but you here's what I don't want you to do and this is where people really fuck it up is instead of putting five on there they put 15 okay instead of like just loosely still working on the business they put 15 on there and then what happens is they get seven done right so the day is a loss because you didn't get your critical tasks done all right so the next day they put 14 on there they get six done that's a loss the next day they put 15 on there they get 11 done that's a loss and the reason that this is a problem is because every time you have a loss you're actually reducing the trust reducing the confidence reducing the belief that you have in yourself that you can actually win the day so five critical tasks are enough to build a very very very successful life and if you do that consistently you can avoid the idea that you have to work 24 hours a day and you can have freedom and you can feel good about it without feeling stressed and guilty because you know that the critical things that need to get done are done now if you want to choose to still continue to you know dream and think and work with your people and build something bro fucking have at it dude I love what I do I love to work I'm usually on the phone till 9 10 11 o'clock at night not because it's on my list of critical tasks but because I enjoy it right and so I don't necessarily you know just check out after my five are done but I do allow myself to do that if I want to do that at those times which gives me a sense of balance it gives me a sense of freedom it gives me a sense that I'm not working as hard as I actually am and my life is still moving forward day by day by day you know this success is very very very simple it's very simple okay it is the matter of winning one day and then the next day and then the next day and then the next day it is one win at a time one day at a time one week at a time one month at a time and you accumulate that over the course of a year you know good things start to happen and so if you win enough days you win the week if you win enough weeks you win the month if you win enough months you win the year if you win enough years guess what you win you win your life all right and that is a very simple very honest very true fail safe system to getting where you want to go it's the only system that I've ever seen that I believe if you execute is completely foolproof I believe that if you execute the powerless properly you cannot fucking not get where you want to go you can't miss I think it's a systematic way to guarantee success and if you want to know what the powerless system is it's a free system that I created back in 2000 that I used to build my entire life and I started talking about on the podcast in 2015 and it's something I've used my entire life it's a huge tool and you know to to this guy's credit yeah it's probably the most powerful system that you could use for personal production and you know 75 hard live hard is a different kind of development process but yeah these are two effective systems that guarantee success if you execute them properly so go to episode 16 on the audio feed get it for free there's also a powerless journal on my website you can buy and start using it yeah because it fucking works now let me actually this because you know you you said you've been using the system since it's fucking like since you started in business yeah and so like that's a long time it was like 2001 or two when I when I started using it yeah I can't remember it he does a long time ago now you know I get it yeah getting up there I know I fucking know you don't tell me fuck you you should feel what it's like for me to move around yeah no I want to ask you though because you know I think I think I like the the mindset this guy has right like you know he's saying he's early in business and you want to make sure the business drives the success and succeeds now let me ask you this for let's say you have an entrepreneur who's same situation same boat and like and guess what I get they're getting their five critical tasks done is there such a thing is also you know you get your five critical tasks done and then the rest of the day you're doing five critical fuck ups that's almost erasing that progress you just made can we talk a little bit about that yeah I mean that's definitely a possibility but it's also a possibility that the five original critical tasks are wrong as well so yeah that's part of the problem you know like we talked about a minute ago with this guy getting funding for his business yeah like if you don't know what the critical tasks are to get where you want to go and you're putting the wrong ones down and you're not going to get there so you have to have enough critical thinking and enough foresight and enough ability to deduce from the end result that you're going for back down to individual actions right yeah so you want to get here in the next 10 years you want to be here what's it going to take for you to get there and you backtrack that out and then you start chunking those down into you know yearly parts of the puzzle and then eventually daily parts of the puzzle and what you'll find out is that what you think will take you 10 years if you execute a plan like this will take you much less because a lot of the things that we think need to happen are these big elaborate things but it's not really that it's one or two phone calls and then those people help you get those things done and they happen very fast so when you actually do this when you actually think about where you want to go you chunk it down into you know the steps needed to get there and then you take those steps and you chunk them down even further back all the way down to daily actions you know what you're going to find out is how far you can go and how fast you can go is actually a much faster rate than what you thought before so yeah you have to be able to break that down into the daily tasks otherwise you don't know if you're doing the right ones and then a part of it is you are going to pick the wrong ones sometimes and sometimes you're going to pick the wrong ones you're going to work on something you're work on something you're work on something and then you're going to figure out oh this isn't going to work this way and then you got to change and pivot but since you know you've been moving fault moving the needle forward in multiple directions that one setback isn't going to bury you see what I'm saying so a lot of this is learning through experience too which the the power list allows you to do because that's just making a pivot along the way well the discipline part of that too because you still did what you told yourself you were going to it's going to build confidence yeah that's the thing you don't want to have a bunch of losses in your power list because bro that makes you believe that you can't get it done right when you have a bunch of when you have fucking 400 wins in a row do you really how could you not believe that you can get your shit done like you start to believe well I can do anything I can make anything work I can make this work don't we deal look how much how much I've moved forward in the last you know 400 days you know I'm saying yeah I love it man I love it well guys that was question two uh third and final question uh Andy you mentioned how important it was to know where you're going right that's kind of a question three's about so let's get into it uh question number three good morning Andy and DJ thank you guys for all the insight on life and the do's and don'ts I absolutely love your episodes and the things you have to say about entrepreneurship and your political views um I'm sure this has already been a question but I haven't heard that episode yet how did you guys figure out what you wanted to do in life I have a bunch of different things that I would like to do but I don't know for sure what path I should take any insight on this would be greatly appreciated thank you guys have a kick ass day listen dude um this is why most people never get anywhere most people are incapable of picking a direction and going just going they they observe the possibilities they get paralyzed by all the possibilities they refuse to move forward on all the possibilities and then time passes them by so it's very important that you make a decision and you go down that path you commit to that path with the mentality of having zero options I don't have a choice but to see this through okay if I don't see this through I'm going to be digging ditches that's what I tell myself when I don't want to come here and I don't want to do this and I get tired of you know doing what I do which happens to everybody you go through ups and downs I pretend like I have zero options I say well if I don't fucking do this bro I'm be digging ditches so I better show the fuck I'm get it done and that might sound ridiculous to you because that's not the truth anymore but I still tell myself that and that's how I operate so you have to pick something and then you have to commit to it for as long as that's going to take to make sure that you see it through and the other thing people do is they pick something and then when it gets hard they decide they want to change to one of the other options and then when that gets hard they change to one of the other options and you can't get anywhere with that either you're gonna have to realize that whatever you pick there's gonna be ups there's going to be downs there's going to be times when you love it there's gonna be times when you fucking hate it when you'd rather do anything else but that but you have to keep going because it takes that long to materialize into success now in terms of what you want to pick you know there's a lot of different philosophies on this and a lot of different thought processes but what's very important in my opinion in the beginning is that two things come in mind one you pick something that you're actually care about that you're actually passionate about and a lot of people say do what you're passionate about out okay yeah that's true but why is it true well here i'll explain it because the first three or four years you're not gonna fucking make any money you think you are but i promise you you won't and what's gonna happen is you're going to have to believe in this thing or enjoy doing this thing for long enough that it bridges the gap between when you start and when you actually start making a lot of money and i'm not talking about coaching on the internet i'm talking about building a real company with equitable back end that you can sell later on that actually makes you wealthy i'm not talking about some internet bullshit i'm talking about real fucking business and so you need to pick something that you care about that you're passionate about because you need to understand that from when you start to when it starts to produce fruit is going to be time and that love and that passion that drive is going to have to carry you through that process so what are you passionate about first thing to think about secondly what can be scaled into a brand into a business that will get you the life that you want a lot of people pick what they're passionate about but not a lot of people ask themselves can this actually be scaled out to be something you see what i'm saying or really even just think about it huh or even just think about what you mean like think about how it could be scaled up yeah that you have if you pick something you're passionate about that really can't become what it is it's going to provide your life you're going to spend all this time doing this thing and it's never going to produce what it is you want to produce so do you love it enough to do it for free for a little bit and can it be scaled into something that can provide a life you want those are the two questions that you need to ask all right and you know you you can make money doing almost anything one of the examples that i use is butterflies all right some people are passionate about butterflies and you say well fuck dude how am i how am i supposed to get money making butterflies well you can start a butterfly youtube you can start a butterfly blog you could actually make some t-shirts with butterflies on it you can make stickers you can make bags you can make an entire brand about butterflies and you could market it to all the other people that like butterflies and you might love that but here's the thing how big can it get what can it become are you going to take that butterfly brand and turn it into a high end apparel like Gucci with little butterfly logo on it could do that right there's all kinds of things that you can do to transition into scaling but you should think about those before you start i'm going to go here i'm going to make a butterfly blog i'm going to make a youtube i'm going to make some shirts i'm going to do this and then eventually i'm going to transition into a high value luxury brand like looting of a time with a little butterfly logo you see what i'm saying yeah so you want to think this all the way through and take some time planning it out so you don't spend all this time on a on a mission that there is no winning at the end or at least enough winning that's going to get you where you want to go yeah so so for you right because i feel like i remember you saying one time it's like you know you became an entrepreneur because you didn't like being told what to do or something to that effect right you know i'm saying so how did you use one of the reasons well yeah this one is one of the reasons right is that common with entrepreneurs i find i find that most entrepreneurs that are like triggered that are legitimately like self made type people are definitely people that don't respect the rules that everybody else respects because you have to break rules you have to think outside the box you have to think in ways that other people don't think and the the people that do that best are people that like have problems with the rules of general society structure and fucking yeah and this is why people either become entrepreneurs or they become fucking criminals it's true okay that's true that's true it's the truth so a lot a lot of criminals would be awesome entrepreneurs if they play within the bounds of the law yeah you know what i mean that's the only difference bro it's not it's not that it's not that different yeah it's one of the reasons i like young golf so much because he yeah he sings about drugs and crime but like he's a hustler you know i'm saying if you take a mind like that and you put him in a legitimate you know scenario that guy's going to be successful because he understands where the game is played yeah you see what i'm saying oh so yeah dude breaking rules is a pretty common theme doing things your own ways a pretty common theme you don't find many entrepreneurs that are like very stiff in terms of that you just don't yeah you know yeah that's real man because sometimes you just got to make shit happen dude you got to figure out how to make it happen and you know within the constraints and the boundaries that they give us in society you know thinking like a normal person right go to high school go to college get the house with the white pick offense have 2.5 kids work you know your next 70 years and then retire when you're fucking 107 right like that's that's not how entrepreneurs think entrepreneurs don't think like that they don't even buy into the what i call the list the list is what you're supposed to do what they told you you're supposed to do and the more society changes the less important that list is we're to a point now we're even mainstream colleges don't even require main mainstream jobs don't even require college degrees anymore see what i'm saying i love things are changing yeah and so being of sound mind and learning how to critically think and learning how to think outside the box to get to the destination that you want to get to is extremely important and you should have the foresight to do that before you spend all this time dedicated to that thing and then figuring out that you can't get where you want to go you know i love it yeah i love it well guys and any of that was three yeah guys let's have a good week let's go kick ass be good to each other make some fucking money and don't be a hoe shut shut coke bad bitch who did slow got a own bank row can't fault does a no hit shot case is
