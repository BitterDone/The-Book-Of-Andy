solve these problems going on in the world other times we have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes and me giving you some real talk that usually comes out on Thursdays and Saturdays or Thursdays or Saturdays usually just once a week then we have full length that's typically what you get with most podcasts that's an occasional type of deal our friends come in they sit down we talk about shit and then we say we did a podcast and then we have 75 hard verses and 75 hard verses is where people who have completed the 75 hard program which is the world's most popular mental transformation program come in and talk about what their life was like before and what their life was like after and talk about how you can do the same thing how you can fix your shit so 75 hard is the initial phase of the live hard program it's available for free in episode 208 or you can go on my website and buy the book on mental toughness and we'll outline the entire program the book is unnecessary but the book does contain 10 other chapters on mental toughness that I think will be good for you so go buy the book yeah we have this thing called the fee we say pay the fee that means

show all right what's up man we got full house here yeah we do yeah we got Will Grumpy from first form my money touched yeah you touch you yeah I recounting the first yeah and then we also have Matt Graham who was what's up dude who was just on the show on CTI on on Friday yeah so he's still here yeah yeah so I call this Uber it's more fun than me that's all right that's all right so what's up man that's you oh me I'm sorry oh I'm good man I'm good you know sit next to like a legend here that is a fact man I don't I'm trying to like mimic his body genre is pretty legendary you know yeah so about will I was going on with you oh man just uh man look ramped up what looking yoked hey I'm trying to always but no we're ramping up the challenge here first form so a lot of efforts going into that uh started 75 hard day what is that four five then we're on right now yeah and uh yeah just excited to get this momentum rolling for 2024 what's the what's the challenge we don't talk so I don't talk a lot about what's going on at first form uh on the show as you know um but tell everybody about the challenge because this is open to anybody that's doing 75 hard even if you've already started 75 hard yeah absolutely and actually there's a lot of people that use the app in general first form app in general to track the nutrition part of 75 hard yeah because it helps with I mean I think we can all relate you don't know what to do or if the plan is right or what my macro should be or like hey I'm moving more than I ever have like how do I make sure that I'm taking care myself here so a lot of people use it just 365 that in general but especially with right now with the challenge kicking off which is a $300,000 transformation challenge that goes over the course of the year but there's four eight week challenges basically one every quarter and uh we just you know announce the first one it starts today when this air is on Monday um you know for people to get involved and a lot of people like you said already started 75 hard obviously that's 75 days uh the challenge is 56 so it fits right inside of there and again you know if you're taking care of your nutrition you're moving your body you're drinking your water doing those things that you're doing with 75 hard you know it's a perfect fit for a lot of people to just hey I'm doing this as well as this because inside of the challenge you know you can win cash $25,000 a couple different ways um other prizes along the way and so it's a good way to just get more involved with that community as well and move forward you said that community that's why I was going to bring up you know one of the coolest things about our app is the community aspect and the community aspect of the challenge we're doing uh something different this time that we've never done before talk about that yeah so uh this time we have challenge partners uh which is super cool because we've always had a strong community especially when people think that they're putting in the work by themselves or you know feeling isolated maybe friends of family don't support them cool we got you covered there but this time you can pick one individual that is also in the app that is also doing the challenge and be their challenge partner so uh it's like an added accountability to it and out of the gate I mean the thing is just skyrocketing with new excitement of like hey I can pick somebody and you know do this like literally do this with them you get a daily update of hated my person do their things or not so you can check in hold each other accountable so both of you can push each other to get better so uh it's taking off it's pretty simple again you just have to be in the first form app be in the challenge what does the app do tell people what the app does because there's so many fitness apps out here I'm not trying to make this a fucking ad for first form but fuck it we're already all the way in so um now that we're all the way in we might as well stroke a little bit right yeah hey yeah what what well it's funny about that nothing hey look uh for real though there's a lot of fitness apps out there I believe our app is the best I know you do as well um talk about the app a little bit because it is a it's a tool that I failed to talk about uh as much as I should because it's very very very useful tool yeah for sure so really the whole premise of the app is bringing together you know the different aspects of fitness right you got to have nutrition you got to have training you need to have support you need to have accountability you need to learn some stuff along the way you know in the app does all of that in one spot by simplifying that process to where like at at you know a click of a button you have you know a Nazum certified personal trainer you have a dietician you have you know someone that has a degree in exercise science you have whatever and they're able to talk to these people like you get an actual human being inside the app so this isn't like some automated computer printed out bullshit right real life person I mean literally every message that goes through that is a real person that is sending that message yeah in this building yeah and it well we have Legionnaires that obviously sends a message is through there as well because they use it to train their clients train their people as well um but it it always takes people by surprise like when they get a message and then sometimes a video message comes through as well they're like oh shit yeah I think it's a real person dude I think I listen you guys hear me talk about how AI is fucking up the world and how people don't give a fuck about customer experience that is outside the realm of the values of our companies any company that I'm involved in and one of the things I'm most proud of is that is that as far as I know we're the only app out there where you can literally get in the app and talk to it actual fucking certified human on demand yeah and I think that's uh that's pretty incredible it's making me proud yeah creating jobs you know like so when you guys use this app understand you know yes there's it's not a free app there's a subscription to it it's easily affordable for almost every person in the world and I could promise you the value that you get out of it is is ex-ponentially more than what we ask for it so yeah and one other thing I'll just say is obviously because education is great you know having people that have certifications is great however like the real people aspect of it is what makes the difference right because you know the advisors those dieticians those trainers those people most of them have gone through you know the transformation challenge through the program most of them are doing it while you're doing exactly doing it literally right along and like we are literally pairing up with people through the challenge partner thing of like hey no we will take people and help them through this process like it's not just you know me talking at you it's me talking with you it's got some AI bot yeah like yeah let's do this and like you know what even if someone didn't start in the transformation challenge and become an advisor and in that like all right I had a weight loss story the majority people have a weight loss story or a severely underweight story of like hey I struggled to put on muscle and I can literally help you do this too so it's you know the experience that backs also that education and that's why it's so effective of like when someone's struggling ask the question because we can help you right or we can find someone in the ecosystem that can help you and we'll make sure that you have what you need well definitely not an ad yeah no it's not yeah yeah hey I'll give it I'll also tell you I saw our video for this and you did the voice over on it yeah really good job thank you it was awesome thank you so Joe makes me sound good no you don't do it was it was it was literally perfect like it fit the video it was the perfect like it was perfect it's great so I just want to let you know it's a little grumpy girl yeah I know everything's perfect you know all right so we do have this show okay I got some good ones for you yeah I got some good ones for everybody right yeah let's get into these guys Andy Matt will question number one hey Andy I changed my path for the better and how I eat train and what information I now consume I feel much better about my life and I'm really enjoying it I have a family member who's the polar opposite okay 31 years old has enslaved a cent in years drinks a lot no consistency terrible friend group he lives with me and my girlfriend we try to inspire him to be a better version with every way possible and I can't get any traction I know he's down in the dumps constantly and we do worry I've tried a loving approach a real AF approach telling him to man the F up but we get nowhere I thought inspiring him with my actions might help but it doesn't you don't want to give up but I'm truly stumped for next steps how do you get these people to snap out of their bullshit when they absolutely know they need to what do you think bro well to me this is the most probably the most challenging aspect of personal development is dealing with people as you're going throughout your journey like the workouts are tough you know making money's tough doing all these things is tough but having to deal with the people around you that refuse to change is buy enlarge the toughest part um so you know I've dealt with this and deal with this you know like but one of the things I'd say is like you can try every single approach you want but at the end of the day some people just have to get to a certain place before they actually realize it and you can be the best example you can say all the right things in every single way that you possibly can and you should like you should try to reach out and and extend an olive branch but you can you can only lead a horse to water you can't make them drink so maybe the situation is at a point where they just have to hit rock bottom themselves to you know have that come to Jesus moment and look in the mirror and say you know I have to change and you can't force that that's a journey that they have to go on themselves like just like I'm sure this person did themselves you know I'm sure they were they might not have been as bad as this individual that lives with them but you know at the same time like everybody has that moment everybody has that day that moment that fuck what is my life come to moment and everybody has that at different stages and different rock bottom looks different for everybody and you know maybe that has to be the case where they just have to get to that moment um but I would never stop being the best example that you possibly can be and to me that's the most powerful thing that you can do you can you can say that this person should do what they should do until they're blue in the face uh but at the end of the day you know just be the best example and then let them you know go on their journey and it is a tough situation I'd like to hear your guys input about you know the the living situation of that because that can be very sticky that energy can be very sticky of you know somebody being negative and you're trying to facilitate a very positive environment you know imagine you know somebody here in this building you know with that kind of energy you kick them right the fuck out but it's not as simple as that with family it's not as simple as that so how did you guys navigate that yeah I mean I think uh to your point it's not as simple right uh however you know I think about me in the beginning of my journey I would have definitely let them live there I'd let them walk all over me um but learning to communicate those things and setting boundaries for yourself is one of the best things that every individual has to and then also redefining what does family mean to you and also what is you know the impact that you're gonna allow family to have on your life right because again we talk about it like all right you don't get to pick your family right and at times I think it's over exaggerated how important like family is in the sense of like loyalty to the family when in reality it's like what are the actions of that individual's a human first and for me you know I had to redefine that inside of my brain uh because I'll tell you there's family members that I have exiled for my life that I won't see them I won't talk to them I don't wish them ill but like the rest of my family knows nope they're not invited you know Christmas in my house nope they're not invited because of the actions that they took that like have I forgiven them sure will I ever speak to them again probably not but that's okay in my brain I've redefined what that is for me I'm comfortable with it it was hard but I think you have to you know really think through that process so um I can't give the exact answer because I think it depends a little bit on the situation and how that individual feels but if it's me I'd remove them from my home I wouldn't handle it or I wouldn't deal with it on a day-to-day basis that's for sure it's like hey if I can confidently answer I've tried to do everything I can to help them within reason and they're not willing to help themselves cool I'm gonna invest that energy in something else it moves my life forward I think we also have to acknowledge the fact that a lot of times people that are in these situations where they're receiving extra help that is outside the realm of what we would normally do for people are actually abusers they're manipulators okay they will put guilt on you they will put shame on you they will they will try to make you uh continue to do these extra service things take care of them provide for them uh make sure they're not out on the street when a lot of times dude getting out on the street is probably what the fuck this dude needs okay he needs to get a real dose of reality of what it is to not be a functioning human being you know we didn't have these problems with anxiety and depression a hundred years ago because if you didn't get up and go do what you were supposed to do you fucking starved okay and that's the reality for most of us responsible humans we understand that we take that responsibility on our own and so when I hear a situation like this I can see through the manipulation happening because maybe I've had it happen and have a little bit more life experience um but this is manipulation bro and this guy sucking your energy you're you're out here being a like let me put you this way how much further and how much faster would you be going if you were spending all this time trying to lug this motherfucker along okay the truth of the matter is is he's costing you opportunity in your life he's costing you opportunity with your girlfriend he could potentially ruin that relationship who knows what kind of impact he's actually having because he's not supposed to be there and because you're a good person which I understand we all have good hearts we all understand what the best is but sometimes having a good heart and understanding what's best means making a tough decision to literally remove someone from an environment that where they're not contributing now this person was trying and they had a job and they were working and they were getting back on their feet that's completely different but the reality is is what you describe sounds like somebody who knows that they have a safety net and is willing to to you know exploit that for as long as necessary that's what I feel like when I hear that and the reality of it is is it's costing you and so you have to make a decision and set a boundary like we'll said of where's the line for what I'm allowed to how much I'm going to allow this person to suck away from my potential and if you were my friend I would say to you I would say well I would ask you some questions first obviously and say okay is this person trying or they actually doing this or they that or this if the answer is no I tell you to kick him out bro and let him learn the lesson you know one of my buddies told me one time you know when you stand in the way a karma coming back to people which you know making poor decisions earlier in life and then having to deal with the repercussions is another form of karma but when you stand in the way of karma that has been earned by people you're the one that ends up getting punched in the face by it you get that yeah that's right and do you want to step in the front of this guy's bad decision making for the last year like two years five years telling him from changing correct he's not happy that's that is what's stopping him 100 percent he this person is this person has not learned that there is a much deeper darker bottom than where they think the fucking bottom is to your point Matt well in the in the best thing that you can do for this person is to allow them to hit that as quickly as possible because the sooner you hit the bottom the sooner you're going to bounce back up yeah that's right it's it's you know like the one thing that rings through my head on this because I mean this question is very personal to me right I have an older brother and he has a drug problem right he's been my brother all my life you know I'm saying but he's been on drugs for I would say almost the better half of my life that I've known this man you know and he struggles with it and it's like I've had to get to a point where I mean I've done all the helps I've you know done all the hospital overdose visits I've done all of that stuff but it's like you get to a point where it's like I can't want this more than you want this right and it's a hard it's a hard decision to make man but you know I tell you this like if you're trying to you know you don't want to make that decision because you're trying to avoid the hurt that you're gonna feel it you can't avoid that you know I'm saying but it's like you're staying you are being a crutch for for this person you're being a massive crutch um there's business parallels here too dude like this is a direct parallel to to having employees like those of you who listen to your own businesses if you free if you reframe this to that employee who was once really good who has now fallen off who is now apathetic about their their job and their place and their and you're you love this person you're like fuck dude this was my dude this was my guy and he's yeah bro and they're and they're they're dead in the water and there's nothing you can do to give him to go it is what it is and that's that we have to understand where those boundaries are and and do it another way to look at this it like how I look at this in business is and I haven't always been great at this there's been a lot of people who have allowed to stay around me way too fucking long after I knew that they were in this situation so I can empathize with this person for sure um but you have what helped me was reframing how I looked at these situations now when I look at them and I see someone who's in that situation who's unwilling to do the work who's unwilling to try who's unwilling to put in the time or the effort of energy to be better I I don't look at it like okay I'm I'm failing this person I'm actually failing the rest of my team I'm failing the rest of the people that show up here every single day and fucking kick ass and want to win okay and so maybe you should reframe how you're looking at this and maybe look at it as yourself and your girlfriend and how much you're holding that situation back by catering to this guy who's refusing to take responsibility for his own existence so you only have so much bandwidth too right like so think about the people that you could help the people that would be you know want to be helped right that would be help that you could help along and and give them a better opportunity or whatever you know if you had the bandwidth to do so you could take the energy that you're giving to this person who doesn't seem to care that you're giving them all this energy and give it to somebody who's going to actually take it and run yep one thing I'll add just as a phrase for the business principle uh that you taught me a long time ago that's always stuck so it's easy to remember and that is did I fail them or did they fail us right and the us part is getting at you know or you really speaks to what you're getting at there yeah it's not hey did they fail me right it's not a oh this is a personal thing right hey did I fail them as the leader yeah or did they fail us I always go with that I give them the benefit of out in the first part first yep like when someone starts to fade off and someone starts to like like I consider things I'm like okay is this person going through some personal shit or is this person sick or there's a some what's going on they get they not get the right instructions yeah yeah like I work through the list and then when I get to that point I'm like okay did I fail this person are they in the wrong spot what the fuck have I done and then but then like when they then there's like a very quick flipping over of the truth which is usually they failed us and that's the reality bro and like it sucks because it you know we would all like to keep our friends and family around and make them safe and make them but sometimes do people have to be pushed out the door to realize how cold it is on the outside before they decide what to do what it is they need to do to get warm yeah yeah and if you do decide it's cut ties with this person just cut ties with them like you like to me at least I just think about like ex-girlfriends right or you know when you like oh just come back over for dinner oh it'll be okay it's like nope and ever ends if you make the decision to like remove this person or at least keep your distance whatever that boundaries appropriate at then you need to uphold that decision like absolutely undeniably for a very very long time until it's undeniable that they fix their problems yeah I love my brother to death but I've made that very clear like until there is an undenied those are my exact words bro like yeah I can't I can't allow it yeah it's super important man yeah super important guys Andy question or two hey Andy are there any beliefs or perspectives around money that you wish you had when you were broke I feel like we've been conditioned to think that money will solve all of our problems yet it seems like many people who are financially free don't make it seem that way I know you talk about how important money is and having it but is there any new perspective that you have now having wealth that you wish you could impart on your younger self man first of all you never hear someone who's got a whole bunch of money saying that it sucks to have a whole bunch of money okay like all your friends and your fucking stupid people in your life that have never had a mother fucking thing telling you that you know monies for evil people or you're immoral because you seek money or all this shit you have to throw all that advice out the window because they have no idea what they're talking about they have no perspective there's not a person in the world that has an abundance of money that says fuck I wish I didn't have this I wish I wish I wish I had less of this I'll trade my life for that doesn't happen dude now you'll have these people who are rich who have always been rich who were born into wealth who will say stupid things like you know I wish I could just go be a regular person or I wish you know I wasn't born in like because they don't have the perspective of anything else okay but for those of us who have had to eat ramen noodles and do what the fuck we got to do to survive maybe suck a couple dicks right DJ I look for the rest of us all right so look if you don't know what $20 you ain't ever been broke all right but here's the reality man you never hear winners saying shit like this they don't say it because it's not true all right the pursuit of financial freedom is a requirement to fulfill your obligation as an American citizen all right that's why the fuck all these people died bro this is the land of opportunity if you don't go out and pursue success and wealth you're failing that you're failing yourself you're failing your family and you're failing everybody that looks at you as an example of what things could be like if I actually applied myself that's a massive failure of life so it is important for people to recognize that having financial resources not only enriches your life but gives you options in life and that's where it's about it's not about loving money to have more money it's not about having money so you can buy more shit it's about having the options to live a life that I choose to live if I wanted to right now do what all these guys on Instagram are doing and go get me a fucking van and travel the earth and be an event for the rest of my life I could and I would never have to work another day of my life they can't do that they can only do that temporarily but they will be the first ones to tell you that somebody like me is fucked up in the head for wanting to pursue financial success well I can do what you love your dream life for as long as I want you can't so you understand there's there's options here and yes there's a responsible way to look at money the pursuit and here's the irony the only way you ever really get money is by trading it for real value okay so like this idea of chasing wealth and making money in an immoral way really only applies to the elite elite elite people of society the rest of us who have to work in this modified handicap version of capitalism that we exist in we have to trade real value for money we have to provide a benefit for money we have to do something that people are willing to pay for it's not like we can just force them to give us the money like the government does okay so we have you the truth of it is is that for you to be successful financially you have to operate on a high moral standard of exchange of value you have to give more value than what that person perceives the money is worth that's how business works so like this whole idea that business people are evil or selfish or whatever it's it's fucking loser talk it's shit that people say when they don't know what the fuck they're talking about and they're too lazy to get the fuck up and actually do something on their own so let's start there your life will be immensely better with more money no facts okay now what would I tell my younger self I would tell them that I would say hey dude don't listen to any of these people not only do these people not have anything now they're not going to have anything 20 years from now and they're going to be working a job they hate doing things that they hate because they have to okay while if you stick on your path and you keep going and you ignore everything they say you're going to be in position to do other things that you want but here's the cool thing young buck you're going to love what you do so much that you're not going to give a fuck about the money you're just going to love doing it and the money's going to come in and that's how it actually works for people who understand how business is really built so you know in my opinion I think it's just important for young people not to buy into this mentality that we see so often online which is I am of higher moral character and I am more intelligent and more refined and I am a better person because I do not seek money that is fucking bullshit those people do not seek money because they do not want to get off their fucking ass and do hard things and because they don't do hard things they're never going to have more than what they have now and I promise you when you go find them in 20 years and you get them to tell the truth they're going to say fuck I wish I had to fuck away that time okay because those people always end up in a bind later they end up like the first question where the dude's on the couch and they can't get off the couch because they fucking have no ability because they fucked away their 20s and their 30s all right so you have to understand dude money's a great thing it's a great tool it's not the purpose it's not the end all it's not it's not the prize or the pursuit it's a resource that you earn that allows you to live a higher quality of life and that's just reality and then you know if you really want to take it further on your people who think you know that they're better than you when you talk about money who can help more people the person with no money or the person that can build you know school and Haiti because I did that you see what I'm saying who who can help more people the people who go out and serve soup on Thanksgiving and Christmas or the guy who can stroke a check for 10 fucking soup kitchens anytime he fucking wants to and does so every single fucking year who can help more people yeah okay so these people that say these things are full of shit and you don't understand that as a young human being especially in today's cultural environment of the resurgence of hippie culture okay I'm connected to other things my fuck you're gonna be connected to the breadline in 20 fucking years you just don't know it yet okay so what do you guys say at the soup kitchen that I pay for yeah that's what I'm saying like it's just garbage nonsense dude we have to consider the source we have to look at the source of where the information is coming from your aunt Paula who fucking has never done a mother fucking thing okay who's always been poor who drives a 1987 rusted out Chevrolet Cavalier doesn't know a fucking thing about money and you know what she's gonna say about people to have money that she doesn't like him you know why because she doesn't have any all right money's a great thing you should be friends with people who have money because those people are actually gonna be functional human beings who can actually who who will rub off on you in positive ways like dude money is the fucking scorecard of reality it just is all right like it just is now there's other score cards as well it's not the only scorecard but it is a scorecard how effective of a human are you how many people are you serving how many people are you helping because all of those people are exchanging those things for money so the amount of money you have can become directly proportional to the moral quality of your life if you look at it the right way people just don't because it's easy to hate on people with money when you don't fucking have any and you're surrounded by a bunch of people that never had any and they all hate people with money okay but here's here's where I'll close this topic out and you guys can contribute however you want if you hate on people with money you're telling the universe that you don't like money and you know what the universe is gonna deliver you delivered to a whole lot of no money all right so be careful what you think when you see people be careful what you say it's not just what you say it's not just your remark you make to your friend it's what you feel and it's what you think in your heart when you see someone win and you start hating on them for winning you're telling the world you're telling the universe you're telling God I don't like winning and that's gonna deliver no winning to you so you better be real careful about what you think and what you say about money and make sure it's the truth before you start thinking it and saying it because that's exactly what you're gonna end up getting yeah money money and and a power are very similar and that they're both tools right like with a hammer you can either build a building or you can hit somebody in the face with it right and power and money are amoral but we've been conditioned to think that because people have historically done bad things with both of those things that that's the problem with power and money but that's not true people have done equally good things with money people have done equally good things with power and so you should strive to have that tool in your life you should strive for power you should strive for money so that way you being a moral individual that wants to see the world be better can wield it for good dude that's a huge point okay you as if you consider yourself a good person you have a actual responsibility to become as rich as you fucking can because you're the person who needs to be wealthy yep you're the person who needs to help people you're the person who needs to turn around and take that money and do good things with it yes there are plenty of evil people with money but we need good people with money too so if you fancy yourself a good human being with a good heart and you're not chasing money to go get some money so you could do some good shit you're lying to yourself I mean look at Elon Musk right now like he's one of the richest men in the world if not the richest and he's wielding his money to try to make the world better and and on the other side of that is George Soros who's extremely rich as well who decides to destroy society instead so you can choose what you want to be you can either be on the sidelines you know watching the game or you can get in the game and try to be one of the players and you know make history go in your direction that you want it to go in what do you think well I think at an important part when you say you know gives you options right something that resonated with me was money gives you the option to prevent the bad right so like so many times people think about oh what can I buy what can I do what can I experience what can I go you know where can I go all these different things however just you know growing up you know watching my mom battle cancer watching things happen in my life my dad lost everything watching just different scenarios that aren't like the world's worst scenarios in the world but just looking at it my relationship with money became okay I got to have enough money to where if my family members get sick I can pay for without a doubt or you know I got to have enough money that if you know I lose my job or shit happens or whatever the case may be I'm good my family's good because you know something that I always connect with is like okay as a human it is my obligation to protect and provide those you know for those that are around me okay well protect them and being able to have the financial means to do whatever it is that I need to do to survive and be successful and thrive protect them and you know and then you know provide for them in the sense of like okay what is that for my family in the future what is that for the people around me you know because otherwise my family is going to work until they're dead right there is no retirement plan there so it's like okay well if I really truly feel that that's my calling and that's at my core well I got to have those things right now in on top of that you started actually thinking about and this is where I think a lot of you know because I'm 32 years young I didn't understand money for a long time right but really thinking about what is the cost to live right and what is the cost to live at the level that you want you know even when you think about all right well that nice truck that that guy drives well how much is that you know trucks now 80 90 hundred thousand dollars easy right okay well what does that payment every single month right then you know people think about oh what'd be nice to have this it'd be nice to have that okay we'll start actually looking at the numbers of it and for me at least I start thinking about well if I want those things if I really want that in my life well again I have to build enough value provide enough value to where I can earn the money to be able to afford that right because otherwise if we're just saying hey I want that truck I want that house I want that whatever you've never looked up the actual price right well then you're never going to be willing to put in the effort to build enough value to afford that price and so for me at least those like two different things of one you know thinking about what it can prevent in your life sickness tragedy things like that or if those things strike you can overcome those more quickly but then also like actually what does it cost and if you don't look at those things in my opinion you're lying to yourself on why you should or shouldn't have money I think also dude it's important note that whenever you think you need like when you design your life and you say all right I want this kind of home I want this kind of cash in my bank account I want this kind of car to drive I want these things I want this kind of life whenever you calculate that amount to be that you need to like 10x that amount because that's what you're actually going to need all right and that's going to be the actual amount of work it's going to take to get you where you want to go for a lot of reasons okay we have inflation we have the devaluation of money by the time you're fucking 65 years old your $100,000 is going to be like a hundred dollars all right you we don't think about these things when we're young so your goals that you set for yourself financially you should like legitimately like we'll say and figure out what you think you need to earn and then you need to try to earn 10 times that amount that's that's really how it works and if you try to earn the amount that you know we've all heard the saying you know shoot for the moon and you'll land among the stars well if you try to earn the minimum amount that's going to provide that your life you're probably going to end up with like 60 to 70 percent of that amount in the end so to add to Will's point you know I would take what it is you think you need and I would like 10x that and then I would think about what needs to happen to earn that and then that will put you somewhere where you're going to be happy to be long term you know love it like if you're a guy who thinks oh I have a job and I just need to make 250 grand a year you need to be saying bro I need to make two and a half million a year how how can I do that and then work like you're going for that and then that will get you on the path to actually being financially maybe maybe even more maybe you get on that path of providing that crazy value and you start you know figuring out how to make even maybe you end up making 25 who knows dude you never know till you're on the path most people just don't get on the path yeah I love that man guys Andy our third and final question question number three what specific tactics or tools do you use to combat procrastination and ensure swift execution in your daily routines well I have this thing that I use called the production pivot all right and what that is is I have trained and first of all if you're not working to build your discipline and your mental toughness you're never going to figure out how to overcome this problem of procrastination but the little hack that I use and then I train myself which takes practice but you can pick it up pretty quick is that when you first start hearing that voice that tells you to take it easy or you've earned a break or you'll do it tomorrow you should train yourself to hear that voice to spring you into productive action right then and there okay that means the minute you start hearing your inner bitch voice start telling you man this can wait till tomorrow or man you had a really hard day you know we'll just pick this up tomorrow or you know what I'm gonna wait the minute you hear that should be an indicator for you to go do that thing and then you should get up and go do it because dude when you become the kind of person who can take that voice of procrastination or that voice of discouragement or that voice of excuse making inside of your brain and you can use that as a trigger to propel you into productive action towards that thing that you're working towards you becoming unstoppable human because now you're not only doing things when you feel like doing them but you're also using the negative self-talk that we all have of procrastination or doubt or frustration or anger or pain that comes in the form of a little conversation in the back of your mind saying man fuck this today I'm tired blah blah blah and you get up right there and you go do the thing how can you ever be stopped what can ever stop you okay like you had a bad day that's the reason you should go do the thing oh you got kicked in the balls today by work all right well this is where you go do the extra stuff that you're pissed off about doing and do it so well that it benefits you towards what you're trying to do and if you can harness those negative thoughts and emotions and flip them into productive action now you're operating on a different level the most everybody else because most everybody else gives into those things most everybody else caves to those thoughts and those those those negative little voices that we have in our head and they stop and you know because people can't figure this one little thing out I think is one of the biggest reasons why people can't be successful what do you think yeah I'd say for me daily reflection at the end of the day right because I think it's human nature you know people procrastinator you work to the deadline or you know you don't have a sense of urgency you have to build those things right and you can strengthen those skills but daily reflection at the end of the day for me specifically is on the drive home after work because if you don't want to be someone that procrastinates okay well make that one of your questions right because I always ask like hey what did I do well what could I have improved what am I going to do better tomorrow right three simple questions and a different times in my life and different phases of my career it's it's you know more focused on different areas but if you know that you struggle with procrastination and not taking actions like okay well did I take action today did I procrastinate today right and I always you know put on my social media like make yourself proud and it comes from that daily reflection because you want to be able to make yourself proud when you have that conversation with yourself and maybe it's you know when you're brushing your teeth or whatever works for you for me it's the drive home from work and it's okay am I proud of how I lived today okay based off of what needed to be done and then also what I'm working on to be better for tomorrow and for my future down the road and so for me it's just you know set it on your calendar put it in your phone as a reminder make it part of your you know daily habits of a little daily reflection ask those three questions and whatever that is for you work to make yourself proud and eventually you'll either be so frustrated that you keep putting things off that you're just like damn it I'm just doing it I'm just you know like to your point of like you gotta hit rock bottom on its own way it's like you're just so you know fed up with your own shit you're like I am doing better tomorrow no matter what and maybe that'll stimulate the action that you need. Yeah so the way that I sort of frame this conversation is first coming to an understanding of procrastination I think self-awareness is extremely important in knowing yourself in your own the way your mind works is a huge part in you know overcoming the tricks that you play on yourself to get you to not do things that are you know conducive to the thing that you want and I think we've all had days where we've been extremely productive and days where we've procrastinated and not done the things that we are supposed to do and let's compare those two days right the first day you did everything you were supposed to do and then you did whatever you want after right and then on the other side of the coin you have the day where you did the thing you wanted to do first and then during the time where you were doing the thing you wanted to do you were stressing about the thing that you were supposed to do in the back of your head so you're not even really enjoying the thing that you want to do right so you're you're you're not even you think you're doing the thing you want to do but really you're just kind of doing it while you're also stressed so you're shooting yourself in the foot both because you're not taking action but also because you're not even joining the fun time either so what I would do is what I do which is I write a list of all the things that I would that I need to do the following day I always do it the night before because I make that deal with myself the night before I say okay this is what I need to do to have a successful day it's kind of a spin off of the powerless I say this is what I need to do once I've done this I can I'm good I did the things I was supposed to do and I do them and I rank them in order from what I want to do the least to what I want to do the most and then I do them and then as soon as I'm done now I have the freedom to actually do the things that you know might be considered unproductive with peace with actual freedom and you're not thinking about oh fuck I gotta do this I gotta do that like what time is it you know I got that thing due tonight you know and it just freeze yourself it's like Jaco says discipline equals freedom if you just do the things you're supposed to do early in the morning get them done and then you can just do whatever you want and alluded to this in episode 16 in the in the audio feed in win the day yeah dude look I think this is a big problem with a lot of people's anxiety to you know a lot of people talk about anxiety in both of you guys mentioned it um you know knowing that you're supposed to be doing something and then not doing the thing is going to cause you anxiety that is the reason for anxiety a lot of you guys think I am anxiety no you have anxiety because you know there's a whole bunch of shit that you're supposed to be doing that you're not doing and it's making you feel anxious temporarily and do you know how to overcome that temporary anxiousness take action do the things you know you're supposed to fucking do and you will feel better so I'm glad you guys both hit on that because that is a base level misconception about these people who are talk like if I hear one more person talk about them being fucking having anxiety issues it's like Jesus Christ dude that's literally just admitting that you don't not only that you don't not only that you've made it your identity now now you made your identity to try and become someone who never feel stressed this is a prop this is the problem I have with all the fucking feel good mother fuckers out here on the internet that are in their feelings and shit they make it their whole identity to be like this zen master fucking weird mother fucker who's going to avoid all the negative feelings in life I'm going to be stress free I'm going to have clear energy I'm going to have zero anxiety and look dude if you're a human being with a pulse those are things that are part of the human experience and if we are to focus all of our life trying to eliminate shit that is part of our human experience we are going to be consistently fucking disappointed and here's the problem with this is that when you focus on removing all the stress or all the anxiety something that is literally impossible that means you're setting out on a path to an absolute 100% certain failure and every single time because the expectation is that you can get to this place that is impossible to get to every single time you feel the anxiety you feel the stress you're going to have an exaggerated response to those things you're going to be extra pissed off you're going to be extra anxious you're going to feel like you're broken because you are trying to eliminate something that cannot be eliminated so you have to start understanding stress anxiety pressure fear these are parts of the human experience that cannot be eliminated no matter how much fucking mushrooms you eat or how much grounding you do or how many journals you write in or how many bowls you fucking meditate with it doesn't fucking matter you are going to feel these things and if you do not understand that and pay attention to what they're trying to tell you you are setting yourself up for legitimate constant frustration and aggravation and you know now you become one of these people who needs to be on all kinds of drugs and go to all kinds of therapy because you think there's something wrong with you and in reality it's just your body telling you physically that there's shit you're supposed to be doing that you're that you know in here you're supposed to do and you're fucking gut that you're not doing it's that simple so when you start to feel these things start to ask yourself what was I supposed to do why am I feeling anxious why am I frustrated why am I angry and then address those issues and things go away but trying to eliminate things that cannot be eliminated like imagine imagine being pissed off every single time you felt gravity okay and you think that like you you heard on the internet that you could eliminate gravity and so you go out every day on your front porch from the four step up and you jump off the fucking step thinking that you've eliminated gravity and you hit the ground and every single time you get fucking pissed off and then you write a Instagram post about I failed again today I failed I must be broken I'm a I'm a damaged human being I need to go to therapy for my failure to eliminate something that cannot be a lip like it sounds absurd that's what you sound like that's what it sounds like to me like when you talk about this shit that's what I hear 100% well guys Andy will man that's all I got all right don't be a hoe you
