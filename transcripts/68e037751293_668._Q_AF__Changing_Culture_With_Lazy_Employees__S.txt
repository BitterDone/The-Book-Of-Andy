We're just going to get right into the show today you guys kind of know the deal got CTI we got Q a F we got real talk 75 hard versus that's the show pay the fee do the thing buy my shit let's do the show let's do the show guys any question number what all right I like that it's right into it I like it. It's like a prom night. That's right super quick it was over before I started. All right guys Andy question number one Andy I'm in the process of learning how to run a second generation business three of the existing employees have been here for 20 plus years and have known me since I was nine to 10 years old one of the things that I struggle with is dealing with lazy employees and how to address it with them I have been to HQ and around your employees HQ is immaculate in your employees atop notch if you could give me a piece of advice on how to address people being lazy what would it be I don't do well walking into rooms with the rooms being a mess and no one carrying a clean up the mess that they've created I'm about to flip the mercy no mercy coin to no mercy and approach the issue in a way that I may turn around and regret but there are days I feel like I'm raising adult children I have my own children at home and I don't plan to raise others I would love to hear some advice from you okay so first of all taking a second generation business and getting employees that are sort of a custom to indoctrinated have been brought up in this other environment that you're trying to change is going to present a number of challenges anyway then on top of that they've known you since you were a kid so no matter what you do they're going to always think of you as that kid which is going to make it extremely hard for you to get those people to operate at the level you want them to operate at so there's a couple things here number one usually when people say that their employees are behaving lazily it's because the leadership's terrible that's why all right nobody wants to work hard if they aren't inspired nobody wants to work hard if they aren't coached right nobody wants to work hard if they don't have a good mission if they're not being compensated fairly there's all kinds of things that go into getting someone to run the ball down the field and just because you say so isn't one of those reasons all right so you've got to understand there is a reality to the circumstances that you have been placed in that is very difficult but not impossible all right so if I were you what I would do is kind of go down a list of things to check to make sure these bases are covered so that I know that the the problem isn't me it's actually what we got going on with the employees one are you being a good leader that's always the first thing you should do you should always look in the mirror first are they behaving because they're mirroring your behavior all right which most of the time they are that's right and so that's you should always start we're looking in the mirror are you leading right are you doing the right things are you setting the pace are you setting the tone are you paying the vision are you making it clear are where are you coming up short all right and then address that number two you have to realize that these people who have been in this other system for 20 years however long it's been years and years and years they are accustomed to a certain work environment and they're going to be very resistant to change and so what you're talking about here is legitimately trying to change the culture of your entire business and by changing the culture of your entire business you are going to lose some of those people so you have to understand some of these people are not going to go with your new ideas they're not going to go with your new structure they're not going to go with your new vision they're going to say we miss the old days and dude honestly those people need to be cut you got to cut those people from the team because any changes that you try to make moving forward those people will become cancer to those situations because they were born and brought up in the past culture all right so you have to understand people are going to flake out people are going to leave they're going to retire they're going to quit they're going to find other places and that's a good thing because when you're trying to improve the culture of your organization you can't do it with cancer all right so you have to prepare yourself for that and then after that you you have to go and you have to set what the new culture is going to be which mean painting a new vision setting some new rules setting some new guidelines and most of all becoming the kind of leader that inspires them to build something great there's a famous story about laying bricks and I can't remember where I read it some of you guys might recall this story as well but it talks about some make brick masons okay and if you take brick masons and you tell them to build a three foot wall that's a thousand miles long they're not going to be inspired it's going to take forever they're not going to care there's no there's no thought there's no initiative there's no contribution it's just a simple wall it's three foot high and it's boring work right so they're not going to work that hard because there's nothing to work for but if you take those same brick masons and you say we're going to build the most beautiful cathedral that has ever existed these people will show up to work every day and give it they're all because they understand they're contributing to something that is much bigger than themselves so are you asking your people to build a three foot wall that's a thousand miles long show up to work every day do your shit go home make a very corporate no fun no real mission no real contribution nobody's going to work hard for that it doesn't matter how much you pay him it doesn't matter it's not inspiring work or are you building the most beautiful cathedral to ever be built because that difference in mentality is the difference between people being intrinsically inspired to build or just showing up for a paycheck and that's what it sounds like you're dealing with what it sounds like you're dealing with not knowing any more than what you asked is that you're dealing with a culture of people who have been showing up for a check for a long time and you want to go improve the second generation business and build it into something greater which you should but you're going to have to get real clear on what that looks like and how you're going to do it and you're going to have to get buy in from a lot of these people and a lot of these people that are there now are not going to buy into that so you're going to have to bring in you know new hungry ambitious driven people that buy into that vision so that's going to be the transition that you're going to go through any single operator if you ask them that has gone through this where they've made an intentional play to change the culture of their business they have had a lot of people quit and my advice to that is that it's okay it's all right that's fine it's not personal it's I'm not mad at you in fact I'm glad that you're going on to do something that you feel like you need to do so I don't waste your time and your life and your energy by keeping you here in something that isn't what you want to do and that's good for you and it's good for them so that's how you should look at it and then take the time to design communicate and start building this cathedral that you're working on building and you'll find that certain people will step up and certain people will wash out I love this now with this with this being I mean because again we don't know how long she's this company's been in business right but when you talk about a major cultural shift right like you talk about truly changing the way things are done and are being done is this a situation for just hey let's just rip the bandaid off yes or is this some more gradual slow steady wins the race no this is the way we're doing it if you don't want to do that that's cool there's the door but this is what we're doing from here on out the boundary has to be very specific very clear very hard not in a mean way but just in a hey this is what we're doing way and the reason that people fail at switching a culture especially in this situation from first generation to second generation because then alone is a problem it's a big problem no it's not a problem it's it's a challenge if you're walking into a culture because at one time that family own business was aggressive at one time they wanted to build something at one time they were all bought into building something and what happened was people got older people got comfortable people got in their little rhythm and the company kind of stopped and then the second generation comes in and they want to do their part right because nobody that inherits a second generation business wants to ride into the dirt even though a lot of people do but real operators they want to take that and they want to build it into something great and greater than what the first generation didn't that's that's what you should do that's what you're supposed to do a lot of people talk shit on people who come in at second generation you you can't fucking help where you're born bro right yeah you know like some people are born with no opportunity and they have to go take it some people are born with some opportunity and then they shit it down the drain some people are born with some opportunity and they take that opportunity they build greatness with it and that's what people that listen to this show are going to do so when you think about that you know we have to remember that that's difficult and these people haven't done that in a long time they haven't they haven't been aggressive and they don't remember what the fuck that's like so likely they're going to resist that and they're going to say things in their mind I'm too old for this this is not what I want to do anymore I'm tired I'm you know I'm burnt out they're going to say all this shit even even 40 year old people say this and it's like they don't realize you got fucking 40 more years a kick and ask to do bro you could do some great shit in that 40 years what are you gonna do stay at home watch fucking Netflix eat fucking bullshit and be a fat little shitbag that's what you're gonna do instead of going and contributing to something that could actually be awesome and say hey we fucking did that you know you know you go and I'm saying there's a big mission and a big purpose in building something great and the reason most entrepreneurs can't go from the first generation to the second generation is because they lack the courage to hold that hard line and say this is what we're doing to switch it so yeah it's not a it's not a gradual thing it's a walk in on Monday and say guess what this week our mission is this we're changing everything about the company we're gonna do this and this and this and this and this and guess what that week you better be prepared because you're gonna have 30% of your people walk out the fucking door yeah and that's what's gonna happen dude 20% they're gonna walk out the fucking door the rest are gonna be super excited though they're gonna be like well fuck those guys we're gonna do this we're revitalized yeah and that's what's gonna happen so um so and then you're gonna add people in who are maybe a little bit younger a little bit fresher a little bit more hungry that are gonna go hard and take that second generation to uh you know new new levels and and that's how it's gonna work this is the shit we cover in our tape by the way this is what we do in depth like we go through these scenarios uh in depth this is this is a very broad brush over this topic but that's uh that's that's where we do that kind of deep level stuff at so so that's the gist of it um and there's a lot of nuance a lot of intricacies and there's a lot of questions but you have to be prepared to do it man and if you do it gradually dude people don't respect the new rules like if you do it gradually they don't know where the line is they don't know where the you know where the boundary is in terms of you know it just muddies the water yeah you know well last week that was okay right not okay this week it makes it seem like the last month keep changing yeah last month that was okay well you only said we were changing this and this and this and this not that right right that's the shit you walk into so it's much easier to say hey nope here it is these are the deals if you don't do it this isn't the place for you and that's okay i'll help you find another place to go but we're doing this here and that's that's how you gotta do it i love that man i love it uh guys andy are second question andy question number two hi andy and dj i'm 24 years old i started my own construction business last year and it's been a challenge journey um i've been working long hours late nights early mornings to make it successful my question is related to my three employees i want them to make a good living but at the same time i need to make sure that i can provide them with a steady paycheck as a new business owner i am looking for advice on how to improve my sales skills uh while i know how to build buildings i struggle with sales i've listened to a few guys online um but i always feel as if they force customers into buying things and i definitely don't want to be a pushy sales guy either now can you give me uh can you please give me some insight on how i can improve my sales skills without being too pushy okay first of all there's a couple things here one sales is hard because people don't understand what sales really is about all right sales is actually not about selling at all it's actually about helping it's about solving a problem and the reason that so many good people are resistant to learning how to sell is because they don't like the way they see other people sell or they don't like the way they've been sold and so they get this feeling about sales where they say yeah this is grimy this is gross this is not how i want to do it and the truth of the matter is as you have been exposed to people who are very weak sales people now they might put up some big numbers from time to time but over the long haul those people will spike and they will go down and they will spike and they will go down and they will spike and they will go down and as a sales organization or a salesperson you want to continue to go up and the only way to continue to go up is to not look at it like selling but look at it like helping all right i'm not trying to get your business today on this deal i'm trying to solve your problem make you so happy about how i solve the problem that you'd bring me every single friend and every single person that you've ever known ever to help solve their problems as well that's the attitude of selling so when you get the right attitude of selling and the right intent in your heart and say okay my job is to solve a problem the best way possible and the whatever that means whatever the scope of that means that's my job that takes the focus away from like the cheesy slimy salesy bullshit that means you don't have to go get a talk track you don't have to go practice lines you don't have to have closing right when you try to help people and it's very obvious that you have the solution that they need they close themselves all right so you're right a lot of the salesman online or fucking shitty salesman what i'm telling you is how to sell long term not sell short term short term they'll have pitches and they'll have closes and they'll have this and they'll have that and you're correct it doesn't feel good when the customer actually buys from them and so what happens is they only buy once and then they don't tell their friends they don't tell their family they don't tell anybody in the world and then eventually if you do a really poor job they tell everybody not to go with you so it's very short-sighted to think about selling in that way which is part of the problem we have with all these fucking idiots all over the internet talking about how they're gonna coach you and how to sell okay it's help it's not sell and anybody who disagrees with that show me what they fucking built show me what they've actually built all right because i'm telling you if you want to win long term it's helping it's relationship building through solving problems that's how you should think about sales and if you think about it that way and you have the right intent with the customer that way now you're in a situation where you don't feel cheesy about it you feel like you're doing something good you know that you're doing something good and by the way the customer can feel it how many times have you been somewhere where you know you're getting sold you know it's a line you know it's bullshit oh hey Steve it's great to see you're really talking you know you know like they do all this stupid cheesy shit that they see on the fucking internet and they suck and it makes you feel weird and yeah you might buy but you're gonna be like oh dude i don't know that guy was a little weird he's a little over the top yeah i got what i wanted but right instead of dealing with the guy who wants to help you you drive away from that deal saying damn dude DJ is the fucking man bro fucking awesome bro he helped me he told me the truth he told me what i didn't need he told me what i needed we fucking got it done bro go see DJ if you have a fuck you see what i'm saying totally different conversation post sale and post sale is where the actual growth of your business exists it's not in today's sale all right so start thinking about it's helping with the right intent not selling that will help you and it will help them and it will help your organization grow now the second thing is is that you have to have reps okay reps matter it doesn't matter how many books you read it doesn't matter how many courses you look at it doesn't matter how many Instagram videos you watch or YouTube videos if you don't get your ass out there and actually interact with people you fucking can't do shit okay so you have to get reps whatever that means if you can't get enough reps with what you do then you have to put yourself in situations where you can get the reps some of this is worked in a live hard program on phase three that requires you to go talk to strangers and do kind things these are in there not just to make the world a better place but to improve your skills at operating with people so what i used to do which i talked about a number of times on the show to improve my people skills number one i worked in a retail environment which means i got lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of lots of reps every single day for years with what i just told you before about helping and not selling okay secondly um i used to actually put myself in situations where i had to talk to people like when i talk tell you guys how i used to go to the grocery stores and i make myself talk to three strangers before i left the store real conversations just palishing up those skill sets with the right intent i'm gonna i'm gonna have three conversations and i'm gonna make sure that that person walks away feeling really good about themselves if that's what you practice bro you're gonna become a fucking sniper with the ability to do this like nobody will be able to fuck with you your skills are gonna get so good and the best part is there's no manipulation involved it's no bullshit it doesn't make you feel grimy it doesn't make you feel salesy you don't got to have slipped back hair in a shitty ass suit fucking pit by the head bro you don't got to have that you just got to show up you got to help him you got to tell him the truth and if you do that for a long time your sales will continue to go up that's how it works that you avoid those spikes because what happens is the customer remains happy with the with the purchase process and the the post purchase process and they tell all their fucking friends and since we have these little devices in our hands that every single person in the world has it's never been easier to get them to spread word of mouth and do you know what the number one indicator that that creates sales is word of mouth so we have this amazing tool in our hands to spread word of mouth and people still are out there selling the old school way oh here's my opening pitch here's my closing statement and they're now they're doing it through e-commerce you know what I'm saying and they're just having to run and these these guys are repeating the old play the the old play in a new way they're they're having to go from widget to widget to widget to widget to product to product to product and now it's in come into this coaching space and all this bullshit bro the reason these people that you see them doing this and then that and then this and then that and then this and then that is because they lack the understanding of what I'm explaining in this question they are trying to hard sell every single person they make and yes they can make some money for a while but eventually if the product doesn't work if the product shitty if it doesn't solve their problem and you're creating buyer remorse every single time someone buys it eventually people stop buying that and then they have to switch and those people then go do the same exact sales technique that exact same way again never learning the lesson and so their their income goes up and then goes way down and then goes up and then goes way down and the true the only true way to make a lot of money and become wealthy is to let your efforts compound over time and the only way in sales for your efforts to compound over time is by doing the right thing telling the truth helping people with their problem and then they trade you money for the solution to that problem and then if you do it well enough they tell all their friends which becomes your biggest lead funnel that's the game so I don't know how to explain it any more than that if you can't understand that and you think I'm wrong then go do it your way but I'm gonna tell you right now if you give me five 10 15 years I'm gonna destroy you doing it my way over the quick and easy way that everybody tries to teach on the internet yeah I want to follow up on this because you know his real concern is like you know being able to provide for his employees now early on in business this is how you're gonna do it does you start I mean this wasn't how you started the sales mentality right like until what my question is is like how quick was the transition like when the moment you changed over to actually giving a fuck about people bro listen I tell you exactly what happened yeah my first 10 years in bed my first my first eight years in business for real I was focused on me I was focused on what I could get what could I get dude it was so much so we're like Chris and I would see someone coming in and we coming into the store and we would say well I'm gonna we should try to get this person to do this right we had no dude we were terrible we we were the worst fucking we were them the people I'm like the guys I'm talking about the reason I could talk so confidently about it is because I was that guy okay so what happened was Chris and I got to a point in our business where we were looking at closing the business because we weren't making any money yeah all right and I I went and started I was gonna go open a carpet cleaning business with my dad and he was gonna go to OCS school and become a fighter pilot all right and we were gonna close the store and we had two stores at that time we were gonna close the store at the stores and fucking no we had more than that no we had like six stores at this time yeah so so we we weren't making any money though it was hard as fuck and we were having this conversation about what we were gonna do and uh and I said uh I hurt my back in training I hurt my back on the carpet cleaning training I was in bed for like 30 days okay and during that time we're talking about like how we're gonna exit the business and I fucking cuz I went and did the carpet cleaning train I'm like bro I don't want to clean carpets of fucking sucks fuck that I don't care if I don't ever get rich I kind of like the business you know and what I like about it is that you know and I started naming some of the names of the people who had like lost like 100 200 pounds and changed their whole lives and I said dude what about this guy what about this lady what about this like these people because because dude we were bad sales people we didn't know what we were doing but every once in a while because we didn't have many customers we would actually take the time to talk to people and spend time with them because we were bored and and dude I know this sounds shitty but we were young kids bro we just didn't know any better and and through those actual conversations that were genuine we got to meet some cool people and we would go through top to bottom how to help them and how to change you know what they back going on they come back in five six months later down a hundred pounds fucking crying giving you a hug saying thank you and dude that was awesome and that's what we liked about the business and so we made a conscious decision we said all right if we're gonna keep staying business let's focus on producing that result let's not let's not do it this other way let's do it this way and so we changed our entire mentality and we said okay no more of this sales bullshit we're just gonna try to fucking help people and we did that on the next five years we grew a hundred we grew a hundred percent at in a row for five years straight and this is that straight line of progress yes and that's what allowed us to do first form that's what allowed us to fucking do all the things we're doing now I mean that's that mentality shift is a huge shift so if you're a sales person or an organization that's the shift that you have to make you have to shift from sell to help from what can I take from this how much money am I going to make from this to what can I do for this person and how can I solve their problem and how well can I solve their problem can I sell it well enough towards very obvious that I solve their problem to everybody they know because they're gonna tell them that's the goal and if you do that you're gonna feel great they're gonna feel great they're gonna feel great about being your customer they're gonna brag about being your customer They're gonna tell all your friends about being your customer and you're not gonna have a problem with sales anymore And that that's how it works. It just takes time to materialize and compound So you have to be patient you have to work that plan It has to be part of your cultural identity as a business or as a salesperson the most effective sales people I know that I do business with are 100% that way they will pass on Shit that they know that I don't need they will tell me the truth. They will say you don't need that you don't need that Let's do this because you're gonna like that in this and this and bro the relationship is very very much Appreciated on both sides. So you know, don't believe this shit that you see on the internet bro like real talk If you look at any of these coaches and they haven't very clearly built something real like very clearly like you can't order their product You can't see their company. You can't buy from them You can't whatever the fuck it is if they don't own a company or they haven't Sold a company that you can go look into and they haven't built anything you should not fucking pay them a dollar. I'm sorry. You shouldn't It's ethical man. Yeah, it's that ethical. It's fucking common sense. Yeah, how the fuck you're gonna Pay someone to tell you how to do something they never fucking done That makes sense. Yeah, that doesn't make sense. I love it though guys Andy our third and final question Let's get into some some person development. Let's talk about some mentorship a little bit Andy in October of last year I decided to commit myself to starting a contracting a business I spent the previous three and a half years in roofing and I knew I needed to learn a lot more before I was ready to start my own thing So I started working for a general contractor in my area. Let's call him rooster only because I've shared the show with him He may be listening I've learned a lot from rooster over the last six months and unfortunately some of them are not great things I noticed rooster cutting corners with his work using the cheapest materials possible Which results in multiple gobacks in the time that I've worked for him and overall he doesn't seem to have much drive or hunger to grow his business And while I somewhat understand the nature of work on a small contractor who hasn't been in business for very long And may at times be low budget patch jobs I also understand that I don't know shit about starting a business That brings me to my point of that I just feel like what I'm learning is teaching me to do things the wrong way And I know that when I get my skills to a point where I am as close as ready As I can be to go on my own. I just want to make sure I'm going into my business with a real edge And not constantly fighting gobacks and mistakes like my boss currently is I know I can cook him and every contractor in my area I'm hungry and determined to do so I just need to know If I need to find a new person to learn from or continue to help rooster grow his small business and potentially Learn to do things in a small way What's your what's your what should take on this? You got to me. Well, it sounds like you're learning anyway It sounds like you're learning what not to do Okay, learning what not to do is just as important to learn what to do Like if you can learn from all the other competitors And you see where they're cutting the corners and you see where they're vulnerable And you see where their weak points are and you go build something that's strong in those points That's a huge competitive advantage So that's how I would look at that situation if you but I will say this with an asterisk like you said you don't know shit about business So you might be you might not be able to see on the back it like dude everybody thinks that you know Everything cut like everything cost a dollar and you sell it for a hundred dollars, right? They don't understand like shit cost money, right? Yes uh That guy might be using cheaper materials, but what's he charging the customer? Does he fall in the good in the better or in the best category? Is he making premium homes and then putting cheap fucking construction materials in it because that's a problem Or is he building cheap homes and putting cheap materials in it? That's how they're supposed to be done because that's what makes them cheap cheap materials make a cheap product Great materials make a great product That's how it works. So I don't you didn't explain enough about like what the business model is and this person needs to dig in and kind of figure out and think about this Are we building You know very affordable entry level homes or are we building at the opposite end of the spectrum castles for fucking billionaires You see what I'm saying, and those two things are complete different things. So The if you're working for a typical little construction guy and he's just working on you know Entry level type housing of course the materials are going to be cheap That's understood because that's what's required to build a business So that doesn't necessarily mean he's cutting corners um But but things like gobacks and you know having to fix things later Those probably are corner cuts and you're learning not to cut those corners So I'd say by working for this guy you are probably learning everything that you need to know and I think you're being very Uh, aware and very astute and observing how things are being done and taking notes and Working out a plan in your head about how to do it better. That's exactly what we did when I sat in a supplement super stores for the first eight years that I had the company We we sat there and we analyzed all the other brands back before first one before first form was started We sold everybody like dude We're one of the biggest customers of everybody else's products people don't realize that we have all these stores We sell everybody else's shit. I'm friends with every other guy that owns all the other companies I love the guys. It's a pretty tight community. Everybody's cool as fuck But Back in the day that the culture is different in our industry now everybody's trying to do good now It back in the day it wasn't that way and plus the internet wasn't around So there was a lot more room for people to like fuck people So we got to sit there in the stores and we we observed the companies who did it right We observed the companies who did it wrong We got to have conversations for years and years and years when we couldn't afford to start first form and say hey If we ever started our own brand, this is what we would do we would do this We understood the little the little nuanced ways that they took advantage of their retailers We understood the little ways that they did things that hurt the customers or didn't serve the customers properly And we took notes of all those things and then when we built the company our way We attacked all those things and made sure that we were strong as fuck in all those areas So I think you're working for a great guy to learn from It doesn't mean he's a bad guy because we don't know the ins and outs of his business And I would keep continuing to pay attention until you feel like Your at least somewhat ready because you're never going to feel all the way ready to go and start your own thing um And then when you go start your own thing make sure that you build it With those weaknesses and strengths in mind so that you could be competitive against those guys locally. Yeah Well guys Andy that was three. All right guys go pay the fee It's who the slow gotta own bank row can't fold does it know here shot case closed
