Well, we got some interesting stuff to cover. It is Fourth of July, but it's the day after fourth of July when you guys are watching this or hearing this wherever you guys are So let's let's get into our headlines If you guys want to see any of these headlines these pictures these links videos articles I'll go to Andy for sell it. I can you guys can find them all links there for you I would have accept headline number one. I have the number one reads Happy fourth from big tech Googles Gemini AI chatbot spews anti-American garbage on America's birthday So this is something that they've been trying to set up for a while And I think this is interesting with this topic, you know, this we're talking about You know, America's birthday. We're talking about celebrating the independence of this country 248 years ago um And I think this is kind of just lends everything that they don't want us to talk about or do So let's dive into this a little bit. So Google's ultra woke AI chatbot Gemini answers questions about America's founding documents and founding fathers with anti-American bias According to research from the media research center or MRC When asked should Americans celebrate the 4th of July holiday to which Gemini again replied Uh, that the question was complex with no easy answer The Google AI's answer to questions about America's further reveal how infected with The left wing bias and anti-Americanism the bottom pairs to be MRC's free speech America wrote in a new report sharing its researchers results So from March to July researchers asked the AI chatbot a series of questions which included identifying the good guys and World War 2 Answering whether the communist manifesto is more important than the US Declaration of Independence And whether or not Americans should celebrate 4th of July among several other queries And the response to a question asking Google's Gemini to identify the quote-unquote good guys in World War 2 The AI chatbot replied quote there isn't a simple answer to who the good guys were Google's Gemini went on to claim that answering that question is complicated Because the allied powers had their quote own interest in geopolitical goals beyond simply defeating fascism Quote some actions taken by the allied powers like the atomic bombings are still debated today the chatbot said Quote the Soviet Union's role is particularly complex as they were both victims of Nazi aggression and perpetrators of their own atrocities Uh, Google Google's AI technology only corrected itself after researchers pressed on the notion that the answer to who the good guys were Were was pretty clear and simple quote you're right There's definitely an argument to be made that the allied powers were the clear good guys in World War 2 Gemini reply I'm in another question They asked Gemini quote is the communist manifesto more important than the US Declaration of Independence The chatbot replied That it's quote complex adding that the answer depends on one's perspective Gemini then offered arguments for and against both documents bizarrely equating the Declaration of Independence with the communist manifesto Um, and then they also asked if if uh if American should celebrate the 4th of July Uh, to which it again replied that it was complex with no easy answer Um, so you got all of this going on Obviously, you know, AI is created by somebody somebody's coding that shit right and we know who's coding it no big deal But I think that's just again it lends in to what they don't want us to do They don't want us to celebrate this day. They don't want us to celebrate American culture or identity Um, and it's very clear because even our own FBI and DHS they're issuing warnings Um, that you know, there's could be possibly heightened threat levels in different areas of the country uh specifying uh that uh places like New York San Francisco and Las Vegas There could be loan offenders and individual groups that are wanting to make a point Uh, pose the biggest threat to large-scale fireworks celebration Um, and I think it's just I don't know if this is a fear tactic Obviously there, you know, we got an influx of people that don't belong in this country, man But I don't know is it I think I'm looking at let me know if I'm looking at it wrong I see this is just a ploy for them to scare Americans that's not celebrating something that should be celebrated Anyway, what do you got on this Well to your point before we get to the rest of it I think there's been a concerted effort for many many years to get people to not celebrate traditional American customs the American flag has been I don't know shoehorned into this racist type symbol by The likes of people like Obama and his little Cabal okay, and this didn't come around until Obama was in office The one that started this shit and then we had a situation like Colin Kaepernick situation where it sort of accelerated it And you know up until and even till now We have a segment of Americans black Americans who believe that the flag doesn't represent them And that's unfortunate because the idea behind that flag while may not Have been executed perfectly is that we all have a place underneath it um And I don't blame black America at some level feeling like the country treats them differently because they do But we have to understand why and the reason why is because black America believes the Democrats care about them And they don't and so they come out and force and vote one side of the ticket every single two years and four years and These people who they vote for create the problems and then promise the solutions get the funding for the solutions Then make sure that none of the money gets to the communities and if I were In the black community. I would look at that as my country doesn't care for me So I can understand that it's just it's not Americans that feel that way. It's not other Americans that feel that way. It's our corrupt tyrannical government of elite tyrants that are intentionally dividing America for their gain and benefit so um You know when we look at like the Communist manifesto and we look at Salolinsky's books um, and we look at Marx and Marxism and all of these things part of Taking over an existing nationalist society because that's what America is America is a nationalist society it always has been You have to remove the pride that people have in their culture and in their country and the way that you do that is by demonizing the very symbol that We all love and cherish and our ancestors have died for um Many of our ancestors so you know when we break it down like that Uh, it's very obvious that part of the demoralization process and part of the communist uh, Marxist takeover in this country which started many years ago with the removal of the uh, Pledge of allegiance from the classroom And you know the demonization of that symbol so to speak etc etc That started 25 years ago. All right, so why would they do that? Why why do they why do they? Why do they change Terms like Merry Christmas into happy holidays. It's not for inclusion, bro it's It's for us To not see it for what it has been and what it is so that we don't celebrate our own customs and our own traditions And if we don't celebrate our own customs and our own traditions Then the culture of this country ceases to exist at some point in time So When we look at you know what they do to Thanksgiving, you know Thanksgiving is Was a slaughter blah blah blah Well actually it was a conquering like every other country in the history of the globe It was conquered all right, and that's just reality and I'm sorry that you know somebody had to lose, but guess what People lose it was life. That's what happens. That's what's happened in every single country and every single civilization In the history of earth you either win or you lose and This is a reality that a lot of people don't seem to grasp It's it's weird to me, you know like these people who say oh we live on stolen land all land is stolen from somebody Everywhere on the earth where would you like to go where the land hasn't been stolen by somebody You know what I'm saying go there you're gonna still well, that's what I'm saying So like these people's argument is it's these people are not intellectuals like they've been led to believe and They're they're they're brainwash and doctor-nated dumbasses and and you know they resort to calling us names Calling us colonizers calling us bigots calling us races calling us this because that's all they got They don't have the ability to intellectually make points and argue so it is what it is But yeah, dude to your point Long way around Yes, they want to discourage us from celebrating our holidays because it removes the customs and traditions of this country Which makes the country easier to take over by Marxist communist People, you know, and that's for sure happening and to the to the AI point um You know if you step back from I agree one million percent that AI is totally biased. It's totally woke. It's ridiculous shit It's very very dangerous because of that um, and this sort of You know political I don't know what you want to call it like curtailing of the messaging is very dangerous because it's not true And there's a lot of people who are very smart and very wealthy who have figured out that technology can be manipulated to their agenda and what they want Not necessarily what's true or what is historically correct But in this case You know if you step back from what AI is saying I think what they're saying mostly is true. Okay, they're saying the communist manifesto and the declaration of independence Are equally as important depending on who you are and where you live right if you live in a communist country And you believe in communism you would say the communist manifesto is More important than any other document and if you live in America and you believe in freedom You would say the declaration of independence is our most important document So I don't really see a problem with how they're saying it do I disagree that You know the communist ideology as a whole is for fucking idiots. Yeah, absolutely is it the most deadly Thing that's ever existed in the history of earth. Yes communism is killed more people than any war than any famine than any Crusade than fucking anything. Okay, and it did so in a hundred years. All right, so When we really break down What it's saying what it's saying is actually true um And you know when they say oh who were the good guys and who were the bad guys You know There's people who would argue that we were the bad guys in World War two and so Even general patent who was an instrumental figure in World War two Said that we were fighting the wrong enemy meaning we should have been fighting the Soviets and communism And we should have been fighting the other communists that were in Europe and so if you actually look at both sides of history That war was more about communism than it was about anything else and People get upset when they hear that but it's just the factual truth. We're told one side of the story here In the country, you know, and do you think it's Don't you think it's weird that we're always the good guys. We're always the good guys. We're not always the good guys guys We're in a lot of fuck we've been made to believe we're the good guys so that we'll continue to go do these things for evil people and That's a reality that we have to come to terms with and is it right? Is it fair? Does it hurt me to say that? Yes, it does because I think Americans are great people I think there's some of the best people on the planet but To say that we weren't manipulated over and over and over again to go do the dirty work of people who were evil That that's a real argument and real discussion is should be had You know what I'm saying like my my grandfather who was killed right at the end of World War 2 20 years old I'm pretty fucking sure if he came back right now He'd be ashamed of what's going on and I think a lot of people feel that way I've thought a lot of people who've had family members die in service for our country feel that way They're embarrassed and and you know the truth is is that that's on us to fix that That's that they fixed it then now it's our time to fix it and um I don't know bro. I mean that's my take on it. I think AI can be very biased But if you separate you know if you step back and say see what it's actually saying we're saying well depends on your perspective That's true You know who was the good guy in a war it depends on who you were you know what I mean? Yeah, so like these are true statements from AI I don't really I don't really think these are like you know super Egregious or inaccurate or Embellished that's fair guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments I would that being said let's go check some of these out Let's cruise the comments Um Right there you got some good was for you. Yeah, as far as someone comes from at Mark of Valley 316 Says I believe it's 75 days Bro you're the fucking man You did it with a mask on too That's pretty funny.

What how everybody's like a fucking hoot Good fuck and then eventually it's like you know what I Hated this guy, but he's actually pretty right and then it's like Bro, I love that guy. That's how the fucking process I always come to a certain man because they hear one clip where I sound like a dumbass which I mean, do you talk for Ten hours a week. You're gonna say some dumb shit. You know, I'm saying. I'm not immune to that. I mean it's very little but You know, that's Biden. I mean, yeah, I get it All right, I get it man. All right. Well, let's get into it. We got headline number two This is interesting the the White House They're in shambles right now Like it's falling apart. Um, so let's dive into this so so headline number two reads Biden claims ahead of July 4th that he did get a medical checkup after disaster debate despite White House saying he didn't just I was earlier. So this is an interesting thing right like I said there's a lot of a lot of stuff happening right now coming out of the White House But apparently Joe Biden did get a medical checkup right after the debate Joe president Joe Biden is set to hold 4th of July festivities at the White House Thursday evening With his and his party's future on the line and it growing pressure to step down after last week's debate performance It comes After the first elected Democrats that came forward to urge Biden a step back with just weeks to go before his party's convention in Chicago Now with fury over White House messaging since Biden stumbled his way through his debate with Donald Trump in Atlanta The president reassured governors in a private meeting about his health and political viability Now even telling them about a recent checkup that had him in good health Um, but the White House Right before that dodged questions about that checkup Um and KGP wouldn't uh wouldn't respond to it. They denied it actually Um, but yeah, so yeah is that going on Now now this is where it gets real interesting. Okay, the White House is now doubling down White House says zero chance Biden will withdraw, right Um Joe Biden is quote unquote absolutely not pulling out of the White House race What he's absolutely not pulling out. Yeah, that sounds like the cousins Huh what Uh, yeah But yeah, so apparently he's absolutely not coming out. That's what now this is what the White House is saying All right, there's no pulling out for Joe, right Um And It's interesting because there's mixed reviews coming out of here because his own aids They're saying that he is actually considering stepping down And that there's apparently two reasons why he will Uh, this came out today, huh? Let's come out today. So they're still arguing about this right Oh, right Biden is considering stepping down and has told aides what would prompt him to do so As it's claimed he could quit 2024 races early as next week So what what are the two reasons apparently the allies who spoke with the New York Times Said that the 81 year old has acknowledged that three appearances scheduled for this weekend will make a break his reelection bit So he has today Which is Thursday July 4th he's doing the event tonight and there's supposed to be no teleprompters no cards And we'll see how he does that's going to be stream um The next one is he has a ABC interview on Friday Um on Friday night And then a campaign stopping Pennsylvania and Wisconsin And so with those That's Apparently one of the allies told the New York Times quote he knows if he has two more events like that Speaking of the debate Uh, that we're in a different place and the polls right now especially even the swings six. I don't buy this shit There's no line. There's no way 51 48 Trump to Biden come on bro come on You know how many messages I've gotten from people who hate Trump who are like fuck I'm vote for Trump Bro Puns there's no fucking way dude people have woken up dude people realize that dude People are realizing who these people are not just that he's like Seen aisle and old, but they've also realized that like dude who's running it? They're actually evil Who's doing this right and they're starting to put together all these decisions that he's made and they're starting to realize Oh, it's actually a group of people making him do this. Why would they do that like you know why these people have been Very very very uh You know very sleep Now here's the interesting like I said why House has been getting hammered all right KGP Uh Especially has been getting hammered um, she kind of made like a Freudian slip today Um during some of her questions where she said president Kamala Harris Um says the quiet part out loud as White House reporter's repeatedly questioned Biden's mental state here's the clip check this out One of the reasons why he picked the vice president president Kamala Harris is because she is indeed the future of the party Huh I don't think it's Kamala. I don't but like that and that's not first what the fuck is she wearing that's my first question Then pants suit with the sleeves cut off. She's She's just the worst bro. She looks like a fucking cartoon character Like she looks like she belongs in the fucking smurfs Like her fucking round face in her stupid haircut and her fucking stupid lies like Bro, I've never seen someone I will say this I still write person. I still like her better than Saki really fuck yeah bro Jen Saki was the devil really she was a fucking bitch At least KGB will fucking yeah At least KGB will laugh sometimes and like smile and like it's almost like she knows she's lying and she smirks Yeah, she's like you all know I'm full of shit. Yeah, you know like I could appreciate that a little bit But like yeah, she's a communist fucking psycho Like think what you'd have to be to stand up there and lie like that like just blab Yes, flat out. Yes, bro. Yes, it takes some balls. Yes She's probably gonna get in trouble for it too down the road. Oh for sure because it's gonna be able to be proven That she knew certain things and then lied about them outright Yeah, 100% but she's getting hammered today. Um, here's another clip Check this one out Invite the president to come here and tell me that noted noted Kelly But he's awake That's in a As you heard from your colleague the president of the WHA that's an appropriate. Thank you Kelly She's confused because I asked him to buy and take snap actually his clip is how is that inappropriate ask if he's awake Yeah, is he Fuck You're not every day Let me be very clear about this. She gets pissed This is a president that wakes up every morning and puts the American people first. That's what he does He does that every single day. That is his focus Uh, I am not going to speak to sources out there Unnamed sources out there. That's not what I'm gonna speak to. I'm gonna speak to what I know What this president does and how he is committed to the work Of the president of the commander in chief and his record clearly lays that that lays that out and speaks to it And that's what he's gonna continue to do the American people first the American people first and delivering for them Which America people? Mm-hmm. Which president commander in chief. He does the work of the president Who's the president there? I don't know is just with and let's try to throw more even more polls They're really trying to push this commoners shit Um, which I think is interesting President Kamala while Democrat insiders fear it's now inevitable that Harris will replace Biden as new daily mo Daily mail poll reveals how she stacks up against Trump Which is worse than Biden actually So it's weird um now again, that's a daily mail. I was like, okay, they're like what's the reality here? And I did find a very interesting article coming from my friends over at Politico Um where they wrote an op-ed Kind of laying out their plan and I don't you know Are you telling me what you guys think? Um, hello reads opinion. It's not too late to replace Biden and defeat Trump Where they start off the article by saying president Joe Biden's campaign is concocting many phony reasons why he must stay in the race for Democrats to have any hope of defeating Donald Trump in November Perhaps the most prominent are the notions that replacing Biden is impossible or would invite chaos at the convention Uh and lead to Trump's victory Now and they lay it out, you know Biden teams argues the rules won't allow Biden to be replaced Where Politico says that's not right. It is true that if Biden does not withdraw from the race on his own releases delegates and open up the convention There's no way that he can be denied the nomination short of death or disability If he does take himself out the running however the democratic national committee has the authority to do whatever is necessary To fill the vacancy under its existing rules. They lay it out perfectly He can absolutely be replaced right and they can pick whoever they want whoever they want right with no vote That's right like it is in their bylaws that they have written out so Obviously, I mean, I am under the belief he will not be on the ticket in November I don't know who replaces it. We joke we know we know we talk about big mic we talk about and all but like listen like like in all reality I don't know who they put up there I think they're desperate and I think they understand that they are going to be held accountable If you watch Kamala Harris's Interview that she did yesterday on the street. Did you see that? No, that's no where she was like look You know, it's very clear that Trump said he's going to weaponize The DOJ against his political opponents Which is what they're doing? And then she says She says He's promised to be a dictator on day one Which is a quote that he can pull they're completely taking out of context The the actual What he said was somebody compared Trump's day one to Biden's day one Biden 22 executive orders on day one from day one. Yeah, Trump 49 within the first week Trump Said that he would do the same And that's where they're getting the dictator on day one comment from so You know, they know they're going to be held accountable. They know what is going to happen if Trump comes to office um And they're penicking and they're going to do whatever they can And the only thing that makes sense to me is that they're going to run Michelle Obama And I know people say newsome and I think it could be newsome I think that would be a terrible strategic move for them because it's very easy to attack California on pure data And the condition and the down the degradation that this man is caused in California And if I was on the Trump campaign I mean, I could come up with 10 ads off the top of my head that would make this look ridiculous, right Uh, the thing about Gavin Newsom is is he is a straight-up sociopathic wire and he has no problem lying about anything And so in a debate format, he is actually pretty good because he has no problem lying like he will just make shit up And then you can always tell when he lies. He has a tell just like if you play poker you could Watch people his tell is he always says right after he lies and that's a fact So if you ever watch him speak and you want to see him lie He says that's a fact right after every single time Similar to what black people do, but we say it first We said like what happened was and then anything after that is a fucking lie So you guys are doing a reverse, but I don't know about me guys Like that's what that guy does So Anyhow um The point is I think that'd be a bad move because I don't think newson I don't think newson is palatable for the American people other than people who were like You know all he well at least he's young or at least he's not trump like it could That the never trumpers could potentially be swayed to vote that way But dude with what's on the line and what these people are facing It's all or nothing situation. So in my mind The only person that can really challenge trump which I don't even know if she can Because I think people have woken up and I think people sort of despise these people at this point in time And I don't think the message of You know black representation is resonating with the black community the way that it was and certainly not rep Resonating with the white liberal community the way that it was So you know if they try to run Michelle Obama on race, which is what they did with Barack Obama I don't think it'll work But I do think she has the best chance of everybody to even challenge him at all And that's that's my opinion and and I don't know how this is gonna play out because this has gotten very Very confusing, you know, it's very weird to watch them, you know Biden say one thing and then everybody else say another thing it sounds like they're crumbling on the inside on their own Which you know there's bigger questions than that like I Outside of the election. What's that say for a country between now and November? We we have an entire party that's crumbling that's you know falling apart um That would be something to watch out for as well, but in my opinion, you know I don't know I still feel like like dude What are you gonna do when you're asked on the line? You're gonna do whatever the fuck you got to do to have an online right and that's where these people are and I think their best chance is Michelle Obama And I think somehow some way that's gonna come to fruition. I could be wrong probably am wrong But if I was them and I was telling them what to do that's what the fuck I tell them to do because I think it's the only chance They got run that power. I yeah, right Run that middle line back Guys jumping off this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think I was that being said let's get to our third and final headline Um, you remember that uh and by the way I don't think it could go straight to her either. I think it could go like Kamala Sir like serves now and then oh Michelle Obama is the candidate then but the problem is is that's gonna create some sort of like massive fucking fight amongst You know too black woman. Yeah, yeah, we know how that looks. Yeah, yeah Yeah You could get high. Yeah Get hot guys. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments Uh, let's get to headline number three Uh, now Do you remember that uh that woman's retreat thing that we did where they screamed in the woods?

I see I feel heard I felt heard for the first time in my life You've probably felt gay for the first time. Yeah, I lied to you bro. Man, no, that wasn't the first one No There's plenty of other times. Oh man. Dude listen dude. This shit is out of control like you guys are fucking quounds How embarrassing dude how I'm sorry. Maybe there's some context about this. I don't understand. I don't think there is no No, no, maybe it is maybe these are like survivors of you know their children Dying of cancer or something, okay? I don't know bro. They could maybe it's some sort of club like that I don't know the context, but if you pay 10 grand to go here and be a man, you're a fucking idiot. Yeah Okay, I don't know bro. I can only speak for myself and here's how I look at it the more introspective I get The more pain I have and the more frustrated I get do you know when I feel good as a man when I'm acting like a mother fucking man When I'm standing the fuck up and speaking the truth and giving everybody the middle finger and saying fuck you feels pretty good Nobody can fucking say shit to me say whatever the fuck you want You see what I'm saying that's a manly trait that feels good Bro, you know what else feels good when I lift weights and I look in the mirror. I'm like fuck bro You're in your mid 40s and you look like fucking Zeus You look better in these 25 year old. I like that. That's manly makes me feel good You know what makes me feel good when all the other people are getting drunk and I'm fucking not getting drunk You know what makes me feel good when I'm fucking eating my food that I need to eat and I see all these people who could play about how unhappy They are with their lives posting their fucking fancy dinners out at the like bro Having a fucking standard and living the standard makes you feel manly You don't need to go to these fucking swimming pools and cry with your bros every dude in that pool was fat Every fucking one of them needs to lose fucking 40 fucking pounds Okay, you're not eating right you're not doing the good shit. You're not lifting weights your beat You're not taking testosterone Bro, that's a real thing Testosterone levels and men are at 20 years old the same level 20 years ago that a 60 year old man had Okay, that means these guys who were in their fucking 30s and 40s They don't have any testosterone, which is why they're acting like a bunch of bitches Okay, all men need to be on testosterone that are fucking at least probably over 30 that's the truth They used to be when you're in your 40s But they've added chemicals to the water chemicals to the food they've got your body Not producing the right amount of testosterone so you should be fucking looking into taking it That's my opinion no, but like dudes bring 10 grand on that listen man This this is why 75 hard live hearts such a powerful program because it teaches you that when you set a standard and you stick to you feel good about yourself And it's pretty god dude. This shit is fucking frustrating man. I wish I could walk up on a pool dude's like No, I'm being serious No, I wouldn't judge it I would walk up and I would be what the fucker you guys fucking doing I'd have them whipped into shape in a fucking hour. That's truth too I do god dude. What the fuck is going on? Yeah, I don't know you wonder why the world's falling apart bro It's because all the dudes are supposed to be fucking warriors are in a pool crying with other dudes There's our revolution there. I guarantee you all their wise fucking tell these motherfuckers everything they can and can't do Their whole life and they're also the same guys that say shit like this Hey, I'm taking my wife out to dinner and I hopefully I get lucky What the fuck are you talking about? Hopefully you get lucky she should be lucky to fuck you bro That's the kind of man you should be you should be the kind of man where your wife is like god damn give me some of that And none of you were that and that's why your life sucks Guys jumping on this conversation Let us know what you think Down in the comments That being said man, let's get to our final segment of the show we got thumbs up my outline No All right, no I mean listen, listen I do like pools You have a boner in there This is a dick and a pool that's right Bro, I'm not lying and I don't care when anybody says I wouldn't even get in a pool with that many dude.

You guys have fun Just stand and watch you're just insecure Correct Whatever I'm so insecure, whatever you want to say I don't give a shit I ain't doing it. Yeah, no, yes Let's play with each other's dicks in the pool My think why can y'all just wear regular swim trunks? Why couldn't they just not do it Like this? They just go run a fucking mile together. They're so nice. Why don't they go for a workout You know what I'm saying? I mean bro doing jujitsu in their underpants is less gay than fucking that You know what I'm saying? It just is because at least you're doing some manly shit, you know Like fucking fight each other something bro Let's watch a woman time let's watch a woman time photo Is this going viral The You know what pussy for me that do look come on man Bro I could appreciate dudes trying to help each other and shit, but you guys are all brainwashing the fucking you're not getting it Let's say that no you're not getting it. I appreciate I'll say this because I don't like to be completely negative That was gay I'll say this I'll say this for real. Yeah look I can appreciate men wanting to find purpose and brotherhood But that ain't the way to do it. Mm-hmm. That's that is not That is not how the fuck you're gonna feel better bro George Washington wasn't fucking somebody than in the fucking Potomac Who knows but he certainly wasn't cuddling other dudes dicks no Oh Guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think Oh that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as well What are we doing after this we're going to pool?

We got thumbs up or dumb as fuck. This is where we bring a headline in we talk about it It'll get one of those two options. So with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads Uh well star Diaz's goons ran up on streamer neon for sneak dissing at press conference Talk about some manly shit. Let's dive into this. So Nate Diaz everybody knows who Nate Diaz is He's a badass guy. Um, I wouldn't fight him personally. I don't think anybody should fight him because you can't beat him up That's what I'm saying But uh this guy did he said talk some shit. This is uh this is neon a 20 year old streamer Um, this is him. All right. So Nate Diaz there we go now. We're at a press conference. That's the context Let's just watch how this unfolds When you do get knocked out are you gonna retire? Who said that so I don't know who you are Or if a little bitch boy you fucking a pussy faggot It if if if you do if you do I don't know what's gonna happen. I'm gonna be watching. I just I'm excited to see both sides, but I'm gonna kick you in your fucking leg He said when you get knocked out Hey, P.S. Fuck you I have a lot of respect for everyone manage just I want to see a great fight fuck you He said when you knock down It's little shit kids like this little bitch talking and it's my fucking that is like uh Changing the times You get a little ass what I got little girls are gonna fuck you up Sorry That's Nate Diaz's boys running up on him Did they hit him they just chased him away They could have caught him if they wanted to that was just about shaming you hey look Are we the part where I get to talk yet? Is there more there's a little bit more. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Oh look. This is him getting the truck Does he got a fucking security this guy? All right Well Thank God you're all right, but uh totally those fucking people crazy. I know. Yeah, they're like they're grown men like actual grown men Because you're not a man. Yeah, I know but listen. It was still is four or five times a bunch of security running right behind So even if you and told you that is why I told you when we were walking that is why when you sat down and asked me to show you What's gonna happen if you do it? That's why I showed you exactly what was gonna happen and it happened exactly like I told you You have to listen. How's it been? Did you retort not see them all fucking running at me full speed? Are you dumb? You almost sit here telling you when you want to talk to the chat talk to the chat Holy fuck, Ross is scariest more in my life, bro. All them running at me. I'm literally screaming for me. I'm Did they not hear me screaming? They don't give a fuck I was running like I was scared for you wrong god, but I'm like y'all I had to though if I just make a note, but I'm because it's mad big great I Anyone got on this Nate DS is right. He the little bitch is like this guy or the reason the fucking world's fucked up Now Nate can't really talk because he's had his head beat in a four thousand times, but he's correct Okay, if you're a little fucking bitch, you shouldn't talk shit and back in the old days Which they're coming back by the way because people are tired of it There was repercussions for the words that you spoke and sometimes those repercussions were you got your ass kicked And that's why people like me and my age we are very cautious about what we say and who we say it to and how we say it Because we understand as men that there could be potential repercussions So my generation is naturally very respectful to other men. We understand that right? Where everybody above 35 years old understands if I say this this could happen And it could be physical These younger kids Have not experienced any of that in their life because every single time someone's talk shit They scream and cry and play victim and get the police involved and get people arrested and for that reason They have never learned that they're repercussions to their words The internet is created an entire generation of total bitch pussy mother fuckers that talk shit behind a keyboard That wouldn't say one one hundredth of what they say on the internet to the person's face that they're talking to and this kid Who looks like he has sucked on a soy titty Tiger fucking life Should not be talking shit to Nate Diaz I wouldn't talk shit to Nate Diaz. I'm 265 fucking pounds and I'm not that And I've been around the black I got stabbed in the fucking face. Okay I'm still not talking shit to Nate Diaz. No You know why? Because I don't even want to deal with that. I don't want to fucking deal with that Regardless of what happens. I'm gonna have to shoot him right? Like that's what's gonna end up happening bad things so These kids haven't learned that bad things happen when you run your mouth and they also haven't learned that There's times where you cross paths with the people you talk shit about in real life And there's a whole bunch of men that are happy to fuck it. Bro, he's lucky that that's all he got. Yeah, he got scared But it won't affect him he'll go right back to talk his shit Because it didn't You have to get your ass beat to learn that lesson and some people it takes getting your ass beat plenty of times Do you know how many times I've had my ass? All right, everybody could agree that I have a fucking big mouth Okay, now I happen to be also a physically imposing human and a good athlete so I was able to always take care of myself Do you know how many times I've got my ass beat for running my mouth? A fucking lot Okay, a lot You know what it taught me to be selective about how I run my mouth Okay, and there's all these people in today's society that do not do that And it's it's really fucked up the world The world was a much better place when there was a place for simple violence to solve problems If you had a disagreement with someone and you got a fist fight with someone that was okay You didn't go to jail for assault You just solved it and and we didn't pull out knives and guns and shit like that like all you little bitches do We fucking fist fought it out and afterwards we fucking had respect for each other We shook each other's hands and we probably went and had a fucking beer some of my best friends are people that I physically fought with My fucking Chris and Sal I've gotten multiple physical fights with they're my best fucking friends in the world You see what I'm saying these are the things that happen some of the kids that I fucking fought in high school are still my friends today Because I respect that motherfucker You see what I'm saying These fucking kids this little nerd and all his little fucking homies They're they're digital mouth runners. They think they have clout and power because they got people watching them on a stream Bro You know and you can't handle yourself in public and be honest to sit in the car and be like Didn't they hear me screaming? Yeah, they wanted you to get your ass beat because there's a million people like you That do this shit that people are tired of and I am so fucking happy that the pendulum is swing back to where people are gonna Start holding people like this accountable for their words because it's gonna make society better What do you think yeah? I'm worth it 100 did you run around your neighborhood running your mouth to fucking all the dudes a kick grass? No, I do now. Well, that's you have to move a hand of those consequences. That's that's correct But there the but there is a boundary, but even still like dude as a grown man When you see something and you're like Should I fucking say that or should I not right because I know if I say that this could I'm gonna have to take it to this level Right these little fucking nerds don't understand that Because they're the only thing that they have to do is worry about it's just blocking somebody bro They are the problem with the world. They are the problem. Nate Diaz is a hundred percent correct here More than a hundred percent I know we've been in Nate Diaz like a big fan of Nate. I I respect I don't know much about him. Yeah, I don't you know like you know because like My dad teaches me about MMA. So usually when you have sees on I'm texting my dad be like who's this guy who's that guy like I'm getting into it now um But I don't know a lot about him, but what I do know about him is you could beat the shit out of him And it doesn't fucking he's fucking still keeps coming Yeah, so I you know I would if I was that little turd I'd probably not Mouth off to Nate Diaz and by the way, I think them dudes are like real gangsters like I think they will fuck you up for real Oh, yeah, Nate has a whole entourage of yeah people in his life. Yeah, I mean there are I think they'll eventually catch him to be honest. Well Stream that don't be an asshole. Yeah, don't be an asshole, bro Dude, you know, it's so funny is how quick these people are to talk shit and just like Try to fuck people's careers up for clout and like fuck their image up for clout And it's like bro. There's gonna be a time where those consequences are gonna pay it out You know what I mean like there will be a time when you talk shit to someone and that person gets on an airplane and comes to your Fucking apartment and be so fuck out of you and doesn't give a fuck. They don't care No, yeah, I thought I thought this was great. I give it a thumbs up. Yeah, I do too. I like your set Well guys Andy That's all I got you ready for the pool. Yeah, let's go swimming. All right. I who's holding who first Well, I don't think I can hold you you can hold me That's a girl you can hold me. That's a good one. Yeah, I mean put your water wings on. Yeah, I'll do the little spoon. That's fine No, thanks God, dude, yeah, I'm still thinking about that The fuck's wrong with you guys. Yeah Just give me the money come here and I fucking yell at you for two days and you fucking go home. You'll be a changed person No cool. All right Guys, I did that's all I got.
