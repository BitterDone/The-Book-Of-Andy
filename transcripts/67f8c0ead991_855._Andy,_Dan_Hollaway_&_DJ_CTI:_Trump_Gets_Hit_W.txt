It was out there I mean, I would say it was in between where your spot was and Jesse James Fuck what's it called or stellar maybe no, they got two there's like two main locations They have one there and then I think they said there was one downtown Austin Spakes not spakes what am I saying? Laurel. No, they have one up north It's a good question. I don't know this. It's Austin I forget the name of it. It was fucking delicious. Wait is it switch? Switch switches. Yeah, switches. Yeah, the other one I mentioned in our stellar is a little bit farther north further farther farther north and it's They have a Michelin star for barbecue. So you're in town go there. Hey, oh shit. Yeah, Michelin star It's not easy to get a Michelin star for barbecue. Yeah, Jesus. Well, I like that switch place, but I'm definitely going back there That shit was good. Yeah, it's hot. I mean you can't get away with bad barbecue in Texas. Yeah, somebody will show up to your house Fuck a beat your ass the kick in the balls. Yeah, that's what happened. Yeah, I get it. I like it. What's been going on man? You know, I hate the government Mostly I start from there and work my way out. You know what? This is why we have so much of common. Yeah, I have a so I I should get a second sign. I have a sign in front of my It's on my dresser in front of where I sleep and it says it's not about you. That's my life motto life's not about you Right, it's about what you what value you bring and it's a good reminder when I wake up and I feel like I don't want to get out Get out of bed or whatever I'm like now. Fuck you. Yeah, it's not your turn But it'll be your turn. We might turn when I'm old Yeah, then I can fucking lounge around and and look on all the good stuff I've done and whatever the fuck But another one I should get made another sign is you get made is Something about the government sucking or something fuck the government or something. I don't know because you know no matter what it is no matter what System government happens. It always and I and variably turns into an engine to extract labor and wealth from the population That's all it ever is right dude. I was just talking to one of my friends last night and I Don't want this to be taken the wrong way because I do love this country but the more I dig into it and the more I realize What has actually occurred here and how far away we are from What this country was supposedly founded on the more disenfranchised I get with this country because the truth of the matter is and By the way, I'm a patriot dude. I believe in the ideals of this country. I Believe in what it could be I believe in the people here and I believe we have a duty in an obligation to make it better but There's a lot of time that I've spent which I've never really felt this way before in my life But I'm starting to become disenfranchised with the idea of America because I can recognize now at this age that we have been completely fucking lied to About what the country's actually about You know, we've been sold this bill of goods that It's about the flag and it's about your fellow citizen and it's about you know all these things that We agree with like that are the good they sound great was supposed to be yeah But the the reality of what we are man in my opinion is We they they feed us that shit So that we'll grow up with American pride and want to defend the country and become soldiers or become you know the badass people that go out and and basically enforce the will of You know countries like Israel who you know Can't really defend themselves Or other situations and it's kind of like you know, we've been sold this identity that isn't true And we'd be given enough just to make it think it might be true In order for us to grow up and enforce the the policies of other countries that just doesn't sit well with me man No, I mean, it's a top-down approach when when we were supposed to be I mean the letter of the law the Constitution is Quite clear that it's supposed to be a bottom-up organization and you know There's a I don't remember who originally set it Could have been Ron Paul or Murray Rothbard or some like that But it's when the state is large the individual is small and the point of America is that Individual liberty and personal entrepreneurship or the ultimate inoculation to tyrannical bullshit right decentralized authority decentralized Economic authority especially keeps the government from amassing too much power we talked about this Before the show of a 25% of all new jobs last two years have been government jobs and the government doesn't make anything They don't make money right? so we're we're basically Yeah, I'm sure you've seen companies like this before that Poor while the American University system is the best place to look so the average This data is from like 2018 so I'm not sure how current it is still but it's probably way worse than this now actually because of DEI but the average Professor salary relative to inflation has gone to about 27% over the past 40 years and The administrative fees associated with an education about up 2,000 percent right and that's bureaucracy It happens in business and it happens in government. It doesn't matter and it's it fails no matter where it happens always It has to fail because the bulk of your enterprise should be producing something of value And if it isn't then you're gonna fail yeah, I mean it's really this is not cop this is like Keynesian versus Australian Austrian economics or anything like that. It's not like two different houses of Economic theory talking with each other. This is just a fucking fact that everybody knows is true Yeah, dude, I think You know the bureaucracy in business is typically born of the unwillingness to do what you are Assigned to do I've noticed this before especially in companies that I've consulted for You know they hire and hire and hire and usually what ends the reason they're hiring is because the person who's supposed to do the job Doesn't want to do it. Yeah, so they're like well We need to hire one more and then we need to hire one more and then we need to hire one more and Everybody kicks the can and then when when you know the butcher comes in starts making cuts They all surprise why they all get you know in government We called it the wobbly wheel theory so Congress passes some appropriations bill and gets sent over to opm You have to do this job You have two years to do it and opm office a personal management who does the hiring and firing for the government says okay Well based on our research we need two people to do that job. It's like all right cool You hire two people one of them sucks So instead of firing that person which becomes notoriously difficult after their two-year probationary period Which is why Trump is dumping all these probationary period people Then they just hire two more people to do the job right you've got four people doing the job of two people That's government in a nutshell. That's how it works and it's fucking stupid. Yeah, and then it spreads and it's like It just keeps going and going and going and going and when it starts to spread it's an exponential spread Yeah, well it's accountability is what really matters And when I say accountability, I mean down to the individual level Fucking Andy you here here are things that you need to get done and you're responsible for them If you need help ask for help, but you're responsible for getting this across the finish line Do whatever you got to do to make that happen? So I can come back to you as one man and say hey, did you get it done and the answer is either yes or no right and if you diffuse responsibility Then nobody's ever responsible for shit That's and that is a complete disaster no matter what it is if it's if it's like a military operation or a business or the government running itself Yeah, no matter where you see that it's nonsense It should never be accountable. Yeah, it should never be tolerated in a company. No, I mean that's like Especially this is the problem with most startups they get money from somewhere and instead of learning lessons They buy their way out of stupid situations and they end up Four or five six years down the road and they're looking at an exit sale Yeah, right because you're making good revenue and I look at your net revenue. I'm like, what is all this bullshit? Yeah, right you're getting you're now you're gonna get a Multiplier a net revenue instead of a multiplier in even though because your company's not growing the way it's supposed right Got a lot of fat and by the way you're $300 million in debt. Yeah, well, it's because it is earning though It's the same thing with the government. They didn't earn the money You know, I'm saying like a good business entrepreneur to start from the bottom. You've earned it You have a different look at the money you have versus when you just get the fuck of money who cares where we spend it who cares Well, this is ultimately a culture problem before being honest. This isn't a problem with organizations in my opinion this is a culture that has been enabled and bred into our society and Become acceptable. I mean dude if you walked around as a man 30 years ago and and basically you know pretended that we you're one of these people that pretended to work but didn't work You know, you're hiding you're doing the least amount possible and then you know, you know, everybody else is doing it bro The dudes will pull you out back and kick your ass. Yeah, like they would kick your fucking ass. They'd be like bro You're not doing this shit. You need to get the fuck out or they they harass them or bully them or beat them until They start doing their part. Yeah, where they quit We call that self-selection. Yeah, yeah, there's got to be a direct line between effort and outcome Yeah, baked into the human beings brain right and it that that's a survival instinct for us But you get what I'm saying the like I mean it's been like think of how many people think of how many people go to their job on a daily like real talk Everybody listening how many motherfuckers do you know that go to wherever it is that you work that do the least amount possible And then hide in the corner when nothing's really going on or they're fucking around their phone or they're they're playing video games or You know they're running the little Sneak plays and the and the you know get around the workplace and then Those same people are the biggest ones that cry and bitch about whenever they get passed over for an opportunity Or they don't get paid the what they say they're worth bro. You're getting paid exactly what the fuck you're worth and to be honest You know If I was an employee at a place and I had people doing that around me I would straight up fucking handle it Yeah, like they would either start working at like a peer-to-peer handling like hey You're either gonna do the fucking job because I'm not gonna look bad because you know or I'm gonna go to the fucking supervisor and be like dude This is exactly what the fuck this guy does all day. Let's give him a fuck out of here. Yeah, yeah I mean it's you we've dissociated ourselves from this the it's and it's again This is basic instinct for human beings You don't work. You don't eat that's how it works right for us and then we told people. That's okay If you don't work when you can still eat. Yeah, that's where society began to crumble a thousand percent right? Yeah, you know, and there's always ways to get it back usually unfortunately for us We have to learn that lesson the hard way. She's got to go completely wrong and then the chaff gets blown away with the win Yeah, dude a thousand percent man We don't we have people in this country. I think we talked about this recently that have never faced hardship ever They came in and comprehended like there are people and it's usually the same demographic of people that advocate for this shit It's upper middle class white women that advocate for this and they advocate because they have never felt hardship They have never had to struggle. They've never dealt with crime. They've never had any of these situations of Potentially starving for real. Yeah, and so they have this Guilty feeling in this need to signal and virtue signal that they're a really good person and we care about these people Not understanding that like dude these people that you're advocating for and a lot of cases are abusing our system that allows them to live off the money that other taxpayers pay You know indefinitely and we could fix this Real talk by limiting the amount of fucking financial aid that people get on welfare and section 8 and making a time frame on it or Making stipulate like dude you you have a certain I'm just throwing this out But you have a certain amount of time that you can collect that over the course of your life Or you have to do these things while you get it. It's not just all I get have another kid and I get more money like Insane unchecked. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, there's three elements to it, right? So the first one is what you said and it's this is there's kind of a duality this it's that They've never felt any kind of External oppression right so they have a pression FOMO now because oppression is the currency the social currency of today Used to be honor courage right being a good man. Yeah, now it's victimhood now it's victimhood right so When you when you take that into account these people have a pression FOMO this this person who wants to feel You know socially accepted or honored or whatever the fuck you want to call it now is completely excluded from that because they're white Yeah, right so that's why you see at these antiva rallies the people that aren't funded by Soros or Russia directly right there the only reason those people are there and then including some of those people were taken money from are just there because Their butt hurt for no reason right so so that's that's one element the second element is when it finally comes and hits them in the face It's nimbi not in my backyard right when a legal ever gonna start showing up to to Kate cod and shit like that Martha's like ah not here buddy. Yeah, not here. We got to get these guys out of here. I mean they come here They had them they can't come here. They like they had hundreds of legals gone and 10 hours from there right They see their faces where they were so funny. It was the best. It was so funny. It was so funny Me and oh my god I got quite a bit of joy out of that and then the other part is something you also alluded to and this is the It and I think it I think it does have something to do with this Disconnect between effort and outcome that people have it is We we go through this whole cycle. I think you were mids actually talked about this from physiological standpoint But people go through this cycle where there's a thing that needs to get done in society and we have been programmed by Hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of years of evolution to address that issue You see somebody that's suffering and it makes you feel some kind of way and you want to stop that shit from happening right That's a good person feels that way. Yeah, so you go over then stop it That's how you do that and then you get rewarded you get oxytocin you get serotonin you get dopamine immediately you get serotonin over time You get oxytocin because you start to develop a connection with that person right This new world we're in where we're completely dissociated from that effort and outcome trajectory now people will say thoughts and prayers Or they'll put a flag on their fucking bio or he him and their fucking bio and say I've done I did it Yeah, I did the thing so not only have they done nothing but they're perpetuating stupidity and then they haven't actually helped anybody But they're still they feel good and take credit for it It's a long artistic bullshit of all time and these are the people who think Regular people don't even consider this but these are the people who think they're better than everybody else That's right. I've literally done nothing functional for anybody in their entire goddamn lives thousand percent dude It's insane. I mean just when you think about it that way and break it down from point A to point B It's like you're a piece of shit. Well, bro You're like one of the biggest drags on so forget about the people even on welfare You're worse. Yeah, because you're capable. Yeah, I mean what the fuck well, bro It's a it's a problem and I do see culture shifting back towards normalcy and Starting you know young kids are tired of this bullshit. Oh, and everybody's tired it everybody's tired of the Virtue signaling and the fake outrage and the cancel culture and can't say this can't say that you're a this you're a that Let's take their business down. Let's fuck it like bro. No one gives a fuck no one fucking cares and that's You know That's what happens when you jam shit into into society for so long And there is some unfortunate side effects of that like when things actually happen with some of these protected classes quote unquote No one's gonna care anymore, but you know these people did it to themselves by overusing it's like boy you crowded whoa That's right you call someone a racist enough eventually they're like fucking. I don't fucking call me whatever to fuck you What yeah, well the interesting thing now is that one it was never black people doing that yeah It was like a couple of black people who grifted right but mostly it was white women. Yeah, and I called Brutcher Now now all these like black dudes and and not Tyree's obviously he's still but hurt again. What's that? What's that? I have no idea. I reached he's he's a fucking retarded, but dude he listen We follow each other on Instagram. He did a whole nine-minute thing. I've talked to him if you voted for Trump man What the fuck man? Better than the vote of a Trump You know what I think did you rich shut the fuck up? Dude, I don't get it because he he's all he I don't know man. It's weird like you know I mean what lists you on bro He's got you might have some stocks and some baby. It makes you suspicious But a lot of other dudes I mean you're seeing all these like yaddy was on somebody's cooking show the other day Asking about BLM. He's like no, that's a bunch of bullshit. That was they were buying real estate They weren't helping black people wrote that was awesome But that's the average that's the average fucking black person in America right now Because I know that you white liberal ladies have never met one but I grew up in a black neighborhood I know these people right like I talked to that have actual conversation I'm not concerned that they're gonna rob me We're gonna save women that that like when they see a black person coming there like cross Like get on the fucking ground. Oh, I'm not worried. It's like have you ever even met a black person before you fucking dummy? No, no, they have it. No, I saw that Your barbecue at the park like hey, there's some black people here Yeah, man, it's 2025 Bro, I saw that that podcast dude that with yaddy and it was like a black girl, right? Yeah, and she was like I'm the biggest pro black and he's like no, you're not Like and he starts going in. He's like they were buying mansions. They were doing this. They were doing that You ain't for black people like it was it was really good. Yeah Yeah, I mean, you know the best economy like this is Maybe it's reductive. I don't know but I think providing the best possible economy for somebody Gives them the best opportunity to liberate themselves from any oppression whether it's the government or Hate groups or whatever the fuck totally agree I think that's the best way to do it and there's never been a better economy for black people than under Trump in his last term Ever in a history of this country is not even close. Oh statistically. I had to fail Yeah, it's that's just the fact so like what what what helps somebody more your little Speech that you give or your bumper sticker or the food that gets put on their fucking table Bro, do you want is it you criticize for that as entrepreneurs like like people will say shit like You know, well, you know, I'm not into the Material things because they're they're this and that and this I go feed the homeless well motherfucker I've built fucking schools. I've built homes. I've built places where people fucking get served food Yeah, what's more valuable? How many more how many people did I help versus you help? Yeah, and I just the moral judgment society is Out of control you gotta do something you can't just say stuff You know, yeah, so leaving a cop smart snarky fucking liberal comment on somebody's post is not being an activist Yeah, Western North Carolina got fucked up with all those hurricanes Everybody that fucked up. I actually have that real quick too because I know it hit close to home well what I was gonna say is My people were down in North Carolina rebuilding this general store, right? They were rather From save our allies right and Somehow I don't know how the fuck you even got hooked up with them and the first place But you had given them some money yeah to help rebuild the store because that store serves the entire community He only store it anywhere near that fucking place, right? Well, when when the hurt a new road we tore it down and rebuilt it right but just but They served that entire area and then all those people are like the only place they could get to is there because all the roads were fucked up So we're in the middle of this somehow. I don't even know how you got involved in the first place, but Somebody told me like oh, yeah, we got some money from some some guy from first form What do you mean some guy from first point like you would give it a money to help start rebuilding? And I hit you up and said hey, thanks. I didn't know if you do I know that was yours either Actually what happened was Somebody was mother fucka me on the internet over some controversial things that may have happened in the past and They were like if you were real if you were if you really gave a fuck you would be doing this and I'm like well Tell me about it. What are they doing tell me some more and I started looking into it I'm like, oh, this is a great fucking cause bro, and so I contacted them You know I gave them a little bit of money and and you know to try to get that general store back online So the people could get you know the things they need because they were shut off from everywhere else I mean feel it and that being it was your guys right like your friends Yeah, it was my friends and I was like I just texted them to say thanks and he paid for all the rest of it Right that's doing something yeah like go either go there and get your hands in the mud or if you can pay pay Do whatever you can but shut it just shut the fuck up. That's it Yeah, you can earn your right to say whatever you want those same motherfuckers would be like that judge you on that was be like Well, that's easy for you to just pay what the fuck do you want me to do? Yeah, you want me to reverse the fucking hurricane? I can't do that eight billion dollars I mean Trump did say we might want to shoot some nuke into those hurricanes. That was that was Trump won No, I don't know if he's changed his opinion on this now We're probably not a good idea to send radioactive waste all over the We'll have it spread all over my head. See how it goes. I guess we'll try it out one time Try on lady, but but but but to that point man I think this is something that I mean in good news, right? Like you know you talked about just like it's kind of in us right and I think especially as Americans and maybe unique to us But we want to help our feather our fellow citizens. Yeah, well, that's put that's so that this is a really good point. Yeah because The equate there's an algebraic equation on how a functional society works and on one side of it is liberty on the other side of it is Fucking effort right and if you want decentralization it requires your daily attention your personal daily attention Right our collective attention sure, but it always starts with you if you want to live in a in a world that the government doesn't have control over your life You better goddamn walk down the street and ask your neighbor how he's doing because if you don't the government will and they're gonna put on Wellfare for the rest of his fucking life It's gonna come out of your pocket forever and if it goes on one more generation now you're on generation Wellfare and that's shit last six eight generations. Yeah, right? So one of the things I tell people a lot is If the government shows up and nobody's got their hand out they have no power there and that is how voting fuck voting like do it Obviously you got to vote and participate in your country, but you're not gonna vote your way out of any of this shit No effort is the only way you get out of this bro the only way it's it literally is What you and I always talk about we say it in different ways But you know it's personal excellence being the ultimate rebel. It's just dude It's not needing them for fucking anything. It's not listening to anything they say it's Examining the narratives they push out educating yourself to what the truth is and really honestly kind of understanding that They don't have our best interests in mind their interests are to get us hooked into a system that we can never escape Yeah, and they've hooked enough people into it now where there's a real problem that Has to be solved culturally and You know the way you solve it culturally is you know what it is honestly it's shaming mother fuckers Shaming and letting them fail right? Yeah, I mean like you got to take the the training wheels off the bike at some point Yeah, like if you're fucking loser. I'm gonna call you a fucking loser No, like I'm sorry that hurts your feelings, but look at you. Yeah, you know, and what do you think you're better than those people? Yes, absolutely. Yeah, I mean I do more I fucking work harder. I fucking do everything I can Take care of myself these people do none of that and then they want to be considered equal That's not how the fucking world works, bro Now you can control two things in life your effort and your and your attitude and that's it right? Yeah Those things belong to you nobody can take that from you only you can give it away, right? Yeah, and we've seen an example just This past week actually of how effective this could be so Egg prices right They went up because 250,000 egg laying hands were million million Millions yeah million were we're just killed because there might be a fucking bird flu now bro That was to intentionally create the perception of prices going up under Trump of course sure So what happened we've seen the largest run of purchases on Egg laying hands from to private people in the history of this country and now a week after everybody was just talking about how eggs are still expensive There's a 4047 percent drop in egg prices and one week Right that's how quickly it can happen if you just pull off the government tit They're not good at anything what the fuck is the government ever been good at first of all Brian None of these people I'm not gonna say none there's a few but they are The very small minority of people in government has time as massive have actually produced Some success outside of government for themselves. Yeah, okay very few How could the government wasn't designed to be run by people like that? It was designed to be run by the entrepreneurs by the the the elders by the experience How much fucking experience can you have running a government if you never ran a business when the government is parallel to a business well I mean the different here's the difference if you if you only have ever worked in government Then you've only ever worked without a budget right That is not how the fucking world works, dude man if you've worked in a business Especially if you created your own business you know exactly what a ledger looks like you know It exactly what the credit and debit section and the assets and liability section looks like you know what a cap table looks like And you know over the course of this many years I got this much money to spend and I have these goals to hit and if I don't I'm fucked well broke This is why I always tell my entrepreneur guys. I'm like guys you guys who are running 10 20 30 million dollar businesses You're much better operator than an operatic than a CEO of a 15 billion dollar company because they have unlimited budget to make decisions though If I had unlimited budget to just say fucking go higher that guy go do that the it would be easy right but We don't and so when you're a small operator not you know 30 millions not small But you get what I'm saying? Compared to 30 billion it's small You're actually a better fucking operator Most likely than the person who's running a company that's you know billions of dollar and revenue Because dude you don't have unlimited budget you have to be creative and you have to think of solutions and you have to be resourceful and You know those are the people those people not the big fucking you know multi-billionaires The middle guys or the guys the government's supposed to be run by you know, so yeah Boy, oh man you want to talk about the Twisters bro. Yeah, this past weekend was wide Yeah, Ryan was telling you guys Right as everybody now there's 42 confirmed deaths across about five states There was a total of 56 confirmed tornadoes, bro in the span of like we're talking like bro We had we had one pass on each side of the house. Yeah On my place so I got we got lucky bad. Yeah, Missouri, Mississippi Arkansas, Alabama and North Carolina all reported deaths from tornadoes or severe storms I Mean do the pictures and shit oh fucking they're insane I mean is it anywhere you went it was just mass destruction or here locally I know Union felt some some heat Arnold got here Arnold got hit Village yeah, and that's what I'm talking about that's on both one North one South I mean you know but dude even where we are you were at my house. It was fucking crazy dude Why we lost like four or five pretty decent trees. Yeah, yeah, it was wild But I mean the good thing you know like said coming off their conversation, and it's like you know the beautiful thing is Like I culturally I think Americans are getting back to that that that mentality of it's up to us I don't know if America ever lost that I think that a lot of people have right but America's been the most generous like the American Citizen is more generous than the vast majority of countries you know what I mean which is unique to us for sure It is extremely unique. So I remember as far back as like the tsunami in Indonesia remember that you know the number one Non-state contributor was to that not NGOs not an NGO not any of that shit It was the United States citizenry. Yeah spent more money if helping to fix that situation than anybody other than the US government did Right just in donations which tells you something very clear one that this country's worth fighting for the people are Not the government but the people certainly are the second thing it teaches you that you don't need to tax people for this We will figure out a way to help these people. I don't need the government as a middleman Take tacking on 40% to all the charges fuck you You're taking money out of my pocket under the guise of some kind of like social impathy or something like that And you what you just gave yourself 40% of it and that's the tax to be a good person. I don't think so bud I don't think so if you get between me and somebody I'm trying to help. I'm gonna fucking run you over Yeah, and they're doing that. They're fucking doing that justify the need for Their NGOs. Yeah, it's dude When I just had what I heard from your your friends and and I had a couple of friends out there too in Asheville area Like it was unbelievable the shit I was here and dude like Fucking believable a lot of it is incompetence. Yeah, right? But I'm like and competence and lack of leadership, right? So This is anybody that's ever worked in emergency management And you would like to think that people at FEMA have at least some experience right? Yeah, you would think Would know a couple things one disaster happens you're on the clock people are without power within a couple of weeks People start to die from sanitation related issues, right? You're also on the clock with regard to Infrastructure so one of the first things that you have to address is Endress and egress like how to get in and out of places roads get fucked up bridges go down blah blah blah Army core engineers weren't there until fucking weeks weeks later They should be the first person on the ground. Yeah, and some of these instances especially there in a place that isn't used to having these kind of things tornado alley is what it is Yeah, right, you know trailers get me we were outside I mean it is we had one of my buddies here from Florida. He's from South Florida and before that he's from Canada and He was like what the fuck's going on like bro. This is tornado's like well, what should we do? I like let's go And then then it's the other part is the complete lack of leadership nobody's got the balls to say hey Did what you're doing's like nobody in the middle management part is like hey? You're fucked up. Here's how it's done What needs to happen is all a FEMA needs to get put under the Department of Defense yeah because you have a very large workforce That's already on the clock. They're already getting paid it doesn't cost you anymore to use them All you got to do is move them places and they're really good at it They're the best in the world at it as a matter of fact it already exists and one of the things I wrote one of my master's thesis on this After Katrina One of the lessons we learned was why are you trying to recreate these Distribution wheels why are you trying to do that Walmart and Amazon exist? Mm-hmm fucking use them All of them get them on the phone. They've got all the water and diapers you need buddy I promise you they'll never run out either and they have trucks to get them there Mm-hmm. All you have to do is say hey we need X and they'll have them there. Yeah, right? I had a Weak or two ago one of the one of the guys from Cajun Kind of weird they don't do that on their own though for being honest you would think you mean Walmart Yeah, Walmart Amazon should be doing that on their own bro like companies my size We fucking spend a significant amount of money meet both me personally and our company in situations like that almost every single time Yeah, the Walmart foundation does but not on their own they give a lot of money But they don't give I they help people so they help Cajun maybe set up a distribution center That holds a lot of equipment shit like that. I don't think Amazon does anything now Amazon is a useful tool If you're in a local community of it is asked to make an Amazon wish list and just put it on the internet people like us We'll share it and you will get the stuff you need I promise and Amazon's quite a bit better at getting it there than the government typically is But yeah, the DOD is already on staff we have What if you if you include all the national guards? We got like two million people on staff Why are we why are we going out and paying a why do we have do that we have like an entire Additional federal agencies. Yeah, but it isn't even good at it. What's the fucking excuse as to why they weren't there? The military yeah, if we got two million people to help these people why would why were they got that? That was so I can tell you the story if you'd like to hear it Well, how long is it very brief? Okay, so the governor we were going back and forth on the phone with the governor of North Carolina at the time He's gone now. He's a fucking idiot. He didn't know he says he didn't know it and what exactly am I supposed to do here? He was asking the NGO. What am I supposed to do here? It's like declare a state of emergency Seed control to the DOD. That's it. Then they'll take care of it already wouldn't do it. No One female colonel and the North Carolina National Guard I can't remember her name, but fuck her right people are dead because of her And I hope there's an investigation into this at some point and she goes to prison for the rest of her life But she kept she was in a zeal the whole time Add people from below her and above her telling me this like and the National Guard there She kept she was in this dudes here like no, don't give up control. We need to be the site commander. Why? You're the fucking commander of a fucking North Carolina National Guard unit You've got the 82nd Airborne down the road, which I was in by the way We specialize and jumping into places and setting up a city. That's what we do We jump in season airfield and set up medical ammo supply Security comms everything we can we can jump in and within three days set up a fucking city a functional city That's what that's like what we do. It's like a what we're trained are are the 80s are gonna Were specialties to do exactly that right going behind enemy lines is set up a fucking base now How could that possibly be applicable to a city that's been wiped out of course it is same thing get the fuck out of my way Yeah, like you this this Pride of authorship or whatever it is like I've got to be the one that solves it man. That's ego. What the fuck? It's fucking ego bro. It's it's hubris. It's ego itself You know glorifying bullshit and it ends up killing people Yeah, it does That's I mean, I hope you guys go for it. I mean shit. There's there's there's gonna be an investigation Yeah, at some point, but yeah, that's what happened. That's what happened and and You know, it's it's unconscionable to think that we've got all these read the we're the richest country in the history of the world We can fix that problem. Yeah, right? We've already fixed it actually We're just trying to fix it in a new way that includes civilians in the federal government set up like when you were growing up What were the national guard commercials? It was dude stacking sandbags That was the national guard commercial like hey come here and help your community. That was the fucking whole commercial. Yeah Now it's just like come here and wear a dress Yeah, and don't help that guy with the Trump's you know Trump Yeah, yeah, it's fucking yard Yeah, that's crazy man. Yeah, FEMA was actually putting that out. I've seen some of those Some of those and again that that came from middle management and FEMA and government employees by a larger liberal for the most part Right, believe what you want, but that's that's the reality and They're like yeah if you go if somebody's got a Trump sign on their property They made it they may attack you if you're wearing FEMA stuff like yeah somebody that hasn't eaten in four days It's gonna attack you when you come with a bag like Donald's yeah, fuck off dude. Yeah It's stupid man. Mm-hmm. Let's do people guys Let's do some cruising. All right got a lot of stuff to cover a weird shit going on It's a lot of weird shit going on So let's get into it.

Did you guys see Trump gets smacked with the mic? I did the hot mic. No. Yeah, so Trump Trump was doing this it was addressing the media at joint-based Andrews in Maryland before going to the deep leave in DC And he was taking some questions. He was in in good spirits and Giant fuzzy dog hit him right in the right in the living like it's habit of the best of us You know yeah, you know usually in private, but usually on the weekends.

He hit with a boom mic as a boom my girl nice big fuzzy black dude How do you want to be that guy? It wasn't a boom mic. It was a handheld. Oh That's even worse. Let's check this out. It was intentional Look at that look Your fire He's trying not to smirk That's what you do Look I don't agree with everything Trump says or does obviously, but dude. I really do like the guy Yeah, he's funny man. He's a funny motherfucker. I mean you can get butt hurt about it or you can start smiling Your boss is gonna be fucking piss. He's like he's gonna be a big story He doesn't shit all the time. I'm gonna be a vent at Marlago where the cameras panic around and all of a sudden It meets his eye line. He's like fucking look at it you buddy He's always he's just an old grandpa at this point. Well, here's a thing Well, dude. He's always had a lot of swag, bro Like he's it. I mean his whole life. That's why he's Trump, you know for sure Well, here's the thing so like when this first happened Obviously you don't really see who's behind the camera a lot of times right? I think most people you know surface level would watch this and maybe not think oh yeah, I mean just an accident right? I mean yeah as a long pole the fucking mic was you know sticking on and stuff right Well, she's been identified the lady who did this if that track runner that club the girl the baton My sister's just showing up and like as well be her Marlago be her oh boy, you know, but uh Yeah, they've they've identified. We got to go to Laura Lumer. She's been putting this out on Twitter here She tweeted this out. She said oh, I have identified the reporter who hit president Donald Trump in the face with the boom Mike this week while he was speaking on speaking to the press on the tarmac her name is Danielle Kurtle's been She is the newly appointed White House reporter for NPR All right, so this is Danielle's profile was Daniel's profile she since Went off of Twitter after Tanka. Yeah, Tanka. Wait is she a wrestler. That's from saying Tanka wrestler from the 80s. Yes. Yeah. Well, I mean, but here's a question.

She must be friends with fucking Elizabeth Warren She's one 32,000th Tanka But like you know, so I'm looking at all of the stuff coming out dude. I think that shit was on purpose Maybe yeah, I mean look people do stupid shit like me just look at some of her past remarks about Trump She wrote this article on NPR the headline reading former president Trump faces criticism of using language reminiscent of Hitler Right saying that the language echoes language used by eight off Hitler and raises questions about authoritarianism raising Rising in the United States. Yeah, it's only those two guys that I've ever said that word I also heard and I don't know if this is true or not But I saw a picture of Hitler drinking a bottle of water and then Trump You Trump drink it. I saw drinking a bottle of water as well. So I saw Hitler petting a dog. Oh, sure. So that means he was really into German shovers. That means that means We have to kill all the dogs because they're evil dogs are related to Hitler. I get it There's a spawn of Hitler. It makes sense. Yeah, you think about it. Did I think she did that shit on purpose, bro? She probably did Yeah, it was probably a fucking uh A German attack. She probably grubbed some of her germs on there. Yeah stuck it in trouble. Oh fuck, bro. Yeah, that's how they get them California that's not even a felony in California anywhere. Yeah, no shit. You just give somebody eight Yeah I just wanted to throw that in there.

Yeah, well, it means come on Well, I'm sitting back then like bro. I hear it probably like really fucking each other up Yeah, there was this thing they used to do where they would take a little razor and cut right above the eyebrow lines You couldn't see it and that's where the blood would come from like that's commitment. I guess I'm not doing that no I'm not doing that. Yeah, fuck that bro Andre the giant Andre the giant used to drink a hundred fucking beers at the city You know that I'm hungry beers if I had to do something a hundred times to get fucked up I would switch to something else just go go to crack Just go crack cocaine smoking cocaine free-based cocaine dude Get some hundred beers There's a picture if you google on the internet of him holding a beer holding a beer king dude looks like a child Yes, it looks like a fake kids beer can. Yeah Yeah, like one of those fucking like the one Ryan has for a fucking kitchen set type thing. Yeah, that's what it looks like It's crazy Um, but yeah, let's let's keep this cruise movement. We got we got some interesting stuff on the horizon here First thing is the dims. I mean they're they're falling apart left. I call them communist. We call them communist on the show They're falling completely apart. Lowest approval rating 29% I mean I've actually seen it in some places where like the actual those who approve of them are like seven percent 29% on CNN. So it's half of that it's half of that. Yeah, statistically. Yeah You know, but stop them Crockett on Schumer Saying many Americans want younger fresher leadership. Oh, this is Jasmine Crockett. Jasmine Crockett Have you seen the video of her before she became a congresswoman? Yeah, she was like a fucking misproper. Yeah, we call that code switching Code switching. Yeah, what do me we? Huh? Well, I mean you know you said you grew up with us We Around and as I know I'll still I'll fucking cut that chain Oh You think you think those fucking you locks are gonna stop me. Yeah, no chance. No, I've got a de waltz grinder. Yeah, take that thing right down Yeah, I'm with it. But yeah, she's uh she's uh She's she's hopping in here. She said uh she made a statement saying uh quote I understand that the American people are frustrated. Please believe many of us did not sleep because we were calling and trying to impress upon the senators Uh the importance of pushing back in this moment as you saw We had all but one Democrat in the house that voted for this so that's 212 Democrats in the house And then you have the vast majority of senators vote for it We vote against it as well And so this idea that Chuck Schumer is the only one that's got a brain in the room and the only one that can think through all of the pros and cons is absolutely ridiculous Now here's the interesting thing right do you guys remember like I think maybe a week ago two weeks ago um Where we realized that they were all saying the exact same thing yeah, there was like that montage that came out right It was very scripted. I think they were trying to that you know, they sat down in the chair holding a little fucking microphone thing Um, they have a new script. Oh, they just got police. Have you seen it yet? No, but before we get into that imagine believing the Chuck Schumer has brain Or a jatcher leader to be fair. I mean she's so this whole thing is fake right yeah These this CR is the continuation of Biden's budget from 2024. That's all it is the one that they voted for So they're against the thing they just voted for yeah, because Republicans are for it a couple of months ago That is retarded right well just to be clear just show you they're not They yeah No, well, they have a new script now um, and uh, I got we got you know just this quick montage here But yeah, just drop the shake this up The strength that we have is in this moment listen to your constituents Center them in this moment But I can tell you that there are a lot of people that are watching his leadership In this moment. This is the moment. No, I think about what's happening uh, you know in this moment What's important is that we meet this moment So are these current Democrats the ones to meet the moment? What do you want to see us doing right now in this moment? And which Democrats are actually going to stand up Against Elon Musk and Donald Trump in this moment fight that you all are exhibiting is not just what the base wants But it's what this moment requires Hmm What are you guys doing in this moment? Oh, man, that's embarrassing. I'm thinking about how fucking stupid these people How stupid you got to be to now understand that everything you say is on camera and recorded and can and there's people out there They're looking for this. Yeah, 24 hours a day. How can you not understand that everything you say and do is going to be on camera and people Like what you can tell they learned the lesson from the last time they're trying to like have a little ad lib going on there Yeah, well, the though. Here's the other issue with this um chris murphy and center Right and then uh, Tim walls their establishment people and then you have Uh, uh, aoc pressley and jasmine crock at the top. They're supposed to be Part of the the young progressive wing that's not we're not part of the establishment anymore With swap clearly are cuz we're all using our talking rights, right? Yeah, like don't try to like a especially aoc She's such a fucking fraud everything she says and does is a fucking fraud Er, anytime so she came into congress as the most radical person and every time she votes with them for credit party No matter what right no matter what kind of stupid bullshit it is she always does No, when they said radical they meant like no the fake arrest as you try to do or like when she got like went down to the border to see the kids And nobody was really there. Oh, she just really doesn't like chain like fences. Yeah, that's what that one really really radical cry really radical Yeah, but so you got that going on new script coming in. Well, uh, I'm sure this montage will probably be another one next week Yeah, also this like three weeks in the row now bro, they also love to like try to present Everything as like an historic event that they're a part of like history You want to be on the right side of history in this moment. It's like dude shut the fuck up. It's this history on x Right like if you can't uh if you can't get somebody if you don't have a compelling argument to make you just make it sound like it's the end of the world. Yeah, that's what they do and by you attack the character of the person to say it Yeah, I just want to reiterate this again This thing that they're talking about the CR that they hate is their budget from last year It's literally the one that they fucking put into place and the Biden's signed. That's it's there's no difference. Yeah Fucking ass hats. Yeah, that's a good word for the day I love how they all try to make a team Jeffries like he's out to be the fucking next Obama. Yeah, and like that's a good thing He's a straight communist like that's a good thing like people fucking hate Obama. Yeah, team of Obama. I think it's what people are saying now Yeah, team Obama. Yeah, team Obama team. Yeah, yeah Um, yeah, you got that going on and other news going on right now. Um, did you guys see that uh The French for now demanding that we return the the statute of living? They're welcome to come try and take it That's what I think that's I'm on the board come and get it. I'd love to see that come come and get it. Where the I mean how do you remove it? I really gonna do Oh You guys got enough shit the word. Well, I mean, I think so they're they're saying your president's married to a dude bro You worried about the wrong statute They're saying we should return it uh, we're not they it's not the French government is one so long ago Yeah, he wants us to return it. I mean, and after this is the the Really insulting part is after we had the common season see the chisel the arm hair off of it Before we actually put it up in New York, right? If you look at the one that's actually in France still it's grown Yeah, you know These people are out of their minds like Europe is um I don't I don't really know what the average european citizen thinks I would love to hear from some of them like are you okay with your country being invaded like do you know about the barberry pirates and the And the Ottoman Empire that this is just like a hundred years ago. Yeah, not the fun It was just a hundred years ago. Yeah, that this stuff got shut down Do you really not remember that like do you have you read a history book? It's always a problem that people do who have no concept of history or in charge of people's futures, right? these people have been eased into globalism thinking To where now its group think throughout the Western Europe region But there's no way that the average like Italian middle-aged citizen or Spanish or whatever else especially Spanish because they actually they've had to kick out the Ottomans a couple times are okay with this hoard of lunatics being pushed into their country. There's no way they're okay with that I know quite a few people that live in Europe and the ones I've talked to They all think they believe Which is incredible that Trump is the problem and what I think is weird is They've these people have been indoctrinated and inched into Thinking that globalism and and a communism and no national identity is Freedom and so that's like dude these fucking people even here Like they've been the leftists have been so brainwashed That they think they're the freedom fighters. Yeah, like they think they're the patriots. Well, that's what the whole EU was even established War was like that was a massive so when they look at like what Trump's doing they don't see it as you know The moving closer to freedom they see it as moving closer to the direction that they're already in you know Which is it's like guys? Have you ever stopped and actually tried to understand or look at anything other than what the media has been telling you? No Yeah, do you remember that uh that little speech from newsroom Jeff Bridges Or sorry Jeff Daniels where he's like that college girls like who lies in America the best country of the world Which is a different and he's like it's not yeah It is actually he's like Canada has freedom France has freedom like no they don't actually yeah They don't can you say whatever you want without Legal repercussions then you don't have freedom buff face yeah, what I mean But that's that's been the trope over the last 15 20 years or so that Europe is somehow on par with the United States and that we share something like now we don't share anything with you We are the continuation of English civilization. That's what americans. Yeah, we're the ones that got it right We took everything good about england and we kicked out all the bullshit and we made a country out of it right? Yes 200 years ago we took the most functional civilization and the history of human beings And when I say functional, I mean economic power military power and the way that they're the English common law Had developed over the years and we brought it here and we gave it to Jefferson and Thomas pain and John Stewart Mill and people like this And they refined it into what is the best country that's ever existed and probably will ever exist on this fucking planet and comparing the United States to Europe or Canada or any of this stuff get fucked I agree with you. These people are begging to be governed by somebody Always and what they don't understand is the history of Europe is the history of totalitarianism It always happens in one form or another and right now they're building the mech and they're building the infrastructure from some lunatech Like Hitler to come in and take control. Let's build one government for everybody. Okay, cool So now one guy can come in and fucking take over that whole fucking plan out of your goddamn mind Do you not see the problem? No, bro, but they don't they don't see the problem. That is their plan their plan Is to get everybody to buy into this global is shit, okay? and to create a situation where they could come in and remove Western whites from the equation through a genocide that's what the fuck they're working to do and they're repopulating their Their countries with these people from all over the place Because in their mind these people are easy to control and rule and Bro, work. It's a dangerous situation. What is dangerous? I mean especially because globally white white people actually in minorities globally You know, I mean, it's like fucking eight percent. You know, I'm saying something. Yeah, I mean, it's it's a day America right now. Do you know what percentage of the population in the United States are natural born citizens and what are not 16% Of Americans or people that live are living in America right now are not natural born citizens 16% the highest ever in this country's history Right now in 2025 not During you're saying 16% are not natural born correct. Yeah, it's the highest it's ever been In this country. It's higher than it was. I mean, that makes sense because you just brought in 17 million fucking people It's higher than it was in the 1890s like from from the 1890s through the 1920s the Ellis Islands, right? So it was 1890s and again, I think in 1913 to 15 was a second round I believe yeah that even during that period We're higher now than they were ever back then as a percentage not total right as a percentage Yeah, and we're way bigger than we were like what four or five times larger population wise and we were back then Yeah, millions and millions of people in this country I mean we're tired that what's what's 16% of 330 million Too fucking many that that's like 55 million people something like that. It's crazy, bro Dude, what the fuck you you can't you can do some damage with 55 million people and you don't deserve to be here Nobody does right you don't you're you are our guest Until you fucking go through the process Well, fuck what they think here I get that the price for admission is assimilation You come here to become an American motherfucker If you're not planning on doing that get your ass don't bring your fucking culture here. Yeah, I don't give a shit about your culture Otherwise, I'd move there I mean if it culture's so good to go fucking back to it. That's right. You don't mean like dude. I'm with you That Jeff Daniels thing though. He doesn't he say Isn't his whole rebuttal about like statistically proving how America he says America is not the greatest yes Yeah, that's why I thought yeah, he goes we're 29th of math we're this and that we're this and this and this and this and this and this and this Yeah, we're 29th in math because of the Department of Education. Yeah, we were third in math the year before the Department of Education. Yeah third 78 or in history And look we're not gonna beat the Chinese come on Just not gonna happen Well, I mean, you know other things you got you know that are going on here Because this is this is also interesting Um last little piece on this this this French hold on I agree on the assimilation shit too by the way like 1000 fucking percent Like the last thing I want to do is be walking down the street and fucking seeing 4000 different fucking people doing for that like dude. I saw this video I didn't want to get into it. Um, yeah, and then McCrone just came out today Calling on the EU to ditch American weapons As Europe's boycott United States movement gross and now like they're all trying to gang up against us Was I think what's part of the plan to begin with that's why the EU was created in the first place? That's what I was saying Economic counterpart to the United States to the US for what reason Like they're not even fucking close. Yeah, you guys don't make there's no there are no energy reserves on the continent of Europe except for Russia and Ukraine Right, I mean, there's there's small bits here in there. You know for not having much. They sure make a lot of demands. Yeah But I say conquer them all Like I'm just saying conquer them all bro. I'll go to yeah, I love to see there. We fly there on the same US passport. Let's roll You know, but another little last news. I want to wrap this this first set up though But this just came out today as well. I'm not sure if you guys saw this because you are also we also alluded to some accountability earlier Andy this might change how you feeling. I don't know The cellar meets trump says Biden's auto pin pardons are void vacant and of no further force or effect valves probe of J6 house select committee So this just came out This this just came out early this morning before the show was recorded Trump had truth he put a truth out about this about this topic He says quote the pardons that sleepy Joe Biden gave to the unselect committee of political thugs and many others are here by declared void vacant and of no further force or effect Because of the fact they were done by auto pin Trump posted on truth social early Monday morning Now there's been a lot of stuff that's come out about this too About the auto pin. I know we if we've covered it when it first you know first got dropped that this was auto pin And I said I mean, okay, like I get it right like there's plenty of things that go on in business or I Obviously the country where yeah auto pin is still there no big deal, but I feel like there's certain things That you know that require that should require like the actual president actually fucking sign in it And I feel like pardons should be definitely one of those things Trade agreements war like you can't auto pin that shit you shouldn't be able to at least But it's interesting because now we got we might have a name to who's been doing this And this is the interesting part You know we talk about the cabal deep state whatever you want to call it running, you know making the calls behind the play And apparently there is an aid That was literally hitting the button on all of this shit and we have a name. So let's dive into this is this the key aid behind Biden auto pin pardons Biden White House staff secretary Lashes out at Trump for declaring Biden's auto pin pardons void her name is nira Tandine Nira Tandine she tweeted this out she says quote more importantly does this mean everything with the Trump auto pin signature is void in this Administration in the last because there's a lot by auto pin and every administration some Enterprising lawyers may want to sue To which the oversight project which is who released this You know couple of weeks ago They replied directly to her Saying you were White House staff secretary when Biden auto pin pardons from the golf course in USVI is this you And then they you know cemented the proof. I mean here's an auto pin that was done This was done on December 30th of 2022 And this was you know put out as a press release and all of that good stuff But you know the president's schedules kept meticulously We know where they go how long they're there and all of that good stuff and yet Biden Was in the virgin islands This was also around the time he went and then that turnie general who was looking into That bank for the Epstein shit was also fired same exact trip kind of interesting Yeah, that was put in then too. So I mean if if you know who all it wasn't just the j6 select committee They got the pre-emptive pardons. Fouchy. There's a lot of people the attorney general mayor garland got one a hundred Biden got one that was from 2013 until presents James Biden. I mean it was a lot of brother got one. Yeah, and they were all auto pin So if none of them are in fact, I mean, you know again, I mean I don't know what the purpose of the pardons to begin with if they did nothing wrong You know and but I mean if they shouldn't the pain. So I think that you know kind of shows something Now what are they gonna do about it? I don't know. I mean, this isn't good. This isn't legal frankly, which piece um Trump but whatever Trump said no all he did was tweet something yeah to be honest because article two section two of the Considus is very clear that the president has imp like completely Unmolested access to that only the president could do that nobody can stop him Frankly, right? I mean that's the partens yeah, right but the problem the question is whether he did it or not But here's so like just play it out in your head legally speaking. They call Biden Into the room with the White House council and ask him hey, did you sign this pardon? Or did you approve this pardon? Always got to say yes and it's over right then right right and he will like you know Now you're not gonna get some cognitive test I'm not saying that he's right and I think it's very clear to everybody that Biden Was never conscious during any part of his presidency I don't I don't buy the like oh sometime in 2022 no The whole time he was retarded. That's why he was fucking run. Yeah. Yeah, the whole time You know, I put a lot of man he was run to create the illusion Of in competency so that they could get away with the shit that they did yeah If you had a guy in there who was competent and said we're gonna let the border open and 70 brother be a revolt all right, so everybody in America was Is Manipulated into thinking that Biden was this poor feeble fragile senile man, which he was All the while they did all of these damaging things to the country intentionally to bring it down All right, so no derbuses what it was yeah, no bro. It was straight up manipulation and lies and They did it so that they could get closer into a globalist society. Yeah Well, there's so there's two major cases on this States versus Klein from 1872 and then X partate Garland in 1866 um and both courts affirmed that once a pardon is issued it's issued unless you can prove fraud Which is what they may try to do but I don't I just don't see how you do it. Yeah, like how do you prove Well, I mean, it's easy to prove the right time. Yeah, dude. How do you say that the auto pen for that is doesn't work when it's accepted in other In other areas right I mean, I think we all know what the fuck happened. Yeah, I agree It's it's it's an impossible case to make to be honest because um unless somebody like even Even if everybody and that worked for Biden testified that he was mentally Out of it, right? You can't prove that he was on that specific moment, right? That's what matters. So I don't see that going anywhere to be honest I think this is just a publicity stunt. I think a lot of things he says are for that a lot of things he says are for getting everybody Riled up About how great of a thing he's doing and then mostly it doesn't happen Yeah, the smarter move to to would be to uh, Sapena these people Sapena Falchie and start asking them questions because he can't be charged with anything that he did while in government because of this pardon But every time he lies under oath he can be charged with contempt of Congress which you can uh, you know That's three years and thirty thousand dollar fine. He's keep doing that over and over keep him in there a couple days Until he racks up a hundred years and throw his ass in prison for the rest of his life Hmm, that's how they do it and he can't use the fifth amendment. Yeah, right you Well, they do it indirectly bro. You see these these no, no, they can't he can't do it They do things like I don't I don't recall well, then then that would be a crime as well, right? That would be a crime of a mission. It's still a crime So once you get a receive a pardon the fifth amendment no longer applies because you can't be is that a crime of a mission if you don't recall Yeah, I mean if you could be proved that he does recall if I could show him evidence like hey Here's your fucking signature on something you don't recall signing this. I don't recall like well here it is Here's the evidence. Did you do it or not? Well, yes, I did all right there good now you've said it Forced that forced these people to say this shit that they did out loud Dude listen real talk I don't agree with any of that shit I think the country needs a total fucking dictator that is fucking Morley online that's gonna come in and clean the fucking shit out and set it back where it was I hope Trump does do this and I hope he breaks a lot of do it and put these motherfuckers in wood shipper Maybe he has immunity shit, dude. I don't even think I don't even think Trump's the guy to be that guy Well, he maybe not but you know Biden just set a precedent nobody's ever given a preemptive pardon before Yeah, and Trump is well, but then his rights to on his last day in office to give himself a lifetime preemptive pardon for anything you might ever do Yeah, right and if they try to charge him with something and then You know the Republicans can always go back and charge these other guys, but I agree I think History is pretty clear that a benevolent dictator is better than any other type of government That's what I'm saying, but the problem is succession right like who the no no forever forever uh Augustus Caesar you get a tibarius who literally raped little babies babies, right? Yeah, you get a nero and a Caligula you get three of those for every one good when you get what we need is a seller A seller why yeah because you need someone to restore What this country is supposed to be and that's what the fuck that guy did yeah, you know But and then it was sets, you know You set the country up for another and another hundred years it could get corrupt again But in my opinion we do need a benevolent dictator who would come in Wipe the slate clean punish people it need to be punished Reset the country to where it should be what the values it's supposed to have and then let it go from there Then that person should step down and let the process work itself somewhere between Sulla and Cincinnati's then yeah Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to think about I don't know why people are so offended by the idea of an oligarchy One like we don't have one and haven't always had one even in this so-called democracy, right? We've always had it but You know do the thought experiment yourself should most people be involved in running the government no Like not only that most people like real talk We would fix a lot of problems by just making the voting system More exclusive to where if you have a tax return that you paid in the system You are awarded a vote if you not have a tax return You are not allowed to vote Because dude part of the problem here is we have a bunch of mother fuckers that don't do shit Voting for more free shit from the people who are out there working. Can I run a thought experiment by you? Yeah Okay, let's say You have an impoverished class of some sort it doesn't have to be on racial lines or any just the impoverished It doesn't matter any of their other demographics throw them out the window. It's just poor people right that's all you got right Okay, no, no, no, I'm just saying just focus on this one group. Okay, so what's to stop the class that has had success in the past from Dominating them for interperpetuity Well, apparently we already do that. Well, we do We do but it's what's to stop the power the impoverished class from stealing from the class that works When they are given equal rights to the people who as a people sure I mean, you go both ways, but I'm talking about what's happening now. I'm talking about your idea That's called a dictatorship of the minority. I believe is what that's what you're from to or mean America Yeah, I mean, that's what's that's where they're pushing towards because but they don't have any real power right? They're just being led along. They're being I mean do you go jail if you don't pay your tax? Well, you should yeah, I mean not should I hate taxes or bullshit, but like in I mean And I was just according to the law according to law. Yeah, right, but here the issues this um The people who are currently functioning well, right? And our goal should be to make sure everybody's functioning well totally agree The northern European countries handle this quite a bit better than we do you have yet so you mentioned before about putting limits on social welfare And so like that they don't have it, but what they do have is the government fucking Just straight up tells you Your job doesn't exist anymore. You got to go fucking learn to do some melts and will help you But you're going to learn or you're getting the fuck out. Yeah, we're not gonna help you forever Um, now I don't think the government should be involved in that. I'm kind of curious where all the church Tax-free money's going to deal with these social issues to be honest, but so back to the other part What is to stop the let's call them the ruling class and that will mean that as a purge orative I mean literally that's what they would be if they if they're the only ones with the vote then they're the ruling class That's how it is right and every every civilization including ours is hapline. Mm-hmm. Don't pretend like we haven't right Uh, so what's to stop them? But that means you're part of the ruling class. I am yeah, so what but what's to stop us? I guess if we want to code it that way from disenfranchising them forever We could vote if if that's how it works they have they have the freedom to remove themselves from that class By getting a job and paying taxes sure But what if I what if I do something like shouldn't a vote be valuable A valuable enough to where you don't just vote for the fucking person that the media tells you? Oh, yeah, I mean there should be some there should be consequences Do you think that our vote is that valuable now? No, right? I think our vote's bullshit But that's not the point I'm making the point I'm making is let's say I understand let's say the ruling class decides We're gonna require work permits for everything and you now we're running a lottery because we don't want all these people to be involved in our work anymore, right? So now we're issuing people work permits We're deciding who gets to succeed and who doesn't now we're just the government again You know what I mean? I do I do but I also believe that we should Allow those people to go get jobs. I mean I see it as intrinsic motivation to have a say in what's going on yeah, right? Starship troopers right? You're gonna be right you serve serve the army you become a citizen you get voting rights And I don't I don't think what you do with the army. No, no, no, I don't want people but that concept There should be some value created With my point is this I understand your point. Mm-hmm, but my point and by the way In real life That's what always happens what you're saying. Yeah, but that's why I say it Understand that's where it invigorates. Once power, you know, what is it? Absolute power corrupts absolutely and that's just human nature. Yeah but We are in such a situation now to where There are so many people that don't contribute that have a say that they're actually voting us into a Socialist slash communist oh, yeah situation let me at least start well, that's right So where the producers are gonna say fuck it which then what ends up happening is the government runs everything Yeah, but it's already happened right because the producers outsourced they went to India and China and wherever else for the They think in the sense of this we're like I mean I agree there should be some changes to the international trade So that that doesn't happen like it has and I think Trump is doing that yeah But they're it what people don't understand and what they have a hard time grasping Honestly because most people will never run a business. Yeah, is that there's going to be a time between when the tariffs go in and the taxes come down To where it's a difficult economic time. It'll be a recession. That's correct. There's going to be A difficult time before the better time and that's the problem with this but that happens in every business too like you Launch a new product and then you buy bro. You make cuts you cut out 40% of your workers because there's a Dude, it takes a year to get recalibrated to run on a on a less a lesser team. Yeah The problem with government is there and there's always this duality No matter what the system of government happens to be There's going to be authoritarianism to some degree like if you don't think that America is what there should be To some degree right there has to be like people need leadership, right? Yeah So you have to choose between and it this is this is where it gets super fucked up because some of it is just principled philosophy And then some of it is practical But principled philosophy isn't always practical in execution. It's a problem, right? So you either have like it's it's more difficult To corrupt a group of people than it is to corrupt one man for sure right? Yeah, it takes more time and effort But it's also more difficult to defeat a group of people than it is to defeat one man And we believe in decentralization here federalism We believe in the ninth and tenth amendments, which means if it's not specifically written as constitution the federal government Doesn't even have a right to a pine on it. It's under your fucking business What I'm doing if it's not written that document that we all made yeah, so you know when I go back to it Um, I'm talking about how to correct it. Yeah, yeah I mean, I think about I think that I think I agree with I do to I think the Constitution's a perfect document Legitimately, and I think it is literal. I think when they say you know, we have the right to bear arms that the the whole You know the whole argument there isn't For automatic weapons, bro. It's for everything they fucking have So that we can count really that's right. Yeah, so you know, I mean But do what I'm saying is there has to be a correctional correction period to get us back to that because if if you try to do this through the corrupt system It could at best it's going to take decades at worst it'll never happen because of the bureaucracy that's infected our system It's already celebrity must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is a naturally occurring manure I think we are close. Yeah, that's what Jefferson said so yeah I mean, that's probably part of it to be honest and when I think of it like in terms of recourse because that's what when when I would be really clear about this people get This is one of the most misunderstood things in all of American history um The founders of this country the continental congress they weren't writing to to England about becoming a free nation they were writing for redress They were writing their taxation without representation. That's where the phrase came from right They were saying hey, we're citizens of the British crown. We expect to be treated as such and we were not so fuck you We're gonna leave that's what really happened right they didn't say no kings. Yeah, that wasn't part of it They didn't like the founders When when John Adams so you're the boss of massacre happens right these troops Spurred on by the sons of liberty trying to rabble rals because they hated the British They shot some people somebody died the whole group went to trial John Adams our second president defended them in court and got them exonerated in court in American court And he referred to himself as a British citizen and the documents that he wrote back to them because that's what he was in the tally saw himself And then the crown decided to bring all tribunals back to London right Even even though they had adjudicated it fairly they still brought him back and that was the final straw for him I was like well fuck you now they did that so that because the the colonies were so small If the American court were to convicted those dudes their families would have been killed. Yeah, yeah But no they they so they were exonerated there right in the American courts John Adams proved that the United States could function on its own I think that was a threat to them, which is why they tried to bring it back But this whole process like if you read about if you if you read the preamble to the Constitution It's like when a when a government like the government has a job and when it comes Uh I can't remember the exact phrase, but when it stops functioning in that way then it's the not just the right but the duty of people to throw that government on Sorry, it's a duty. Yeah, so it's like When I when I think of it like that people think in America that we're just against kings and As a soldier I would feel a lot better fighting for a king that fought alongside me like king of Della and Jordan Then I would any of these fucking gay lords in Congress dude, I mean, dude. I mean, that's another rule like fucking bro If you fucking vote for a war you you better go to fuck over there Well, you know jay so Jared's got a theory on that. He says That if you're in congress Either house or the president and you vote for sign a war or deploy people you have to send to your family. Yeah I think that's fair. We have completely different Geopolitical situation. Yeah, we know what Yeah, you shouldn't be deploying people. Well, I think we can both agree on this. Yeah, I mean, tyrants Yeah, I mean, I don't like tyrants are the problem. It's not the system of government specifically obviously Capital no works better than any of the system government our government Dude listen here people what you know this already so I'm I mean, we talk about this all the time It's not that our system is broken. It's that the way they're running it doesn't reflect the system that was set up at all And we're told it does we're told we have freedom. We do not have fucking freedom We're we are paraded alone as a free country when in reality we're one of the most financially oppressed countries in the world By our own government unless you don't have a job and you get all your shit for free right so I mean dude The the Constitution and everything the way these guys set it up is Perfect legitimately perfect and to be completely honest I'm in awe of how smart they were in terms of anticipating The challenges that we would have and what they didn't account for was technology and the internet and all of these things To subvert The foundational rules Work to mean and so Bro, I believe in the you know, I do I believe in the Constitution like literally yes literally But we're so far off from that is the problem Yeah, I mean, we've got a course correct somehow and I think you know We also have to end some of these delusions that we have one that We're a democracy we're not right There's only been there's only been one direct democracy in the history of the world and it was in Greece and Athens and they Shut it off after two years because it was fucking nuts. Well, yeah, bro People that invented democracy said no, we can't do that but people don't understand why that is Look if you've ever led anybody in your life in any situation You understand the need for leadership Because if there is none and there isn't someone who can lead and say do this we have to do this These people will all stand there and argue about whose idea is right and who's the best and could I get credit for this And I said this and I think we should do it this way. You know what ends up happening? Fuckin nothing, okay So anybody that's ever run a company understands that anybody who's ever been a leader in the military understands that dude If there's no leader Dude the guys get fucking killed. Yeah, okay, and dude So we have to understand that some people need to have say that is more powerful than A group Think you know what I mean and people don't like that when they hear that they think well fucking Hitler That's where they automatically go and it's like dude, you know Some of the most prosperous countries in the history of the world were led by one person. Right and I don't know bro like I don't know the solution But to get people to understand that we need a Leader like a legit leader that's gonna say this that this It's very hard because everybody wants to have a say and you know who wants to have the most say The motherfuckers don't pay in People doing the fucking least man. Yeah, I mean guys jumping on this conversation Let us know what you guys think with that being said. Let's keep this cruise moving. We'll go right into headline too um This is the interest of one so uh Trump deported 238 Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador Yeah, now this was picked up some heat so so uh he flew to a plane full of these guys Um, he flew him over to El Salvador. Um, we have a great relationship Uh, with the president Um of El Salvador naïve Kaylee Um, he tweeted this out. He says uh today The first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization trend day arongo arrived in our country They were immediately transferred to seasot which is the terrorism confinement center Uh for a period of one year which is renewable he says in parentheses The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us over time these actions Now combined with the production already being generated by more than 40,000 inmates engaged in various workshops and labor Under the zero idleness program We'll help make our prison system self-sustainable as of today. It costs 200 million dollars per year Um, on this occasion the US has also sent us 23 MS 13 members wanted by Salvadorian justice Including two ring leaders Uh, one of them is a member of the criminal organization's highest structure Um, it's well-placed finalized intelligence gathering and go after the last remnants of MS 13 including its former and new members Money weapons drugs hideouts collaborators and sponsors Uh, he finishes off saying may god bless El Salvador may god bless the United States of America Now there's a little video. It's three minutes long. We'll play just a little bit here for you Um, but the video is fucking awesome. This is uh them as they were getting taken off of the air playing and being transferred to seasaw check this out Hey, bro, that all looks fine I Mean it's just dragging them in the back of these fucking listen. I'm cool with it I'm cool with the fucking cool. There has to be fear of repercussions for people to not do bad shit Bro, even the biggest baddest fucking, you know who you would think would be the biggest bro. They cry crumble. Yeah crumble now They crumble now, but here's a thing on this so uh, you know The plane gets there landed and apparently a federal judge uh, who's an abama appointed judge Um, he orders the deportation flights carrying the alleged Venice, Wailing Gang bangers to return to United States Um, and he blocks trump from invoking the alien enemies act with it, which is what trump used to get them over there Uh, but naïve being a great troll that he is tweeted this out in response saying oopsie too late No, I really think we're bringing them back brother there. They're some president That's funny here president of al Salvador put that out oopsie too late. Yeah, let me fair um Just a couple of couple things here one trump doesn't need to use the alien act of 7098 for this There's USC 1227 and USC 11 82 both are very clear One says that if you're here and you're not a citizen that is including green guard holders, right? But visa holders and green guard holders and it definitely applies to illegals That if you endorse if you support endorse even immaterially, which means you don't have to give the money or anything All you have to say is like I like Hamas gone see ya It's pretty clear. I mean it says it right there in black and white A federal judge has no jurisdiction to look into law that's been passed and by the way Jordan versus the George 1951 Clinonets versus Mandel 1972 i and s versus St. Seer 2001 Leacole versus Ashcroft 2004 sessions versus Dimaia 2018 at trumpers of y 2018 This statue these two statues 1227 1182 USC Have been tried and retried and the supreme court for a hundred years. Fuck you Like they absolutely should ignore everything in any of these judges say You don't have any you don't have jurisdiction to tell the president how to execute But on the book laws and the executive branch. I'm sorry. This is not how our government works Well Tom Homan would agree with you Because he does out the radical judge for defying logic with ruling to stalled trumped reportation says uh, he said quote who in their right mind whether you're a judge or not once to allow TDA That's trender rongo a recognized terrorist organization sent here by the Maduro regime To great havoc to unsettle the united states through the use of fintonautical thousands of americans Violence to american citizens raping and murdering young women in this country homo x fox and friends he says president trump is going to make this country safe again He's going to do it one illegal alien at a time now. Yeah, push because i said they're using the illegal enemies act to do this which is i mean over a hundred years old cool But so it's 200 years old. I don't give a shit how old it is. Yeah, it doesn't won't neither this time homie Because he had this to say we're gonna report a try to You say to those who claim you're using a 200 year old law to circumvent you frozen a no law Now there's always constitution. We still pay attention that don't we Dude is great bro. I do like that guy. No, he's I like her band. I like him a lot. Yeah times a good dude Yeah, but you had do you know him uh, we've Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Fuck bro. He's awesome. I love him too. I fucking like him a lot. Yeah, he doesn't give a shit I feel like I feel like he has some dark human that you've got him in a room bro I mean he was a cop forever. Yeah, like he has that cop vibe. Yeah, yeah, bro speaking of cops. Did you hear that uh Did you hear that law they're trying to do Missouri where if Uh, you send if a police officer sends their kids to school they get to go for free. No, I hear that yeah, it's uh It's called I got to mean like to university and shit Yeah, I just yeah, that's so they do Texas does that for anybody's got a purple heart I thought it was fucking awesome or a hundred percent disability rating There's a lot of states to do that actually. So it's called Senate bill 71 here in Missouri and basically What it does is it gives first responders Free college for their kids which I think is fucking amazing in the state of Missouri Yeah, and I think that's something you know when when you guys go to vote Our call your set your state senators and make sure that they pass this shit bro because these people are out in the streets Fucking dealing with the worst shit ever all day long and uh Dude I'm by opinion they get paid three or four times less than what they should be paid Especially with the amount of money these fuckers have been stealing through USAID and all this shit We could dude it's so frustrating because we could pay these people so much more they be so much more comfortable because this is a difficult job to do The least we could do is allow them to send their kids to be educated for fucking free. I mean the average cop Qualifies with their service weapon two times a year With 50 rounds right that's unacceptable. Yeah, no, and a country this large We need to have a legitimate professional police force now. We don't it's not for a lack of effort on their part They just don't have the time to see as we're like you spent you spend eight hours a day on patrol Maybe 10 depending on what what jurisdiction or another two or three hours doing fucking paperwork I'm sorry. I go into the range after that. Yeah, and if you did you get it Listen the job needs to be restructured to where these guys get paid properly They have the proper benefits and then what would happen is we would remove ourselves from the element of shit bag cops because the job would become Very valued asset again. We would have children saying I want to be a cop. Yeah, I want to be a police That's dude when I grew up. That's how it was yeah, yeah, yeah, you know And and dude with the amount of money that's wasted here Yes, it's easy fix and there's also so many downstream benefits I mean anybody that work this is I don't want to get to and the weeds on it But anybody that understands economic theory like you just think about lock and general John lock and general right this idea that The ultimate right is the property right and the ultimate properties yourself right and you are entitled to defend it However you want right and we've chosen as a society to hire a professional police force to help us with that task Now there's value to that outside of just safety like you can also look at mazzles hierarchy needs safeties right there. It's number one but you can also look at downstream from property rights is security right security So in a number of different ways not just physical security if you're an investor or you're a person Let's take it back to the pioneer days if you're gonna go somewhere and discover something and build a house And then maybe build a city there you need to know that your assets gonna be protected that means the government's gonna not gonna allow somebody to come in and just steal your shit Because otherwise what's the point? You know what I mean? What's the point of working nine to five what's the point of working 12 hours a day if somebody could just come steal your shit? Well, that's what I mean yeah, exactly right so part one of the functions of government is to stop that from happening That's the one of the whole purposes of it. So Yeah, I hate the government. There's a function there I want you to do what you're supposed to do and do it well. I'm not the more to fuck out everything else right so This this do them familiar with Jared Isaacman. I don't know if you've heard of him or not. He ran He's the only privateer to ever go to space He like went to space on his own dime basically right it's fucking wild but before that he was doing consult like red cell consulting for the Air Force He learned how to fly mig jets and then built this company where uh They're testing Air Force pilots on their ability to dogfight and she's like he's as a private citizen Did this shit he came from the same thing that Elon did from payment processing and shit like that and he's like you know what? This seems like something to do Um now he's been nominated to be the NASA administrator and I know you're a flat-earther but they're all nine I am there is uh are you no fucking okay? Kyrie Irving is though. That's why his knee got fucked up, but Because I was too flat No, but uh Of all the government shit that we're doing one of the biggest returns on our investments I can't believe you called me a flat-earther bro. I'm fucking offended. I don't think this is they take a fencer Yeah, yeah, because you're fucking retarded. I'm a flat-earther. Yeah, well it's I'm at like full-fledged. It's a black thing I guess now maybe yeah, maybe I mean lizard. I'm not like all the way there, but like you know I Prove I mean I've seen I shelf theories more likely than flat-earth. I believe in both of them. I would can't There are different things said who All right anyway, so we're gonna have an intelligent conversation so uh now of all the Of all the things that we've spent money on collectively as a government NASA's probably been the one that has the biggest return on investment, right? Like every piece of technology. Well, I mean that fucking movie they made about land on the moon I But but everything that you're using right now to do what we're doing right now was made as a result of that organization NASA right like literally everything these or that technology The way these mics where who knows but they're the ones that got it the phones that we're using the computers that we're using all this stuff the internet Developed as a result of NASA as well and GPS everything you use on a daily basis One of the only organizations That has primarily been a federal organization that actually benefits people and a real meaningful way and it doesn't just fuck people over NASA's never fucked anybody over maybe trick the couple people just like a couple time. Yeah, but It's it's the only organization that actually fun. They never fucked anybody over once they were became NASA's where you're saying correct Yeah, yeah, uh and it's To me, it's wild man. We just defunded it a while back But this is how we beat other people the next so there's two There while there's three main races going on. We're not in an arms race anymore. We're in an AI race We get a beat China and AI. We have to beat them in energy not clean energy energy The more energy you reproduce the better society is period. There's a direct line between those things And the third one is space all these fancy satellites We have to defend us and give us information and shit. Don't mean a goddamn thing if somebody can just shoot it down Right, that's the next frontier now. We may be talking about 25 50 years from now But just like every other organization whether it be government or an agency within it or a business you need strong leadership Right and some of these uh, I'm it's been hit or miss with some of these picks for Departments in my opinion. Pambonis sucks. I terrible. I agree um We'll see you on cash. I think you don't think he'll do fine But under her like they get rid of you're gonna see a fucking war between those two. It's something's gonna happen I think yeah, I think and I think she's gonna end up getting replaced by Bailey or something. I think so too It should have been Bailey to start with it definitely should have been Bailey. Yeah, but Uh Isaac Ben is that dude man He's a fucking entrepreneur that's ran multiple businesses made himself a billionaire just by being smart And he's like, you know what? I'm gonna this America used to be great And part of it was going to space and developing technology and and satellites and protecting our shit Right and figuring out how to do stuff and I'm gonna go do it again. Yeah, right That's the kind of guy you want Elon is the kind of guy you want and so whether you agree with him on everything or not and I disagree with him sometimes That's the kind of guy you want looking for inefficiency because he's done it and then sold companies for a million over and over and over Yeah, well dude. This is the other thing people don't know how companies are valued and if your company is heavily inefficient You're going to get a much lesser valuation This is the reason that they come in and audit everything that you do before they buy They say what the fuck we're we're that five cents. Why why what what's that Like the amount of depth they go into is they say yeah, so it's like think about yourself from a CPG Let's say yeah, um this can right here is two separate parts not including the print So it's three things that happen with this can you have the can itself you have the lid which separate and then you have the print on the outside of it If you're locked into a five-year contract It's a shitty contract on one of those items and somebody tries to come buy your company like uh, yeah I'm gonna I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to give you a hundred million dollars less because you made a stupid fucking mistake right You know that people don't understand they don't understand it but like somebody like Elon does So when he's combing through this stuff and find his stuff and cutting it out like great I mean we still need Congress to actually make a permanent which TBD on that But that won't be his fault if it doesn't have and he's doing the right thing I I People are worried about an oligarchy, but when we put billionaires in charge of stuff Why do you think that motherfucker's a billionaire? Well not only that uh because he's got lucky Yeah, he got lucky I like four different times. We're cool It we're cool with them if there are billionaires. Yeah, well that's that's heroes can do it like Certainly certainly, but they never tried to put source directly in charge, but here's the other issue There very they still run a version of an oligarchy. It's just an oligarchy of incompetence. That's correct It's like well, we want we just need this group to be in charge for the next 40 years But what the fuck have you ever done except for being government you've done nothing Pro Joe Biden never had a real job in his life He was 29 years old when he entered Congress and he never had a real job after that. Bro once listen Not a single fucking one of those people could run a one fucking week And one of my retail stores. Yeah, they couldn't do it. They could not do it bro They could they could not do it. It'd be a fun test. It'd be hilarious because they wouldn't get it Yeah, you know, maybe that should be part of the challenge out like you challenge any of them And if they can then you'll vote for no if they can I'll award them a franchise I don't know. Yeah, that's pretty. Yeah, that's pretty nice. Yeah for free. Yeah, oh my dollar. I'll fucking build it out I'll put the whole you know the whole thing All right aoc come on. They can't do it Obama can't do it. Obama can do it. No, they can't do it It's because of what Dan said earlier. They're used to operating with unlimited resources And that's not the way the fucking effective organizations are You have to operate within budget Trump knows this. It's a lot of this is a lot of the reason this is the main reason They all fucking hate him because he won't allow them Well, he did allow them but he's working to not allow them to just fleece American citizens to fucking make themselves rich You know with the I mean look dude That's why the tax argument is such bullshit. They they print all the money. They need anyway Bro, they just found like the taxes are not met now Like the way taxes are presently are not meant to fund anything in the government They are meant to financially create hardship for the American citizen to make them easier to control Did you see Elon Musk just came out today? I think talking about it that they found doge has found 14 He calls them magic money computers That are strategically placed around the government like there's a few in the department of treasury There's a few in the DOD few in the state department HHS and the these fucking computers and they literally like They're cutting checks whatever they need them to do create money out of thin air just if I move in decimal nothing Out of nothing cool. That's not real That's that's always the danger in a fiat currency obviously Well, bro that serves them too. Yeah, because if they print more money than these people have less no matter what they have I'm good. This was in the real but the effects are fucking real The monetary system in the United States is impossible Virtually virtually impossible for someone to come out ahead of it It's just that bad and unless you're out unless you are making an Extraordinary amount of money, okay, and it has to be extraordinary. You can't come out ahead because even at the end They take fucking 60% of it So yeah, about 60 yeah, most people yeah, I've got a radical idea I think we should let's use our debt the right way right? So here's how I would do it I would run a debt for fiscal year 2025 and then that's what I would tax the following year And no more you're not allowed to spend more money and then the next year so on and so forth Then people would start paying attention to who they're voting for in November Because that fiscal year ends in September taxes are due in October Right, and then the votes in November and then we'll see who fucking votes for whom Mm-hmm. Yeah, that'd be interesting man Well, I last little piece I want to bring this up to because there's something else going on with the White House You got Conor McGregor's in there He's chilling with you. He's not being up old dudes and bars and I ruin anymore He looks thick man, dude. I was just talking about that this morning Like I already punched a guy for the face to go down either For refute no, he didn't even flinch bro Conor McGregor punched this old man in the face who refused a shot of proper 12 I guess like he was disrespected And he punched his dude in the face and he didn't even move he just kept drinking yeah To be fair that 80-year-old's probably been sitting on that bar stool for 70 of those 80 years right he couldn't move Yeah, yeah, I really dude I wish people are scrappy bro. Yeah, yeah Yeah, well, yeah, he's there and they're gonna have to be because they're getting all bro Well, that's what he was there calling out. I mean, he's calling it all out Saying zero accountability. I didn't know he was he's 36. I don't know. He was that young Yeah, I mean, he looks like it looks a little older than 36 But might be the proper proper 12 now. It's probably the you know living on a yacht partying all the time Who knows what drugs some perupery and baby powder? I mean My fuck has been having a good time Yeah, man, but yeah, he got in there man, and uh, you know, he's been challenging some stuff We had a little nice little interchange exchange at the uh In the press briefing room that David August suit. He's one of those clean man. Yeah, I thought he really did the the fuck you pinstripe But I guess you know that's green looks better than Patrick's day. It is any Patrick's day. He looks better than the leans The lusky does though, so that's good Yeah, you think he's I mean dude. He's talking about like taking over I really play the clip What is going on in Ireland is a travesty our government is the government of zero action with zero accountability You know our money is being spent on overseas issues that is nothing to do with the Irish people. It's very nervous The illegal immigration racket is running ravage on on the country There are rural towns in Ireland that have been over one in one swoop that have become a minority in one swoop So issues native address and the 40 million Irish Americans as I said need to hear this because If not there will be no place to go mom on visit He's you get to feel his breathing. He's trying to say more shit. Yeah, bro. He's up there trying to say more shit He has a lot to say. Why kill them all. Yeah, that's right He's definitely a little uh nervous anxiety. It's public speaking is not easy to be honest And uh, but he's right about everything he's saying by the way Uh, if you saw uh martyr made on Joe Rogan and whether you agree with everything he says or not One of the things he said was that Ireland's on course to be minority Irish place in 20 and 2070. Yeah, that's not okay dude and like 45 years No, of course, it's not okay. Why would you like that that whole thing and then Rogan went on to talk about him more as well, but Nobody gives China any grief for wanting to stay Chinese and why would they it's China? That's right right then the goddamn name You know what I mean? Ireland's been there for a minute. I said that at a clip that was posted around and Everybody in the fucking comments was like what he's really saying is that America's just for white people It's like dude shut the fuck up. No, we did something different here. We did just right individual liberty here with that That's our race individual liberty with an accepted universal culture. Yeah. Yeah. That's our race Our race isn't it just happens to not be ethnic anymore, but we still have a cultural Culture here. Yeah, it's identity for sure act like like you you talk It doesn't matter what fucking fuck every other country sees this that way. Yeah, I'll see this as fucking, you know fat lazy Americans Yeah, we're the only ones who like to divide ourselves. Yeah, it's fucking stupid. We'll still whoop your ass Oh, bro. No doubt. We'd be that we're gonna have big fat cousins sit on the couch and get up knock you to fuck out Everybody talks a lot until it's time to do some shit. Yeah. That's right. Yeah come take rest. Where the fuck are a where's their shit Y'all a bunch of pussy's Calling us fucking what we are y'all call us when you need shit Let's like Michael Jordan. It's like yeah people say I was brutal. It's because they have never won anything You know what I mean? Yeah, like I don't don't don't take any criticism from anybody wouldn't take advice from that That's a good standard dude. You know as well as I do you've been enough in enough business that have done very well to understand What it fucking takes to win it is not For fucking everyone the biggest lie in society right now is that oh everyone can start a business and every yeah Everyone can't start a business not everybody can win at I mean 80% of businesses fail in the first Motherfucker I could shoot free throws. It doesn't mean I'm gonna be good at it. Mm-hmm Anyway, no no dunking. I'm with the conner bro. Let's go fucking. Let's go clean it up for them. No dunking for sure Yeah, man guys jumping on this connobs and fucking hot dogs and unseason chicken when I get done right with some fucking corn water Oh, that's nice. You man. We guys jumping on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. We got one final segment of headlines here for you. We got a head on a three Let's let's talk about some race relations. I think this is a good time to do it. Oh, fun. Yeah, I mean listen I mean just American culture where we are. I think a nice little check-in temperature check Headline up for three beats Woman pleads guilty in cross burning hoax during Colorado Springs mayoral campaign Have you guys seen this? I can't remember if we cover it this I don't think we covered it, but it came out originally this was back in like 23 it came out originally That you know this black mayoral candidate this guy right here Okay, I mean he was running for mayor in Colorado Springs, Colorado and One of this campaign signs was defaced with a burning cross and some Not-too-kind words. Yeah, who would have done such a thing Yeah, I mean gotta be a racist person of course. I got to be a piece of shit person white people, you know I'm saying it's gotta be bad. He was running against a white person and Yeah, now it comes out that a woman who was part of a group charged with Setting across on fire in front of a defaced campaign sign for candidate who became he'd be actually became and won the race because of this Mm-hmm. All right. This is juicy. Small it because nobody wanted to be racist, right? Like, you know But yeah, she pleaded guilty on Tuesday and what authority says was a hoax Deanna West one of three people indicted in the 2023 incident pleaded guilty in Denver federal court To one count of being part of the conspiracy to set the fire and then spread false information about it and the run up to the election of mayor Yemi Mubalade Moba Moba Lade Google Mubalade Oh, there we go What's the what are those pens There's an air force pin on yeah Believe me's an immigrant I said flower. What is that? Gay maybe I think that's just a I think this is for the suit. Yeah Like a little that's a thing. Yeah Yeah, but this guy so yeah, so in a strange prosecutor said that they would drop an additional charge related to actually setting the fire So prosecutor say that after staging the cross burning a photo and video of it We're sent to media and civic organizations making it seem like an attack on Mubalade Now again, who are these people right because those names you got Deanna West you got another guy Derek Bernard Jr Okay, sounds reasonable, but here's a thing man They were all bypox We'll see you girl Here's one. This is Ashley Hernandez Well, having her fucking face. I should probably got you know beat by the white supremacist looks like she had a stroke Yeah, yeah, like a little poker looks like she has a 60 IQ. Yeah, well, that's for sure. It's definitely double digits. That's for sure. Okay, so a black man and a Hispanic Hispanic woman Set across on fire blame on white people correct now. How's that not a hit crime right? Versus white people it should be and that's actually the funny thing is any of the people been calling for brother. Well listen Standing up for your own race is not racism. Yeah, it's when you start to press on other races, which is racism right and a lot of people Who happen to be white? Do not understand that you have ever rewrite and should stand up when things Against you that's not saying you should be against anybody else, but that's saying hey, I have a problem with that That's not okay, and we don't do that at all All right, we've been bullying beat and punish into accepting any discrimination that we have against ourselves as well You know, we are white, so it is what it is and You know, it's interesting because I openly say all the time that White people have the right to stand up for themselves and should to balance out reality because right now White people are the only people that are allowed to be openly I guess persecuted Out of any of the races legally, okay up until recently. Yeah, all right so and that's been my whole life that's also been your whole life bro Yeah, and just until recently with the affirmative action changes and things like that have things started to change well I was thinking about this as someone who you know, I live in Missouri I'm a white dude. I'm pretty vocal. I Kind of stand up for what I think is right. I mean if anybody were be invited to you know Clan meetings or white supremacy meetings you would think I would have gotten invite. Yeah, I'm saying you're gonna get an invite but weirdly enough I've never ever seen one of these people. I've never seen And you know why because it's not a real fucking problem the way that it's presented to me It's not it's a fucking scary boogie man that lives under the bed or in the closet that they scare the fuck out everybody with now It's just like the Italian mafia at the at its height. There were 5500 total members. Yeah You would think it'd be fucking a million fuck off. Yeah, right? Yeah, 5500 people just let them do what they want. Yeah, well, they actually did a lot of good for society I took they took these people who do this fucking bullshit and handling Yeah, you know, you know, it's really funny about this whole story. You know Wilford Riley is Oh for rye author. He is a he's a history professor I think American history professor at an HBCU an historically black college. Yeah And he wrote a book. I think it was a 2019 called hate crime hoax and it was after that just juicy small it bullshit and his research found that um, oh yeah, he got fucking destroyed of the three. Yeah of the 346 total Hate crimes reported during the Trump administration one in three were fake. Yeah Yes, including LeBron James by the way if you think somebody went up into Brentwood and started tagging up houses with the n word And didn't get caught on a camera somewhere get the fuck out of it. Oh, we've had it happen here a bunch of time Bro, like fucking it's so it's so much. We've had we've had situations here in the St. Louis greater area where you know People go into the stall and someone scrolled the n word or some shit a shutdown school A lot of come to find out Come to find out. Yeah, it was a black student. Yeah, right And that's happened over and over and over again and at some point People should be genuinely harshly punished for that Because of the division that it creates in society I don't want to be invited to white supremacy. I don't want like broke to me If you're cool, you're cool. If you're not you're not and that's fucking that that's in my opinion And in my mentality, that's what America's supposed to be. I think we got to start talking more shit to each other again Yeah, like you you're starting to see a lot more black comedians on Social media making fun of dumb black shit. Yeah, which is super nice How many is the bridge bro? Comedy is the bridge to pressure. It's the only way you can deliver truth. Yes Comedy is the pressure relief valve. Yes, you and I are in some heated argument and then some dipshit walks by Like they guys are like fucking idiot. Yeah, and then you and I are friends again. Yeah, I mean, that's just how it works Bro, it's listen dude, and I think most people agree with that. I think most like the I think a massive majority of people agree with it which is why these situations are so harmful to culture You got Don limone. Yeah on fucking TV Arguing with a what's his face still Mar. Yeah saying He bill mar says well clearly there's there's you know, there's some racist in every area and he goes Don limone goes well, you know Magas racist and he goes well, there's probably racist people in mag and he goes no, I'm saying most of magas racist And it's like bro people like that are the reason that we can't all fucking just get along bro and Well, he went on to say If somebody said that they were black and mag I wouldn't believe him which is just paraphrasing Joe Biden saying if you Uh don't vote for you ain't black. Yeah, bro. He just he just paraphrased. How's that now racist? No, it is. That's I know that's it. I get that but it's like but we have to start calling out racism against all racist right Well, there's a thing the problem is it's like you know the power how can how come it's okay for fucking anybody to dude You could say any fucking thing you want about white people and nobody will say a fucking thing Yeah, well, I mean here's a good thought experiment. So this February is black history month Yeah, and March is now Irish history month in America, right? If uh if DJ shows up to work tomorrow dressed like a traditional Irishman Nobody's gonna give a fuck but if I show up Tomorrow dress like a black dude. I should know you know In black, forget I say tradition or black because what does that mean and chains? I don't fucking I But the cotton tucked into my shirt. I'm saying you said traditional Irish like what's traditional black? Well, I mean like if you showed it with gender hair in your face, painting white with freckles Shit and then I show up to the next day and black face. Bro right bro. I mean, that's a good look dude I got the better example Look, it's okay like no, listen, and my kids like Let's listen. Listen, I'm just cultural pro-propriation. Yeah. Okay. I Saw a video on the internet of a white girl getting destroyed because she had brains And by the way, she looks stupid with brains, okay? Destroyer for that. Okay, I feel like an asshole. All right, right? But and this was black people destroying her. Mm-hmm black women specifically What black women can fucking wear blonde wigs? That ain't right. They can do all cut like yeah And every nobody could say shit and by the way, I don't want to say shit because I don't give a fuck But the point is is that we're talking out of both sides of our mouth here. All right, it's not cultural appropriation for One class of people to do one thing and then the other class of people to do the exact same thing the other way and that it's okay Yeah, it's a yeah, it's a I mean if imitation is the highest form of flattery then appropriation is just a kind of Compliment that's right. It seems like it now obviously if you're dressed up like out or what's his name? The jazz singer out Jolman Jolman or whatever the fuck is the name is out Jolson Jolson I think if you've got if you if you have like brown paint around the edge of your face and a giant red lips Maybe that's racist that might be a little racist shit Maybe it's still funny to be honest, but it might be all the races But yeah, this is all postmodernism ro listen This is Marxism is postmodernism. It is in the pro established classes. Yeah, they rank them based on victimhood and use that to divide everybody That's that's that I mean it's thousand percent. It's just it's just Marxism. It's just clever It's not new. It's not empathetic fucking annoying. It's stupid. Yeah, it's done It's like the lowest frequency kind of way but I think people have started to grasp these things we're talking about You know more shit like this keeps us yeah, like bro like we we in this country Should like dude you say whatever you want about Martin Luther King I think one of the greatest things that ever was said by Martin Luther King Was that we should be judging people in the content of their character not the fucking race. Yeah, like bro how fucking Stupid do you have to be to literally look at someone of a certain race and say well I think that person's a fucking shit bag because they happen to have more melanin or less melanin or this or that like dude It's just it's a low IQ fucking argument. Yeah, and you know Unfortunately, I fortunately and unfortunately it's been pumped into our brains for so long like dude When you and I were growing up the racial tensions were not as bad as they have been recently like the young class the younger people have Been tricked into believing that this is another civil rights area when in reality dude when in our age we grow everybody is fucking cool man Well the solved solved problems don't get out the vote. That's that's the issue right? So you got to keep that thing going so let's reinvent some problems Yeah, and it shows you how like I mean I look for people that have deep first principles even if they're misguided you believe what you believe and you anchor yourself from that And you try to figure everything out self because now I can talk to that guy I know what he actually believes and not just because here's two pretty decent examples one is the one you you just made where Things that what what most people would consider the most important civil rights activists in the history of this country said that phrase And that was the anchor point of his entire ideology and the left believed in it so much that they made a party about it That that was there that became their party message for all this time and then They switched it up and said you know what now actually we are gonna judge based on race It's like okay cool. You don't really believe in that do and now we've seen a recent example over the past six months and Zealon musk These leftists who Believe in that the world is going to end the world is going to end soon by 2050 if we don't do something for 40 years and God who was it who is that dipshit Kelly no mark Kelly from Arizona. Oh the former national yeah, yeah fucking dick hole He got rid of his Tesla and traded in for a V8 Chevy yeah, right Well, don't tell me you fucking believe that shit first of all We all know that the green movement is a vessel for fucking communism and control period. Okay Oh, yes, I'm just we've had what I consider to be the foremost expert in this field on our show twice Which is Curtis Bowers who wrote Agenda and agenda to which are both amazing fucking documentaries about Green movement being what just understanding the communist a vessel for communism right so we just had And I don't know if you saw this the ex-president and founding member of green piece come out Literally in the last like three days talking about viral clip He's been saying this for a long time, which is why he was persecuted out of the movement But there's a viral clip going around of him right now talking about how the entire green movement is total bullshit And how we actually have CO2 deficiency in this In our atmosphere right now meaning we actually need more CO2 So the plants can make more oxygen because we have more fucking people yeah, it's nonsense It's like bro. This is a self-correcting problem plant trees. You don't have to stop emissions. Just plant more trees Dude The trees we have aren't growing as fast because there's not enough fucking carbon like it's it's You know, so what do you we got to make more cart? What kind of you know say it like if we're gonna have eight billion people on the earth That's gonna throw it out of whack more calpharades pretty much more so that so if you understand the actual science behind the actual science Not the bullshit science if you understand that you know like they taught us in fucking first grade science class You know like plants plants eat carbon dioxide and then they produce oxygen and then we are alive Well, it should make sense to you then that when we have eight billion people when we used to have fucking four Okay, that we're gonna need twice the amount of oxygen which means we either need more plants And probably more carbon too to produce the amount that we need like it's but they're gold. Let's just take them out the way Their goal their goal is To justify the removal of Of all these fucking quote-unquote and this is their fucking thinking not mine quote-unquote peasant class people that are not going to be needed once AI Starts to fucking really filter through people don't understand dude like these people are fucking diabolical and they understand that AI is going to take all the jobs though AI robotics mix is going to create all the labor and they don't need to work in class anymore They don't fucking need them all they're gonna do is cause problems All right, we're facing some very dangerous shit globally Because it doesn't mean the United States doesn't have to do it somebody else can do it. You know what I mean like Yeah, I don't know bro like it's Yeah, we're off track. No, that's good I mean people that people that do this and fake race attacks They should go to prison for a very long time. I agree. I agree I almost think that they need to go in the woodchipper with all the pedophiles. I would agree I know this I knew this was fucked up someone arguing me about that about why do you think that the people that touch kids should be fucking Executed right away. Well, here's why because First of all it's evil but second of all do you know What happened to those people who do the molesting when they were kids? They were molested Okay, and so if you have a predator who molests 70 kids those 70 kids then grow up statistically to Potentially be more likely to molest other kids which means you have a You have a problem that grows at scale the more you allow this in society and nobody talks about that Nobody talks about it all child predators Should be fucking executed fucking without hesitation yeah because it stops a cultural it's I mean do you get stopped in the other way? Yeah, no it keeps going But I do got one last little question on this piece here I mean I knew that this was bullshit when I first saw the the cross itself Because like yeah white man would have done a much better job put that cross like listen Supposed to be 10 feet tall, okay, like I mean like there's there's regulations and shit don't ask me how I know But do you guys think the mayor was in on it? Yes Highly likely. Highly likely. I don't know what's his iPhone message say there. That's well So that's the interesting thing so like the Bernard guy right this guy he's the one actually said it ablaze he told Mobile today that he was quote mo they got all of this stuff from his Facebook and messages they said he was quote mobilizing my squadron in defense and for the final push black ops style big brother the clan cannot be allowed to run this city again When did the clan run the city bro Colorado Springs bro That's my point come probably not I mean Colorado was never a slave state obviously right bro What he's saying is we cannot allow white people to run this city. That's what the fuck he's actually saying And then Mobile today was then accused of speaking with Bernard for about five minutes on the phone three days after the cross burning Now he's obviously denying having any knowledge or involvement in the crime and reveal the letter From the US Department of Justice that identified him as a victim during the investigation into the cross burning Um, I think he needs to be investigated because there's no way I mean you can verify that feeling thing pretty easy pretty easy Yeah, you know, pretty so I don't know guys tell us what you guys think I think I personally think I speculate he was in on it But tell us what you guys think now that's my speculation too. Yeah, if I'm betting Absolutely. Yeah, he was in it for sure All right, well, let's get to our final segment of the show guys we've been rolling We're all the folks okay, miss it though. We got thumbs up with dumb as fuck guys. This is where we bring a headline in Talk about it you get one of those two options Um, and so with that being said our thumbs up with dumb as fuck headline reads Peruvian fishermen lost for 95 days in pacific ocean is found alive um I would say thumbs up on that one and my guess is he's got an unruly wife at And he was on vacation for 95 days Per if they wouldn't lost a professional fisherman isn't getting lost out at sea, but yeah, sorry. I just don't buy that shit Yeah, I don't know man. I don't know well. I was live into it. So Peruvian fisherman has been found alive after spending a grueling 95 days living off insects birds and sea turtles When his food supply ran out while he was lost at sea maximum napa Castro. That's a nice name Something that powerful name um sets out on a fishing trip from a southern Peruvian coastal town of um, Marcona on December 7th with enough food to last them two weeks however 10 days into his trip the 61-year-old fisherman straight off course due to bad weather sending his boat drifting aimlessly into the vast pacific ocean when napa Castro did not return home His family reported him missing and peruse maritime patrols began scanning the waters for the missing fisherman for weeks without luck He hadn't been found until months later when an Ecuadorian fishing patrol boat found his boat drifting 680 miles From the country's coastline. I mean did he not have the ability to move his boat from one place to another because If you're in the pacific ocean, right? Yeah, and you're seeing the sun come up You would think yeah, just go towards it. Yeah, because that's east mother fucker You would think a fisherman would know that which again, I think he probably faked all that night This this sounds terrible although I do wonder if he had a volley ball But since he's south American did he have a fucking soccer ball instead with a face painted on it You know what I mean? Yeah, I want to be racially appropriate Wilson. Yeah, Wilson. It would be called like You know, what would you say Wilson is Spanish? I don't know, but I wonder where'd he go? Yeah No, I think he's probably just Wilson actually but really I don't know man. I make something up. We just add an older than the bit. Well, so no, that's what my dad does Yeah, we go to Mexico. Wilson. Yeah, I was L Wilson Look at the fucking hair on this guy. Yeah, it looks that's Maximo, bro. Like yeah, I mean this my dad my dad El Biro If I get two El Biro's yeah, yeah, I mean You don't so you don't believe it. No, I mean He's probably happy by who he got rescued I genuinely don't believe that a 60-year-old professional fisherman didn't know which way east was no, I don't I don't believe that I tend there in the middle too. Yeah Yeah, he looks pretty healthy for being out there that long too. Yeah, he's even fucking sea turtles, bro Anyway, thumbs up my protein in those sea turtles. Yeah, thumbs up on that one I like either way it happened he was either a tough guy that survived Look he's trying to trade in that wife you're talking about right there or or that was it. Yeah, he took a Vacation look at him looking at her. He's like yeah. Yeah, I mean it's peruse He probably had a fucking pound of cocaine on that boat. Bro. That's how you really stayed alive for 90 days That's why he's so excited. Yeah, what else did you do those two turtles? That's my question My they got yeah, I think turtles don't like straws. So I don't know that's that probably how I killed him It is Peru though. He probably killed him with the straws, you know We'll see man. All right. Well, we got thumbs up on this man. Can I just want to snort cocaine off a turtle shell now Well, I say it. Damn, that's all I got man. Hey brother. Thanks for coming in, Dan I always enjoy our conversations You have a book that you're writing. Yeah, it's almost finished. You want to talk about it all? Yeah, it's called the American and American Reformation and it's I guess you could say it's a list of tenets That are that I think are important Um To do what we're talking about to reestablish this connection between you as a citizen and the fucking government You you we we will and it variably get the government we deserve I agree So the best way to get the best possible government is to improve yourself. That's right, right? And there are tenets like um, uh, uh, you know, true through discourse no censorship shit like that. Yeah um, uh, decentralization as sacred I think it's something that we need to get back to it. There's a lot there's a number of them and and When you plan or having this out, uh, while we're in the publisher process now So however long it takes them to edit and decide all that bullshit. Cool.
