Yeah, dude No, that's not the first one the first ones in my office at home. It's like all sweated out. Oh, got you Must look at I'm I definitely a second one, but you felt the power he put off felt a little bit more domestic. Yeah, you know You've got like you went up the list a couple notches who notches really got it. Yeah, I agree So we have a guest today do have a guess once you introduce our guest. Yeah guys. We got we got a great I've actually been following them for a minute Um, we got Tim Parliamentary who is it on the studio today? Tim. How's it going good good good now Tim is an attorney. He's at the up Um, why don't you tell us a little bit about what you do and where you came from Tim's audience gets a little scope of Your experience so far sure so uh, I started off in the Navy. I was a surface warfare officer It got out of that and went to law school. I started my career in New York City On doing a lot of organized crime work Working for all of the the greats who had you know been part of the jangati Trials, you know, really learn how to try cases there Ultimately, you know, I got involved in a really big case the 80-galagher Navy SEAL war crimes case for years back Which which we won big not guilty verdict there. Yeah, and then that you know kind of catapulted me through a whole bunch of other things You know, I Recently represented Donald Trump. I was representing him through the um the investigative phases for both January 6th as well as the Mara Lago case So you're on the list with us too And uh and I have my own firm uh, Parliamentary Law Group. I have uh 16 attorneys that work for me Uh, it's uh an entirely cloud-based platform. So you know all my people work remotely um It's very uh, you know military friendly. I have you know a few veterans on staff and then also uh about a third of my people are actually military spouses because Because of who they're married to DoD keeps moving them around the country and attorneys are licensed by the state So I don't always don't always live where they're licensed and with me they can tell a commute and so it gives them good opportunity to contain to work. So Um, you know my personal specialty. I do civil and criminal cases And I always say you know, I don't specialize in any one type of case. I specialize in in weird and big ugly fights And that's that's where I'm comfortable. It's not nobody else wants exactly. Yeah got it. That's cool, man What made you get into law like what what was there something like I mean? Did you watch was it a show was it Uh, no night court back in the day I don't know what that is. It was actually my day my best friend I went to the Naval Academy undergrad and my best friend got in trouble when we were juniors and He was facing separation. He came to me and he said you know Tim I need your help and so he and I just sat there went through all the regulations and I figured out What they were charging them with didn't really match but there was something else that matched a lot more Uh, and I said just go tell them this and he's like Tim. I don't understand what you just said. I need you to do it So I went up to the common non's um, you know Jagger officer explained the whole thing He got dropped down to a battalion level discipline. So it saved his career He just finished the tour of commanding the newest guided missile destroyer in the Navy Selected for captain um, and yeah, he is uh, he's a real hard charge and a great asset to the Navy who would have been thrown away Over 20 years ago, but for that and that that experience You know really to me kind of lit the fire because I realized This is something I have a passion for you know before that I was thinking I might wanted to be a Marine Corps infantry officer, but I realized This is something I have a passion for I can help people and and I'm good at this like this is my You know, this is my talent the key to greatness man Most people can never get those things aligned. Yeah, and so with that it kind of it shifted to trajectory. You know, I tried to um I tried to get into the Navy Jagger. They uh, they didn't accept me. I applied like four times and So instead I came back as a civilian defense counsel and just beat the crap out of all the jacks That's cool, man. That's awesome Now I think so so obviously your most recent. I guess biggest note of no notable notable case was the trump case Uh, can we talk a little bit about the Eddie Gallagher case? Oh, yeah, yeah, so I mean I do you I mean yeah, I talked to the case is saying Yeah, I've talked to Eddie a few times over Instagram. Yeah, we've talked about this. Yeah, so I mean what what so I mean because you I didn't know about it though I never knew about it till I talked to him. Yeah, so it's an insane case. It is insane. It's insane case here We can we just talk a little about that. I mean what was there anything in that case So for for though can we just get let's give the basics for for those that have not heard about this case Like what start to finish so Eddie was a he was a Navy seal um and he was the um the platoon chief Over fighting in the battle of Mosul in 2017 and they um You know, they were accompanying the Iraqi forces in retaking Mosul from the Iraqi or from the ISIS And about a year later he was accused of war crimes. They said that he had stabbed an ISIS prisoner in the neck killing him. They said that he had as a sniper shot at innocent civilians the child and uh, yeah Exactly a child an old man um and so he was serious allegations. Oh, yeah very serious serious serious war crimes allegations He was he was arrested. He was put in pre trial confinement and I came into the case um several months after he'd been arrested when they They were dissatisfied with their legal representation and wanted to trade up and so I was honestly only in that case for about three and a half just less than four months and in that time, you know, we had him released from jail We had the prosecutor kicked off the case because of uh because of violations We took it to trial. We got a not guilty verdict and it was it was a wild thing in the middle of trial One of the witnesses confessed during my cross examination to being the actual killer. That's insane So there was uh it was a very wild case There was a lot of shit that went on there too. He was trying to get help and people were fucking tell them they were helping him And they were actually not helping them. They were doing the opposite like very a very famous Uh certain political figure was at the head of that There was a lot of politics going on and um and a lot of dirty games going on at one point I actually discovered that the prosecutors and NCIS had launched an illegal spying operation surveilling me Um and so I obviously brought that to the judge's attention that created a whole separate fiasco we had you know several days of hearings on that which ultimately resulted in the prosecutor getting removed um The halfway through the hearing it ended early because the NCIS director sent a letter from Kwanako invoking privilege and refusing to allow any of the agents to testify And the judge is sitting there reading the thing saying I don't think I've ever seen a law enforcement agency invoked their fifth amendment rights, but I'm gonna have to interpret this letter as an admission of criminality by NCIS shit That's crazy. Yeah, when the case was over I sat with the judge and he's he kind of looked at me and he said you know what Tim You read about these things, you know some in newspapers some in John Grissom novels and you think maybe in my career I'll see one of these things We just had all of them in one case. Yeah That's crazy, dude. Yeah, so what's it like to work with Trump? Yeah, I must say did you call him? I gotta have that guy that got huge. I enjoyed it Um, yeah, it's it's very it's a different kind of client um Yeah, I enjoyed it because It's very consequential case, you know the the issues that we were Litigating I felt you know, we're very important issues and had to be handled right I got along well with the client Um, and look I've been very public about this the reason I left has nothing to do with him or the case It was the people around him that I felt prevented me from being able to defend him to the best of my ability For a couple of times I reset that Bro, I talk about that all the time on the show I'm like, why is he doing this and then dude? I've and then I meet the people around him and I'm like that's why yeah Oh, yeah, it's crazy. It was If you want to bring me into a case you gotta you know take the handcuffs off and let me win your case Yeah, don't have me saddled with a campaign that um, you know, that's gonna hold me back and yeah, I mean he's not the first person I've represented with a campaign Yeah, I mean, I represented you know one of our mutual friends Eric right? Yeah, yeah, and he right from day one said Tim You're here to help me out with this thing campaign you're here to get me elected you guys Stad his way Tim if you need anything you guys give it to him. Yeah, and that worked great But here it was kind of the reverse where the campaign is trying to dictate Strategy in a way that they In my opinion, we're trying to use these criminal cases and investigations as more of a campaign right To a tool than an actual litigation thing and I mean look I love I love the biggest case out there, but at the same time I don't want to be used for campaign purposes right Yep, and also you don't want to be making your strategic moves based around how the public's gonna perceive it when you're trying to actually win something or how they think the public No, that's the I already know the conversations these dudes are telling him oh you can't do that because this is how to look I'm gonna do this because this is how to look now and as I always say in a criminal trial There are only 12 opinions that matter and yours is not one. Yeah, no shit. If you're not a juror. I don't care So what do you think about what's going on in the world, man It's crazy. Yeah, I agree It's crazy. I mean, I kind of have a unique perspective on things because I get to see a lot of stuff behind the curtain um It's a situation where legitimate problems have overreactions and overreaching solutions being implemented which causes bigger problems and And I think that a lot of this you know people you know they loved to overreact and they love to take advantage of any tragedy for their own political gain And if we were to take a step back and look at these things a little bit more You know carefully analytically Focusing more on the facts the evidence and the law You come to a different conclusion What do you think it is Ah now I want to know first of all it seems to me that the law Is being heavily twisted and manipulated By a certain political party, you know what I'm saying like it we're very We're very much so applying the law to people there's a there's a double standard When I observe what's happening and how the law is being applied to Let's say conservatives, but not being applied to let's say People who are left of center What do you how do you correct that over the course of time because I've never witnessed that in my life before or maybe It's always been that way and I didn't notice it But it's become heavily weaponized at this point in time and it's very obvious And one of the things you know that I struggle with is like when I think about how we can rebuild The country and sort of restore what needs to happen I mean what do we do with people who are willing to take the law and basically make it applicable In certain cases where it doesn't apply blatantly without regard for for what they're supposed to do because I feel like Things like what latisha latisha James is doing and like this what's what's this dude up here in uh the skeletal or that fucking That old breath no that old white dude That looks like skeleton old white which now bro. He's he's the judge in the oh yeah in goren. Yeah that guy I actually got that it's hello. Oh, do you? Well condominium. What is it? What what is it gonna take To correct this problem In my opinion this is not something that's recent. Okay, we have always had a weaponization of the criminal justice system I see it a little bit differently. Yeah, not so much that it's being weaponized against one party or As other people would argue it's being weaponized against certain ethnic groups and things like that I see it personally as the criminal justice system is weaponized against everybody The difference is who's in charge in the political figures that will protect their own and protect their favorite group And so You know that's that's the problem and I think that a lot of it is a lot more public now and people are starting to see You know things that things that were obvious to me years ago You know just in the New York City criminal system of how it is weaponized against people um It's now much more public and you know the the years of where you know We thought the federal prosecutors were these you know nights and white shining armor and you know like you know The things you see on on TV, you know jack McCoy type characters That's all affection and To me the way that you fix this is You know to change the career path of these prosecutors to make it something where they're incentivized to do jabs As opposed to racking up their stats or to racking up the biggest you know names the biggest scouts on their wall And also to remove the politics from the process. I mean to me an elected prosecutor Is a recipe for disaster I agree latisha james You know and I'm gonna address both of the names you brought up latisha james is an elected democrat attorney general who was Who campaigned on a platform of I'm going to get Donald Trump And because she is in a largely one-party jurisdiction They bought into that because really all you have to do is a as a prosecutor in a single party jurisdiction You know Red or blue Is you have to win your primary to keep your job to get or keep your job and so Yeah, cuz you're gonna run essentially unelected in general. So that's what she did Yeah, she she campaigned on that and now she's doing what she needs to do to win the next primary election to keep her job the judge And not not a lot of people know this but in New York judges are elected And when you have a one-party jurisdiction like that New York City judges Are all for the most part elected unopposed the way that they get on the ballot is they go over to the democratic party and They you know they do the beauty pageant there and the party selects who they want on the ballot And so just by every judge in the state system in New York Is selected by the political party you know to that position and then rubber stamped by the electorate because they don't really have another choice And they do serve you know like a ten-year term and so if they want to keep their judgeship, they're going to you know keep the party happy Uh, you know federal judges aren't like that. You know federal judges are appointed for life and it is a Not a perfect system, but it's a more a more perfect system where they're appointed by the president But with the advice and consent of the senate and ordinarily They don't even get advanced to the president's desk without the Senator from that jurisdiction You know, so really any federal judge in New York Doesn't get to that position without you know for the ones that were elected they were appointed during Trump's era They don't get to that position unless both Chuck Schumer and Donald Trump agree that this person should be a federal judge And then they're appointed for life and they don't have to worry about re-election so That's one of the many reasons why I prefer to be in federal court But when you have a state system like that and everything I just described also applies to Georgia Yeah, if you have a situation like Fulton County where it's a one-party jurisdiction Certainly the Manhattan District Attorney's office all of those are politics infecting the criminal justice system And then on the federal side the attorney general is appointed by the president and When they are given their marching orders of these are what your priorities are going to be When that trickles down The prosecutors even if nobody says you know even if Joe Biden never actually calls up Merrick Garland and says I would like you to prosecute my political opponents Merrick Garland and the people under him and jack Smith they all know I want to please my boss And the best way that I'm going to please my boss is by bringing the cases that they like to see Um, which is now in today's day and age things they get attention right now And one question I have is not necessarily what's wrong or what's right just But an interesting thing is you have a situation like Bob Mnendez Getting indicted right in the middle of all this Well, what do you think that was because I feel like that was like a you know Because you we talk about it in terms of like you know When you when you are in these positions you're your Bob Mnendez your a Democrat Senator, right? You got to play ball because the committee chairs that you sit on like that's all that's all pay for play You got you know, there's things there's rules and regulations that you got to play by and it may not be a direct conversation But you know the rules and if you want to stay in this game you're going to play up Now I'm I'm to the opinion that I feel like that was just one of those situations where Bob Either did something that they didn't want him to do or didn't do something that they wanted him to do And he got shit canned Or he took it a little bit too far I mean once you get to the stage of having you know stacks of gold bars in your house. Yeah Um Yeah, one one problem that what about having a tank in your house Well, that's a different issue We might need to talk about that Yeah, once you get to that point, you know one one problem that the DOJ has in keeping things politically aligned Is that they do have agents that go out there and bring cases And then if the agents You know try to bring a case, you know They they now have to worry about whistleblowers of oh, we're going to all of a sudden get all these IRS agents that you know Go talk to Congress about how you know We wouldn't let them prosecute Hunter Biden And things like that so there there is an element of that where you know The line agents are out there Trying to do the right thing Um, and and that's one thing if you look at the FBI the line agents by and large are out there trying to do the right thing I've noticed that we have a lot of we have we have well they tell us yes And and and like even you know You know the FBI does have you know a large cadre of people that are not agents Um, and you know those are the more of the political appointees Uh, I mean one of the things that drives me out of my mind, you know one of my good clients and close friends is Bernie Carick the former yeah Bernie's awesome my pd. Yeah, I love Bernie. Yeah But and he and I are always talking about like look at the FBI director When is the last time we've had an FBI director who has personal experience carrying a badge and a gun It's been probably decades right yeah right Hoover Well, FBI directors who were waiting. Oh dude look. Yeah, but this is look How do you this is the same problem in business? This is when businesses get too big they end up hiring people who are fucking they come from Harvard and Yale As opposed to people that actually pack boxes and went through the whole system right you know what I'm saying We can't get the same outcome. So I Don't know Yes, I mean the bad going back to your question was the best way to fix it Rip the politics out of it Literally yeah literally find a way to depoliticize the criminal justice system And whether it's having some kind of a bipartisan oversight commissioner or something Yeah, if you rip the politics out of it and then you start to actually hold prosecutors accountable For misconduct because that's the other thing is they have they have immunity And so when a prosecutor goes and does something that's outright illegal and unethical to try to put somebody innocent in jail Nothing happens to him. Yeah, that's insane like Kim Gardner. She got she got what a 500 dollar fine Exactly. Yeah, that's insane wrote Kim Gardner literally I mean got people fucking murdered in St. Louis legitimately like there are families right now without loved ones because of decisions that she made right intentionally intentional decisions she made Gritons wouldn't still do exactly. Yeah, she prioritized she used taxpayer dollars To go after removing a popular and effective governor from an opposite political party as opposed to focusing on murders Who do you think gave her her marching orders? Soros I know that yeah I mean that is that is what it seems to be because who funds it right um, you know Again, you know as a lawyer. I don't like to you know speculate too much. I'd rather Whether I rather get her under oath and have her admit it. Yeah, yeah I like this is a speculative show. It is a speculative show. So it's fine. Yeah Yeah, anyway, I'm normally objecting to speculation Sustain These pull me out of my comforts. That's right. This is Sustain was at the right choice. Yes, that's okay All right, well, we got some good stuff, man. I want to bring this up um You know, I think I think if there is any proof That someone listens to this show I found it All right, because someone well, I'm gonna show you because you guys remember this is probably like maybe two CT eyes ago Um, Andy had a famous line. He said, you know, it's time to get back to just saying fuck you. Oh, yeah Then you got you line out the next day saying the shit boo, boo later. See that. Yeah, have you seen that video? Let's just watch it for those. Oh, why doesn't Elon just have like why doesn't he just come on the show, man? Elon just hit us up bro. Just come on in. We got you. Yeah We say fuck you with you It makes it even more impactful. Yeah, I'm saying this was great dude. It was fucking awesome So this was uh, so Elon Musk did this this live I got tagged in this a gazillion times and I'm just like Bro, he listens to the show. I don't know what he does, but he's on the right path I'm just saying that show comes out you tell people to get back to it Yeah, here he is. What I say we need more kid rock and let's Dylan Mulvaney All right, let's see it. Yeah, let's watch the clips. So he was doing a live interview. I believe it's on CN CNBC He's doing a live interview and the interviewer is asking him about the advertisers on ex coming off and leaving the program leaving the platform This was Elon Musk's response You don't want them to advertise? No What do you mean If somebody's gonna try to blackmail me with advertising blackmail me with money Go fuck yourself. Yeah Love the awkwardness go fuck yourself I hope it is I hope it is. I love it. Can you one more time? Yes, yes. Okay, one more time. Here's this fucking great. You don't want them to advertise? No What do you mean If somebody's gonna try to blackmail me with advertising blackmail me with money go fuck yourself Oh I think he fucking really did listen. That's exactly the same shit. I was saying just like that It's fucking her made him bro. This is the four-living to fucking simulation dude Bro, I mean the solo tweet. He tweeted out. Yeah, he treated out the solitweet after I talked about that for listen Yeah, he's fucking listening look dude Elon Real talk, bro I've been saying fuck you to advertisers before they even try to advertise on my show I've been funny my own show and even take a dollar from these motherfuckers because I I'm not gonna listen to shit So I'm with you, yeah, but feel free you could advertise. Yeah Ever he should advertise some X dollars on the show. Yeah, yeah, we have it. Oh, we don't you know We don't do that. I don't really do that platform But I take some free money from somebody that thinks fuck you. I like X. Yeah, I'll sponsor you back. I'll buy a Tesla No, you won't I'll buy a Tesla. I won't drive it. I'll buy one you'll buy one though. Yeah, I'll do something with it I'm just saying She's not my cup of tea bro. What should I go? You lie? I like him a lot. Yeah, he's an interesting guy That's one way to describe me These social media networks, you know that they try to you know shadow band and and censor people as much as people don't like it the reality is they're allowed to do it Yeah, um because You know and when you try to sue them for it, yeah the Constitution first amendment that only applies to the government And to restrict their ability to censor actually implicates their first amendment rights What I like about him is that he went in and he he kind of made a business decision of hey, you know what? People don't like censorship Maybe we can increase usership by getting rid of it And and I think that he's done a lot of great things you know with that and also I love that attitude where you know He's not going to just cater to everybody um, you know the way that Yeah, Zuckerberg and these other people do let me ask you a question about regarding like the internet right yeah So I hear what you're saying and I know it's technically correct right like it infringes on their right By telling them they cannot censor right so we have section 230 right so At some point in time right when we talk about the public conversation When the first amendment was Created there was no technology like this it probably was could not even be thought of like not even fathomed But what we have and this is real is we have moved public conversation from in person to a digital format that is privately owned And so if public conversation moves from Here to onto this electronic device this electronic platform where they can censor shouldn't we reconsider If People like that are allowed to censor since they now own the public Conversation and that technology was never considered when we first came up with the first amendment rights of people in this country You know, it's Similar to AI right like AI is this new thing and everybody's hyped about it, but nobody's thinking like oh maybe we should Not do these certain things because save cards and when the you're old enough to know With the internet started nobody thought about these things right like so that's what I'm Good what do you think on that the issue becomes when you have become so large as Facebook has become to where it's essentially a monopoly right And they dominate they they own the entire space and and so there is where you may want to You know say If you have become that big that you are monopoly, you know, then some of these protections should apply But as far as you know these these types of entities, you know, that'll only put out one you know one point of view That actually did exist back when they wrote the constitution in what way because newspapers at the time Most newspapers were actually For one of over the other of the parties and so yes, so but that's how it was from the beginning Alexander Hamilton started the New York Post. It was called something different, but it was specifically You had to put out you know, a federalist propaganda and then there was the Democratic Republican newspaper and so People would you know, they would write these essays attacking the other side But if you read just the one paper you're only going to see that one side, you know the New York Post We never published anything written by Thomas Jefferson Um, and so it did kind of exist at the time But the people had access to multiple papers so they could read the one that they want Or they could read them all and get all sides out of it But when it does become this the single hegemonic thing, you know like meta Then at that point it was it does become almost a quasi-governmental agency where they really do control The public conversation of everybody I actually kind of look at it from a slightly different perspective of It's kind of a fraud When you build a platform like this and say that it's going to be all about you know free speech and public discourse and everything And then you have people that go on there and they build a huge following they build this whole community All based and justifiable reliance upon the promises that were made by Zuckerberg Back when they started and they pour all of their money and effort into this thing and then all the sudden Facebook turns and says Okay, well guess what now even though we promised you this we have decided now we're going to exercise our first amendment rights to only have People that we agree with Have those kind of platforms and now I'm going to start suspending all these accounts and I and so I think from a You know from a Essentially a fraudulent inducement perspective there's there's a different legal argument to be made as to why they can't do it rather than just simply a First amendment should apply to meta see I'm okay. I'm gonna if that was the case I'm fine with it because guess like there are other options you can go to right like that's fine But I think the dangerous thing and what's come to light you know within the last year or two years Were you know like the metaphiles or I'm sorry the twitter files which Exposed that it was not these private companies just acting on their own right These directives of censorship and shadow banning and the use of bots It was all at the direction of the federal government Right, that's that's when you get into being even more so Government action because because if the government is directing you to do something Or you're doing something that the governments be hast even though it's you know if it's a request or otherwise It is initiated by the government and so then yeah, then that is a violation absolutely. Yeah What do you think about the idea? So something that we never hear and you know Eric Schmitt's a good buddy mine It's funny because I was friends with Schmidt and right and so it was a little bit weird actually you endorsed Eric too Yeah Actually the truth was and I have no problem saying this I've been friends with Eric right and I supported him first and then when they Snowballed him in the in the primary with those fucking false allegations um I agreed to meet with air Schmidt because air Schmidt asked to reach out and I'm actually friends with his cousin so Eric and I air Schmidt and I met and I ended up really liking him and we've become friends after the fact So now I'm friends with both of them and it's a little awkward I they don't like you know, I don't think I think I just don't invite them together I don't even know. That's what it is you know, I think I think Eric right and feels very sour about what happened And I think he deserves to feel that way but in reality, I think he also knows that Schmidt's a team player. He's up there trying to do good work and uh and he wasn't behind it. No, he wasn't and and uh So you know and that's been a really cool friendship but Eric Schmidt and I Eric starting to lead the charge on what we're talking about here And one of the things him and I were talking about Was how they You know traffic throttling people don't talk about that in terms of censorship the algorithm right like it's not just getting your platform Taking away or getting your post deleted or getting fact checkt read It's the way that they naturally that stuff comes later. Yeah, it's the way they naturally Change the flow of the algorithm when you start to talk about things that they don't want you talking about and that's censorship as well and that's something that you know I've encouraged those guys to really start to talk about some more and I see them say some things about it But I hopefully you know we get some resolution on that as well because the truth of the matter is If these guys wanted if he look this is how I look at it Look at tiktok right tiktok's crushing everybody the reason it's crushing everybody is because it's pretty open algorithm All right, so if these guys were operating in good faith like they say they do saying We're a business. We're here to build a business They would open the algorithm because it would create more money for their business But that's not what's happening. What's happening is they have a big business that's making a lot of money And they're using that business to curtail and craft public discourse in the way that they want it to be And we see this from the donations of the people who run these operations and the money where the money goes that they donate And so my argument When when I think of like what's actually happening is that they're not even operating in good faith as a business in the first place They're operating as a literal conversation Manipulator of public discourse and so you know what do you think? No, I think that that's true. I don't know that I would be so kind to tiktok on this Because obviously I think that they are well, they're pushing the the harmful cultural shit correct But for everybody else, they're not like like my shit that gets posted there They're not censoring it because I'm saying stuff they don't like but they are pushing out the Mentally damaging things for the youth right right we can agree on that. I'm not being kind But what I am saying is they're not trying to suppress everybody else, which is why they've gotten so popular And it goes back to you know to me it's a fraud if you are holding yourself out to be one thing And you're actually engaging in something else You know if you if you want to make everybody think hey, we're a free speech platform And then you are throttling the content so that people you know are led to believe that the free speech platform shows that such the majority of people Think this one way And that you don't get to hear the other side of things then that is a fraud You know because you you've induced people into the space With the promise of free speech. Well, it goes further than that. Look at what they what DJ brought up in the Twitter files They have millions of accounts that are not even real accounts that they used to put traffic on Political narratives that they believe in right and then they use those same fake accounts those bought accounts To attack the political narratives they disagree with in inside the corporation like dude What the fuck like that's these are not even real people and they're using their internal resources to Prop up and then suppress and Create confusion in that. This is why so many people that have regular common sense views feel so alone This is why people think like well, there's real damage there too, and how many people died because I've ever met in the hydrox chloroquine with censored Lot how many people didn't take those therapeutics Because they were told that they were you know horse stuff and like how many people Like there was real like there's physical damage there. Yeah, you know, and they're trying to create as much distance between then and now As they can so that people forget what they actually did and so they can do what they actually did was they fucking killed people By propping up Trousse that we're not true and and suppressing the actually true shit You know bro. It's it's crimes against it. We got we got we got crimes against humanity. It is It is man Anyway, yeah, let's get into it because we got some good headlines here Let's get into it. We kind of touched a little bit of stuff some stuff. We touched some stuff Uh, you touch of stuff. I didn't know you guys touched some stuff I'm not Now we got some good headlines guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to any for seller.com you can find them link there if you're watching in on YouTube Check down in the description below you can find them there as well. So with that being said man Let's get into our first headline headline number one That's on number one reads Trump gag order reinstated by a pills court in New York civil fraud trial So this just came out today. This is a new development. There's a couple of new developments in this case Um, so let's let's do I think you know we got it. We got having attorney who actually represented it Representative Trump not in that case. Yeah, not in that case But let's let what do we see in here? So let's dive into this a little bit So a new york appeal court Thursday reinstated a gag order that barred farmer President Donald Trump from commenting about court personnel after he disperaged a law clerk in his New York civil fraud trial The decision from a four judge panel came two weeks after an individual a pellet judge I put the order on hold while the appeals process played out the trial judge Arthur and Goran Imposed the gag order October 3rd after Trump posted a derogatory comment about the judges law clerk to social media The post which included a baseless allegation about the clerks personal life Came on the second day of the trial in New York attorney general Leticia James lawsuit James the ledges Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements used to secure loans and make deals Trump Uh, a republican denies any wrongdoing um, and and there's a couple of other big You know losses. I guess what I'm happening right now. Um, this headline also comes out the same day Judge Chuck kin denies Trump motions is subpoena for missing j6 records. So Judge tanya chuckkin who is presiding over special counsel jack smith's case against farmer president Donald Trump for 2020 election interference This week denied a motion by the former president to seek material She said the house committee investigating jenuary 6th 2021 had not turned over to the national archives on monday chuckin rejected Trump's motion accusing him of going on a quote fishing expedition She she says quote the broad scope of the records that defend its seeks and his vague description of their potential relevance resembles less a good faith effort to obtain identified evidence Then they do a general quote-unquote fishing expedition that attempts to use the rule 17 c subpoena as discovery evidence She wrote in her denial Um, a lot of interesting things happening um But there are some wins and some interesting things that are happening inside the courtroom um, so they put this uh this this this banker from dutch dutch bank on on try on to testify in this court case um And he kind of blows the whole thing wide open of how baseless this claim is when it comes to exaggerating wealth He he's a banker. He was at the bank of one of the banks that loaned Trump money, right? Um, so he and he's an executive there He gave testimony that could bolster Donald Trump's defense in a civil fraud trial telling a new york judge That prospective clients can get loans even after reporting a net worth far higher than the lenders own calculations So david Williams um, who worked on at least one of three loans dutch bank made to trump in the years before he was elected president Testify to's day That it's quote a typical but not entirely unusual for the bank to cut a client stated asset value by 50% And approve alone anyway as it did with the trump. I don't believe that's even at typical. I that feels pretty standard That's pretty fucking standard if you've ever had to actually get a loan for anything just saying yeah He's every bank does that and what people don't understand because they've never filed any personal financial statements Are done anything financially in their fucking lives But they have a fucking viewpoint on this is that the net worth stated is up for debate It's a there's no certification process of what you say your net worth is and what they say your net worth is It's it's what the market will pay so if I think my house is worth 15 million But the market says it's only worth five It's worth five even though I think it's 15 and just because I put 15 on a fucking financial statement Doesn't mean that I'm committing fraud. It means I'm doing math that doesn't agree with what that math says right So and I'm not even saying that he did that because the reality is they're saying Marlago's worth 18 million dollars when it's worth a fucking billion dollars okay, so There's a whole bunch to this they'll fuck yourself. Yeah This is they're playing on people's ignorance in their own financial ignorance This is why the same reason they don't teach people basic finance in high school. Yeah, so well Let's listen to his response so so quote is the bank capable of reaching its own judgment based on the evaluation it makes of the guarantee towards financial condition Trump attorney Jesus Suarez asked Williams a managing director at the German bank Quote certainly yes, William said Under questioning by suarez William said the bank always reviews a perspective client stated net worth and Adjust it as needed quote as part of he's saying when I just said. Yeah, he's saying always yeah always yes Quote as part of our due diligence we subject to clients asset value to adjustments Williams said Quote it's part of our underwriting process. We apply it to every client Regardless of what's reported all right Says quote is a difference of opinion and asset values between the client and the bank a disqualifying factor to extend credit suarez x Williams Williams said no Suarez said why not William said quote. It's just a difference of opinion Williams testify quote I think we expect clients to provide information to be accurate But Williams added that such financial statements are made quote largely relying on the use of estimates And it's almost like I've done this before. Yeah, almost, but here's where it gets weird, right? This is this is where it gets fucked up, okay? So the documents show that Trump cured the breaches And Williams testified that there was nothing particularly unusual about the way Trump's company got back into compliance dutch bank quote Was satisfied with the resolution they got their money everything's fine everything's good Now after Williams the article says was excused as a witness Trump attorney Christopher Kess acts the judge to issue an immediate verdict in favor of the former president Arguing the testimony from the dutch bank executive had refuted the state's claim that any asset inflation was Material to the lender's decision quote the bank had no problem with a two billion dollar difference a three billion dollar difference Large changes to net worth are not unusual. Kai said quote. There's been no demonstration Of any materiality issues at all In goren the judge said he'd rule on Kess's request at a later time, but suggested he wasn't convinced by the argument quote The mere fact that lenders were happy doesn't mean the statute wasn't violated Yes, so I get that but you used to both the law He's that's a technicality What do you think there? Well, first of all Chris keis is making a motion at a time when he doesn't have a mechanism to make it So the idea that the judge wouldn't rule on it at that point means that In this case the judge is actually following the law and Chris keis is just showing that he doesn't Know what he's doing um By the way, he and I did not get along You guys believe that's for us You know, I mean this testimony really does kind of go to the heart of of what this case is and you know should the It's interesting in a fraud case that you would have The defense put the victim on the stand to say that the victim was aware of all this And that the victim and that the victim doesn't you know, not only doesn't care It's not about whether they care the what happens is did they do it anyway because fraud requires That you make a false statement and through your false statement you actually induce something so gain from it right Right, so you know if I'm gonna sell you a car and I and I tell you you know this car has a has an eight cylinder engine in it And you say okay, great. I'm gonna buy it and you pay me and then I give you the car and you look under the hood and it Hel own a six cylinders. I've committed fraud If I tell you it has eight cylinders you look under the hood and you see it's got six cylinders But I still like the car and then you paid me and then knowing that You buy the car from me anyway It's not fraud. Yeah, it's just bullshit. Right. Yeah exactly and you've accepted the bullshit right It's it's not how I would sell a car personally But you know that's that's a thing is that There has to be there has to be a plausibility Element to the fraud and it has to be something that Somebody relies upon and if the bank didn't rely upon it Yeah, maybe it best you could get an attempted fraud You wouldn't get the substance of fraud you get an attempt of fraud My question is if why like bro listen, they're trying to fund them 100 to millions of dollars hold on dude listen This this case could apply to any single fucking human being that's ever even applied to a mortgage Yeah, like every single person out here listening to the show who has written their net worth down on a personal financial statement to get a mortgage And has miscalculated by a dollar Yep could be found guilty with the argument that they're making I'll give you another example about one of our mutual friends who made a mortgage That mortgage application on it he wrote that he had received the gift from a friend a cash gift He later came into a lot more money and decided to pay that cash gift back Payed the mortgage on time, you know no issues like that he went to jail Because DOJ said when you said that that was a gift We think it was really a loan because you ultimately did pay the guy back That's crazy that's Bernie karak that's fucking crazy That was one of the things that he was convicted of Holy shit That's insane that's like saying that's like Tim that's like you That's like me being in a spot right like a financial pinch Which fucking happens to everybody at some point probably multiple points in their life no matter how Donald Trump almost lost all his money like seven times like like bro this happens. Yes So that would be like one of Donald Trump's rich buddies saying hey bro here's fucking 30 million bucks Don't worry about it. We're billionaires. You're gonna get back no big deal I love you man. I love everything you've done for me And then Donald Trump later saying Back on my feet. Hey bro. Thanks for the 30 I appreciate I gave it back to you and then put him in fucking jail for it That's insane. That's why it's one of the reasons why to me The government shouldn't be him. It shouldn't be getting involved in this. Yeah, now if Deutsche Bank Called Latisha James and says We've been wronged. Yeah, he's a different guy. He defrauded us. He told that's what I'm saying Right if I'm happy bro He inflated his income. He claimed the owned three buildings that we found out later. He didn't even own Um, you know if it's something like that and then they didn't get paid back Yeah, and he defaulted on it and ran away from it then okay Yeah, now it makes sense to go to the federal government or to this a G and say hey we're victim of a crime But if the AG Goes hunting for a crime and they start going through financial statements and they decide This is a crime and they don't The victim hasn't come to them saying hey, we've been defrauded Why are you even getting involved because it's a political hit you right dude Here's what people don't understand. Listen Pete the you know this yeah, the political The what they're doing is they're creating cases that people do not have the capacity to understand intricacies up because they're financially illiterate Okay, so they're creating these things that are naturally confusing for people So that they can convince people that this guy's a fucking liar and a piece of shit and a fraud here Let's take that one step further Had Donald Trump Said I own these three buildings and he hadn't owned them and they still loaned him the money And he paid the money back and they said everything was satisfied It's still not fucking fraud because they would have done a due diligence to know that he didn't own the fucking buildings Yes, this is not me offering to sell you a car that you don't bother to look on yeah, they looked Do it you but especially that kind of dollar value yes They do do diligent bro. They go all the way up your ass. Yeah, like all the way like with the fucking big ass spot I know you have a good bro from the bottom like dude And so what they're doing that's what people don't understand like You know in the internet culture everything's a fraud everybody's a fraud Everything's a fraud everybody's a fucking scammer But the reality is is people don't know the reality of the law right and when we talk when we talk about the specifics of the law Would it be okay for him? Is it ethically okay for him to say that he owns things that he doesn't know But the reality is is they did their due diligence and they knew that he didn't own the buildings And he had just stated the owner buildings and they said you know what by the way he's worth X amount he qualifies for alone. Let's give him the loan. He pays it back. There's no fucking crime You know, it was it was so does that make sense? No, I make sense. Yeah, I didn't was the building thing like is that a real thing like you So he did say he No, that was an example. I made that up as an example. I'll give you another example I have a case right now. It's a securities frog case where it's a 300 million dollars You know publicly traded company that was taken private and during the go private The due diligence revealed that half of the city or portion of the subsidiaries didn't really exist and The buyer used that in a negotiation You know to get an advantage and get a much better price on the thing to take a private And then as soon as he took a private he pretended to all the sudden find these things And you know to try and get the guy out on recourse, right? And so so now we're going to go through a federal criminal trial over this thing For a go private that was sold for under Fairmark of value because they knew that there were certain subsidiaries that were empty and it's one of those things of like Why are we doing this? Yeah, the victim new yeah But You know but we but the federal government still gets involved in these things It is an over criminalization. You know that kind of thing Yeah, fine deal with it in the civil suit deal with it in a bankruptcy proceeding We don't need to put people in jail for that. Yeah Yeah, and I mean look there's a difference between a fraud and a bullshitter right there's a fucking difference sure Yeah, and due diligence by banks like Deutsche Bank and It identifies the difference. Yeah, you got to be really good to get best. Yeah, it's like saying like You listen man We've been through due diligence in our companies because like you know We we deal with financial institutions and things like that and like bro they fucking go through your credit cards No, yeah, like they like people don't understand they go through your credit cards They're like what's that $4 or 72 cent Quick trip charge that you have every morning. What's that about like this? about to kiss right like they do listen like they know like they know and and this whole case is based upon the idea uh You know all these smart intelligent people in this courtroom know exactly what the fuck is going on And then they take it to the media and the media makes it into something because they don't know what the correct the average person is not taught any kind of financial literacy For the reason that our debt is their asset So they want financially a literate people out in the world making stupid financial decisions Because the more money that you owe the more profitable they are and this is this is the game And so they weaponize this ignorance to make this man look like he's done some highly criminal criminal shit when in reality The and this is where the fucking rub is here like this is the thing that should concern you is that if they're doing it to him They can do it to you because if you filled out a loan for a car and you overstated your income by 2 grand Or you figured uh you put on a mortgage statement that even though you made all your payments you calculate your net worth or Bro, this is what I'm saying dangerous shit and people don't understand this So if you guys get behind so many people are like fuck look he's a criminal. He's at this. He's at that like Dude they can do that to you. Okay, they can do the same thing to you I'm final thoughts on this topic real quick because we've got to move on but I want to ask what do you think I know you don't like to speculate But what do you think is the outcome of this of this one specific case is that there's three others But what do you think happens in this case? Oh This case the judge is gonna rule against him Yeah, he's gonna have he's gonna have a verdict against him and then it will go up on appeal and I think I think just about all these are gonna be trial losses and appellate wins Got it. Okay. Well, you heard here first on real a. Yeah, so we'll stay tuned on that man Yeah, it's funny and guys if you if you want to jump in on this conversation hashtag bring them down because I I I agree with you and I think they're gonna try to jell them in some of these cases. Yeah, oh, you know So yeah guys tell us what you guys think hashtag bring them down down in the comments Let us know what you guys think the harder they push on this dude the big this is what these guys are failing to understand because they live in an echo chamber Do they not understand it or do they not care? Well, I think they don't care anytime you have a political candidate that's not planning on debating or campaigning And I'm not talking about Trump talk about Biden. Yeah, who that should scare you it should scare you that this highly unpopular elderly man who Most people fucking hate because he's ruining their lives legitimately Is literally not planning on campaigning why do you think that is It were for them last time sitting the basement That should worry people that should be highly concerning Anyway, no, it's real shit man But before we get to our second headline guys as always let's cruise the comments So we had a big day yesterday we we dropped episode number two Oh, yeah episode number two of day of the life and we had a lot of really really great comments guys Like first of all, I mean the commute you guys are amazing you guys really are that's super cool It's really really awesome.

Yeah, fuck you You don't like it fuck off But uh, no, I know we had a lot of really really great comments, but I like this one the best it was very very simple right to the point Um, so today's cruise the comment comes from uh No, Rodriguez. Yeah, okay I didn't know there was something different there okay. All right. No, we're out regress 7872 the Americans Dream will not die because of you Andy. Thank you for leading no, it will not die because of you That's what you have to understand just because I'm out here. I'm I've been doing this for 25 years The reason I come on here and talk this shit is so that you have the opportunity to go live your dream And this is the other thing I saw a few comments like oh Andy's just trying to show off his lifestyle Yeah, motherfucker. You write about that. I've earned it I've been I'm gonna know that it's for 25 fucking years And I want to show the young men and women out there that are out there grinding that there's a fucking reward for that grind at some point Yeah, it's an obligation if you're winning if you're a winner if you built something To let people see some of the spoils share some of that reward Let them know that I'm on the other side of this fucking bullshit that they're working through There's something to actually be had and we don't see that enough because we got all these knuckleheads on the internet Crying about people showing the fuck off. I'm not showing up bro Do you know how hard I dim my shine so that you guys don't fucking die? Like if I'm being real if I went around here and I showed off and flexed you'd fucking know Okay, I'll teach James Like I'm legitimately being considerate. I'm being considerate of your fragile little feelings Okay, so you know if I was flexing and it didn't it isn't showing 20 minutes of my life There's not a place I can point this mother fucking phone that ain't a flex for most people And I've earned that and I've done it for 25 years and you can too So when I show you some of the cool shit in my life, it's not bragging It's inspiration for you and if you see it as hate or whatever get the fuck off my page Go be a fucking loser or eat your hot pocket with your fucking mom give a shit What I love it bro, I'm dead serious.

Yes exactly so You know Winners are inspired by that shit losers are hate to become haters. That's reality. No people who hate Bro they hate themselves. They don't even that's a loser matter. That's no. It's not it's a literal statement If you hate on someone else you're hating yourself because what you're telling God and what you're telling the world is I don't like winning and that means you're never gonna get it So remember when you hate on someone and you talk shit on someone if you even think bull shit about someone that's winning That's just hating on yourself because you'll never win You'll let your put out the wrong energy you put out the wrong vibes and what you're saying is I don't like winning. I don't want winning and winning will never come to you It's real shit man. So when you hate you're hating yourself, bro love it Love it, man. Well guys, let's get back into our headlines headline number two now We're not beating dead horses here. All right, but there's some developments here. We got to cover it And there's also some interest in backstory on why the story is coming out So we covered last show I believe about What's going on in China, right kids are getting sick. Oh, have you been seeing that? Well, let's have my reads mystery wave of pneumonia hits America. They're saying that it's here Mojillo County records 142 cases of white lung syndrome which says Which it says meets the definition of an outbreak as China and Europe grapple with crisis Like I said, we covered this thing. You know, we also covered you know if you guys do some research Go back to October. I believe 23rd of 2022 where they ran a second tabletop experiment Where they planned out something just like this Now I was like, why did this headline come out? Why why this article right um Why now right and it took me a couple of minutes and then I found this headline Fouchy set to be grilled by house GOP majority for first time Oh, that's why they got a cup. What's the distraction? And I think that's the important thing to remember here guys There's always this this shale game. They try to play look over here. Don't look over here And we like to expose it here here at here relay up So I was diving to this so dr. Anthony Fauci is facing the house GOP majority for the first time in a marathon two-day session behind closed doors To discuss the US government's handling of COVID-19 Fauci the former long-term director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Will be interviewed by the House Oversight Committee select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic In his second place across two days on January 8th and 9th which each day set to last seven hours Without accounting for breaks the committee announced on Thursday Fauci also agreed to public uh to testify in a public hearing at a later date the committee said The immunologist was the most public facing federal health official during the COVID-19 pandemic under both the Trump and Biden administrations President Biden ended up elevating Fauci to his top medical advisor position He left when he left his other role at the end of 2022 He ended up taking a large share of blame for the negative impact on the public health measure at the time With his endorsement of lockdowns and school closures Since being blamed for significant learning loss among students across the United States Um, that's just that that's not that's being easy. That's that's being very very nice Um chairman Brad Winstrup out of Ohio said Fauci's testimony was critical to his panels investigation on the origin of COVID-19 Course of mandates gain a function type research Scientific censorship and more quote it is time for Dr. Fauci to confront the facts and address the numerous controversies that have a really risen during and after the pandemic Winstrup said in a statement quote Americans deserve trusted public health leaders who prioritize the well-being of our people over any personal or political gains Um, and at the same time they're trying to run this this uh fear tactic of the uh this new outbreak Um, as we were just talking about good buddy Eric Schmidt He's back in it Republican Senator Eric Schmidt vows to end COVID tyranny of CDC and NIH So he's he's getting a bill together that he's about to get passed Senate uh Senator Eric Schmidt introduced a bill Thursday that would give Congress greater oversight Of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the CDC And the National Institutes of Health following the COVID-19 pandemic according to a copy of the measure Exclusively obtained by the post the bill known as the quote in COVID tyranny act with Mandate congressional appointment and term limits for the directors of both agencies as well as require a majority vote by both chambers To approve a public health emergency lasting longer than 90 days Guys, I know what we got on this Look man, I think we need to be a lot more aggressive. I think these people ruined lives. I think these people Caused deaths. I think these people coordinated things that You know created the destruction of many American families not just their family businesses, but also their lives have ruined uh, you know They've ruined the lives of of millions of people and they did it In my opinion for reasons that had nothing to do with health and everything to do with control And I think anybody who's been paying attention from the last few years can see that and so to like continue to You know pretend like these guys were acting in any regard With the health of the general public in mind Is an absurdity and I think we need politicians including Eric Schmidt to get a little bit more aggressive Maybe a lot more aggressive and actually holding people accountable that committed these crimes There were real consequences to them people actually died as you noted a minute ago There were people many people who didn't take ivomectin or hydroxychloroquine or Strictly on the base of the narrative that they were spending the own our own federal agencies The FDA put out a tweet with a picture of a horse that made fun of anybody that actually took this Okay, and we have now come to realize that guess what it is actually effective And what's happening is no one has actually tied together the idea that the reason that they wouldn't allow discussion of effective therapeutics Is because they actually would have had to end their emergency order So if they would have had to end their emergency order they would have lost control and lost their ability to do a lot of the things that they did And so when we think about why they did what they did it had nothing to do with health and had everything to do with control manipulation of an election and the manipulation and well transfer from the middle class to the upper class and that's reality They need a very dependent population To create a universal basic income type society where people are dependent on the government Where they continue to vote these guys have figured out that people will vote for The free shit it started back with Obama with his free cell phone Okay, Obama campaign on giving a free cell phone out to a whole bunch of people and it fucking worked All right, so we have a society that is literally willing to give up their fucking freedoms for a guaranteed check from the government And they're forcing the hand of businesses by creating scenarios where people have to close their businesses or people actually get fired And when we talk about You know all these people like a fire for not taking the shot that was part of that You know like we're this happened a lot of the military bro This is this is part this is all a play to create a dependency class and to get people enough of those people on one side of the situation Where they continue to vote for these people This is their play and we're in a situation now where you know these people are not being held accountable and we're in danger of them doing it again So until these people are literally fucking hung They will continue to do the shit over again and I'm tired of politicians pussy footing around the issue That's my opinion But what should I take on the code? Dude should be on the end of a fucking spike You know there's a couple of things this to me is you look at Throughout our history the government is is always growing and it's always finding ways You know to creep more and more into our lives And what was intended to originally be as a relatively limited government Has instead become very you know overwhelming and Every time that there is a situation like this that they can use that to further their own power They do that You know one thing that When you talk about how how bad all these measures were you know something that I deal with You know relatively frequently is in DOD when they had the covid-vax mandate which was clearly erroneous And they kicked out all these people they did you know terrible things to their records To to try and get rid of anybody who wouldn't comply and I don't know if you saw this but not only are we now you know They now opening up reversing all of those you know bad you know bad discharges But the army's actually sent out letters saying we missed our recruiting goals So here's the process to reverse your discharge and please see a recruiter because we'd like you back Why do they like you back why do they want you back Because they They lost so many people and they've missed all the recruiting goals Well, they can't get the mission done It's not the mission bro. They they're gonna sent me Listen, they don't have enough warriors anymore. Yeah, they fucking kicked out all the warriors Warriors have a mentality and it has a certain level of fuck you to it right okay And they were on musk in there. Yeah exactly and so they took all the fucking warriors bro And and sent him out of the military because they wanted a compliant military Okay, and now we're in danger of actually being in a real war and they need them back And that's the problem so and most of these dudes aren't going back so Well, it's the problem is you kick them out and they have to find a way to you know to restart their lives in a different way And so they get into business. Yeah, they get new jobs. And so yeah, how many of them are gonna say okay? Yeah, you know Bro, if you really want to back take some of this money Something over to fucking Ukraine and offer him a year extra salary as a bonus to rejoin They won't do that shit though So much of it Yeah, so much of it for veterans you know our our relationship with the military is kind of like you know It romantic relationship where it's you know battered wife syndrome and no matter how bad they abuse you keep going back Because the navy really does love me. Yeah, and You know, but the reality is here You know the dod broke up with them, you know broke their heart and said you know, we don't want you anymore And now it's like you know, I know I abused you, but please come back. Yeah We'll see how I see that how I and I see this from a different perspective than most people But I look at it as okay If I'm trying to do some very Evil shit as a government I can't have my people in the military not going along with what I'm doing So how do I get the people who would be the least compliant out of my system so that I can now do what I need to do and get the full support of our military behind it Yeah, and that's how I see what's been going. No That that is I don't see it. They took it too far because now they got people who are compliant But I'm not capable to do that and guess who guess where all the capable warriors are Oh, they're on the side of the fucking people where they should be they fucked up with that. I think they did to you man Yeah, bad chest move because they're stupid I don't think they expected that many people to hold firm. I think that they expect that everybody to Well, you guys are welcome for that Yeah, well, I mean, I feel like you know A very common response was like hey, man listen, you know, I took the anthrax stuff like you know we're diny pigs Everybody's got it no big deal right, but it's just like yeah, I get that but this is different You know, and there was a lot of people that stood up and was like yeah, no, we're not doing it. I'm not doing it Um, it's unfortunate unfortunate. I just feel like too. There's so much time has passed since those discharges because that was what 2020 2021 Is what you got going? Yeah, 21 when he got going like heavy Like, bro, you tell me two years old was all 21 because the man they didn't come in until after Trump left exactly exactly So it was all 21 22. Yeah, but I mean, so we're talking two years. Yeah, I mean fuck like again Like you said the business have been started. They moved on with the lives and I try to now I got to stop all of this shit to come back and do what I can see a lot of people saying all right I'll come back in the reserves. Yeah, but I can't give up my job. I've I've restarted my life over here Yeah, I don't think they wanted people in that look dude. I believe I fully believe I fully believe in my heart That these people planned like you said to him on very little resistance very little And I believe that their plan for the very little resistance was to remove those people from society completely And if you look at what they did with the Vax mandates the pressure they put on private institutions You know, they were threatening to sue companies like mine who wouldn't enforce and make I'm not making my employees take this shit There's no fucking way and they were threatening companies like mine with fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars per employee So like when we're talking about what they were trying to do That I totally agree they did not count on the level of resistance that actually occurred And I think their plan their plan was to take the people who resisted the small amount and put them into fucking FEMA camps Or dispose of them in some way and they needed a compliant military to do the orders and enough in the military said no Like bro, why is why why are there why was the state of Washington building COVID camps? Why were they building camps in Australia You know like dude we were this close like had it they're not been the resistance that actually occurred We were fucking this close to a large part of the most the strongest Most resistant citizens in every single country on the planet being killed Being killed and that would make slaves out of everybody else. So that's how I see it and you know Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm pretty good at recognizing patterns and Why would you not want why would you want a more compliant military? Why would you need a more compliant military to blindly follow orders? The only reason you would need that is if you were going to do something that require blind obedience And what kind of thing would require a blind obedience doing something that was inherently evil that everybody disagreed with right And so I think the fact that you know there was resistance Literally saved the world because dude if they would have eliminated the people who were resisting those are your fighters Those are your warriors those are people with backbone the rest of you motherfuckers would have been slaves forever And I think they're gonna try it again. That's my opinion. That's what it looks like man. It's looking like it That's my opinion, but I got tinfoil hat right here real nice one. So maybe I'm fucking wrong I always think what if I were the enemy what would I do If I were them what would I do if I want to control how would I do it? If I wanted to create a situation where I wasn't having resistance. How would I remove the resistors? Right, yeah, how would you do it? Well, if you were only planning on One percent of the people saying no, I'm not doing it. You could get everybody else to go along with that Remember the language they were using remember remember true doe saying on tv I don't know what we're gonna do with these people. What do we do with these people? That's genocidal language. Yep. That's saying We have no other way. This is the way lower life. But yes. Yes like bro, this is That the plan they had was much worse than what actually enrolled in my opinion. Yeah Guys tell us what you guys think jumping on this conversation down to the comments Hashtag finding Fauci. Let us know what you guys think. I would that being said. Let's get to our third and final headline guys headline number three Again, we touched on it a little bit But new information has come out. Let's talk about it The headline reads thousands of fake Facebook accounts shut down by meta were primed to polarize voters ahead of 2024 Hmm, this is a big deal This is a big big big deal and nobody's talking about it. So let's talk about it um This is the AP news article reads someone in China created thousands of fake social media accounts designed to appear to be from Americans and use them to spread polarizing political content and an apparent effort to divide the US ahead of its next year's elections meta set Thursday The network of nearly 4800 fake accounts was attempting to build an audience when it was identified and eliminated by the tech company which owns Facebook and Instagram The accounts sported fake photos names and locations as a way to appear like every day American Facebook users weighing in on political issues Instead of spreading fake content as other networks have done the accounts were used to reshare post from ex the platform formerly known as Twitter that were created by politicians news outlets and others The interconnected accounts pulled content from both liberal and conservative sources An indication that its goal was not to support one side or the other but to exaggerate partisan divisions and further inflame polarization Uh, the newly identified network shows how Americans formed adversaries exploit US based tech platforms to so discord and distrust And it hints at the serious threats posed by online disinformation next year when national elections will occur in the US India, Mexico, Ukraine, Pakistan, Taiwan, they're not gonna exist in Ukraine. They've already cancelled their election. Yeah Ukraine's done. Yeah And uh and other nations um quote these networks still struggle to build audiences but they are a warning said Ben Nimo Who leads investigations into authentic behavior on meta's platforms quote foreign threat actors are attempting to reach people across the internet ahead of the next year's elections And we need to remain alert Meta platform zinc based in Menlo Park, California did not publicly link the Chinese network To the Chinese government But it did determine the network originated in that country the content spread by the accounts broadly compliments other Chinese government propaganda and disinformation That is sought to inflate partisan and ideological divisions within the United States Um and while this is happening right It's all about what's happening in the background and I think the important the reason I have these articles here is because people should be aware America is weak right now right where we fundamentally physically financially America's militarily is weak. Yeah, we're weak right now right? I mean we got citizens that are demoralized and the the thing is is that We see it internally, but other people see it other countries are seeing that and they're acting on most weaknesses, right? So the second context headline I have in here as well as this is all coming out this headline comes out federal government investigating multiple hacks of US water utilities So this just came out The federal government is investigating multiple hacks suspected to have been launched by an Iranian government linked cyber group against US water facilities That we're using is Rayleigh made technology Kicking year ago they would say Russia linked government like yeah right with you Ukrainian water facilities. Yes Um according to the two individuals familiar with the probes One of the branches made headlines saturday after the Tyron links cyber avengers group claim responsibility for hitting a water authority in Pennsylvania In total the government is aware of an examining Quote single digit number of facilities that have been affected across the country According to the two people who were granted anonymity to discuss details They had not yet been made public Um none of the hacks call significant disruption according to the individuals while cyber experts familiar with the Pennsylvania incident say the activity Appears designed to stoke fears about using is Rayleigh devices Um Where we got on this guys Okay, here's what I got They're fucking billboards as one hacker way Okay, that's better. Yeah, all right. So so let's talk this through A year ago it was Russia that was doing all this shit. Mm-hmm. Okay. Now who is it China? Oh, no, it's Iran Oh China. Yeah, and it's it's always the people that they tell us are our mortal enemies and I'm just saying I'm not sure I believe that shit at all Okay, that's that's where I'm coming from I think there's a there's a high probability that members of our own government who want to Create support for certain situations are willing to literally damage the infrastructure of the United States or do certain things to create that support And so I think it's I don't think that's out of the realm of possibilities I don't think that's unreasonable to consider after what we've witnessed so When I see news like this, I always look at it from okay. Yeah, it could be Iran It could be Russia. It could be this it could be that It can also be our own people doing it to gain support to create a war So that they make a lot of money and get what they're trying to get and it's hard to tell because these people are all Fucking lying and they've lied so much that we can't figure out what's truth and what's actually not truth So when I look at what's going on I see multiple scenarios of what the truth could be and I don't think any of them are in that article Hmm, that's what I think same what you got you know A lot of this you know, I look at the time that I spent doing the January 6th investigations and You start with 2016 where you know Russia tried to tip the tip the election in favor of Donald Trump And then in 2020, you know, then the other side, you know, thinks that Um that there was fraud to you know help Joe Biden and really if you take a step back from it and look at it You know of what do our enemies want Then one destabilization And by the way the Chinese wrote this down they wrote it down hundreds of years ago Sunsu's the art of war and it says it right in there but these stabilizing the enemy to win the fight before you have to enter the battlefield and the ideal thing would be For one election to think that it had been destabilized With one political party complicit with the foreign government to commit fraud and steal the election one way and then four years later to do it the exact opposite way and so You know, it was interesting to me where it talks about how this Chinese group, you know, wasn't really necessarily supporting one party or the other that the goal is simply destabilization Because that's what I say and when I look at a lot of the things you know in 2020 I have no idea whether there was Fraud in that election, whether the outcome was Was real or not and the reason for that is because I've never seen a full and complete investigation either direction on that What I have seen is that the people that were doing this at the time saw indicators that they believed Would show that there was fraud and that they pursued those leads and that they were stymied from being able to You know fully investigate those because of time resources And so they went to DOJ and they asked them and the state agencies to take it over And they refused and so there wasn't really that full investigation of whether there was fraud or not Of course leading up to than January 6th, but If you're a foreign government, if I'm China, I don't actually have to swing the election for Joe Biden All I have to do is manipulate some of the public data So the people on the right think that there's been fraud And in fact the most brilliant thing China could have done in 2020 was to make the Trump side believe that fraud have been committed Without Chinese fingerprints on it and instead so that they start blaming the Democrats And so you have both sides You know continuing to fight one another which causes that destabilization Which makes us much easier to You know to conquer from the outside and then when you add on top of that what we were just talking about with DOD getting rid of all the best warriors with You know with covid Vax mandates doesn't this all Really Fit perfectly into the Chinese playbook that they've been following for hundreds of years Well, doesn't it fit perfectly that we have a commander in chief that is under investigation for taking funds On behalf of China for certain political favors The and the fact that since that man has been in office He has drained our strategic oil reserves. He has left a large percentage of our military equipment in Europe He has created an invasion crisis at our southern border And he's he's like crime and instigated crime To run rapid in the inner cities of this country Etc etc etc etc etc we could go down the list. So isn't it convenient That we also have a president who has you know allegedly By the data that's been of Been shown that he is taking money from other countries and pay for play schemes Doing these things that make our country weaker. What does that actually mean? Well, that means is the people who are at the top of our country are actually fucking traders Okay, and they're selling the American people down the drain by making us literally Setting us up on a platter for us to be conquered So like doesn't that make sense with what with that same strategy? Absolutely Yeah, so like because that's also part of the Chinese strategy is if they can then infiltrate our people and You know and have some of our high government officials. Yeah, Eric Swalwell. Yeah, is good exact thing Yeah, exactly she was killed. Yeah, I saw crash. I saw what went unreported. I saw that interesting very interesting. Yeah, no it's All of this is consistent with what their playbook is And it's all about creating division And then if you can also bribe some government officials and get some you know Get some people at the top that are beholden to them then it just makes it all the much easier So you know to me yeah, I certainly respect how you look at it and you say this looks like it could be our own people Well, that's that's what I look at it and I say this all very clearly it could be our own people doing it For the benefit of money that they've been picked yeah, absolutely, so we're both kind of agreeing. Oh, yeah, I agree with you I mean the division that's been created is is insanity Yeah, like and I can remember saying many times three four years ago like hey Other countries don't look at us as black and white and Asian and American Indian and all these things They look at us as the United States of America and we're over here arguing over the color of the pigment and our Fucking skin when they're licking their chops to come over and kill all of us that doesn't make any fucking sense Yeah, that's how I would bro their opportunities. That's how I see it. No, I mean dude We're doing right all the opportunity tip tip what Tim is saying is correct like This has been a thousand year plan for them and they this we're not the first country. This has happened to no We just happened to have the most important people in our office in our media and some of the most powerful discourse platforms Going along with it to create it for money which bro Think about that. What is that? What is that called? What is that called when someone takes money and sells out their country man What is that called that used to be punishable by death? This is a sedition that's treason. Yeah, that's treason dude. Well, it's a group back in the day Back in the day individuals can commit treason Benedict Arnold. No, I'm saying but if it's a group it's cost edition right Sedition is is is when you're trying to overthrow your own government. Gotcha I mean They saw the fucking election it might be yeah treason is where you're well. How do you have sedition? Okay? Here's a question I have yeah, so how do you have sedition? Wait, wait, are these billable hours? This is a real question. Yeah, so where is the line with sedition when our own constitution says that our citizens have a duty to remove corrupt officials from office Do process In what way the do the do process would be the issue is that we Where the law sees the difference is in removing those corrupt public officials through impeachment indictment etc. Versus you know the the armed mob with You know with Tiki torches. Yeah, but if the armed mob wins and there's nobody to accuse you of sedition Yeah, see that was all my always my problem It's a sort of who defines corruption. What do people the people who win? That's what I'm saying. Yeah But the problem is the only reason they're able to say JC likes was wrong dude History is always written by the winners. Yeah, you know how different is that from what we did to the British right? You know right the difference is we want they say we we did a coup right Look bro, we say here's a prop here's the problem I see with it here. This is a mate. This is When I saw that did you you you probably saw the release footage that just came out for January 6 where the guys were fist bumping And all that stuff under cover agents taking the badges out. What's your take on that? Yeah January 6 was such a um Politicized event that we've lost sight of a lot of the facts You know, there was a lot of bad behavior on that day But at the same time there were a lot of people that are in jail right now that I don't think you know Really engaged in bad behavior, you know when I saw some of these videos People look like they were you know, they were tourists, you know the cops are opening the doors They're walking in they're looking around and I personally believe that a Large percentage of those people probably thought You know what I just watched a whole bunch of people disrupt the Kavanaugh hearings They go into the hearing they make their voices heard the capital police drags them out put some back out on the street And they have they have exercised their first amendment rights and they move on And I wouldn't be surprised if a large percentage of those people Walk up see the cops opening the doors and think that they're going to do the exact same thing They're gonna go in they're gonna make their voices heard they're gonna say You know, we don't agree with you certifying this election unless you investigate the fraud The capital police will escort them out and then that's going to be the end of the day Not that they're going to be charged with all this you know stuff and go to jail for 10 years Yes, there were some bad actors there. There were definitely you know smaller group that you had You know had darker designs, but to try to take Take that same brush and paint them all with it You know is not accurate and it always drives me nuts when they call it an insurrection because Insurrection is in the US criminal code And nobody's been charged with it. Well, and so how can you possibly call that an insurrection? How can you call it an insurrection when we have Literally more guns in the citizenship of the United States than almost every other military has in their fucking armies combined And nobody brought them to the insurrection right The fuck out of here. Yeah, okay, this fact They wanted to disrupt they wanted to disrupt the proceeding Because they did not believe that the elected officials were taking into account The the will of their electorate correct of their constituencies And so they wanted to make their voices heard You know that I understand and so you know, but that's not a crime Oh, dude also Let's be fucking real, okay? What better way and this is my own opinion But what better way if you actually did manipulate an election To deflect the attention from the manipulated election then to create an insurrection That wasn't actually an insurrection and then take the insurrection and prosecute the former president For the insurrection there was actually created by bad actors in the fact that there were any three letter agents Or any sort of police dressed up as that should mean everybody is fucking out of jail It's entrapment and here's the other piece of it. I don't know what it is legally, but dude is wrong Here's the other piece of it is when you come down so hard on these people. Let's say that there is claims of fraud in the next election Okay Who's gonna go down to the Capitol and protests like dude? We're talking about real shit, okay? Like these guys are making that I agree with you the the entire part of Prosecuting all these people was to create a situation where people are intimidated to show public disapproval of what's actually going on So how many protests where are the patriotic Americans? Where are the fucking red, white and blue Fourth of July hot dog grill and beer drinking mother fucking man Americans. They're there. They didn't disappear They're all out there. They all listed in this show. They fucking they they know what's going on But they're quiet and they're under the fucking ripples of the water Why because they want that people to be quiet because they know that those voices matter So they don't want people speaking up or standing up or going out and protesting that are patriotic Americans because it It shows the amount of fucking fraud and where the public actually stands, okay? When you see Fuck I don't know how many people were at J6 bro. There's a million people, wasn't it? There were a lot yeah When you see a million people with American flags like that look like regular everyday Americans who are all and by the way There's some of the coolest people on the planet. They're not domestic terrorists. These are just fucking people that love American man And they're all out there together and everything like they don't want that because when you see that it inspires more people to join that to do that Yes, so dude. This is a societal cultural manipulation and and here's the problem that I have with it Now they're using this insurrection quote-unquote That they planted people in to create a scenario where They're prosecuting Donald Trump The on a situation they created so what better way to get what they're trying to get which is the maintained power than to rig an election Run a fake fucking insurrection then prosecute the dude who they say is responsible for it You see what I'm saying and then and then and then by the way Scare everybody who has any thread of patriotic blood in their system from saying shit or doing shit and then and bro remember No dude and use that To have states take him off the ballot so we can't run again the next all being rejected for the that that's being written but yeah As you just put up earlier They are denying him the ability to subpoena for the full files exactly so that it'll never be found Never found no it will be found. It just won't be found until these people are out Yeah, like dude. This is insane. What's happening? This is historic times. This is real and I agree with you man the whole the whole the biggest part of J6 was to intimidate the patriotic American in the silence They did it peacefully with the branding of silent majority before that right like that's a cultural Movement that they intentionally create. It's not Like they want people to say oh man. I'm part of the silent majority bro. There's no nobility in that like that means you're a fucking pussy Okay, silence equals We don't get what we want ever that's what it equals and they know that so they branded this piece this this big swath of Americans as the silent majority okay, I don't have to speak up I don't have because I'm in the majority and we're gonna win anyway, you know It's funny because I see that regularly the you know the silent majority where you know people come up to me in the gym And yeah, I live right outside of Washington DC people come up to me in the gym Look around. I love what you're doing. Yeah, exactly. I know exactly. They do it all the time I know bro. I get it everywhere. I can't do what you do, but man. It's awesome what you're doing And I'm looking at this motherfucker. I'm like bro. You got no fucking backbone Where's your fucking dick and balls? You know, I'm saying you wearing your wife's tampon right now Like real talk like are you fucking what what the fuck is wrong with you? What do you mean you can't speak up? What do you mean you can't join in? What do you mean you can't share the message? What do you mean? That's why we're losing That you'll know when an insurrection happens bro because a million people will show up with weapons and kid it out And like it'll be real shit. That'll be a real insurrection. Yeah That's a real insurrection an insurrection is not a bunch of patriotic people who feel like Something bad is happening in their country and they get invited into a fucking A building with the police standing right there. So hey, come on in man. Yeah, but the thing is the people that will The freedom-loving Americans Aren't gonna want to do that because the reality is They want the constitutional system that we have right it the people they just want to be enforced right the people that want to overthrow our constitutional system are Damn are not gonna be the ones showing up with gun. Yeah, but they're gonna be the ones scattering The moment that there's a counteroffensive. Yeah, listen dude Here's my opinion and and grittances of the same opinion There's no going back you guys think we're gonna go back to 2019 or 2018 or 2005 it ain't fucking happening We're gonna have to look at what's happening. We're gonna have to rebuild forward It has to be new creation or has to be and by the way that could be just creating a system that enforces the rules that were laid out 247 years ago Okay, but the reality is is those rules have been highly deluded and highly compromised and we are way far away from what our founding fathers And what this country was supposed to be about and for us to get back to that it's going to take something There's no magic to this like it's going to take action and when I mean action. I don't mean Violence what I mean though is everybody participating in the public rally to push us back into the boundaries of what this country is supposed to be And that's something that not enough people understand that they have a role in that every single day They have a role in that and what they say how they live what their standards are how they behave in their community How they behave at their job how they run their companies? It's the personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion because when we This from a cultural standpoint Demand that the government get back in the rails of the Constitution through Through our voices it will eventually happen if the voices are strong enough They won't require violence like a lot of people want But the reality is is if people don't join in what we'll get is violence and it won't be us bringing it to them It'll be them bringing it to us and that's what people should be afraid of you know what they fear more than a violent insurrection Is that the next primary will get rid of every incumbent yeah, but it should happen every single one That's right. They're both sides. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that would be a a much more effective revolution Yes, he's if both sides Vote out every incumbent and we put new blood in bingo. Yeah, you do that. That's that's a problem Becoming less and legal revolution the problem becomes brother is that well a lot of people don't believe the elections are real anymore So a lot of people are like well fuck we can vote our way to what you know I'm saying No, I agree with you though that is what needs to happen and long with the realignment of culture to a to a higher standard of living Citizens understanding that hey man we have an obligation to live a certain way here certain things happen here certain things Are not okay here? It's not okay for a grown man to dress up as a woman to shake his dick in front of kids We're not gonna tolerate that okay. It's not okay for our own government to send All of our military equipment to Europe and leave it there. It's not okay for our government to send our our grown men to war every generation Because they want to thin out the herd of strong capable Independent free thinking warriors. It's not okay for them to leave the border open where millions and millions and millions of people who shouldn't be here come here like These things are not acceptable crimes not like and that's a cultural nonacceptance that's you as a listener and you as a citizen saying this is unacceptable to me In open in front of your friends and not fucking apologizing for it and then living the way that you think an American is supposed to live Like when they're when I was a kid dude and when you were a kid There was things where like you just knew what you could and couldn't do like bro If you did if you behaved a certain way bro your neighbor might come out of his house smack the shit out of you You know what I'm saying like bro you you you stop on an American flag like when I was a kid bro Your your neighbor who served you and now I'm come kick your fucking ass your 12 years old Real talk and nobody says shit because everybody say you deserved it Yeah, I tell you another way at the risk of opening real can of worms another way to fix it It's just to break up the two political parties If you got rid of those political parties and allow to Americans to realign Based on their actual values instead of what the parties demand I mean people always you know they they call me Yeah, I love it when they say oh your Republican lawyer like no no no yeah, I don't identify with any pull I don't either I don't either I think it's dangerous right I don't agree with everything that either party says you know and some things I agree with one and some things I agree with another and so therefore I refuse to identify with either party and I think that the best way to resolve a lot of these things would be to break up those two parties And realign based on what Americans actual values are And I mean the idea that these two parties are monoliths that they can never be Broken is silly. I mean how many different political parties have we had throughout the history of this country? Lots exactly. It has not always been these two. What about so it's been two major But it's not always been these two What about part of the responsibility of a responsible citizen of this country Being not to make their identity with a political party right we like people's that cultural side of it That's right. These the media and these people have been so good at convincing people you have to be this or that You're either on that team or you're on this team and the real team is us the people versus them the fucking tyrants That's the teams okay, and and and we have to get to a point where we as citizens cannot say I'm a Republican Because that's saying I blindly agree with what the Republicans do and I don't love it Yeah, and you don't and most people don't either Most people are actually in the middle right most people are in the middle They have some more liberal views and they have some more conservative views and those Those very amongst where people come from or what they've been around or their social environment or where they're geographically located or their life experience and we have to get back to as individuals voting for people who represent what it is that we believe And not saying oh, well that guy's an R that guy's a D and that's why we vote You know like part of the problem is this people go in and they go right down one side of the ticket and they walk the fuck out They have no idea what those people stand for and that's a that's a majority of voters. It's a problem Yeah, it's a big problem You guys jumping into a valid point dude. Yeah Guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments.
