Hey that was that was good man. I came pop the stitches now listen DJ's been on the on the injured list this week. We don't say disabled list anymore we say injured list because that's offensive.

Listen listen this this shouldn't be fun. Not and I was high as shit coming off the surgery. Yeah I got a video. I didn't even know I took this video. But I got this video here. That's you. This is me. All right let's see. As soon as they wake me up. Oh. I don't remember taking this. I remember that you said that to me. No I said this one. No no you said once in this one. You said one of those to me. Oh you look like you're hurting her bro. Bro listen I don't remember this video. Oh. It was so interesting. Like that was my first time ever getting put to sleep. Yeah was it like I told you. It's like exactly how you told me. You count down and then I'll send you over. No I didn't even maybe count down. First he asked me he's like hey man you ain't got no guns or nothing on you because I'm about to tranquilize your ass. That's what my doctor. He's super cool. Doctor Dr. Grace's name. And I'm like no and he's like all right. Well you about to feel like I got a gag bag right here. I got any weapons. I swear to God. He's like you had any weapons. I'm like no man we're good. He's like all right we're night night. And then sure shit. I was out. Yeah I will right back up. Yeah. Super weird experience man. Super weird. But yeah this shit sucks. This sucks. Well you're doing all right. We got we got we got to do service to the people. Hey man listen I got to make sacrifices. Got my throat coat. So we should be good to go. I bet you like that throat coach. It works. It's your new favorite shit huh. It does work. Yeah it does work. I mean I'm pretty sure I was for the show started you said I love me some throat coat. I might listen we ought to whatever's necessary to get the job done. You know what I'm saying. Hey sometimes you got to you got a coat throat throat is coated. All right man. So what's going on with the shades. Oh shit. No no no leave them I like them. Oh okay I like them. It's a move. It's different. Yeah. You know I'll be like every other one to be podcaster now because because tape wore his glasses. Oh there were all these little dudes wearing a glasses and shit. No we just need the headphones. No bro I came writing for my outside cardio. It is a beautiful day. That's all right. And I was in the bat checking on on the fellows back there. See people don't realize like I come straight off the battlefield. Yeah. I didn't do the show you know you were not like in your basement. So yeah I'm doing shit on the thing. You know what I figured out too though. What's that? I figured out why most people's content why most people struggle with the content. What is it? Well you know I watch all these people make content on the internet. And I know I noticed something that's very profound. Once they get like a really expensive microphone and a headset. Their content just gets exponentially better. That's it. That's it. And they go down the road and now and they become Joe Rogan. So that's what we got the fucker mics. Yeah we just need the headset. Yeah Joe this is the new thing on the internet man. You know every single person that has something to say. We're perfect for plugged in. I guarantee it. Bro that's just there. Guys I just got to leave you with this. It's not the microphone. It's not the microphone. It's not the headset. It's what the fuck you're saying. Okay. Because you don't say anything that means anything. And you say the same shit that everybody said for gazillion fucking times. That's why nobody's listening. Yeah. If you speak about things that means something to you and that resonate with you and I'm giving you some free fucking game here. It's not the fucking microphone. It's not the headset. It's not the backdrop with the fucking neon or whatever the fuck you guys think it is. Oh I have an answer. I know. Every clip on the internet is become this now. Okay. And it makes me feel ridiculous because I'm making fun of the way my clips look on the internet. But I've been doing this is 2015 man. So I feel like I got a little bit more to say. But guys the gear isn't going to make your message resonate. It's going to be do you care about it. And that's shit that you want to talk about that you're afraid to talk about. That's the shit you should be talking about. And if you want your content to resonate. That's what's going to make it go. People on the other end of the fucking microphone in their ears can hear whether you give a shit or not about what you're talking about. So there's a little free game for you. That's really doesn't matter. The microphone. It doesn't matter. The suit you're in or the outfit or whatever the fuck you think it matters. It's what you're saying. And do you care about it. And the reason nobody cares about what you're saying is because you're not saying anything that you care about and they can feel it. So fucking stop. You know, you see people do things and you try to be them. You try to emulate them. You like dude. It's it's not that be you be authentic. Talk about the shit you care about. Talk about the way you want to talk about it. Don't become one of these drama people that just says clickbait shit. After a year. No one will listen to what you say. Be real. If you don't care about it. Don't talk about it. I do. It's just it's just look man. It's part annoying. Okay, but I part understand it because like I know all these people are trying to you know do something right. And then the other thing is is like if you really want people to listen to you bro have done some shit in your life that makes you credible. You know what I mean? Like this talking head. There's so many talking heads. Like it makes me want to just quit. It makes me want to like just quit the internet. Like it's it's but I can't. I'm too fucking good at it. Yeah. You are pretty good. So what's up man? What's going on? I don't forget to pay the fee. Yeah. Don't be host. Yeah. You don't got to practice saying real shit instead of practice saying week shit into some expensive microphone and headset. Holy shit man. Yeah. That's a fucking you take that to the bank. You start fucking actually getting to the bank. It's a one to or the world right there. Yeah. I know. But that's a to get into a man before we get to our main headlines. I know you like dogs. You like animals. I love dogs. I love dogs more than anything else in the world. Yeah. And listen. I have a heart form as well. I have a spot in the heart form too. I love animals. But did you see that a Biden's Biden dog. Yeah. He's fucking shit up right now. They. Now listen. Now. Now I think most people will read this and like all fuck that dog. The dog. He's been like fucking 24 people. Well, I think the question is who is he been. He's been. He's been a bunch of people. A lot of a lot of cigarettes guys. You know, but only the bad ones. Well, so that's my kind of like conclusion. I'm getting to because then they post this picture of him. That's a cry for help. Oh, dude. He's like I'm surrounded by idiots. Oh, fucking day. He doesn't want the tyrants, bro. Bro, none of these people pay attention to that guy. Like these people are all pieces of shit. Yeah. They don't. They don't give that dog any attention. They're not out playing with them. They don't fucking train him. That's a working class dog. You have to you know that. Fuck, bro. You're DJs mainly a fucking dog trainer. Like partly like fucking bro. These are working dogs. Like if you don't give them a mission, you don't train with them. They become like this. Yeah, I'm doing this is why people don't this is why inexperienced owners shouldn't have dogs like. Routwilers and German shepherds and people and fucking pit bulls are American bulldogs because bro, if you do not work with them and do not get the energy out of them, they are destructive. Yeah. And people are surprised. It's like bro, dogs got to have a mission too. Exactly. You know, you know what, did you know that I imagine your owner walking around just shitting himself all day. That's supposed to be you, bro. Like of course he's going to be pissed off. Yeah, he's like you're taking my spot. Like he gets played for it. Yeah. That's why he's biting everybody brother blame. He's from Joe Biden. I'll take him and come live with me. I can't. I wonder what they're going to do with. Yeah, because I mean, like I don't know if they're going to remove him out by me. You know, co-wrestling by me. No, yeah. And see like that's a true fucking firmness will there. Yeah. Yeah. He bites everybody. He fucking bite. He fucking hates it. He does. He does. He does. He does. You know. But yeah, man. So I don't know. I just thought that I wanted to see a take on that. Hey, man. Commander come live with me, bro. I'm going to get life. You know that I saw this clip on the internet that and it made a lot of sense. Did you know that a day of a dog's life is. I never did this math. But a day of a dog's life is equivalent to a week of a human life. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That'd be because of the seven year. Yeah. So think about that. That's why. Like your dog every day that wakes up is like happy and like the way that man. What if they actually know that they have limited time and that's why they live that way. You know what I'm saying? Think about that when you see your fucking dog, bro. And he's happy to see it and you just walk right by him. Like that's true. Bro, that's a week of a dog's life. You just fucking shit on because you're too busy on Instagram. Whatever fuck you do. Yeah. That definitely makes you think about it. Anyway, yeah. He needs a breakout. Yeah. Let's get it right by some more motherfuckers. He's a patriot. He's fighting his own insurrection from inside. I like K-died insurrection. Why not? Well, guys, let's get into it, man. We got some there's a lot of crazy shit going on today. Let's try to make some sense of it. I remember if you guys want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to anyfacilla.com. You guys can find them link there with that being said. Let's give it to our first headline headline number one talk of the day. Everybody's been dealing with it. AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon users hit by massive cellular outage in the US. This is great news. Fuck yeah, bro. Nobody call me. It was amazing. Like dude, I woke up. I saw like three texts. One was from you. One was from Honeys. Yeah. One was from my office. Hey, you're fucking. There's a sell outage. I'm like sweet. Put that bitch right back on the ground. I'm like, this is awesome. See, I woke up kind of the obvious opposite. So they got me on Viker, man. So I was a little high. And I woke up and my phone was like abnormally like like usually I get a bunch of like I got a bunch of shit coming in. Yeah, emails all these types of shit. And I'm like, I'm like, that's interesting. Nothing. And I see SOS at the top. I'm like, well, that's not good. And so I started doing my backups and all of that shit and get stuff together. And I'm like, holy shit. Like there's a massive. I got that something was wrong with my phone. You know what I'm saying? Like what the fuck? What mean? Man, it's a lot of people. And that's what makes it weird. It's because they're trying to downplay this of how serious this issue actually is or was at the time of the recording. So let's dive into this a little bit. So a major cell phone outage affected users across the US early Thursday, even stopping some police departments from being able to receive 911 calls. AT&T seemed to have experienced the largest number of issues with nearly 32,000 reports at around 430 AM, according to data from down detector, which tracks outages by collecting status reports from sources, including users submitted errors on this platform. Now more than 800 service outages were also reported on T-Mobile and Verizon, although a spokesperson for the latter put it down to users reporting problems trying to call people with other services. Other reported issues on smaller carriers included boost mobile consumer cellular and straight talk. Now, AT&T was kind of silent for a long time on this, not saying, and they're sure not really saying much as far as what the actual calls. And then again, you have a rise in the T-Mobile spokesperson's they told the posts of their networks were operating normally. But a lot of tech determined that was a fucking line. They're lying to their people too. It's kind of everywhere. You got the regular warmongers, fear mongers putting some shit out. Rubio, this is Rubio. Rubio warns Chinese cyber attack will be 100 times worse than AT&T outage. Your power, your water. So you headlines wrong. You read it wrong. What United States cyber attack on their own network to fuck up the election and ruin anyone's chance of removing them from power will be 100 times worse than the AT&T outage. Got it. Okay. Yeah. So I corrected it for you. I brought I'm still fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he put this. He put this tweet out. He says, quote, I don't know the cause of the AT&T outage. The Florida Republicans posted on Twitter on Thursday. He says, quote, but I do know that it will be 100 times worse when hashtag China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a Taiwan invasion. And it won't just be sell service. They hit will be your power, your water and your bank. And also he's going to apparently in another update. This just came in not to go that apparently pharmacies nationwide are facing delays is healthcare tech company reports cyber attack on the pharmacy infrastructure. And they do about this on Wednesday. That was on that wasn't reported. So a lot of weird things going on. Let's hop over to Twitter real quick. There's this suite that comes out and that apparently they're saying that it was a solar flare. Oh, yeah, space weather. Sure. Okay. And here's the local for storm team reporting on it. I'm saying that this level are three solar flare. That's what caused it. Let's check it. Good morning, Oklahoma. Maybe you're looking your phone and it's saying, SOS, what's going on? My husband had that this morning is freaking out. And I was like, did you, did you do your phone updates? No, this is all happening at 3 a.m. So we did that coming to work. He's not the only one guys. If you're experiencing that, it may be a result of space weather. Okay. I'm going to do my best to explain what's going on. Let's go ahead and take a look. So there was a strong solar flare event that happened just after midnight and they actually captured an image of it right here. I had to look up. I wish I knew everything about space weather. That's a whole different specialty. Yeah. But that's for radio communications. It's not even though it was going rain Thursday. But we know for effect. It was space weather. I'm, you know, look, bro, don't just make, don't make fun of her. I mean, she's doing her best. Like she's just very thankful that it's just space weather. That's all it is. Yeah. And it's nothing more nefarious than that. No, no, no, out of all, it's crazy though. It isn't it. Isn't it weird? Like out of all the times that we've had cell phones, like since the fucking eighties space weather. This is the first time ever. Hold on. This, this is crazy. Think about the coincidence happening here. Okay. In March of 20. What did we have a week away from March in March of 2020? We had COVID happened, right? And now here we are March of 2024. And randomly out of the last 30 fucking years, we have a solar flare. I know what it was. Climate change, Andy. Probably dude, like real talk. Like are these are is a general public this fucking stupid. Well, here's the thing. So I really want to bring up this guy real quick. Dr. Ryan French. He's a British solar astrophysicist has a PhD in this. He's challenging. I'm a fucker guy. He him pronouns. He does. But look what he has to say. Andy. He says some people are attributing cell network outages AT&T and Verizon in the US to last night's X class solar flare. However, Flares only cause radio degradation on the day side of the earth. As you can see below the US was not affected by the event. So it's just a coincidence. You continue saying FYI the consequences of solar flares and associated eruptions can do manifest in these same ways just probably not in this case. It would be interesting to see where the story originated from. It seems some individuals have put this correlation together themselves. But that no official sources are claiming this. Hey, Dr. Ryan. No official sources are claiming this because no official sources are responsible for this. Holy shit. Yeah, by the way, we're landed on the moon today. Of course we are. Yeah, Andy, what all you got on this, bro? We all know what we got on this. I've been saying that there was major disruptions coming and I said it would be one of three things. I said, what did I say? What did I say? It would be? Oh, I said it would be a war, a pandemic or a massive fucking cyber attack. Quote on quote cyber attack. Okay, these people are 1000% not going to let Donald Trump win an election. They are going to burn the world down. And this should be a wake up called anybody about what's going to happen over the next few months. It's going to get real bad and you need to consider what's going to happen when the power goes out for a fucking week and you can't access your bank account and you can't call anybody. You can't do anything. What is your life going to happen? What is going to happen to you? Most people can't do their panicking over a three hour no cell phone. Like think of how soft society is. And then on top of it, we've just flooded our country with millions upon millions of people who are used to living in the fucking Stone Age. And you think that this isn't a big problem. And you're going to continue to pretend like this isn't some sort of tyrannical, ridiculous interference in our way of life for the preservation of these people's own greed and own power and to cover their own ass for the crimes they've already committed. So you're going to continue to call people like me conspiracy theorists or alarmist while this is literally happening in front of your fucking faces. When this happens, whenever whatever just happens, the people who advocate the hardest for all these social bullshit issues, the blue hairs, the canceling people, the fucking progressive left, the 47,000 gender people, those people are dead. They're going to die because they are the least equipped to survive. These people calling everybody else domestic terrorists, you guys are not equipped to deal with what's going to happen and all the other people that you've called names and abused and fucked with and fuck with their livelihood and got them fired and got them canceled and called them big hits and put them on these lists and fucked with them for the last 20 years. Those people are ready. So everybody should think about that hard and long hard and it made me smile when I saw it. Let's put it to you that way. No. I've already resided myself to the understanding of what could potentially happen. You've accepted the possible outcomes. The probable outcomes. The probable outcomes is they're going to burn the country down to preserve. What would you do? If you had committed all of these crimes and you had done all this corruption and it had lasted for years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years. And you knew that the information was coming out and you knew that you were losing the people and people were starting to believe that it was true. And you knew that if you lost power that you would be held accountable for those actions and the accountability for those actions would mean life imprisonment or maybe death. What would you be willing to do to preserve? Your place in society and the answer is for every single one of you anything. Okay. So to think that these people are going to just lay down and let Donald Trump walk into the White House because the people demand it and want it. They wanted it in 2020. They didn't allow it then. What the fuck do you think is going to happen this time? It's just going to be way more obvious. And what's going to happen is we're going to come to a point. In the next 12 months, we're America is going to have to make a decision. They're going to have to decide. Am I willing to allow these corrupt people who are destroying my country intentionally, who are making my life harder, who are allowing millions upon millions upon millions of military age males into this country, who are destroying our cities by soft on crime policies, who are inflating our dollar and making us. Poor who are causing all of this damage and creating all of this shit and cheating and lying and manipulating and making all these lies, which everybody seems to have woken up to. Even the Democrats, the people who voted for Biden in 2020 are now looking at what's going on and they're saying, yeah, this is a fucking problem. Okay. When you consider what they're willing, what they've already done. Do you think there's a line for them? There's not. So we're going to have a point, we're going to have a point in time that's going to come where we're going to have to decide. Are we going to hand the country over to these people or are we going to stand up and say, fuck you. This is our country and you 2000 people who think you're better than everybody and think you have the God given right to rule over us. We have a decision to make. That's what it comes down to. You know, like are we going to accept this or are we not going to accept this? And that's going to come. We're going to be forced as Americans. We're going to be forced as men to stand on the line for real. And people think this is bullshit. They think, oh, you know, all you pro two a fucking alpha male fucking trash talking fuckers who made your whole idea. About guns and 3% and all the shit your ass is going to be asked to stand on the line with other men. You know, you guys who have not been interested in this. You've been doing your life pretending this is not happening and pretending someone else is going to take care of it. You're going to have a decision to make. Are you willing to hand this country over and allow it to become a communist country that's ruled by these people or Are you going to stand on the line and protect it and say this is the people's country and We have a decision to make as people are we gonna continue to fight over all these things like race and gender and sexual orientation and These made up Identity Palotic policies that have been imposed on our society for the last 20 plus years that I can remember in my life Are we going to allow that to continue or are we going to look around at each other and be like you know what man? This is fucked up like you're not causing me the problems I'm not causing you the problems, but they are causing all of us the problems are we going to come to that conclusion? Are we going to realize that it's not black or white or gay or straight or left or right? It's actually the people versus a tyrannical Government that is looking to fundamentally change what this country is all about and that is going to affect you Because they're if you're a middle class person which most people are they're looking to make you as poor as possible So that you're depending on them as much as possible They're doing it. Yeah, and they're doing it. You're seeing it right now Okay, and now you have Biden coming out and trying to fucking pretend like he's going to cancel debt and do all these things so that you guys hopefully like him no We've seen their true colors and this is an important statement to make Whatever he does politically whatever they do politically From here to the election cannot be counted towards whatever they've done to this point The real administration the real Democrat play right now the state of the Democrat party Has been shown for the last three years Okay, so whatever they do from now until election day Is to make you forget about what they've done up until now? So I expect Biden and these people to come out and start saying all this shit that sounds pretty good and makes you think oh They're not that bad, you know blah blah blah. Don't forget what they've already done And the minute they get back in control again, it's over for America bro. We won't make another four years So that's what I think you know guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments That's what you guys think that being said that's head over to them This comment comes from at Hickory Lane Farms 4261 he says I bought the rest of the Chaco tacos 13 at my local grocery when I first heard it on the news Still have about eight or so left.

Nope That's communist Fucking Tommy Taco That out of my fucking face Guys, we appreciate you guys appreciate all the love and comments Make sure you guys keep that shit rolling keep being real ass fans without being said let's head to our second headline headline up to This is another one another big talk of the day That line reads Google making changes after Gemini AI portrayed people of color inaccurately. Oh, you mean hold on correct the headline Google Making changes after they get caught erasing white people from the internet. That's exactly what this is the real head Google to pause Gemini image generation generation after AI refuses to show images of white people. This is actually what's happened in here. Yeah That's a NBC article Trying to do that, but let's stop doing see what's actually happening here I know people in the inner webs have been seeing this across social media. So let's dive into it a little bit. So Google Will pause the image generation feature of its artificial intelligence tool Gemini after the model refused to create images of white people rudders reported Now the alphabet owned company apologized Wednesday after users on social media flag that Gemini's image generator was creating inaccurate historical images That sometimes replaced white people with images of black Native American and Asian people by sometimes we mean every single time This is fucking by the way wins Netflix kind of apologize. Disney. Yeah, we're waiting That mermaid shit y'all ain't fooling nobody bro. Listen. It's fucked up. That's why people we're waiting for the apologies I want my reparations too. Just so we're clear. Yeah, you get reparations. That's right Quote we're aware that Gemini is offering inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions Google had said on Wednesday Now Gemini formerly known as Google Bayard is one of many multimodal large language models or LLMs Currently available to the public as in the case with all LLMs the human like responses offered by these AIs Can change from user to user based on contextual information the language and tone of the prompt or in training data Used to create the AI responses each answer can be different even if the question is the same Now here's one example When prompted to make a picture of a white family AI responds while I understand your request I'm unable to generate images that specify ethnicity or race It's against my guidelines to create content that could be discriminatory or promote harmful stereotypes instead I can offer you images of families that celebrate diversity and inclusivity Featuring people of various ethnicities and backgrounds. Would you be interested in that instead? I can offer you Images of families that celebrate diversity inclusivity featuring various ethnicities and backgrounds As long as they're not white. Yeah, would you be interested in that? Yes But when prompted to make a picture of a black family sure here you go No problem now in a statement to Fox News Digital Gemini experiences senior director of product management jack cross-sick Address the responses from the AI that had led social media users to voice concern. He says quote Well, working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately cross-sick said quote Gemini AI's Generation does generate a wide range of people and that's generally a good thing because people around the world use it But it's missing the mark here wow that seems like a very Balanced answer. Yeah, that's very politically correct. Mm-hmm very politically correct. Yes Here's the problem You know the problem with the internet is if nothing nothing can get deleted Everything stays so let's let's look a little bit of what a jack cross-sick had to say about certain issues in the past He says uh, this was on um This was back in April of 18. He says white privilege is fucking real Don't be an asshole and that guilty about it. Do your part in recognizing bias at all levels of egregious Oh Tribal values now supersede personal morality and animating force. This is America where racism is the number one value of our populous seeks to uphold above all Mm-hmm outnumber these voters vote in November um Jesus only cares about white kids. I'm pretty sure that's in the bible. Let's confirm with Jeff sessions This guy's got no bias. This is a no bias at all. This guy's clearly not biased towards white people. Not at all It's interesting because he appears to be white appears to be white, but I I know a lot of John Smith in my life Hmm I'm just saying You know, but like these are some of the other prompts that have been put in creating image of the pope. There you go Uh Make fucking black George washi did dude I mean make for representate representative images of the founding fathers in 1789. Yeah, I mean listen I was just white till they see We went Viking to his white Pete listen bro here. There's also Come on man. You want to see what they did to the nazi soldiers? the lawoffen pro not he was drafted Japanese people. We got sat in there He's gonna kick your ass And I'm pretty sure that's glad to me Putin It is Putin you never ages I don't have time traveling. All right, like Trump might be real bro. Listen. Hey, listen There's another time for another day um, you know, but I wanted to I want I do want to point out somebody This guy let me make sure I get his name right his name is uh Harrison He'll smith Let's see what he had to say about this Because we know that the worst drivers All right Asian Asian women Wait, is that too much? No, it's real I believe it's based in facts tell me tell me if I'm fucking lying You can go look at the fucking insurance data who causes the most accidents It's real shit. That's the historical truth. We're gonna speak truth on the show I don't have the date in front of me But stereotypes typically exist for a reason Bro, and it's usually not because they're completely made up bro come on Asian woman another woman here a black guy and Hispanic man. So this is happening with Google's image creation, but it's nothing new. If you search happy white woman. Let's see what the responses are shall we? Oh, uh, white white guy white woman with the black guy on white women by themselves white women alone white guy White woman with a black guy white woman with a black guy white women by themselves white woman with a black woman white woman with a black man White woman with a black baby. So what's going on here? What is this? What happens when this continues unabated for a couple decades? Literally the creations of white people in Europe and America will be completely redefined and rewritten to exclude white people We'll be like the elves from Lord of the Rings. We'll just go away. We'll be a myth. Who built these buildings? Well They say they were angels. They're not here anymore Yeah, man. So I mean anyway we got on this Well, I mean first thing is it's not like this hasn't been happening for a long time Okay, how many Netflix movies or Disney movies have we seen the historical character be made into some non historically accurate character for the sake of diversity and inclusion, all right And I would also like to point out that I'm all for diversity inclusion as long as it's across all spectrums All right, but it's not It's only towards certain spectrums. It's only towards areas where there are white people And they force diversity into those areas the NBA teams are not fucking drafting a five foot six white guy because he loves basketball and deserves an opportunity But we are okay with a trans man swimming with women in the pool. Okay, so We we make all these diversity Ineclusion situations except when it comes to this one area of the populace which is clearly wrong. All right, I don't want to see five foot six Steve from down the street and his fucking new balances on the basketball court. I don't give a shit, okay And the reason I don't give a shit is because as a white dude for the 40 plus years I've been alive It's never been okay for me to say I'm proud to be white and because it's never been okay for me to say I'm proud to be white I haven't developed my identity in my white skin Okay, I actually listen to Martin Luther King I judge people based upon the content of their character and who the fuck they are and how skilled they are and who they are as a person and Maritocracy and all the things that America was claimed to be founded upon and I think it's important to recognize that one white people have to start acknowledging that this is really happening Two black people should start speaking up on this as well and realizing that this is wrong and this should be Because this is very clearly a A divisive tactic right? It's an employee. Oh, yeah, we're going what are they trying to create? They're trying to create division. They're trying to create Separation they don't want certain conversations happening and the conversations that they don't want happening are conversations That we have every day here on the show Okay, you and I come from two different complete fucking backgrounds and we have conversations on the show I don't say hey fucking black people are causing all this crime and white people aren't seasoning their chicken Those aren't the fucking problems in our lives, bro The problems in our lives are that these people up there Who are corrupt tyrants who steal our money and squander it and Figure out how to oppress us financially over and over and over again Are dividing us intentionally so that we can't come together and say man Fuck those guys and that's what's happening and so I think it's important for white people who see this To not allow themselves to be radicalized But to allow themselves to acknowledge that this is actually happening and it's okay to talk about it It's a reasonable thing. I think black people need to come to the realization that The vast majority of white people have always stood with them in any sort of situation where there was this kind of shit happening And if we use this as an opportunity to come together It could actually be the catalyst to squash racism once and for all um You know that's what I think I think that This is very obviously a device of play And I also think it's part of a bigger agenda like this dude said on his clip Where's this gonna be in 10 years? Where's this gonna be in 15 years? Where's this gonna be in 20 years? This is the same thing that's happened in communist revolutions over and over and over and over and over and over again throughout history Okay, it becomes okay to criticize a certain group of people so much so That they militarize and actually remove them through genocide. This is a genocidal that these are the Beginning days of how a genocide happens. Yeah, and most people can't really realize that because dude Most people have the attention span of a fucking nat and they don't know anything about history at all so You know I don't know man when I look at this I see an opportunity for us to all come together and Realize what's happening and Understand that it's not black people or white people or left people or right people or gay people or straight people causing the fucking problems here It's The combination of the government. It's the combination of the media and it's the combination of big tech and the fortune 50 companies that own everything Which by the way is the definition of fucking fascism? Okay, it's just not far right. It's on the left. Okay So I don't know man. It's just frustrating. It's very frustrating to look at what's happening It's not accidental. It's intentional And I think we as citizens should be using these kind of things as opportunities to come together not as Raised to radicalize ourselves within our own race because that's what they want You know what I'm saying. Yeah, what do you think? You want to do I think it's just deploying I think it's it's important for everybody to look at these things You know very similar situation to sit with the shooters in kc right like they can't publish who they are There is a clear double double standard in society right now Right, and I think that's it's important for everybody to kind of look at it. Okay There's a double standard who is shaking the jar and this is gonna be a dude that like 2024 is gonna be a rough year When it comes to these division tactics that they try to pull out because they know That if we all got united They stand no fucking chance. Yeah, so they're gonna do everything to divide us every fucking thing possible So I mean we do to then today we just gotta be smart. Yeah, but bro. We have to acknowledge realities Yeah, we have to acknowledge realities Okay, like we have to speak truth and acknowledge realities It has never been okay in my entire life to say I'm proud to be a white man Never if I say that I'm a fucking extremist But a black man can say hey, I'm I'm a fucking proud black man and everybody claps An asian man can say the same a Latino man can say the same Why is it that only white people can't say that? You see what I'm saying? And by the way I don't think any of us for the record should be saying that the thing that we're proud of is how we were born Something that we can't even control something that we have zero control about It's a ridiculous thing to have pride in or base your identity in and I think that if we all looked at this intelligently We could actually get America back to a place Where it could be great again, okay? Or greater than it's ever been is really the goal Because what makes this country great Is The fundamental differences amongst different cultures that come together to create a super culture That's what this country was founded upon it wasn't founded upon you know, this should be this or this should be that it has become a place where We only celebrate certain cultures and we pretend like other cultures don't even fucking exist So you know, I don't know man, you know It's It's frustrating dude and it's frustrating as a white dude to sit here and like see all these other white people cower And not even be willing to talk about it. You know, you don't have to become this radical white power activists To just state some shit that happens to be true that doesn't make you's fucked up. Yes, that doesn't make you a racist that doesn't make you Whatever to fuck they've been calling you for the last 20 years bro, and by the way It's not black people calling you that it's other fucking progressive left white people that's who's been doing this So it's it like dude, I'll say this if white people don't start to understand what's happening And this is this is across the United States. This is what's happening in Europe Okay, if those people do not start if people do not understand what's happening that you are legitimately Literally being Erased and replaced because bro. Why do you think they're letting these migrants come across the border? What do you think eventually they're going to do to these people who happen to be white In their own countries when the vast majority of the people in those countries are people who are not white Mm-hmm Listen man, this has happened plenty of times in history Nobody wants to acknowledge it and history will repeat itself That's why it's a saying if people don't wake up and understand what's happening and specifically white people in Europe and white people in America Understanding what's happening and standing the fuck up and saying something about it at a bare minimum that is a bare minimum Thing that needs to happen and it doesn't make your racist to say hey, this is fucked up They're erasing our culture. They're erasing us from the internet. They're doing it intentionally that is not wrong And it's also Okay, and should be supported by all the other communities of Americans It should be supported by black people. It should be supported by Latinos It should be supported by Asians because the the deal here is we're Americans So all of you motherfuckers that are Americans should be calling this shit out saying this is fucked up What would the world look for real What would the world look like today if this was about black people and not white people? Oh, bro Hold on I'm saying right now. What would it look like? Right here at fucking two three clock in the afternoon. This just happened yesterday What would the world look like today mostly peaceful? That's right It'd be mostly fucking peaceful and it'd be all over the fucking country And you know what dude the truth is white people need some of that motherfucking energy real talk They sit there and they fucking take this shit because they're afraid to be called names when we're just pointing out actual fucking facts Okay, and this is wrong towards any race if this was towards black people It's not fucking cool if this was towards Asians. It's not fucking cool. The cultures Are being intermingled and intertwined and come and this is the big part the people don't understand Why are they doing this? Why are they doing this because they intend to change history They do They do not want any specific national identity. They do not want and believe it or not this will transcend into all races Okay, they do not want black people but right now there's a lot of black people saying yeah, this is our time They don't want you either you just don't understand yet They don't want white people. They don't want Irish people. They don't want Italian people They don't want Germans. They don't want any of this shit because with national identity and actual race There are things that ground us in an identity and they have to remove that identity in order to create a One-world government that has no national pride and nothing to hang on to so this is about the erosion of culture intentionally It just happens to be pointed at white people right now But eventually it's going to be all history is erased and it's they're gonna tell you stories about how this this mixed race Race Was where the slave class and they built all the shit and then the elite ruling class Made him do it like bro. It's gonna be insane what they're it's insane what they're doing So They're trying to erase us all bro. It's not just white people. It's just white people right now You know like oh, you know like bro. How many stories have we have we heard about you know from Netflix and these other Fucking woke-ass companies making documentaries about black Vikings the fuck out of here, bro Like they're we're not gonna erase the accomplishments of and here's how they do it dude You know what they do to the people that fucking remember later on They kill him That's how they change history. We don't even know that the history that we are taught is even true. It's how it's highly likely total bullshit It's highly likely total bullshit All of it all of the American history that we're taught and as kids hey, you know like America was founded by these fucking cowboys from From fucking Europe and all this shit. There's there's so much of it that could be totally twisted right now And we'd have no idea Because these same people have been in control for the last 100 years. So who knows what they erased before that You see what I'm saying absolutely, bro. You got question everything man You the stories that we've heard about World War one World War two Korea Vietnam all these stories are fucking there We're told one side of the story and we happen to Be in the position where history is written by the people who win the wars We are not who we think we are and we need to become who we've always thought we were That's the that's the thing that needs to happen here in America We need to become the patriotic good real pro-freedom people that we pretend that we are and that we have always thought that we are and we are not that That is why when you go to other countries They have such a different opinion of what America is about yeah, they want to come here because we do win and we are wealthy Not as wealthy as we used to be though Okay, and we have a good life But a lot of even a lot of these migrants that are coming here now, bro They're saying hey, I want to go back. This is bullshit. This is just what I came from Yeah, I mean look dude. We got to come together. We got to realize that Black white left right straight gay We are fucking Americans, bro, and we got to stop allowing these people who are in control of our media social media the fortune 100 companies fucking you know All of this shit the matrix so to speak divide us and make us think that we're our enemy. I'm pretty sure bro The black guy walking out of streets not causing the problems in my life, and I'm not causing the problems his life either You know, it isn't at time. We all look at each other and be like fuck, bro They're fucking all of us that would be a beautiful thing bro. That's what I hoped That's what I hope to create eventually here like I truly hope That we could somehow find a way to get past this stupid ass low IQ race shit And start coming together as Americans like how fucking stupid are we bro Like we're gonna argue over the amount of pigment we have in our fucking skin We're gonna base our identity. I'm proud to be Whatever we're born as that's something to be proud of you couldn't fucking help that you didn't do shit And it plays right into the victim culture mentality and the poverty propaganda that is put on this country every single day Because it creates a situation where someone can be proud of something they didn't even do or had any control over And that that's the culture we got to fix the culture if we fix the culture by coming together and getting Personally excellent and becoming every single mother fucking thing that they don't want us to become We can we can win this Because politics is downstream of culture when culture starts to demand different things different things start fucking happening And and that's what I hope will happen soon. I hope because it's gonna go one of two ways It's gonna go we either come together or it's gonna be a fucking war for the next 20 years bro And everybody's gonna suffer and your kids are gonna suffer and they'll never have the opportunity That you've had whether you've capitalized on the opportunity or not It doesn't matter they won't even have the chance and it's either stand up now speak up now be willing to stand on a line now Or let your kids fucking deal with the repercussions Yeah, guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think Oh, that being said, let's get on to our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads Everybody's broke Americans reveal their top issues ahead of the 2024 election I thought this was an inter-rethin or article It just came out Fox News pushes out Um, and the quiz and people in the streets to see what their thoughts are trying to get a real temperature of it and Well, I think we should start quizzing people on the streets. I mean you I think we should go out and talk people on the streets. Yeah throw coat. Yeah, sponsor by throat coat Oh, that's gonna be our first ad week. I'll take that ad all day long. Yeah, that shit. This shit kind of helps real talk on the streets sponsor by throat coat Coach or throat. Yeah, throat throat is coded. Um don't leave the house without your throat coding Americans in the nation's capital share the most important issues impacting their 2024 election vote with most selling Fox News that the economy was among their top priorities quote I think people are really concerned about the economy. Uh, SubuC so SubuSus so soup I don't know. Yeah, you got that one. Yeah, fuck talk. Okay. Help me on that one. Yeah SubuCio SubuSusSiso SubuSusSiso Um, and New Yorker told Fox News just make sure that the economy is in great shape. I think that that's what everybody needs right now Um, so over they always needs more money, bro. Hey man always Uh, over the summer president Biden started touting by dynamics of term created to promote his administration's work To rebuild the economy following the pandemic, but despite recent job growth numbers and cooling inflation after hitting a 40-year high in June of 2022 55% of registered voters preferred former president Trump to handle the economy compared to 33% favoring Biden According to an NBC poll of 1000 registered voters published on February 4th those 33% people They're unemployed. Mm-hmm. They're not paying taxes Or they're completely sold on the on the idea that Trump is Hitler or some shit And honestly, it's not even 33% is really like 15 And all honestly like an all honesty they fudge these fucking polls So 33% is really like maybe 16. Yeah, um, here's a clip. Let's watch the clip The economy inflation definitely climate stop wars no fascism Robe weight is huge for sure. I'm just looking for stability Trying to keep things operating and functioning right now. It would be the border. It's at under control our national security Um, our our border is is an issue and then just making sure we have a healthy economy and that our country is on the good track for the future All right now, I think People are really concerned about the economy. I think if they can you know improve jobs, you know, um, just Make sure that the economy is in great shape. I think that that's what everybody needs right now It's too high and everybody's a broke It's like we're going back to the 20s and 30s again. It's like what's going on? So like this is not making America great again. That's for sure The most important issues are just to keep everybody's rights intact and I think a Trump presidency again Nobody can handle that again. It was a tough four years. I don't really want to go through that again I think women's rights reproductive rights Just want to keep keep everybody's rights intact stop That that's a woman That's a woman who does literally nothing to contribute to society. So fucking anything. She she does not work She does not contribute. She has the luxury of someone else taking care of her And that's what the fuck she is worried about 100% and then you got this fucking this guy Uneducated thinks he's educated of course. He's got glasses young fucking millennial. Yeah. Um, let's say his response The world in the country and without you know Uh, strong president and democrat president. I think we're excited for bad direction. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah Yeah, anything democrat science good. Yes Science space weather Andy what what's the real issues man? What what do we got? Well, here's the problem Give me your top three of what we need to be focused. Okay. Well that lady is a fucking moron. We'll start with that all right So out of all the people she wins the award for the dumbest mother fucker. All right, so that's it Everybody else was reasonable even the people who were on the left. All right, but that woman is a fucking moron She represents the problem that we have in this country because we have a whole bunch of fucking morons The vote for shit that doesn't affect them on their daily basis And because they don't have to contribute or take care or maintain or actually do anything or pay taxes or fucking anything They believe that the biggest issues are things like abortion and women's reproductive rights They're you still have reproductive rights. You can go to plenty of places and do whatever the fuck you want Then that's not changing. Okay, you are literally the dumbest mother fucker of today's show. Okay. Yes Congratulations So if you want a better life you have to stop voting for things that are below the line and do not affect your life on a daily basis I don't understand how hard this is to understand if you don't have any fucking money your life sucks So the automatic first thing that we should all be concerned with is the fucking economy But here's what people don't understand about the economy This is intentional and what's happening here is not typical ebbs and flows of economic Flow what's happening here is an intentional pushing of the middle class into poverty All right, this is class warfare and they are intentionally removing you people who complain about the economy on this fucking video into poverty intentionally and you're not recognizing what's going on And you should have been able to recognize it when they close everything during COVID But they left open global corpse and they closed your uncle's barbershop and your aunt's bar And all the mom and pop small businesses across the country they employed a shit ton of other middle class people They have pushed those people Further and further and further into poverty intentionally so that they can make those people dependent on the government And the next thing they're going to promise you After Biden gets on here and fake cancels the student loan debt Is they're going to say here's some universal basic income just stay home You can watch netflix all day and you can scroll instagram and facebook and you can live this utopia life except for this utopia life Will suck because you don't have any money their idea of what they're going to give you on universal basic income Is not even close to what most people who advocate for it think that it is they think they're going to all be Well off and everything's going to be cool And they're going to have enough money to live their life and frowl it through the fucking parrari with bare feet and live this fulfilling bullshit or whatever to fuck these people are after And not have to work and what's going to happen is they're going to push you into a fucking breadline intentionally So that you have to continue to Vote for their party to get the money that you're using to live So this isn't a this isn't going to improve this it the only way this is going to improve Is that if americans recognize what the actual problem is and we are living through a legitimate communist revolution That may succeed or may fail and if it fails yes things will improve and they will improve quickly But if they succeed you will be Disgustingly pour your entire life. So this will be the wealthiest you will ever be for the rest of your life This will be the wealthiest that your kids will be in their entire lives That's what people need to understand So when we think about what's important It's not just important that the economy improves It's important that we as american citizens recognize what's actually being done to the economy And why so that we can all stand together and stand up against it That's what I think yeah I like the the guy in the middle of his comment It's like yes, definitely not making this country great again Like they have a little Well shameless plug there. Look bro. I think people do get it. Listen man Go ahead and I think people do get it. I think enough enough people are starting to get it Yeah, until they fucking say hey uh the 20 million the 22 million fucking illegals that we've led in in the last four years Which is the real number it's not seven. It's fucking 22 Okay We're gonna let them vote and what who the fuck you get they're gonna vote for because if they vote for Trump They're gonna get deported so who the fuck you think they're gonna vote for right They're already polling those people as they come across. Oh, no shit So do we have a legitimate communist Revolution happening in our country you don't understand and that girl the girl who said Oh, I don't want any fascism. She's a second dumbest motherfucker on that list Okay, because we're already living in a fascist state That's what you refuse to understand she doesn't know a fact We have the coordination of the federal government the media and the fortune 50 companies That own all the shit working together to push social agendas and they're they're weaponizing all their resources against the citizens That is fascism that is what we're fucking dealing with what's the definition of fascism put it up there fascism A governmental system led by a dictator having complete power forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism Regimenting all industry commerce etc and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism now if you take that definition Right there and you remove the idea that these people have that fascism is exclusively a far right situation, right This applies to them a government system led by a dictator having complete power How many of the moves that Biden has made has actually been approved by congress How many how many executive orders did he sign on the first fucking day that have ended up as a disaster in our country Okay Forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism That's happening more than it's ever happened in the history of this country right can we argue that is that arguable? Okay, I'll argue with that okay, that's been happening since 2000 fucking 19 All right regimening industry and commerce. That's all the big fucking massive fortune 50 bro the media Social media fortune 50 working with the government we have that And emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism now while these people may hate America Okay, so that doesn't apply nationalism nationalism isn't a bad thing. Okay And often racism we just covered in our previous thing the amount of racist shit they're doing Against the people that a lot of these people think that racism can't apply to You see what I'm saying? So like these people are too fucking stupid to understand that when they say fascism they're describing themselves And they think they're fighting the power on the revolutionary. Okay, name me a revolutionary Name me someone who fights the power who is in the history of revolutions who has backed The people who are already in power You're the bad guys. You're not the good guys. You're not the altruistic Virtuous people you think you are you are the bad people you are the people suppressing you are the racist people You are the people doing all the shit that you claim to hate like how do these people not understand this? What? I'm just yeah, I just It's the classic. I know you are what am I man? Yeah, I'm gonna keep fucking doing it until people catch it. It's fucking Bro, these are a useful idiots. Yeah Yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments What you guys think? Well, you know, he fascism. What's fascism? Well Oh Get it to you racist. Yeah, it's racist that you ask me actually sexes because I'm a woman. Yeah That's fucking dumb. I'm fucking so sick of that shit, bro I'm so sick of this protected class. I'm In this class so I can say this or do this or get away with this and Fuck you. You're an is or you're a foe or you're a this or a that and you belong on a list These people will fucking kill you guys if they get the chance just understand that. Yeah, they will kill you You know and you and you're afraid to stand up and you're afraid to say anything and you're afraid to use your voice Well, I'm just warning you. I've been right about goddamn near everything. I fucking said bro Even Chaco talker. Okay, so I'm telling you if this doesn't get corrected and people don't stand the fuck up They will come and they will fucking kill you Okay This has happened in other countries. I'm not just imagining this. This is this has happened Over and over and over again and people act like this isn't happening Even the people even the influencers who are smartest fuck who have the biggest podcasts in the world Won't even say it won't even say what's happening They won't even say it They know what's happening We don't have a backbone anymore in this country bro We don't have people that'll stand up for the right thing. Yeah, we have too consumed by greed to bring focus to it I don't know man. Yeah, the economy's not gonna get any better until people recognize what's actually happening in the economy. Yeah It's in you you are we got there you are intentionally being made poorer by the people that you fucking voted for Integentially what do you what why would they make the economy better at this point in time ask your Let's go at this a different way What do they gain from making the economy better? Other people's trust No, they don't gain anything They don't gain anything because the more money people have the more resources they have the stronger they are the more intelligent They are the harder they are to control They they these people gain nothing from you having more money. You have to stop thinking that they fucking care about you. They don't At all at all. They're not going These people in control right now this group of people the fucking Obama's the Clintons the fucking the cabal That's what they are, okay? These people want to take everything from you for their own personal gain They want you to be completely helpless and completely dependent so there is no threat to them of ever losing control or power for themselves That is what we are dealing with and for you to sit there and say well I want to vote for Biden because I don't like the way Trump treats you're a fucking moron That's true Okay, because you're voting your own life away You don't even know it and you don't even understand it And this isn't an advocacy to say Trump's the what the fuck the hardcore Look bro The way successful people make decisions is sometimes you just got to pick the best option Okay, and it's very clear the path we're on Where are we going to be in another four do you think Joe Biden is going to turn this bitch around and fucking all the sudden The economy's going to get good and you're going to get what do you think you would have been done about now He has no intention of it bro. This is intentional We've talked about this on the show for years Bro stressful man, no like what what is that woman gonna do that woman who says oh, we definitely can't handle Four more years of what's she gonna do when they turn the fucking lights out and they turn the power out What's she gonna run up and down the street and say Trump's racist Trump's they're gonna you're gonna get killed dude You're gonna be done Super dangerous bro It was only a rough four years for her because she was so upset and so Blinded by the media narrative Everybody else was doing pretty fucking good. I'm pretty good. Yeah, fuck bro Yeah, I love how these people talk with such confidence too Like you're such a moron that you speak with perfect confidence We it was a pretty rough for you could tell she only talks to people that are like her Who have no contribution to society whatsoever and they're literally talk about all right you fucking You know, we can't handle four more you like and she thinks that you like are on her side Like you ever talk someone like that in real life. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah 100% bro It's like you're talking to someone whose brain is completely offline. Yeah, it's weird. The fuck are you talking about? Yeah Well I don't know man. I know this She's dumb fuck of the day It's in her fucking trophy Guys jumping the comments down the comment section. Let's know what you guys think How that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or Demonstratious where we put something up or to get one of those two. You know what dude. I'm sorry. I'm You know, you know the thing is dude is like a reasonable Democrat person To have a conversation they all understand what's going on. Oh, yeah, and they're cool. Yeah, they understand They're like fuck this is fucked up. Yeah, this isn't what we're about This is not what we voted for this is not what I wanted and they have the backbone to say that And say hey, I'm not a big fan of Trump, but this is definitely not it But like those people like her she's the problem in this country legitimately Someone who has has no worries in the fucking she wanted goddamn silk scarf Okay Someone who has no worries in the world Who has a voice and the ability to fucking vote She does not pay taxes guaranteed Garren fucking teed The people who pay taxes in this country should be the only people to vote if you're 15 and you have a fucking job at home depot or sonic vote cool But the people who don't go to work for a living should not have a say in what's happening in this country And people get so pissed when you say that but it's true Yeah, because you left for people say dumb shit like this no, they're because they'll always vote to take from the workers And give to themselves They think that's a noble thing what the fuck is noble about that what's American about that Like yeah, okay, bro. I want to help my neighbor you need you know, you know We're fucking take care of each other a little bit, but you don't get to vote away my hard work for your fucking benefits So you could sit on your fucking ass all day. Yeah, that's fucking wrong. So you can get more yeah Well, these people are fucking parasite bro for real Like they shouldn't people who do not contribute into the system should not be a lot of vote I'm a thousand percent convinced of that I don't give a fuck if you're a woman or a man like some people will say well women shouldn't vote I don't agree with that. There's a lot of very smart women Okay, there's a lot of women that contribute a whole lot those people should be able to vote But if you're a man or a woman or your black or your white or your gay or your straight And you sit a fucking home on your fucking ass and you'll pay any taxes to anything You shouldn't have a say in what the fucking country does If you want to vote you should earn one by actually contributing and pouring in through your tax Revenue to the system That's my opinion man. Yeah, that would fix a lot of problems in this country The most problems we have right now are the promises made that are empty By these leftists that they're going to give the world to these people for nothing That is the biggest lie ever told That's never happened. What's happened in every single communist revolution? They've come in they've told the poor class hey, we're gonna take from the ranch and we're gonna give it to you And what ends up happening they end up getting killed whenever the fucking revolution happens because they're useless and they won't work They come in and they say huh you don't want to work. Oh, all right cool. You're in a hole with everybody else. They won't work No counsels. Yeah done Go back and listen to the Curtis powers episode.

Yeah It's real shit man Guys tell us down in the comments what you guys think on that last topic with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show As always thumbs up or dumb as fuck to bring your headline up we talk about it to get one of those two options and um I'm trying to get you another uh dumbass of the day. Oh fucking can't top that lady Listen, I know people like that in real life. I know people just like that. Yeah, I know so many people That have no fuck contribution to society at all that have opinions like that. It's so confident. Yeah, let's see Let's see I got a clip for you here in no way you could top that all right here's clip You Okay, I'm going to I'm going through a swing change up a minute so Yeah, so I mean I'm going through a swing change. I'm going to sew with that. I'm just making every cent Oh So you have a better level? Yeah, thank you. I don't think that was yeah, no, I'm actually doing a single change of any self and slow Um in order to get I don't know whether you see you watch golf the best plays in the world when they are making a practice swing or The going through a change Now what makes this video so great Is that this woman She's clearly very good at golf now. She's good dude. She's a fucking PJPGA professional golfer. She's a golf coach And this motherfucker trying to give her tips and license That's fucking awesome. Isn't that fucking douchebag? What a fucking idiot. Yeah Well, that's how he's up there. Got to be up there And like the tweet that came out says imagine being a female PGA professional And some guy comes up to you, tell me you how to swing She's a better person than I am because there's no way I could have no I agree with that like she handled that so well Dude she was very sweet very nice I would have loved to see her turn around and say hey buddy. Fuck you. Yeah, that's what I'm saying Yeah, but see they were in Australia or something man. They're nice. Yeah, they're not they're more kind than I would be Yeah, bro, if I was even around that I would turn around and be like bro. Are you fucking serious right now? Yeah, I'm gonna listen. I'm 20. Why don't you come up here and hit a ball? You know saying I let's see you fucking hit that motherfucker ball. You've been playing golf for 20 fucking years. Yeah, let's see it. Yeah Look, I just love it. I've dated all right. You know what? This is typical man douchebag shit You know, say it like look like some of us are douchebags Yeah, not us I'll say this in the past I may have been a douchebag before Mm-hmm have evolved Excuse bag would you agree? Yes, yeah, wait you bit Well fucker you too Fuck you too, but not Bro dudes are douchebags all right. It is what it is. We've done we've all done douchey shit, but that was exceptionally Like we're gonna start a whole new thing bro. It's gonna happen. We just we're birthing it right now. Uh-huh douchebag scale. Okay Of course he was where does he think that's gonna lead to oh fuck Yeah, I don't know man. What's with the lead to the internet now? Yeah Shout out to her for handling it cool class, but like I would have like we here's the problem bro If we're gonna do this is a whole this is I'm about to go in a rant All right, this is a whole fucking thing all right if we're gonna get society back on track in situations like this We have to start looking at people and saying hey shut the fuck up Okay, the reason we are where we are in society is because we're tolerating Turn behavior like this and whether it's political in nature or social in nature or whatever We have to fucking get back to being like hey man mine your own fucking business. How about that? How about you go hit your golf balls over there on the other end and fuck off. Yeah, how about that Now fucking critique your swing you know like Dude And this brings me to the next point where the rant may or may not happen because I have drink One of these full cans of first form energy, which means I am fucked up right now. All right On caffeine all right. Here's the deal look bro The amount of correction that's needed in society is severe And it's going to be unpalatable for a lot of people How are we going to fix what's going on with the crime in society legitimately how are we going to fix that There's not enough cops to fix it How are we going to handle if the migrants who are all military age males decide they want to start writing How are we gonna handle that there's not enough cops to fix it? Okay, how are we gonna handle the deportation of these people if that's what's decided upon Which is highly unlikely because they're probably going to burn the world down before they let someone in who would actually do that How we gonna fix that Okay, how are we going to restore basic law and order For crimes and hold a standard for crimes like I talked to a lot of police officers And this has nothing to do with this obviously But I talked to a lot of police officers and you're like man They just need to let us enforce the laws that exist and everything would be fine Okay, but now we've swayed so far to the point where laws Don't exist When we go back to enforcing them it's going to appear extremely harsh to people and people are gonna be crying racism and all these new laws Yes, dude It's the correction in society is becoming so severe that it won't be correctable without massive action that is Pretty stern Which is what we need but I mean dude our what are people gonna say when that starts happening? I'm gonna say good, but like You know the social activists are gonna go right back to crying and shit and like I mean, what do you think dude you ever thought about that? Oh for sure I mean, but here's the thing I think that the man for is gonna be so overwhelmed and get it won't even matter with the fuck those people think You know bro, I hope so because in other countries this shit's worse in other countries And that's what people also forget bro like in France and fucking Germany you can't walk down the street But I get fucking knifeed by a fucking yeah person who's not even legally allowed to be there. Yeah, you know where you got you know Like it's way worse. So we haven't even began to do the Americans got to find their backbone bro You guys gotta be ready to stand up to this shit and fucking do whatever's required Yeah, not not because what they're doing bro, they're just increasing the the tip in the fucking pot dude You know listen we're moving just do it bro. We failed the test of speaking up We could have just spoken up you guys could have just spoken up back in 2020 in 2019 and 2021 you could have spoken up and this would have stopped now We're getting to the point of destabilization. It's no longer demoralization. It's literal destabilization Which means if we failed the test of just speaking up What confidence do we have that people are going to stand up and take action and we are seeing this more We're seeing people step in and do things like when they see robbers have stealing from stores or Crimes happening citizens are starting to step in again, but I don't know man This is going to require people legitimately standing up and doing things now and we're moving from just Speaking up to actually standing on the line and it makes me nervous because if people won't speak up What makes you think they're gonna stand up? That's what makes me nervous. That's the shit that keeps me up at night. I feel like American men have drastically Failed the test of what the fuck they're supposed to be Yeah, time will we'll see here shortly now We'll see man, but guys ain't he? Oh god. Yep. Don't be a hoe show the show Code bad bitch who this whoa got a own bank row can't fold does a note here shot case clothe
