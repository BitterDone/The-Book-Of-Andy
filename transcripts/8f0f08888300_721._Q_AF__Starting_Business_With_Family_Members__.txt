question number one hey Andy hey DJ hope all as well hey long time listener first time caller I'm a 27 year old guy I've worked as an equipment mechanic since I was 18 I started at the very bottom at $8.25 per hour and with your advice starting at the MFCEO project I give 100% every day no matter what so my wage has drastically changed since then I want to start my own business and walk my own path I've acquired some clients to maintain some of their equipment and I have a lot of support from friends and family to pursue my dream I found the path now time for the hike I've been doing it part time for a year now and built some relationships and some reputation so my client base is expanding my dad he's 52 is in the same trade he has been a manager at the same company for 25 plus years I've worked with him for my first six years in the trade and we have a great relationship recently we discussed starting our a business on our own my question is how do you negotiate a partnership instead of a boss employee relationship and how do you give that without offending the man who created and shaped you can you give Dusty a shout out we listen to all the episodes and have daily discussions about them keep kicking ass fellas Dusty Dusty I guess that's his dad Dusty what's up man what's up Dusty Dusty you want to come to our party you got any bikes all right um look man this is very simple okay when we grow up we and this is there's nothing wrong with this but we look at our parents as they're superheroes and we have respect for them we listen to them and we look at them like they're on a different level and as we get older we start to realize that they're humans just like us and you're 27 year old man you're looking to start a business and you're looking to start a business with a business partner who happens to be your dad and that's how you need to look at it okay you need to look at it as I'm starting a business what would I want how would I want the partnership to be framed oh and by the way that guy is my dad not I'm starting a business with my dad and I got to do all these things my dad says okay so you have to step out you have to think like an adult you have to be non emotionally attached and you have to build a partnership that makes sense and be able to have conversations that are outside the realm of a father son conversation and inside the realm of a business conversation and so what we're really asking about is how do we separate personal relationships from business relationships and guys this is very simple it's it's so simple that people overlook it when you're at work it's work when you're at home it's home and that's how it is man like this advice that goes around on the internet like oh you should never start a business with family or friends how many of those people have businesses with their family and friends it's you guys again listening to broke mother fuckers about how not to be broke if they knew how not to be broke they wouldn't be fucking broke okay so you shouldn't be listening to people and what they say there's a lot of dumb shit that goes around on the internet and one of it is never start a business with your family and friends because you don't know how to communicate with your family and friends and you don't know how to communicate with anybody in a business relationship yet because you haven't done it but I'm gonna tell you as someone who's built a legit empire with my family and friends it's actually pretty fucking awesome okay they all win we all yes sometimes we argue but we all keep in mind what the point of the project is and the point of the project is for it to provide for all of our lives as partners so we make decisions that's good for everybody and that comes with experience and maturity and you know just doing it so and I've seen many businesses like that you know any people I know in business that are business partners with their their parents or business partners with their friends or their brother like I am like dude these things are natural and normal and the people that say them are usually dumb as fuck okay but ultimately guys we just got to learn to separate what is the relationship and what is business and sometimes yeah those things are gonna get intertwined and sometimes they're gonna get difficult and sometimes they're gonna bleed together you're gonna get an argument in business and then some personal shit's gonna get thrown on top of it and that's where you have to be mature enough to say bro look now you're throwing personal shit at me okay we're talking about this and you're throwing this at me and the the guy has this you have to be mature enough to say that's all right that's not cool all right we'll handle that over here but right now let's solve this and you just have to compartmentalize where the conversation is appropriate and so when it comes to setting up a business relationship with your dad and not offending them well you know the best way not to offend them is to build an awesome business where you both get fucking paid you know what I'm saying so what's gonna make the most sense for that how's that gonna work because people are much less likely to have problems in business when everybody's doing well so where the problems come in is when nobody's doing well and everybody's fighting about it nobody wants to take responsibility nobody wants to admit you know that they're not doing their part and people get their hubris and their ego and their pride all involved in these conversations which prevent any growth or any progression in the business and so dude this is where when we talk about humility mattering in business this is what we talk about humility is not oh I drive a little car and I live a little house and I have a modest life that's what the losers want to tell you but where humility is valuables when your dad make dad's trying to make a point and you shut the fuck up and listen to him and actually think about what he said and then think like man well from his perspective this and from my perspective this and then answer him instead of trying to win the argument because you think you know better all right so this can be done this is done every day and the reason you have hesitancy over it is because you and your dad have never done this before and you've probably heard your whole life that it's a bad idea and it's not a bad idea because I'm gonna tell you in business dude you're gonna be tested you're gonna be tested to the infinity degree when it comes to how hard things are gonna be and I'm gonna tell you when things get hard like that you're gonna want your friends and family there they're gonna fuck it stick with you not some dick face half-ass guy that you barely know who's just in it for the money right so what you're saying I'm just gonna clarify what you're saying is like when you get into a business relationship having that person you're having a person relationship with that person doesn't make it harder or easier because you could just as easily have issues with somebody you don't know that's a business partner absolutely okay that makes that but I also think that when things get really hard which they do in business you want people who are gonna stand by you in those positions yeah you know that person yeah yeah bro look you don't think that fucking me and Chris and Jason and Sal were sitting here fucking you know and shit gets hard and we're like fuck all right well we're all in this together bro like because if we lose we all lose yeah I mean that's yeah but you and you also know them guys you know they're yeah you know they'll fucking do the work yeah that's real yes it makes sense it makes sense man I love it well guys Andy that was question number one uh let's keep this train moving uh guys Andy question number two uh hi Andy I am a 21 year old aspiring musician and I need you to take on holidays for the whole of 2024 I've been getting after it releasing music going to the gym doing more completing 75 heart uh and it felt great I feel great however I hear many entrepreneurs speak about the imbalance of success how you must be all in on your goals and the idea of balance in the layman's term is a lie which I wholeheartedly believe um I was meant to be going on a holiday but something inside of me doesn't feel right about going on holidays and taking vacations when I'm not rich successful and I ain't driving a boogaddy yet um at times I like to taste success such a stand at a five star place for one day or checking out some supercars but going on holiday for one week at a time feels wrong especially at the stage in my entrepreneurial career my question is what is your take on holidays and taking time off uh in the rudimentary stages of your career I cancel my trip because I don't want to do what everyone else is doing instead of saving up and going on a holiday for a week I'd rather invest this money into my skills and business um I want to enjoy the holidays later on in my life when I'm rich like you um but in my early 20s I want to invest all my time and energy into becoming rich as far and when I am rich I can go uh to those destinations thoughts on this man and there's a lot of thoughts on this okay first of all you gotta stop listening to these people who are overly extreme in their application of what it actually takes yes it takes way more than you think it's gonna take yes it takes way longer than you think it's gonna take however for going your entire life for something that's 10 years down the road that's you're not gonna miss anything by taking five days off and going on a trip dude and I think it's very dangerous you're saying this is a marathon like it's a long marathon yeah yes it's a marathon but you're sprinting the marathon okay it's not a fucking easy stroll it's never like this casual pace you're running as fast as you can but here's the thing guys the point that you said about going and like tasting the success and like you know seeing the cars or being around the cars or the houses or the different levels that's shit's important and I think it's also very important for people to experience different cultures and to go to different places you know there's places that I go that when I come back bro I'm super energized like New York City is one of my favorite places to go I can go spend two or three days in New York City and come back and I'm a fucking animal for six months okay and everybody's different and how they recharge and all these things but I don't think it's good advice to tell a young person to never travel or never experience anything or never do anything until they have x amount what's the x amount that is going to give you the access to go do something do you have a number do you have a place because what'll happen is you'll keep telling yourself when I get here and then when you get there you'll keep working because you're a fucking hard motherfucker and and then you'll say when I get here I'll do this but you won't do it because you keep working and I know a lot of guys who have worked most of their life away and including me by having an attitude like that and you know I look back from where I'm at now and I'm just gonna be honest with you guys I always keep it real I look back now and I say fuck dude you know I could have went on that trip I could have went and done that thing it wouldn't a fucking fucking me up okay and so listen to me when I tell you this because I'm admitting something that I could have done better all right I did mostly what you're saying you're going to do and I can't think of a trip that I canceled or didn't go on that would have thrown me off you see what I'm saying back now if you go away for six months or you go on some fucking van tour for the next year that's gonna fuck you up that's gonna cost you okay but going somewhere for a week or 10 days with your family and friends you're gonna wish that you had that whenever you do get to the place where your finances are in order guys there's more to life than this you know your parents are gonna get old your parents are gonna get sick your friends are gonna die a lot of you guys don't understand like by the time you're in your 40s half of your friends are gonna have shit that happened to them not half but there's gonna be people that have died that you wish you would have spent more time with and I think it's very important for you to get out there if for no other reason get out there and experience other things so that you know more about what you want out of your life because when you're 20 years old all you think about is I want to make money because I don't have any money and you don't really know what you want to do with the money because you never did anything right so I think it's important for you guys to get out there and do a couple things but I think it's also an equally and even more important to make sure that it doesn't throw you down the the whole of leisure and pleasure and comfort and convenience that ends up caution your whole life so from my perspective I don't agree with a lot of what these guys say I am built around the idea of effectiveness not busyness I don't think it's about necessarily how much time you put in and the early days it is because you lack skill but as you gain skill and you gain experience the less time you actually have to put in to get the same result and the people who end up getting the best results are the people who have the high skill and put in the time but dude why do we do all this shit why do we do this we do this so that we can have a better life and I wouldn't foregrow you know experiencing little experiences on your life along the way thinking that it's going to fuck you up because I don't think that it will and I'm not seeing anybody that it does the only people that it does are the people that take like three years off or a six months off and then they come back and they're like you know they try to act like they're fundamentally enlightened and they try to say shit like oh you know my priorities have changed and I don't really want to do this anymore blah blah blah and what's happening is they're hung over from their fucking trip and they can't get back in the groove and then three or four years later they're like fuck I need to get my shit back together right and I've seen that happen a hundred times I'm trying to play catch up yeah and you don't want to be that guy but like going on a trip for fucking four days bro listen you're competing against people who only work two days a week it's not gonna hurt you you know most people they drink Thursday they party Friday Saturday Sunday they're hung over Monday they get Tuesday and Wednesday in before they start the cycle again yeah so um so where you're at dude I I think you have a great attitude and I think your mentality is correct that you need to fucking hustle and put in the time and use your 20s to do as much progress as you can but I don't think you cancelling a trip uh you know unless you're going on a vacation every other week is is going to affect your progress have you said that is like a common thing with young just young people in general just like feeling the need of like they have to give themselves permission like this idea of rewarding yourself you know for somebody like it's well I think that comes I think that comes from from from two things one the culture on the internet is not accurate okay you have a lot of people on the internet who haven't actually built the things that you want to build telling you how to build the shit that you want to build you have a lot of people parroting successful people's words like dude half the shit fuck more than half the shit that's set on the internet is shit that I've said over the last fucking 10 years okay go back and listen to the msco project if you don't believe me the msco project gave birth to more fucking business influencers than any fucking podcast ever the problem is a lot of those motherfuckers aren't doing it they figured out they can lie and sound good and sound like they know what they're doing and you could give them their money don't give those motherfuckers your money unless you could see their business see what they've built talk to their customers use their product they haven't built a real business don't fucking buy anything from them all right but I think there's a toxic there's a toxic mentality around hustle culture meaning you have to work 40 hours out of 24 every single day and then I also think the ignorance of not being down the path right I don't mean ignorance in in an insulting way I just mean how can you have the perspective of what it's really like if you've never done it right the only way for you to have a perspective is to listen to someone who's done it and then hope that you can grasp it so I have done it and I'm here to tell you you know there's a number of trips that I've canceled over the years that I really wish I hadn't done that too and I don't want that to be you because I think you'll make it either way if you have the mentality of I need to develop skill I need to put in more effort than anybody and if you do those two things and you don't quit everybody else is gonna quit at some point so you get where you want to go I personally that's where I'm at I don't think you're gonna hurt yourself yeah I think it's also too completely different from like there's some people like oh I need that mental health day well I gotta take this mental health vacation for sure for like that's a whole for sure yeah that's that's a whole that's probably the third point that fucks people up okay we've got a pussy culture yeah who thinks that if they work for fucking you know two months they gotta have a mental health week like bro mental health week that's like a new thing mental health day that's a new thing in the last three or four years it's fucking pussy shit okay it's for people that don't want to fucking get the shit together and want to excuse just to fuck off you if we could just we should just call it fuck off day okay I would be more I would not be in real that's that's more yeah I would be okay with that like if like if my like if somebody came up to me and say hey bro I need to fuck off day I'm like cool I need I give it you saying but like this pretending like you need this mental health thing so you can get a day off of work that's fucking week as shit just tell the truth hey I need your day to fuck off you know what saying yeah makes sense guys any question number three eighty twenty years old and growing up fast I've had the same group of best friends that have been there for me whenever I truly need help and still will be here and be there to this day the problem I'm facing with them is that they lack the maturity majority of the time now in days and still act like they are in high school when we've been out for three years now we have awesome times for the most part but I'm tired of dealing with the drama they create and the unnecessary bullshit I'm surrounded in when I try my hardest to avoid it there are two things I hit in life drama beef with other people in maturity when maturity is required I would take a bullet for these two guys but I don't know if it's good for me to stake so close to them or to move on and expand to newer and better people that are out there out of this phase of thinking I'd appreciate your real spill on the subject well first of all I wouldn't take a bullet for those motherfuckers you you you think those people are your friends because you spent time with them what you listen this is where a lot of people fuck up their lives they they meet some people in high school or they meet some people in college and they think because they're in proximity or they spend time with them that they're actually like a friend that they're obligated to friend with friendship is a two-way street they contribute to you you contribute to them they contribute to you you contribute to them they are reliable for you you are reliable for them it is not I grew up with this person it is not I am related to this person it is not I went to high school with this person it is not I went to college with this person it is not I dated this person for three years the contractual understanding of a relationship or friendship can change at any time all right and when it changes and when it should change is when it no longer serves you and it doesn't make sense for you to remain there and it's halting your personal growth and so when I say you shouldn't take a bullet for them what I mean is is that you lack the perspective to understand what friendships truly about because you're still a young person every single young person including me including DJ including all these guys we all went through this we all thought that the girl we dated in high school or the friends we had in high school were like the end all be all of our life at the time of 20 years old and we didn't do things because we didn't know if it would disrupt that ecosystem or if they would hate on it or if they would disapprove and that holds more people back than anything and so what I would say to you number one is that it's really mature of you and good that you're realizing this at 20 years old because most people never realize this they will grow up their entire lives being loyal to people in a way that they should not be loyal to and what I mean by that is they're giving up their hopes their dreams their plans their vision for themselves to appease people that they grew up with or that they would take a bullet for or that they are my brother and those people really aren't and here's the problem with that if you never progress from that friend group and you have dreams that are outside the dreams of that group and these people won't understand you're never going to be fulfilled you're never going to be happy you're always going to be bitter and you're always going to be asking yourself what if so we have to understand that where you're at is a normal thing but the next move if you want to change your life if you want to progress if you want to become the person that it is you're trying to become is to continue down that path without worry without care without concern of what those people are going to say or think about it most people will give up their entire lives everything that they've ever wanted because of the opinions of people that they basically sort of ended up hanging around and it'll ruin their lives and this goes to relationships too okay a lot of dudes and I'm going to speak to the dudes here this is a big deal a lot of you dudes lack game at all you do not how I'm just going to be real I'm going to keep real real you have zero fucking shit going for you you don't have any money you don't have any game you don't know how to talk to girls you don't know how to make them laugh you you fucking basically are in a position right now at 20 years old where you're going to take any pee that you can get tell me I'm wrong you're going to be trying to stick your shit and fucking every hole that you can find and you don't give a shit if that person has their shit together and this is how dudes fuck up their lives okay they're so desperate they don't have anything going for them they don't have any game they don't know how to talk to women and then they take the first girl that'll fuck them from the bar and they stay in a relationship with that girl for three or four years and that girl nags them and that girl holds them back and that girl says why don't you spend more time with me and then when you spend more time with her then she says why are you always broke okay and these people will fuck up your lives so you have to understand and this is just a fundamental reality whether it comes to friendship whether it comes to relationships the relationship is allowed to evolve and change based upon your desires and what you want for your life and you should not stay quote unquote loyal to people because you knew them at one point in your life and that includes girls that includes boyfriends that includes friends when you decide you want more and they don't want to come with you then it's time to exit that relationship and continue moving on because at the end of the day when you're 70 80 90 years old all you're going to have to show for your life is what you actually did and here's the best part about it especially for young men young women too but more so for men is that the more you progress the more you get your life together the much the more of a winner you become the greater the options open up for you to meet someone who's not nagging you who's not bust in your balls who isn't looking at every other dude on the internet because you don't have any money or any fucking means okay because that's the reality bro they tell us the story about oh you know all the matters is what's on the inside that's total bullshit that's not real advice that's that's romantic advice that older women give their sons because that's what they wanted the truth of the matter is is the world's very harsh and the and the truth of the matter for men is the world rewards you for what you produce and who you are and what you become and yes you're going to meet people that will love you for you but you're going to meet a lot more people that are a lot cooler when you have a lot of shit going for you and you've actually expanded upon or or materialize some of that potential that you have and so we have to be very honest about relationships here most people give up their entire hopes dreams careers lifestyle everything they want because they met some girl at a bar or they met some dudes in high school or college tell me how that makes sense okay so let's have a realist viewpoint on relationships if the relationship doesn't serve you if it doesn't contribute to you if it's not something that helps push you down the path then it doesn't belong in your life and that goes for marriages that goes for boyfriends that goes for girlfriends and that goes for friends people change things change situations change and sometimes it's time to say hey I appreciate you you're still my friend I you know we dated I still I still appreciate you you're a good person but I'm gonna go my way because this is what I want for my life and we just want different things Tony Robbins has a really good way of describing this that I think that when I heard this it really changed my mind about relationships and he said that when relate when you decide that it's time to move on from your relationship you have to understand that it's not a personal thing you don't have to be mad at the person it's just I think that's people's biggest issue yeah bro listen yes dude listen this made it click for me and I got this from Tony Robbins he said look everybody has a different nature everybody has a different plan for themselves and just because their nature is different than your nature or their plans for themselves are different than your plans does not mean you have to be mad at them it doesn't mean there has to be contention it doesn't mean you have to hate them you can very amicably just say hey look you want different things than I want and that's okay in fact I'll help you get those things but I gotta go do these things all right and that's how you move on from those situations and the best part about this guys is that as you move on as you progress you meet friends that make you better you you get a partner that makes you better you're no longer getting mad or made fun of or told that your dreams are stupid instead you're surrounded by people who say fuck dude this is awesome I think we should do this and this and this let's do this here I'll do this together and that's the like dude my friends that I talked to there's not a conversation that I have that's not like about how we're gonna win more together yeah you know what I mean like think about that I want you all to think about the conversations you have how much drama you have how much gossip you deal with I don't deal with any of that I've I've I've removed that for my existence a hundred percent and you know this because you're around me enough if someone starts drama around me more than once or someone's a gospel around me I cut him the fuck out bro quickly yeah if I find someone in my company that's drama and gossip guess what I get him the fuck out okay I don't deal with that shit I don't like that shit I appreciate people that will look you in the eye and say I don't like this let's do something about this that's adult shit and you guys have to go from being a young person thinker to a mature thinker and if you want to be successful in business you're gonna have to be able to evaluate and adjust and make decisions objectively about the current situation if you're always attached to all these things emotionally and you always have this like oh well I don't want to do this because Steve's gonna be mad at me if I do this and you know I'm not really being his boy and this and that and this dude if you if you make decisions like that in business you'll lose you have to make factual realist decisions about the way things are not about the way things you wish they were all right and you see people like this in the influencer space you see people talking about oh fuck that guy he in a real one because he didn't stand by me when I was doing well you were doing bad shit you were doing bad shit so you're fucking right you see what I'm saying right like you don't owe people to stand next to them when they're doing fucked up shit in fact I get the fuck away from those people that's a smart move but the point here guys is this stop being loyal to relationships that you shouldn't be loyal to stop bending your dreams your goals your wants your needs in life for people's approval or disapproval that honestly doesn't matter it's your life you have to build your life you have to live your life you have to be proud of your life at the end of it and that's only going to happen if you are understanding that a lot of these people that come and go in your life are just their visitors their people who come it's like a neighbor to live your house people who moves you're gonna live at your house for a hundred years every three or four years new neighbors move in and then they move out and every three or four years they move in again and that's kind of how life goes and eventually you know you're gonna you're gonna meet that one neighbor or those two neighbors that you're like fuck those are really good people I'm gonna stay in touch with them they're gonna come to my house for the pool party they're gonna come over for the barbecue I'm gonna do Christmas with them I'm gonna go on vacation with those people those people become your lifelong friends but you only have so many slots for that bro and you're not gonna not all your high school friends are gonna be in there because they have different natures not all your ex-girlfriends or current boy friends or fucking husbands and wives are gonna be in there because dude you know that's a whole another topic like this topic of unconditional love okay unconditional love is for your fucking animals it's not for people people say well it's for your kids too you don't understand really if your kid went and fucking shot up a school you still gonna fucking unconditional love them right if your kids out there being one of these weirdos molesting all these kids and shit you still gonna fucking unconditionally love them if you do you fucked up all right so let's remove that too love has conditions it does 100% friendship has conditions love has conditions marriage has conditions business relationships have conditions you know what it's called it's called real fucking life all right and so let's stop living in the fantasy world where our high school buddies are gonna be our buddies our whole life yeah they can be and you could be cool with them like I'm fucking I still see my high school boys bro we fucking drink beers together shit but we're not I don't hang with them every day I don't call them and ask them what decisions I got to make I don't weigh my life by them I drink a beer with them when I see them it's a fucking place you know what I'm saying like it's not it's okay like it's part of life man and we have to get we have to get good and we have to get comfortable with understanding that life is a progression in a journey and you're gonna meet people along the way if you're ambitious the further you go that are gonna actually accelerate your life yeah so it's almost like a safe to say you haven't even met your best friends yet no you fucking haven't and dude but dude you have to understand you only have just like a baseball team bro you only have so many slots on the line spots yeah you only dude you only have like what four or five slots on your roster and that includes your relationship see what I'm saying you those slots should be filled with the best fucking people not people that you happen to their parents happen to enroll them in school the same year that you got enrolled and that's just you come from the set yes but people will fucking say though I fun grew up with those people I fucking take a pee I'll take a bullet for them no yeah no that's that's the mentality that fucks your whole life uh yeah a 20 year old and getting that we're like oh dude dude look man and do I have friends that are friends of mine just because they're friends of mine they've been friends of mine yeah absolutely but like I said bro like I'm not weighing my life decisions based upon their approval or or not I don't care all right you don't like what the fuck I'm doing well fuck off yeah I love it man yeah I think it's an important I think this is an important question for people because people struggle with this it's not just young people it's old people too yeah like people who are you know 40 years old like how many people right now are listening that are 40 years old that are like thinking they're like fuck I've dealt with this mother fucking my whole life right I've had this fucking bitch my whole life she's been in my ear for the last 15 years root I've wanted to do this and all she does is fucking bitching me how many you do it's can can can relate to the thing I'm saying where uh that the your your significant other says what'd you have any time for me you're always fucking working and then when you go hang out with them they're like why don't you have any fucking money bro fuck them bitches tell them to get a fucking job yeah I love oh there listen I'm be real dude there's a lot of toxic bitches out there there's a lot yeah there's a lot yeah it is what it is it was also a lot of guys we just have to settle too though bro that's because you ain't got no game you got none going for you yeah you'll get there man no they won't they a lot of them won't a lot of them will still continue with that mentality that like you know like they're starving in the desert bro and they're wondering through the fucking Sahara and then there's some titties and they're like oh you know I'm saying like that's what dudes do and they sit they take what they can get they marry some chip that they met by chance not by design and then they're miserable and they can't figure out why it didn't work well it didn't work because the contents of how you met him was you like their titties you see what I'm saying like you should be looking at what is their character what are they like do where do they come from do they have are they smart are they funny like they're goals yeah and by the way you get a lot more to choose from when your shit's in line when you're in shape your finances are in order you your intelligent you've got good quality friends not these fucking douchebags from you know 20 years ago or five years ago or high school whatever the fuck you know like bro you want to put yourself in the position of most leverage in the way that you put yourself in the position most leverages by becoming the best possible version of yourself as quickly as fucking possible love it man love it what guys Andy that was
