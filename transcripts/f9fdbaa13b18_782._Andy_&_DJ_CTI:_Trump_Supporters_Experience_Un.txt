Yeah, well cuz I like to know about the dudes, you know And this is just wild to me man, but it's but it's game in a lot of traction though, so Um, I guess we'll see what comes of it man guys let us start out in the comments You guys happen to the ring let us know yeah, no man. I know No, zero zero interest. Yeah Um, well, it's getting to our crews man. We got a lot of stuff to cover a lot of interesting dots to connect remember as always If you guys want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com guys can find them all link there How much would the purse have to be for you to do it? Hmm Like how much money is it staker? Oh, I'm I imagine that probably not getting much from me personally I'm gonna do least a millie a mill a mill really easy to get slapped get slapped. That's it. Yeah Yeah, I'll take it. Yeah In all dollar bills. That sounds like a lot dude a million dollars to get fucking slapped on national TV I would do it for less than that really. Yeah, I would do um, yeah Why would? What? I would do it for free. Thank you for a little bit less than that, you know 20 bucks is 20 bucks No, I mean 20 bucks is $20 man. I mean $1,000. All right, well I think that's I think that's a lot if we were negotiating contract I would say you're asking to do the rest of the test people could die from this fucking thing I'm not not even a million dollars man pay me okay, not doing it Your interests. Well, it's your dollar amount You're gonna say a couple of nine hundred and ninety nine thousand Yeah, man. All right. Well guys, let's get it. Bro, listen, I've done dumber shit just around with my buddies for free Yeah, like that's all I'm saying like we've done dumber shit You know just when we're drinking beer or smoking or whatever like hey, let me slap you. Hey, let me slap you You know, hey, let me touch your reener Just came we didn't do that Most of them get paid between two to ten thousand dollars Ten thousand nine dollars. Top earners can earn up to 45,000. Pay a little bit better. Yeah, a little bit better It's a lot of money. Perfect. But that's if they win like they got I guess winning by knockout or what yeah, I think everybody's Contract is different All right moving on we'll see Well, let's get into these headlines guys headline number one This is a weird thing that came up I'm gonna address it real quick before we get to the main meat and potatoes here But Trump had a rally in Tucson. All right, and apparently There were some issues with some of the supporters that were there This headliner is Trump supporters experience unexplained near blindness temporary eye injuries following Tucson rally per report Some of the attendees of a Donald Trump rally in Tucson Arizona last week were left with unexplained eye injuries With some reportedly going nearly blind temporarily They have been seated right behind the GOP nominee on stage during the rally according to news for Tucson Six people who were seated behind the former president on stage during his rally are still Feeling the effects Such as eye irritation and required medical attention at least one person went to the emergency room My myra Rodriguez who used to be a plan parenthood director But became a pro life advocate and supporter of Donald Trump told the outlet quote as soon as we left And we stepped outside my eyes were burning and she got home. She decided to go to the emergency room She said quote the emergency room staff from the triage nurse to the physician assistance acts are used Sure, you didn't get sprayed with something your symptoms look like you got sprayed with something Now the morning after the event she was nearly blind, but doctors weren't were unable To determine what caused her injuries quote. I can't see anything when I try to open my eyes I see a bright light it hurts it hurts a lot to open my eyes I have this cold cloth I put on and take off constantly. It's horrible Thankfully the near blindness was only temporary and her vision started to improve as of Tuesday Now that happened again no media really picked that up and this was last week But doctors before the assassination. Yeah, but doctors waited on the mystery assassination attempt That's yeah, right And but doctors weighed in saying that it was probably more I was probably due to the air conditioning system on the stage that dried out their eyes With lighting and stuff like that and like I mean, I don't know we got studio lighting in here and I'm never I Didn't he blindness well, I walk and read words. I'll tell you this blind. Okay. Do you know when I speak when I speak publicly What do I wear? You typically wear sunglasses. That's right and the reason I wear sunglasses because the light is so bright on the stage that like afterwards I can't see shit for like five six hours. No shit. I have very sensitive eyes. I don't know. That's why you did yeah Well, I also it looks cool. It doesn't yeah, so that's the other reason, but that is why I do that There was a really yeah, and most people have never been on a stage with proper lighting and it's it's pretty fucking bright Like they don't understand like when I'm standing on stage or Trump you can't see no you could see like three or two or three rows I had a view and that's it. You everything else is black maybe even the first row is all you could see And which is interesting because people like how do you speak in front all those people? It's like well, I can't see them You know, so it's like there's like eight people right here in the front two people are gauging That's it. Yeah, but You know, it could be that You know if they're seated behind them You know people have different eyes. They have different sensitivities light But also it makes you wonder like bro like would they try to pump something into the air conditioning or you know That makes me nervous dude. I think I think everything is on the table man. Nothing's off the table Yeah, but I mean if they were trying to pump something through the air would have got everybody right? so Well, I mean, but on the contrary to though with the lights and stuff Trump has to deal with the same exact lights Yeah, but he might be used to it or he might have eyes that can tolerate it You know or you know, I don't know. Yeah, I know my my eyes I've had to like condition my eyes To not be sensitive to light because I wore sunglasses for most of my life And I started reading some data about you know how it's important not to wear sunglasses to develop vitamin D Uh, and honestly it made a big difference and so I don't know You know, it's weird. It's weird. So I mean, well, well, well, we'll stay on the lookout of this topic But let's get to some other interesting stuff that is coming out um right now Now we released a show yesterday a CTI Um, where I believe a call to action was made for secret service like hey, we need to have some whistleblowers come out Absolutely say this right? Yeah, just said this because 98% of them dudes are fucking great dudes Well, and I know this and I know that you know this And don't know if you guys listening though this but a lot of those guys do listen to the show And so it should be no Surprise that as of today when the show was recorded Um, we got whistleblowers now good um, secret service whistleblower makes bombshell claim about security laps at trump golf course as agent who spotted would be assassin reveals while he was stunned When he first saw him So let's dive into this because this is uh, this is definitely an interesting development in the second assassination attempt of Donald Trump Um, a secret service whistleblower Has made a bombshell claim about a security lapse at former president Donald Trump's Florida golf course Where a would be assassin was found with an AK-47 the 78 year old former president was enjoying a round of golf in West Palm Beach on Sunday When Ryan Wesley routh 58 years old allegedly stuck the barrel of his weapon through the chain link fence Uh, but it was later revealed that agents had spotted routh prior to the assassination attempt And Republican senator Josh howley now says the secret service failed to secure the perimeter Josh howley from Good old mozzura all right where we wrestle we do rattle Ha ha ha ha ha but he said it's not even clear that the secret service swept the area before the Republican presidential nominee stepped onto the course Uh, he told uh Fox News uh, just he waters primetime Wednesday night um But check this out If such allegations are true All he said that it would mean that trump's detailed failed to follow a protocol Just two months after he was grazed in the air Biobullet at his butt the Pennsylvania rally Let's listen what he has to say Well, what we've heard Jesse from new whistleblowers who've come forward about this second assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life and here's what they have told us that golf course That the president was playing secret service have guarded that course many many times and what the whistleblower says is Protocol calls for secret service to station agents Along the places in the course that are known vulnerabilities I want to emphasize the services guarded this course many times they know where their a vonal Vulnerabilities they normally station agents there ahead of trump's appearance on the course But they apparently did not do that this last weekend and the whistleblowers tell me that's strange That's out of protocol. It's not even clear secret service swept the perimeter before trump took to the course Also a broach a breach rather a protocol and they want to know why and so do I I think the secret service deserves to give us answer No, so two big issues here. They didn't sweep it before he got there and they didn't stand in the places they knew were vulnerable Which that place where the shooter was or the attempted shooter was a known vulnerability they known vulnerability Yeah, right, which makes you think With the idea that that was a Not planned round of golf. It wasn't on the itinerary. It was a last minute change of plans now In security there is a very deep out I imagine with trump it is like detailed to the minute very very in depth right so You all I mean dude to me it feels like it was it was left open on purpose That's just what it feels like well listen like I mean in the business right it's like no we have this worries You know you adapt right you have to be fluid is what we call it But the thing is like even at last minute changes There's still steps and things that you do to ensure it right yeah, I'm like all right you want to go play around A golf okay, well you get your stuff ready. I'm sending some guys out there to go sweep the fucking field right It's very simple like it's like you know it doesn't take long right and especially when you've been like that's a property You know like it's home base. Yeah, you know where the fucking weaknesses are You go fucking feel those it's very very simple There was a decision it had to have been a decision intentionally not to do that Sure appears that way. That's what it looks like now other information is also coming out at this time Um, Matt gates representative of Matt gates he claims that there are five known assassination teams in the United States that are intelligent services are tracking and aware of now and are doing nothing about This is a crazy claim that's coming out, but let's fucking Track the American patriot and put him on a domestic terrorism. Yeah, let's do that. It makes perfect sense So representative Matt gates he said during an appearance on bright bar news daily That there are currently five known assassination teams in the United States Three of which are foreign and are out to kill former president Donald Trump Quote tragic avoidable gate said when asked where it starts on the second assassination attempt against the former president Quote I am starting to get the impression that we do not have enough force protection of supporting president Trump That we ought to have given the threat environment he said noting that he recently met with a senior official in the department of homeland security or dhs Who said that there are at least five known assassination teams in the United States At least three of which are foreign that are out to kill Trump How do you guys know this information and do nothing about it? Why aren't these people apprehended right now? Why are they still here? Yeah, you got people who walked into the capital Doing literally nothing damaging just walking through who are still in jail with no bail no bond No representation that actually matters and nobody gives a shit But we know five assassination teams three of which are foreign Right the other two are who Right, we know who the fuck I paid by yeah, right And they let them they're letting them out they're letting them go around they know who they are look Do this is the same thing we talked about yesterday? Oh, they were a known threat on the radar for this much time All the school shooters the assassination guy this guy like It sure seems like they are intentionally being allowed to operate and then they're going to people's houses Who speak out online and harassing them for what they say on their podcast or what they say on the internet or on twitter That's insane dude That's insane that is communist shit And if you don't think that there's people it like I saw this clip yesterday And I don't remember who the who the government official was but they approached this one of the Democrat government officials it was a senator or a congressman And they said what do you think about the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump and you know what his response was Donald Trump has called us communist he has said this he has said that he has said this he said nothing about condemning this these attempts or nothing about keeping the integrity of the American system intact He justified the assassination attempts and sounded like he sort of supported him And then they did a poll last night. I don't know if you saw the poll But they asked Democrat voters how many of you think the country would be better off if Donald Trump were assassinated 29% said the country would be better off 24% said they weren't sure So that so when they say To even put that hold on it was on fox when they say There's no place of violence. They do not fucking mean that and people have to understand they are saying that So you and I and everybody else out here who's completely outraged will not do anything to stand up and defend what's going on right now They do believe in violence. They're happy the violence is happening They're not apologizing for the violence and these are the fucking facts of the matter now Joe Biden gets on the phone with Trump And they have a tremendous conversation. Why do you think they have a tremendous conversation now because Biden realizes that he just got kicked out by the own thing that he thought he was a part of So now he's on the outside and do you know who just awarded president Trump presidential level detail Biden no shit happen today No shit. Yeah, see that happen today That's crazy. Well, cuz he knows I wrote this I don't think they're gonna like if Trump wins it won't be easy. They're gonna cheat They're gonna do as much as they possibly can I got a little bit more on that a little bit later, but you know Here's the truth of the matter man like There has to be some type of consequences for these people who are caught when it comes out that we're involved in all of this shit It has to be in DJ. These people are traders dude and I hope you're coming this This is a communist insurgency slash revolution happening in our country If you think this is still political norms or political ebbs and flows you are missing the big picture This is complete communist shit that's happening and we are in danger We we the people are in danger if we do not unite if we do not come together If we do not start overlooking identity politics and political correctness and all this bullshit and arguing over this or that Or this little thing or that little thing or this next distraction If we don't smart enough dude, we're gonna be a communist country and it's gonna be real bad real real bad And it's gonna especially be bad for the people who are rooting for their side because those people are the people in general who are not Truly producing okay and in communism they use these people who don't truly produce to rally Enough support on the street by promising them free shit by promise them at a fun utopia They rally these people on the street to get these people into office Using the electoral system then after they're in office They actually take these people who are not useful and they put them in camps Because they're not useful they call them useful idiots They get those people out of society because they can't work They can't produce they can't contribute to the communist agenda and Those are the people who are champion this they think they're gonna be on a commune with a bunch of people skipping through the forest and the roses and having a great time and everybody make you know You make the butter and out trade for you the milk and I'll do they think this shit That's not what it's going to be Those people are gonna be in a camp break and mother fucking rocks That's what it ends up being and that's what it's end up being in every single communist society It's ever existed. That's the truth the people who don't produce are putting camps everybody else Works their ass off and gets to keep none of it because That's the way the communist work. It's an excuse to say oh, are we gonna work? It's all for the common good, but the common good is not your good. It's their good. What's good for them? They are the common good not you It's way worse and people don't understand that this is what's happening right now This is what is happening in this country That just was thinking more to you know, I'm by rewarding him the presidential level protection I don't know if that's a good thing actually I have person like I'm still of the belief bro that they're need he needs to bring in an own separate private entity to handle that shit Because you like you can't trust at this point Right now you just want to get trust that's what I'm saying like you can't I mean definitely can't trust that I don't know may not be the best move Um, how much do you think that these these threats Could be intended for him to stop campaigning. Oh, I mean at this point I don't think any of the threats are made for him to stop campaigning. They want this guy out. Yeah, yeah The time for the stop campaigning that was the year ago. Yeah, what I'm saying is Well, yeah, I think you're right. I mean do the shot to do in the ear. That's what I'm saying I mean they were not trying to like they're way past the point like I mean, I think I think Trump's long enough to know that I mean like They know that like I mean just trying to give him a stop campaigning. You can't stop the guy. No, that's not gonna You know what I'm saying like there's very little you could do to actually stop him And they know what the fuck that is you know And so what so what happens if they do assassinate him What happens if he gets assassinated what what what happens I think that's something everybody should stop and really think about what happens if that happens What's the world look like yeah, no, what do we do yeah Yeah You know and like and the other part of this human like the part that I'm really sick of seeing is that like you know All these assassination attempts all these people coming out, you know making these crazy like this dude in Alaska Just got arrested for threatening to torture and assassinate six supreme court justices right All of these people They all align and are on left the fucking left. Yeah, that's right These aren't and they say they're the party of joy and the party of love and the party of tolerance and peace and all that They're the party of lying in intolerance and violence and gaslighting and manipulation So that we the people will not ever be able to unite and figure out that we are on the same team and they are on a different team Like it's crazy like this 76 year old fucking dude He said some messages between march and july of 2023 Containing violent races and homophobic rhetoric, but you know, guess what he's a fucking registered Democrats donated to act blue multiple times Um as recently as of july You know what I'm saying? It's like all these people and guess what those six conservative judges while they're not trying to name them If you know the supreme court, it's nine justices six are conservative three are more liberal. Yeah, so do they These guys To get arrested for this they have to have intent to execute the plan correct probably won't stick no, I'm just saying they have to I mean it depends right like you're making They can't just be saying oh, you know, this guy should be dealt with it's has to be like them thinking like okay, this is the plan to do so actionable plan yeah for sure For sure, you know, but I mean it's just imagine being so lost that you can't see what's actually happening new your heels are dug in so far You can't see just like that woman that had the blindness And she used to be with playing parenthood and she woke up to what's actually going on Dude like at some point people have to like stop and say fuck What is actually going on here? What what how why do I believe what I believe where did I get that belief system from Does everybody else believe this or do I believe this one of the biggest things I don't understand about the leftists and when I say leftists I don't mean Democrats. I mean leftists One things I don't understand about the leftists Is you know they pride themselves on being the revolutionaries or the you know the anti system you know what I'm saying activists yeah, but you're on the side of the biggest media the biggest companies the biggest governments ever existed in the history of earth You're on the side of the machine, dude It's not you're not raging against the machine you're raging with the machine And these people walk around like they're fucking patriots and like they're you know revolutionaries and it's like dude You're the machine. You know how do you how do they not see that how that makes sense? Yeah And then they call the other people fascist when we have a fascist system that exists right now where your people are perpetuating even further Makes no sense to me, man Guys does it makes us you let us know down in the comments what you guys think I was that being said. Let's go to cruise some of these comments. All right cruise comments. This first one I comes from at yank 98 100 Just a little fun fact codex hair Remember you ask called wicks call wicks that makes sense. It looks like wicks. Yeah. All right. Cool. I appreciate yank.

Codula Harris We're not taking anyone's guns, but we must ban AR-15s I don't want you to die, but I must kill you Yeah, like that doesn't make any sense. Yeah, let's dive into this Democrat presidential nominee vice president comal Harris said she would not be taking away anyone's guns Then immediately pushed an AR-15 ban During a Tuesday question and answer with reporters at the national association of black journalists Um, so she finally appeared on to the same thing that Trump did a month ago And uh, she actually, you know, she she had a very different greeting It was much more relaxed and you know likeable. Yeah, and uh, I like when they go at Trump there because he can handle himself Well, I mean, it makes them look stupid. Yeah, when they try to go after this guy like that Um, man, so so let's let's hear what common law has to say First of all, yes, I am a gun owner and Tim Maul is a gun owner and we're not trying to take anybody's guns away from that But we do need to solve weapons ban How can how can you say that? I Because she's an idiot. She doesn't know what she's saying Like do these people think these people think that AR like do you see some of the comments about What these people who are not in the guns think of AR-15 like bro, they'll that I saw a comment about Trump's shooting his the one in uh Butler And someone was like it when that was definitely not an AR-15 because if it was it would have blown his whole body apart in the pieces With the story don't yeah like dude people have no idea like that guy even know what AR stands for no Dude the other thing is is that remember that guy who was like 30-round clip three seconds 30-round clip Three seconds, you know, or the one guy that shot the gun do you remember that yeah And he goes Dude these people are they don't they're not educated on what they're talking about no They don't understand what an AR-15 actually is they also don't understand the Fundamental reason the only reason for the second amendment the second amendment is not about hunting The second amendment is not about deer and kevlar vets like Biden said a bunch times The second amendment is so that we can protect ourselves against a tyrannical government That's armed with the most advanced weapons by the way that we pay for to be used potentially against us So the entire purpose of the second amendment has nothing to do with anything other than us the citizens Being able to counterbalance against a tyrannical government Which if you think about it like that We should be afforded the ability to get any weapon that they can get now does that mean nuclear weapons and shit like that I don't think anybody should have nuclear weapons They should exist but does that mean a tank does that mean a helicopter if you could afford one does that you should be able to have all that shit Because that's what they have and the only thing that keeps us from being slaves which by the way we all already are you just don't think of it like that Is that balance of power? Yeah, we are in slavery already we do pay more in tax than we get to keep for ourselves What's that called slay that is called tax slavery? Okay, that is that is totally against what this country was founded upon completely against Okay, but we don't think of it like that because we were born into it They were supposed balloons under that's right And so we have a lot of people who don't think they don't think like what is this country supposed to be it's supposed to be free Look around you look at your city look at your state look at your roads look at look at the state of the buildings in your city Does it look like Dubai or does it look like a crumbling ex Powerhouse of a country You know, we we have to understand these people are Teranical and they we do need a counterbalance and when they say we want to remove AR 15s or we need an assault weapons ban Why do you think they say that do you think these people are so ignorant that they don't understand the reason for the second amendment or do you think That they think you don't understand what the second amendment is about They think you don't understand because they're in the background laughing at you about how much taxes you pay about how much they take from us About how hard they make life for us about how we are just stupid little peasants that need to be ruled over them these people have an elitist mentality they do not see themselves as part of us they see themselves as part of a royal gang That rules over us and it's harder to rule over us when we are armed with semi automatic rifles It's just harder because you can fight a war with an AR 15 you cannot fight a war with a 9 mm lock You can't do it So this is the reason that they do this and if you think it's for any other reason You're you're mistaken. I'm sorry you're wrong all right And they even I mean we talk about all the time They try to pull on the purse strings, you know make this like emotional argument, you know and bring every time there's a A school shooter that one of their fucking people do and commits You know i'm saying is like they want to bring that back in the conversation these people don't give a fuck about kids Because at the same time they want to abort them at the same time they want to mask them up and jab them and vaccinate them and fucking leave them out of school or more importantly Uh, how about bombing them like they're currently doing in plenty of places around the fucking world. Yeah, you don't they don't give a fuck about now They don't care about anything other than money and power when and then they try to come on and gaslight and say that The only people that care about money and power are the Republicans well there's a lot of Republicans that do only care about money and power But if we look at how they attack Donald Trump they're not attacking Donald Trump because he's a threat to the Quote unquote democracy for the people He's a threat to their power structure that is why they attack Donald Trump so People have i think people don't believe her at all. I think people are coming to the understanding that if we are disarmed We are done. We are done. There will be no way to defend yourself against a tyrannical government There will no way to be def- no way uh to defend yourself against an invasion which has already happened These people are already here. They're already here 90% of the migrants that came across the border are military age males 90 fucking percent You go we go fight them with the fucking fly swatter right when they come to your house and again like they're doing in calirado Or like they're doing you know in these other places around what are you gonna do hit them with a fucking frying pan What is that what you're gonna do? Bro they don't give a fuck about loving peace. They want your shit. They want your house They want your food. They want your water and they want you out of the fucking way and people are idealistic That's why this show is called real af realism is the truth We cannot in life and death situations we cannot take an idealistic viewpoint and say oh well this person has a good heart So i'm go if you think that then why aren't you hosting those people in your house? Oh well you know anybody who votes or thinks it's okay for the migrants to be here You should be hosting them in your house and if you're not hosting them in your house you're a fucking liar Intrushed period because there's a millions of these people homeless and you have this bleeding heart for them And unless you have them in your home you are a fucking liar period No, I mean it's like everything else. It's not my problem deal with that. That's right. You know that's right You know but it's crazy but back on this topic though man Banging the article continues banning a r15s aka 47s and other firearms and democrats describe as assault weapons Has been a part of Harris's gun control agenda since she was Vied for the democrat presidential nomination in 2019 Moreover Harris made clear during the 2019 nominating cycle that she would enact such a ban via executive Action if elected When April 22nd 2019 Bipyre news reported Harris is planning to give congress a hundred days Uh, it's a past new gun controls if she won the white house should congress fell to act Harris made clear She would simply use executive orders to achieve the gun control she desires Then on July 13th 2019 Harris again pledged to bypass congress and enact executive gun control should she win the presidency Now Harris remark quote gun violence is the leading cause of death for young black men in America We must stop this when president. I will take executive action to ensure guns and I fall into the wrong hands You know like the hands of Ralph or crooks or people that are on your radar for months and years at a time or people that are groomed through the pro through a program called mk Altra why don't you guys go look up what mk ultra it is not a conspiracy theory is in a man is in a Real program that is used to manipulate mentally old people into doing things the horrific things that we see such as school shootings These are not just random things guys. These are mentally old people who are on the internet who come across another group of people Who happen to be associated with certain agencies who then convinced this person to go do these things Okay, that is what the fuck you are really dealing with and if we don't understand this I think I don't know bro. Well, it's not nothing. It's frustrating. It's not isn't but here's it's not even nothing new with her like her specifically This is a clip from when she was the prosecutor in California Right next to Gavin Newsom check this out and listen to what she says because what she says is I mean if there's anything that I've ever heard that was more un-American it was is what said in this clip Responsible behaviors Among everybody in the community and just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home Doesn't mean that we're not gonna walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affair Why would you have the right to come into our home and see if we are safely and responsibly handling our lives in any Way shape or form Not just about guns about anything now I understand if a little child's shown up to school and they're all dirty and they're sick or they're you know what I'm saying and there's some welfare question I understand that we need those programs Outside of basic things like that The government needs to stay the fuck out of everything Who the fuck are you to regulate everybody's lives think about the level of arrogance and the level of elitism That that woman possesses in her heart and mind that think she knows better than you how you should be running your life That is a fundamental problem with our government right now You these people are not the best and brightest these people happen to be the most corrupt They they give and trade and scratch my back. I'll scratch your back all the way to the top with zero integrity They're not the smart people they're not the intelligent people the smart intelligent people are out building their own lives Okay, these are fucking snake people who are going into government and then believe that they should be telling you and I how to live No Now that's little thing I want to bring up here because there's a deeper story that's going on today Um that I don't believe has been covered. We got to go back Uh and uh just a month ago a little bit over a month ago in august that was this headline I believe we covered it um and everybody talked about it. There was a massive hack That started right and it affected Microsoft a couple of other places um it was a big deal And during that uh it it it come to light that the Trump campaign was actually hacked That internal documents were leaked to the media starting in late July Um that was in august of this year um now since then it has now come out Uh headlunner reads here we go FBI announces Iranian hackers since stolen information from Trump's campaign directly to people associated with Joe Biden's campaign Okay, so this is a bombshell the article reads uh bombshell news just broke revealing how I ran is directly into fearing in the election to stop president trump From coming back into office as the associate a press reported the FBI has uncovered evidence that Iranian hackers sent the Biden campaign what they called quote unsolicited in quote Information stolen from Trump's campaign. It is unclear whether at this point Biden's campaign utilized the stolen information against Trump The emails were sent in late July and as uh in early July just weeks before Biden was forced out of the race It's part of a Democrat coup the outlet went on to say that this is the latest effort to reveal efforts regarding iran's efforts To interfere in the 2024 elections Um AP news reported on this uh headline reads Iranian hackers tried but failed to interest Biden's campaign and stolen Trump info FBI How do we know where's the proof that it is uh people from Iran You got that let me get there. Yeah, because that that's a great question. Yeah, that's a great fucking quote like who's to say It's not the FBI hacking and then saying it's around and then sending it right to Biden What was that Russia Russia Russia collusion exactly was right. Yeah, like do you really believe anything they're fucking telling you um And uh but AP news wrote this article and they say that there's no indication that any of the recipients responded official said Uh and several media organizations who have said they also were approached with stolen material did not publish it Kamala Harris's presidential campaign called the emails from Iran quote unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity That were perceived by only a few people who regarded them as spam or uh fishing attempts Um, but then in the same breath and now saying that they were never even aware of stolen Trump documents ever sent to them Doesn't make sense now here's back to your question because that is a great question Just on the base the base surface of this right you guys are expecting us to believe that the same people We're having their cell phones and pages and walkie talkies and solar panels getting blown up have the capabilities and intelligence and intelligence capabilities To hack into a national global system. There's only two there's only two countries of that capability But that's what they want us to believe. Mm-hmm Now those two countries are very specifically it's fucking the United States And it's Israel. That's right But yeah, we're supposed to believe that now Trump is pissed off about this uh he actually acts Kamala Harris when she goes before grand jury After his Iran uh spy claims um, he said quote uh When does Kamala and her campaign go before grand jury on Iran Iran Iran Restar, restar, restar, right? Trump question and all caps posted on truth social on Thursday quote my campaign Went through hell on the Russia Russia Russia hoax the big difference is that the Iran Kamala campaign corruption case is real You concluded yeah, I don't buy it. I don't either. I don't fucking buy it. I don't buy it at all I think that this is completely made up. I think that they're and I think that they are blaming Iran For the assassination attempts when they have the first assassination attempt in Butler The same day or the day I think it was the day before day after it was right in that window I can't remember exactly they put out a statement saying Iran was gonna try to assassinate Trump all right When this happened at the golf course they started saying stuff about Iran now they're saying around Haktas thing Bro, this is bullshit Okay, they fucking hacked this shit and they're saying it's Iran and that's that Iran is they're fucking writing around A motherfucking donkeys, okay? They're over there and they're they're listen This is not the most sophisticated fucking country in the world. I know That there's there's a reason why people flock from Iran. It's not because it's the best country in the world These people do not have the technical ability to do what they're doing There's only two countries that can even do that and what you said it's the fucking massage and CIA and that is it It's That's it Anybody who's been paying attention knows that too now now someone who is a you know a casual observer or a casual consumer of Political discourse or news that sounds crazy But if you're paying attention, it's very obvious and now they're playing they're playing to The uneducated voter or the uneducated observer Thinking that there's still a lot of those people out there And I actually think there's not a lot of those people out there I think a lot of people are woken up to what's actually going on and the fuckery that's happening between the agencies Trump the current administration and the media they're seeing it What do you think? Yeah, I mean do listen I think when you take again just surface level The rushery rushery rushery collusion shit the still dossier how all of that was fabricated by our own people in our own government Right Obama's signs so to deliver the fucking operation that did it yeah, right when you take into account all of that stuff I don't buy any fucking thing that any of these people say at all period Dude there's a reason Rod to Santas won't turn over this new What's his name? What's his guy's name Roth? Yeah, there's a reason to Santas won't turn Roth over to the FBI It's not because he trusts the FBI No, it's not happening these people know what's going on at this point dude guys you tell us what you guys think down in the comments Let us know That being said man, let's get to our third and final headline headline up to three This is an interesting one. Let's let's get back on the migrant topics. There's some interesting stuff that's happening But these illegal alien legal aliens um I'm gonna read this headline so I want you to read this headline. Okay, head on number three is it challenging? There yeah, listen, I Were 54 in I've been doing good you doing good. That's right Read this headline. Hello number three reads Full list of 158 Democrats who voted against sex crime ban on immigrants 158 Democrats who voted against sex crime ban on immigrants and we're supposed to believe that these people give a fuck about women They don't even know what a woman is if you ask them If you are a woman and you are voting for these people you are not paying attention They do not care. They do not they are erasing women. They are creating a fuck Bro, please read the rest before I go crazy. Oh, listen man. Like here is the truth of it How the fuck can you vote against a sex crime ban meaning they're going to Take these people and deport them for sex crimes. How can you be elected by the people and vote against this how You're voting again. So if an immigrant comes and rapes your fucking daughter. Yep They don't get deported. You can't charge them. And by the way, it doesn't get reported in the crime data And by most estimates Just alone rape in this country right now is up 40 percent That's that's not even including the migrant crime because it doesn't get reported Like when listen when when that study came out it came out last week about the actual crime versus what was being told That was without migrant data, bro. That was I got it right here hold on with second I was I was gonna post this but um I wanted to talk about it on show This is a this is this is last week Massive news the Department of Justice just released brand new crime data showing I was absolutely completely right at the debate In fact the data is even worse than we could have imagined compared to 2020 Violent crime is up nearly 40 percent rape is up 42 percent Aggravated assaults are up 55 percent violent crime with a weapon is up 56 percent violent attacks on strangers are up 61 percent Car theft is up 42 percent and the most serious forms of violent crime were up 55 percent Our cities are under siege and that does not include migrant crime and migrant rape Spree that has overtaken our cities in recent months Kamala crime is destroying America and the gangs are taking over That is a tweet from Donald Trump that I went and looked at the study that he was referring which is true And it's also true that none of that data reflects what's going on with the migrants So think how bad it really is and they're trying to convince you that it's not bad We have to understand they are not reporting crime in LA in San Francisco and Houston, New York and Chicago or New York They are not reporting crime data No, now I mean here's the good news, right the bill still passed Thanks to Republicans But more than 150 Democrats voted against Republican Representative Nancy Macy's bill that would ensure undocumented immigrants convicted of sex offenses are deported and deemed innit missable to the country The violence against women by illegal aliens act passed in a 266 to 158 vote on Wednesday every Republican present voted for the bill as did 51 Democrats will give them some credit While 158 Democrats voted against it The bill would also deport or deem innit missable to the country undocumented immigrants We've been convicted of or immense a having committed sex offenses domestic violence stalking child abuse or violating a protection order It comes as immigration is among the most important issues on the minds of voters ahead of November's election With former president Donald Trump and Republicans repeatedly claiming that president Joe Biden's immigration policies have led to a spike In violent crime by people who are in the country illegally Um Studied now they say studies have generally found no link between immigration and violent crime But that's easy to say if they're not fucking tracking it All right I'm going to should be also to no surprise that right here in Missouri Cory Bush was one of those Democrats that voted against it Um a woman in a city Uh in a position of power to not vote to protect the women in this country Um now that comes out along with this headline um this headline reads another Biden Harris border official alleges cover up Of migrant crisis these people want to protect these illegal aliens coming into our country the question should be why Why are we protecting and why are we more prone to protecting these illegal aliens than our own American citizens? Why do you think? Be or one fuck these American citizens and uh we need the votes of the uh legal aliens coming in I think there's a lot to it. I think they realize they have lost the trust and support of the American citizenship I think they realize that people are not going to vote for them and their policies and their leftists shit anymore and I think That they want the votes. Yeah, but I think I think the great replacement theory of what they're talking about replacing us With them is actually happening and and I It's happening dude. It's not I think it's fucking happening actually happening and I wanted I forgot I want to include this to men on this whole vote thing you do you want to know why you know What you want to know you want to hear why they said they didn't vote for this was a quote from one of them Here we go again debating another partisan bill that fear mongers about immigrants instead of working together to fix the immigration system Uh that's jyapal. That's what she uh wanted to say You know like so we're so it's how is that an offenseable position? I okay look Imagine this Imagine your daughter Just got raped by a migraine and Cory bush comes to your house and she says You're saying hey, what are you gonna do and she says nothing? We're not gonna do anything Well, what would you you understand that is the level of care that these motherfuckers have It's real easy to to vote But let's see them look someone in the eye who has been Had their child or been raped or been stabbed or been You know whatever by one of these migrants a sexual abuse Situation and then looking you in the eye and say we're not gonna do anything about it That is what they are saying that's what those 158 motherfuckers are saying more importantly, and we're more importantly They're gonna actively Intentionally go against how can anyone defend that in any like at all And dude, it's everywhere bro like it's everywhere But to this board board this this uh, how dude how can you how can you vote for that? I'm just being real. How can you vote for that? No idea man But but to this to this point though um The former border patrol official responsible for securing nearly one thousand miles of america's frontier has charged That the Biden Harris administration intentionally covered up the ongoing mining crisis. That's no surprise. Oh shit X San Diego sector chief agent Aaron Hettke Toad members of the house homeland security committee on Wednesday that the White House repeatedly tried to quote quiet the border border wide crisis by shielding information from the press and concealing crosses crossings by dangerous migrants with terror ties quote I had to release illegal aliens by the thousands each day into communities who could not support them testified Who retired in summer of 2023 and appeared voluntarily before the panel Quote to quiet the problem two flights a week were provided from San Diego to Texas. He explained These flights simply brought aliens that would have been released in San Diego over to Texas each flight cost approximately 150,000 dollars This was the administration's way of trying to quiet the border wide crisis. Hike emphasize Elsewhere in the testimony. Hike also said that administration officials asked him to move more than two thousand migrants apprehended in between the two US Mexico border fences spanning southern California quote out of the site of the media Uh the chief agent was all they don't have to do that because the media doesn't care. They were the big media doesn't care They were there local media my care didn't really have much hiding but uh but dude the shit everywhere There was a brothel in New York City that was just uh just rated um in a late-night raid um that was being ran by migrants traffic sex trafficking women migrant brothel that operated 24 hours a day in cd new york city quote market of sweethearts rated by cops. Yeah wherever said that this brothel was the worst of the world A democratic leader uh here i'm months already said it operates 24 hours a day But sure let's focus on you know that's not let's let's actually get on to anybody that even calls him illegal Yeah yeah that says he will keep calling Haitians legally in springfield illegal that's because they are illegal It's wordplay man. They they are illegal. They are illegally here What how can that's unarguable? They are illegally here. They're illegal immigrants and they're illegal immigrants These are illegal migrant immigrants that have to be deported they have to be Well now in good news uh mortgage rates They're gonna be dropping to the lowest uh since i'm a little bit over here ago As the feds just cut the interest rate yeah um but that's a little short that was at 50 days before the election Right, you know and there's some interesting things behind this because um and just so you guys know we like to keep the facts here Um currently now it's at 6.09% where back in January Uh of 2020 or even January of 2021 it was uh Just about two percent yeah, you know i'm saying so it's like It's a it's a common theme that they will do right they force all these problems and then 50 49 days Exactly actually or 48 days they throw you a bone to make you think everything's going great. Look how good we're doing Yeah, look how we're doing it look how good we're doing but we all know that this is political right larry coolo Uh, this is the feds 50 basis point gift to commonaharris Um, it was a 100% political act right the feds 50 basis point gift to commonah That's the subject of the rift 48 days before the election and it looks like fed chair j pal Just gave commonaharris a 50 basis point gift by slashing their target rate uh by half of 1% This may well put the central banks smack in the middle of presidential politics something they pledged not to do Right because the thing is Andy were 48 days from the election They could have held off on this and not do this because they have a meeting the day after the election where they could have put this in then Does that make sense? Yeah, so These people are intentionally they know the course they know the shit's terrible of course of course They want to fix it wait for the october surprises wait for the ship that they make up on Donald Trump next month called the october surprise You know like just wait and there'll be another hunter-by-the-laptop that comes out that gets censored and gets pretended to be that it's fake or quote-unquote misinformation this con this comment this this statement Called misinformation is the most dangerous Comment or name of anything to our to our country or republic Into the constitution Who decides what misinformation is Information is factual you don't get to decide the factual information is misinformation The facts are the fucking facts The facts come from mathematical data So if you're saying a statement based on mathematical data That are factual that is the true information and they are calling all of the factual data And the conclusions that are made from the factual data misinformation to confuse everybody and make people think that people like me and you and the people listening who are Of logic mind and can understand the meanings of data They make us feel like we're conspiracy theorists or we're threats or we're this or we're that and dude I'm fucking tired of it. I'm so tired of these people using that term Misinformation Disinformation based upon what they don't like It's what they don't like they don't like it They don't like when you say something that doesn't go along with their agenda and it's called misinformation even if it's true The term needs to be eliminated from the vocabulary It's either facts or falsehoods right it's truth or lies It's not misinformation based upon you know what John Paul Pierre or whatever name it says or what Kamala Harris says or what the media says we all know that the big media is the big media We all know these people have an agenda We have to come back to terms of what's factual data what is mathematically provable What is the actual truth and what is not the truth? Okay, and it's not based on opinion. It's based on data That's real man guys jumping on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always We have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where we bring a headline and we talk about it and get one of those two options So that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads 12-year-old boy fatally shoots black bear maulding his dad during hunt in Wisconsin Yeah, I probably try to rest him for not having tagged You know Yeah No, they're good man a 12-year-old boy shot and killed a wounded black bear as it was mauling his father near their hunting cabin in the thick Western Wisconsin woods Ryan Behrman 43 told the Minnesota star Tribune that he was pinned beneath the 200 pound brewing on September 6th When his son Owen fired a shot from the boy's hunting rifle quote Owen was a hero he shot that bear and killed it on top of me Said Behrman who suffered bites to his forehead arm and leg He also needed stitches to reattach a flap of skin on his cheek that was ripped during the attack check this clip up So this is my first year. I killed it with a crossbow foreign avid outdoorsman like Owen Byerman Every mouth is memorable This one I also got with the crossbow just as much as the time dad Ryan gets to spend with his son Being out in nature. I love it except their last hunt together. Maybe the hardest of all To beat he was just he was trying to live and I was trying to live at that point Ryan remembers the 200 pound black bear not 10 feet from him and I looked down and I see Teeth and claws coming at my face and all Ryan could rely on Was his empty pistol or so he thought it was holding the gun like this and hitting strike in the bear That's when he let go of my leg and moved my face And I remember Here in the first bite it was like a crunch fighting suit and I heard heard the shot and I felt the bear's weight shift to my left side and Just shove them off me and it wasn't Ryan's gun Didn't think twice had you shot it It was Owen making the miraculous shot. There's a picture from a couple days later his dad wounded but alive He performed under pressure that a lot of people wouldn't perform under around 200 Owen had hunted bear before but this time he missed injuring the animal that then took off the two trying to find it later Leading to that faithful encounter A story much like the bear is now frozen in time if we do a full body probably find somewhere downstairs The next mount is another memory these two won't soon forget that'll be the most memorable moment in the house I Should crazy man. Yeah, fuck you got him too, huh? No, he did man. Yeah didn't hesitate to shoot that black. That's good good on that dude. There was black I didn't hesitate I don't know what you're talking about.

I think that's pretty fucking cool though. I dude You did what he had to do. Hey man, and without hesitating. I tell you this if a bear comes up on me black or brown I'm getting it. Yeah, white too, right? Polar bears. They don't let it come over here. Well, yeah, but if they did If they did They eat your mayonnaise Oh All the reasons yeah, and then potato salad Hmm maybe doing the work the wiki boogie All right I think that's fucking I agree that's gonna be a damn good story that like lives in that family.
