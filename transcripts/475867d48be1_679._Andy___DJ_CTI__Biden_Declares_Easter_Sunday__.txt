Lot of great, a lot of interesting stuff happening. It's an interesting Monday, man. It is an interesting Monday, but we got some shit to debrief. All right. We'll say that. We'll call it that. Yeah, how was your Easter? Easter was good, man. Easter was good. Dude, I was fucking exhausted by like five. Dude, I was too exhausted. And I don't know if it was like the heat or like, I mean, because fuck, it was nice. Yeah, it was nice, man. But like, you know, we got up, we did church, did the Easter service and stuff. And then it was like fucking family shuffling. Like it was fucking high. It was in South City, the North County. I'm like, dude, by five o'clock, I was cooked. I don't do that shit anymore. It's hard. That family shuffles shit. No, I do this hard. I can't do that. It's hard. Guys want to come to my house, you're welcome. Yeah, just pull up. Yeah. It's all good. Yeah. I was your one, everything was good? Yeah, it was great. Yeah. Yeah, but I do. I don't know what it was. Dude, man, I cooked. I was cooked, bro. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, well, we got some shit. All right, let's get into it. Got some shit, guys. Pay the fee. Yeah, don't be a hell. Try the show. Let's get into it. Let's start off. You know, we did this, something like two episodes ago. We had the dumb ass of the day. Well, this one's plural. Dumb asses. Dumb asses. They themselves. And I just thought this was absolutely gold here. I'm not sure if you guys saw this headline, but Hedlon reads, Florida transplants fleeing in droves over relentless heat damaging hurricanes. So now there is a mass exodus of all the motherfuckers that left handle it. They can't handle it. They can't handle it. But it's actually a little deeper. It's not even just the weather that people are complaining about. Let's dive into this a little bit. This is a New York Post article reading, the grass is apparently not greener in Florida. This is a Florida transplants who moved to the sunshine state during the pandemic are packing up to move elsewhere, complaining of the relentless heat damaging hurricanes and dangerous wildlife more than 700,000 people drawn by the promise of sunny weather. No income tax and lower cost moved to Florida in 2022, including 90,000 from New York state, according to census data cited by NBC News. Nearly 500,000 gave up on Florida and left in 2022, according to NBC News, which interviewed several disillusioned transplants who decided to head back north. One of them was New Yorker Lewis Rackowitz, who lasted two years in the state, quote, like every good New Yorker, this is where you want to go. The physician told NBC News by phone while driving to his new home in Charlotte, North Carolina. Quote, it's a complete fallacy. Rackowitz said he and his wife bought a home in the West Palm Beach area where they decided to pursue a more relaxing affordable life. He landed a job as an emergency care doctor and his wife became a teacher. But Rackowitz soon realized it made a mistake. This is quote, I had a good salary, but we were barely making ends meet. We had zero quality of life he told the news outlet. The doc said the commute was a nightmare. The cost of their home owners association fees had doubled. And he felt unsafe after the state passed a law allowing people to carry a gun to carry guns without a license. Quote, everyone is walking around with guns there. He told NBC News, I consider myself a conservative guy. But if you want to carry a gun, you should be licensed. There should be some sort of process. So everybody's leaving. What do you got on that? Good. That's guns, Andy. Yeah, man. That's why there ain't no fucking shit. You know what I'm saying? I don't know how hard it is for these people to really get it. These people, when it comes to guns, their logic is so freaking flawed. Like, criminals carry guns. Do you think they get a permit? I have licenses. Yeah. So you got a criminal, you got criminal license. I got a regular person license. Like, how fucking stupid and delusional can you be? You know what I'm saying? Like, these people that try to eliminate guns, you're not going to eliminate criminals from having guns. Just like in Europe where they've eliminated guns and you know what they do now. They stab. They stab. Okay, criminals, criminals by definition do not operate within the boundaries of the law, genius. And for you, and another thing, you're a doctor. You're moving to West Palm. That's where billionaires live. You're a broke mother fucker, bro. You can't afford to live there. Okay. Live within your means. You're probably not made for West Palm. We're real estate's $50 fucking million. Right. All right. On a doctor's salary. Well, I mean, adjust that too though. It's not like it's just everything's just more expensive in fucking Florida. That's everywhere. Well, yeah. And it's because people are dumb as fuck. And they don't they vote for things that are below the line as if they are above the line. This is what happens when you vote for things like social initiatives and abortion and all these things. This is what happens. Everybody should be voting for the economy and for the safety of their cities. Those are the two biggest, you know, issues that affect them the most. That's it. And this dude here, Sionara, no one cares. He's out to fuck out. I'm sure the people of Florida are pouring some out for other homies. You know what I'm saying? Like, dude, Florida's Florida is a lot like Missouri, dude. Like it's just different. It's like Missouri with a beach. Yeah. Like if you come here and you bring your bullshit here, nobody's going to like you. And you're a conservative guy, but you can't understand how someone can want to carry a gun without a license. Bro, criminals do it all day long, man. This is what I'm talking about though when we talk about like the like when we talk about privilege, that's pretty good. These people have privilege because they've never had to be in contact with any sort of criminal element. So they can't comprehend in their head that like fuck. It's probably better that I carry a gun and it's better that that guy has a gun and that guy has a gun because there's trust in community. How many times do you see can seal carry people just whip out their gun and start shooting people or pro two A advocates? They don't do it. Now if someone starts doing some shit, they'll shoot those people and that never makes the news. They don't put that on the news. But yeah, man, Charlotte's probably a good place for you. It's probably better than Florida. Florida's a little wild for you. Pussies. You know what I'm saying? So, you know, Charlotte, you know, according to D.T. Charlotte, you know, it was good people there. Who? Charlotte North Carolina. Charlotte's cool. Wouldn't that Charlotte or the Charlotte? Charlotte'sville. Charlotte'sville. Yeah. I digress. It's just, it's one fifth the fucking cost of West Palm. I know shit. Yeah. Dude, West Palm's like the Palm Beach is like one of the most expensive places. If not the most expensive place in the country right now. Oh, yeah. And you're a doctor, dude. Yeah. Like, I know you're a big deal where you come from a shit. But in big, in big boy game, doctors don't make that much money. Not. Unless they even have 100 practices or you know what I'm saying? Right, right, right, right. Not enough to live that lifestyle. That's one point. Yeah, that's a different lifestyle down there. Yeah, I just saw that man. I thought that was interesting. No, everybody's playing that fucking reverse in no card right now. I thought that was good. Yeah, I mean, maybe the real estate come down a little bit. You know what I'm saying? Michael, buy that. Yeah. I love it, man. Well, guys, let's get into our headlines. Remember, if you guys want to. Oh my god, he's got fucking guns in his pants. He's got a gun in his pants. It's not a gun. Yeah. He's just happy to see you. That's a weapon of mass destruction. All right. I guarantee you he did. Like I guarantee you he probably waited a year. He didn't even change his license plate. Huh? We just go back to New York. Yeah, he's trying to convert. These people come to Texas and they come to fucking Florida. They buy all the car heart. They buy all the dude. For real, they go to Tennessee, like all my buddies in Nashville are like, what the fuck? Yeah. And you all fucking idiots go there and you vote the same way, not realizing that the shit you believed in is what caused you to leave. Yeah, well, man. Oh, man. I'm just glad I'm glad nobody comes to Missouri. That's what I don't come here. Missouri is like a hidden paradise. But no, no one comes here. No one wants to be here. When people come visit, they're like, why do you live here? And I don't say shit because I want them to think that. Mm-hmm. Do not come here. No, don't come here. We like it here. Fuck off. Well, guys, let's get into these headlines. Remember, if you guys want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to AndyFrasseller.com. You guys can find them linked there. With that being said, let's get into our first one. Coming off the Easter day weekend, I'm sure everybody saw it. It was a big deal all across the, all across the country, pissed off a lot of people. Joe Biden declared Easter Sunday transgender day of visibility. Now, there's been some updates with this. Yeah. But I thought we're pretty interesting. Yeah, there's a lot of interesting topics here on this. Even, you know, I'll let you get that. Yeah. Let's just get in the fucking jujus. Yeah. Yeah. Let's dive into this. This is a bright bar article reading, President Joe Biden's White House has declared the holiest of Christian holidays, quote, transgender day of visibility, in quote, announcing that transgender Americans are part of the fabric of our nation, the gafed part of the nation. They're that part. It's like unraveling the rivet on the fabric. There's like a terror. Biden issued an official proclamation on Good Friday reading, quote, we honor the extraordinary courage and contributions of transgender Americans and reaffirm our nation's commitment to forming a more perfect union where all people are created equal and treated equally throughout their lives. The official proclamation continued, quote, now, therefore, I, Joseph, are by junior president of the United States of America by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States. Do hereby proclaim watch 31st, 2024 as transgender day of visibility. I call upon all Americans to join us and lifting up the lives and voices of transgender people throughout our nation and to work toward eliminating violence and discrimination based on gender, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, identities, excuse me. Biden's chosen day for the inaugural celebration is Easter Sunday, a day on which Christians, including Biden, who discusses his Catholic faith, often celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Now, listen, I'm not one to tempt God, like I don't, you know, you have to be careful with that stuff, right? And I don't know how many people out there are religious. That's precisely the point, but it is interesting that you know, when they, you know, the day that they do the Easter egg hunting, all of that stuff at the White House, it was a bunch of lightning and storms all across and they got delayed like two hours before they could even do anything. So the start of the traditional Easter rogue, Easter egg roll at the White Jail, yeah, kind of egg rolls that Asian mix in there. I think little Tariaki in there, but it was delayed for the egg rolls, bro. Egg rolls are good. They're the shit. They are good. So one good thing, come out of China. I don't even think that's a chicken. Pot stickers and egg rolls. I don't think that's all American Chinese Americans are cool though, because they fucking all like China either. No, that's real. Only know we like to eat. Yeah, they're egg rolls. The start of the traditional Easter egg roll at the White House was delayed for 90 minutes on Monday as angry storm clouds delivered thunder lightning and a dusting of light rain on the assembled gas. Here's a video clip of it. Yeah. She that looks like my house. It does actually does. You got caught out by the DC Archbishop and DC, the Catholic Archbishop, he got caught out as a cafeteria Catholic, his official statement said, quote, I would say that he's very sincere about his faith, but like a number of Catholics, he picks and chooses dimensions of the faith to highlight while ignoring or even contradicting other parts, Gregory replied, there's a phrase that we have used in the past, a cafeteria Catholic, you choose that, which is attractive and to dismiss that, which is challenging. But the biggest weird is not weird, it makes sense. Apparently now Biden, Biden saying he didn't even do that. Did you see that? I did, but I didn't know if that was true. Oh, it's real. Yeah, it's absolutely real. Uh, he apparently, this is a tweet from Philip, uh, Malin Thon, Wegman, he says, quote, I didn't do that. Biden said, uh, when asked about proclaiming Easter Sunday, trans day of visibility, I asked about Speaker Johnson's claim. Otherwise, the president replied, quote, he's thoroughly uninformed. Yeah, he didn't do that. He didn't do it. There's a fucking tweet. He didn't do it. So just more lion Andy, let's get some juice on this. Well, first of all, this started in 2009. Okay. So like everybody saying that it was, you know, it's this thing that he just made up, it's not. It's been going on since 2009 and Easter moves every single year. It just so happens that Easter falls on this date this year. And that makes you question why make such an official proclamation, right? And when I break this down in my head, that's just more demoralization. That's part of the communist revolution that's happening in the country right now. The next step after that is destabilization, which is what we're seeing with the migrant crisis. The crime, the inflation, the next step after that is crisis. And the next step after that is normalization. So I believe they're running straight down the pipe of a communist takeover in this country. And this is just part of the demoralization, along with his part saying, I didn't do that. Like that's clearly a lie. And what they're doing is flexing on America saying, hey, I could say whatever I want. I can do whatever I want. And there's nothing I you could do about it. These people are hostile towards the American people. And there's yeah, there's people that are with them no matter what. But that's a small minority. And the more that they do this, the more they push everybody away from them. And I still think this goes along with the idea of them trying to get people so aggravated and so pissed off that they either join or give up trying or they give violent. And these people are able to crush some sort of violent revolution attempt. Like they claimed January 6th was right. Because if they can get people to organize and be violent, there's a good chance that they can kill all the main leaders in one stop. You know, if you got if you got 50,000 people or 100,000 people or a million people get together once against these people and they just drone strike these people, they don't have any resistance left. And all the people who weren't there would say, great job. You did it. You saved America. And that would be the narrative that they would they would run. They would run. Yeah. So I think they're trying to either get people to totally quit trying because it's, you know, quote unquote, hopeless in regards to having any accountability for these people. You know, and that's that's what we see with Biden straight up denying it like that when he just tweeted it the day before two days before that. Actually yesterday tweeted it and today saying it didn't do it. So like that's what I see there. I see them. I see demoralization and it doesn't matter what I say or do you can't do anything about it. Yeah, so what you're saying is like just to make just just to clear this up. So, you know, Easter does change every single year. The date of Easter changes, right? Right. And so you're saying that this trans day of visibility, this has been a thing. Yes. The last since 2009. 15 plus years. Yeah. And so but one thing that I think it's important for people to point out is that these tyrants, they will use any any type of advantage to push that demoralization. For sure. So, okay, cool. Yeah, Easter fall. Oh, this is perfect. Yeah, let's make a proclamation. Push the proclamation. Yeah, let's let's let's stir up the horn's nest. Yeah, because I mean, do like, like listen, at the end of the day, the vast majority of Americans are Christian. Yeah, vast majority. 70% of America believes that. Yeah, and this Easter is the day that, you know, Jesus rose from the dead. And so it's like, when you have an opportunity to shit on the majority of the country as a tyrant, you're going to do it. Well, you know, dude, I also think that this is a play to try and get violence going against the transgender community, you know, all eight of them. Well, you know, what dude, real talk. I'm fucking sick of the visibility and the 50 plus holidays they all get, you know, it's like three months. Bro, I'm fucking tired of it. And so is everybody else. We get a force down our throat in every single fucking direction we look. You know, you all don't need any more visibility. You need to shut the fuck up. That's what you need to do. You need to shut the fuck up and people will leave you to fuck alone. Stay away from kids. People will leave you alone. Stop this crazy shit. People will leave you alone. Jamming your fucking shit down. Everybody's throat at every fucking point is only going to create more problems for you. You're not going to be left alone or live in harmony or be respected or be treated with dignity because you're not treating anybody else with respect and dignity. You're not respecting anybody else's viewpoints. You're having to shove your lifestyle down. Everybody's fucking throat. And if you don't, if they don't like it, they're a racist. They're a bigot. They're a this. They're a that. They're a this. How about this? Fuck off. How about that? Yeah. It makes sense to me, man. Yeah. I mean, and here's the thing. They're like the visibility that they're begging for. They're going to get it. It just won't be the one that they want. Well, leave people alone. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, jumping on this conversation down in the comments, let us know what you guys think. Speaking of comments, let's go cruise on. This comment comes from at Megan Hines, 4167, she says. Had better results from 75 heart than three years of VA quote on quote therapy and 14 pages worth of meds. Thank you for bringing awareness to this topic. People really love that episode. With Chris with Dr. Chris. Yeah. Yeah, that was a fun time, dude. You guys should all get his book, man, operate your syndrome. Yeah, for sure. He's awesome, dude. I guess we take this to what other, what, oh, we got a drop. Yeah, coming this way. Yeah, we do Wednesday, right? Yeah, got a drop time. Time is it seven, seven central? Yeah, seven PM since. For those of you guys who are looking for real American freedom gear, we do have a drop this Wednesday night, seven PM central time. So yeah, drop it like it's hot, baby.

Guys, we appreciate all of your love and support. Thank you guys for continuing to be real last fans. Without being said, let's get into headline number two. This is a little update from a few months ago that I've been trying to keep tabs on. Do you remember when everybody's phones were shit? Everyday? No, like the actual cell service was shit. Yeah, like every day. Yeah, well, I mean, I guess that's it. You mean like how phones make apples one of the most valuable companies in the world selling a product doesn't even fucking work right? Yeah, yeah, like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But specifically, AT&T, remember when they had that massive outage? Yeah, okay, massive update comes up. headline number two reads, massive data breach. AT&T confirms personal information, including social security numbers of 73 million current and former customers leaked on the dark web. Wow, this is interesting. Let's dive into this. AT&T has confirmed that a data set containing AT&T specific information was leaked on the dark web around two weeks ago. The communications giant is currently investigating to pinpoint whether the data originated directly from AT&T or through one of their vendors. Now, this data set notably includes sensitive personal details, such as social security numbers, though the exact source remains under review. Following the discovery, AT&T has initiated a comprehensive probe, marshalling both in-house and third-party cybersecurity experts. preliminary findings suggest that it compromised data dates back to 2019 or earlier. The breach potentially affects approximately 7.6 million current and around 64.4 million former AT&T account holders, despite the severity of the attack. AT&T has stated there's no evidence. This is just an unauthorized breach of their system leading to the leak. This was their official statement. Now, mind you, so this happened back in February. Okay, we're in the tape will first today. And they're just now starting to come out and talk about it. Now, I remember seeing this thing where they gave all the users that were affected by the data outage like a $5 credit. They did, huh? That's what they gave us. Very generous. Very, very fucking generous. And so now, with this coming out and they're admitting that, yeah, this was actually, this wasn't attacked. They're still not saying who they know who. We're not saying who. And now they're saying that you should just take extra precautions. And if you notice any weird actions or things happening in reference to your credit or anything like that, that you should take the proper precautions and make those notifications. Anything on this? I know it pissed off a lot of black people. Did it? Well, black people, phone bills are highest shit. I don't know why I don't know. Why people's phone bills are high shit? No, I'm telling you, it's not the same. It's not the fucking same. I don't know why you're saying that phone bills are racist. They are a little racist. I'm going to be honest. But I'm like, how much you pay if you're a phone bill? How many lines you got? You got two lines? How much you pay? Okay. I got two lines. My shit's like 300. That's, well, clearly racism. It's racism, but black people are pissed. Black people are pissed and they gave them five bucks. I wouldn't know about that. What's your phone bill, Andy? You don't know. You don't know. My fuck, I don't pay bills. My bills just get paid. That's what it is. Yeah, that's what it is. Let's talk about from, because either the day at the heart, you're entrepreneur, right? Yeah. Let's talk about doing the right thing as a business, man. Let's go down that rabbit hole. What do they do wrong? What do they do right? I don't know, bro. I mean, this is a much bigger problem than just your phone not working. You know, like when you have social security numbers and stolen identity and bank accounts breached and, you know, messages and all the private emails and all this shit, you know, I mean, that creates a, that creates a problem not just for now, but for who knows how long. And so, you know, I don't know what the right move is here, but I know this. People should be very careful about what they keep on their phone. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's real. And five bucks ain't fixed. And using the cloud too. Like the clouds are not a safe place to use your shit. Like you guys don't think that's the case. Secure, huh? You don't like the cloud. Fuck no, bro. Yeah. I know too many people that have had all the shit stolen off of it. Yeah. You know, like that's, I don't use it. You know, I'd rather just go plug my shit in the my computer and let it take fucking two days. Yeah. Because I mean, you got the original Mac up there. I know. Yeah. My fucker, I got the dudes that made the Mac up there. Steve? Steve? They're out there cracking away. Churning butter. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I just saw this man. I thought this was interesting. We're timing to bring in this up. The finally addressing. Well, I'm pretty sure black people don't pay more money for this phone. No, no, it's a fact. No, no, no, it's, I don't know why. I mean, listen, it's probably because they got all the fucking cousins on there. That's possible. It's a fact, huh? Oh, bro, let us know in the comments. That's a fact. Let us go to the comments. Let the people decide. We might the fact check that. Bro, I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm not saying, no, what I'm saying is, is that like the phone bills are probably higher because they have all their cousins that shit on the same account. You know what I'm saying? Like they got a little cousin Ray Ray. They got to do that. I don't got a cousin Ray. Well, that's what I'm saying. So like that's probably why. Yeah. I mean, I guess yeah, if you got more shit on there, probably paying more. That makes sense. If I had a cousin Ray Ray, he wouldn't be on my phone. Yeah. I tell Ray Ray, you get fucking job. Maybe that would help with the phone bill. Yeah, but the fourth line is like 25. It's like, it's like, it's almost free. That's not almost free. Yeah, that's true. That's that's $25. Yeah. See, I think the problem is, we're counting kind of funny. You know what I'm saying? That's a weird way to count. Almost free is not an actual thing. Well, listen, that's just how we look at shit, man. I'm like, oh, it's normally $100. And that's almost free. They listen, these are the secrets. All right. I'm just telling you what they are. Secrets to poverty. I mean, this sounds like the most ridiculous shit I've ever heard in my life. Well, hey, listen, I didn't make the rules, bro. All right. But we definitely ain't playing a bio. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this conversation, man. Let us know down in the comments. What you guys think? That being said, let's get to our third and final headline. Hell, number three. This one is great. This just comes out of Denver, Denver, Colorado. Let's tell our reads. Denver City official caught on camera begging migrants to leave. What? Wait, head to Chicago, New York City going to suffer. This is great. This is great. Let's dive into this. So a Denver City official appeared to beg migrants to leave the sanctuary city. That's been burdened with the legal immigrants in a leaked viral video. In a video obtained by nine news, City official, Andres Carrera, Denver's newcomer communications liaison tells a group of migrants that the city's shelters can no longer help them. And they must go to other sanctuary cities or they will suffer. Quote, the opportunities are over. Carrera reportedly tells the group in Spanish. Quote, New York gives you more. Chicago gives you more. So I suggest you go there where there is longer term shelter. There are also more job opportunities there. Quote, we are not going to block you if you want to stay here, he continues. Quote, if you stay here, you are going to suffer even more and I don't want to see this. While the city officials suggested New York, Chicago or Miami as destinations with more resources, he offered to transport them to any city they wished in the United States. Quote, you don't have to walk anywhere. We can buy you a free ticket. See there is here. Is he black? He must be fucking black. Buy you a free ticket. What kind of fucking economic... What is that? I don't know, but okay. You thought it was bullshit, that's real shit. And it's BIPOC. That's what it is. He says, quote, You can go to any city we can take you up to the Canadian border wherever. And of course, we have the video. But a city spokesperson, they reached out to nine news. They reached out to nine news that they will not bus migrants to Canada but can take them to cities near the Canadian border if they desire. After his speech, Carrera asked the migrants to raise their hand if they wanted to leave Denver and go to another city where there is more work. The video appeared to show a handful of people raising their hands. Here's the clip. The opportunities are over. That's Andrés Carrera, political director for Denver Mayor Mike Johnston. Carrera is Denver's so-called newcomer communications liaison. That means that he meets the busloads of new arrivals. The city says this group got here on March 26, sent up by Texas's Republican governor, Greg Abbott. He warns them the jobs, the resources, the opportunities have already gone to the 40,000 migrants who came to Denver before them. I'm here to help you. I'm here to warn you that your path has not been finished. If you end up here, you will suffer even more. And I want to see this. Parents listen quietly as children play on the floor. As Denver tells these families that have sometimes walked from one continent to another that they just have to keep moving, that they don't have to walk. Denver will buy them a bus ticket. The city says it won't buy bus tickets to Canada, but it will help migrants get to American border cities up north. It's a desperate pitch by Denver, a city that is taken in more migrants per capita than any city outside the southern border, and is looking at $120 million in budget cuts to pay for migrant service. The city says it won't buy bus tickets to Canada, but it will help migrants get to American border cities up north. And the budget cuts to pay for migrant services. The moment of truth, who in the crowd wants to go to a different city, and who wants to stay in Denver. Doros, a migrant says, everywhere. The clock is now ticking for the migrants who arrived on that bus. have six weeks in Denver shelters and then they must go. Individuals get 14 days in shelter. As they were warned, after that, there may not be resources to help them. This was a spokesperson for the city argued that the video did not show a complete picture of the efforts Denver has made to help migrants. Quote, this news clip showed such a small part of the work our team member did that evening. And just a fraction of the tireless amount of work he and the rest of the city's team have put in to help newcomers who arrive in Denver, the spokesperson said in the statement. So yeah, so they're up about 40,000. They're calling them newcomers, legal aliens. And that's 5.6% of Denver's population, which is the most per capita of any city in the country. But how do we get there? Right? Well, we got to go back. We ain't got to go back far, ain't he just a few months. All right, coming straight out of Denver. How Denver became a destination for migrants? Well, before you even get into this, I can tell you how we got a bunch of liberal fucking dumbasses that live in Colorado that fucking think that everything sounds good and they don't have to do anything. And you know, I got a big bleeding heart for these families and these people and they can come here. And then when they come there, they don't want to take any personal responsibility for actually helping them. So now you have families with little kids and little children because you wanted to be virtuous and brag about how nice you are and how cool you are and not live to fucking finger to actually make a real difference. Okay? So now they're stranded here without works, without jobs, without a way to fucking take care of their kids and their families because you wanted to sound cool on the internet and be cool in front of your hippie fucking buddies. That's why they're there. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean to the point where they sounded it into a bill. Yeah, to the point where their Denver police chief said they're not even going to work on deporting them or reporting anybody to ice. Yeah. Look what you got to deal with now. Yeah, that's right. And people in Denver and Colorado are pissed off where I know a whole bunch of people live there. They fucking hate it. Yeah. You know, and it was a beautiful city, right? Colorado is one of the most beautiful states in the whole country, dude. Yeah. But it attracts these mindless, nomad, hippie, vanilla people. Okay? For real. Yeah. That that that have come from a privileged place in life. They're usually white. They're usually middle upper class and they go there and they say, who cares? What differences have made to you? You're just a Trump supporting bigot. You know, and all they do up there is go on ski patrol and smoke fucking weed, which I don't got a problem. That sounds you bad. But they don't have any real responsibility. They travel around. They ride their mountain bikes. They fucking, you know, do all the hippie shit. And then they vote for this shit and they don't do anything. They're personally about it. It's just so they can look cool amongst their other hippie buddies. And now you got a real problem where people are really suffering. And you know, those people aren't going to do anything. They're going to keep voting for the stupid idealistic shit that doesn't work in reality ever. It never works. It never works. Well, that's a thing, man. It's like, you know, you're talking $120 million for like a city like Denver. It's not that big. I'm not there's not that many people that live there. But that's a shit ton of money that's coming from taxpayers that that are now having to be completely redirected and shit is getting cut. That's always been my biggest issue with like liberal ideologies, bro. Like the shit sounds good on paper. That's that's why that's why it sounds for it. Yeah, it sounds good, but it doesn't work. Dude, that's why people vote for it. People vote for it because they are too lazy to dig in and understand what's actually going on. And they vote for these things that sound really nice and sound really humanitarian and make you feel like a good person when you vote for them that are outside the realm of reality. And then when you operate in reality and all these people come and they cut all the budget, now you have crime, now you have a shitty city, which was once a beautiful city. You have litter everywhere. You have trash everywhere. You have all these people that are homeless and all the people who voted for it, they're not doing anything to help. They're not working in your heart. They're not doing they're not doing anything. They don't care. They don't listen, dude. The the leftist voter is the most uneducated voter on the planet because, bro, they vote on their heart and they it's very easy to get them to come and they're not bad people. Now communists are bad people, but the the regular left liberal voter, they're not bad people. They just have this bleeding heart mentality that doesn't work in reality and they create so much more issues in reality for other people in themselves because they vote for things that do not connect and do not practically work. And they don't have any experience with anything that practically works because they haven't done anything in their life. There's no awareness. Yeah, so like, dude, that's what we deal with here. And you know, there's all kinds of people who have worked hard to build Denver into an amazing city, which it has been for years and years and years. And now it's getting destroyed because, you know, the conservative voters even got too liberal, where they got to the point where they were like, ah, just let them do whatever they want. It's no big deal. Well, do you really still think that this is what happens when you just say, ah, whatever, living that live. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man. I mean, these people, listen, dude, it's sad what's going on. These people got to go though. That's reality. They got to go. So I'm the old. Yeah. No shit. Yeah. And I think we as society got to stop listening to all these granola people. Yeah. And these hippie fox who don't have any understanding of reality. And when they start on their high horse and trying to preach, do you tell them to shut the fuck up? Like we tried it your way, motherfucker. Look, we got it. It didn't work. It doesn't ever work. Didn't worry. It's not that we didn't do it. And then they say, oh, well, you have plenty. You should have motherfucker. That wasn't the dream. The dream was I could do whatever the fuck I wanted and build whatever I wanted. The dream wasn't work my ass off. So you could go smoke weed on the fucking mountain side and be one with nature. Yeah. It's in what's it called? Well, you could vote away my fucking tax dollars to these people who don't even belong here. That wasn't the deal. That's not the American dream. That's bullshit. Fuck you. Yeah. Fucking some bathing the buttholes. Bro, I don't even go to Colorado anymore because of it. It's like on the list of count with California to me. Last time I went there, it was so like it was so intolerable. The attitude. It was just, it was gross, dude. Mm hmm. That sucks. Yeah. That's so. And I love Colorado. I love it. That sucks, man. Well, guys, jump in on this conversation. I just know what you guys think. What's happening in your sanctuary cities? If you guys live there, I'm sure we got a few listeners. Well, did you see what happened in Georgia? With what? With the sanctuary cities? They fucking banned sanctuary cities in Georgia. And they said any city that becomes a sanctuary city will lose their state funding. Oh, that's great. Completely. Yeah. So that's that's happening in Georgia. So that's great. We're going to see that start to happen in other places. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, and here's the thing to guys, it's like, I mean, we are far away from them at this tunnel. Like, you know, I'm saying like, the consequences, like the damages that have that have started and have been put in place. We haven't even seen the fucking repercussions. They're not even reporting the full scope or even close to the full scope of the amount of crime these people are committing. Like that one squatter story that we covered, there's hundreds of those happening right now. Thousands. Yeah. Thousands. Yeah. Guys, jump into the comments. Let us know what you guys think. With that being said, our final segment of the show, thumbs up and dumb as fuck. This is a good one because it's karma. And we always like karma. Thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads, kayaking Karen gets instant karma. Woman launches foul mouth rant at family during riverboat trip. Then capsizes as she tries to splash them with her or this is just great. So this is the moment that kayaking Karen got instant karma. Benny Larkin and his daughter Taylor Larkin 14 were boating down Dora Creek, New South Wells, Australia when they broke down and were approached by a Mrs. and know it all kayaker. The 33 year old says the boat engine stopped working while they slowed down to meet the four not speed limit, but he quickly realized the enraged lady, thought he had broken the rules. Footage shows Benny calling the kayaker a Karen, so she addresses the camera to claim this cock sucker was doing 24 knots up the creek. Now when Benny acts the five mouth woman, if she talks to her mother like this and she replies, my mother knows how to fucking drive a boat better than you. She kayaks closest to the vessel and tries to splash him with her or but instead hilariously capsizes her kayaker falls into the water. Here's the clip. I just like to do the right thing and when he comes through, take him down every one of them. Chris is better to take the final way from every. Oh, that's it. Oh, I forgot that. Oh, did. What'd she say? Oh, you got that. So this is the whole rate. There we go. I like guys just letting you know that this is how cool. Sucker was doing 24 knots up the creek. Was it 24? Where's your radar? Where's my radar? Everyone was clocking. Where's your radar? I don't need a clock. Come on, my. You said 24. 24. 24? I'm on 24 knots. I'm sorry. You can do more than four knots up there. And how much is that? Four knots. You don't need any more losses. Which how many knots will I do? It's four knots up there. You said all the time. 24. How many knots? I have t 4 5 5 in. You're reported. Happy New Year. I hope you know what it's going to license too. She's on record. You can't do that speed. You've got no life. Okay, fair enough?
