You know I think everybody listening they know that I don't have a good experience with the pools. Yeah. So I haven't been doing that. But I've been doing something else. What's that? Down in my basement man. I sent you some pictures. Yeah. I've been doing some work man. Yeah you're like making your little cabinet. Yeah. It's clean too. Yeah it looks good dude. You inspired me man. How so. Because you redid the the bar line. I didn't read it. I paid it. Yeah. I mean that the rule of life you know how to do something or have enough money to have somebody else do it. Yeah. That's like the rule of life. Yeah. You know and I'm gonna do it and I fucking love that shit. And well yes I've been down on the basement man doing some work. Well Bob the builder. How is that you're like man came down there. What is that? No I don't I have one room in the house. Yeah I know. And that's just like that's it. Yeah. And that wasn't it. No. Okay. Yeah. So that is not your room. It's not my. All right. That's Alex. Everything else is Alex and the girls man. Yeah. But no man we were like doing some some funks. Way work in the basement. You know trying to just get it all right. Because both like listen the problem with kids man. I'm gonna say it because I know nobody else will. Kids have too much shit. That's the problem. Yeah. It's fucking every way you step. Yeah. You're stuck in bars and shit. I do it's terrible. Yeah. You're a step on a fucking Lego. Not shit. Like I'm sure I'll get there. That's the worst. But they got too much shit man. So we've been like trying to like funks way the basement out. You know like to make it a little bit better of a setup. And we have this like deep like corner in bed or whatever. And I'm like we got to put something here. And yeah man so I've been grinding man. Good. Been grinding. It looks good. It's nice to like do some shit with your hands. Yeah. For sure. This makes me feel manly. You know. Very manly. Yeah man that's that's about it man. It's Monday. Let's get to it. Yeah. We got three good ones for you guys always. So with that being said, Andy, guys question number one, Andy. I think I have been struggling with setting big enough goals. This year I set a goal to my business to do 100K in revenue. And we are going to do over 300K. I am looking to the new year and looking at setting goals. And I think I might be afraid to set even bigger goals because I don't want to fall short. Where do you find the line between setting a large goal and being realistic? It's not that I don't have dreams of the biggest goals. I just don't like falling short. I didn't do this, Andy. First of all it depends on how big you want to go. Okay. If you want to be big, you want to build a big life, you want to be mega successful. You got to have big goals. And the thing about big goals that aren't realistic is that big goals inspire big actions which produce big results. And realistic goals inspire realistic actions which produce regular realistic results. So it really doesn't matter how you set your goals but you need to understand how this works. A lot of people they want to hit their goal and they want to say, oh, I lost five pounds or I made a hundred thousand dollars. And that's fine. But the truth of the matter is the highest achieving people, they are resetting the bar for their goals before they even achieved the goal. I can't tell you the last time I achieved quote unquote a goal and was like, man, this is great. I hit my goal. That's not how high level high achieving individuals think. They set a massive goal. And then when they realize that they're going to hit the goal, they get close to it. And then they raise the bar again. So it's like you never actually end up hitting the goal, but you move past it every time. And that's how championship people think. That's how high level people think. And we have all these people out in the world who really haven't accomplished a mother fucking thing telling everybody, oh, you got to set realistic goals and take small little actions. And you know, you got to they don't understand it because they never built anything of any sizeable nature. If you want to be excellent and you want to build something huge and you want to have a big life and you want to make a lot of money and you want to kick ass, you better set some big fucking goals and follow it up with some big fucking actions. Because you're not going to ever set realistic goals and then have the tiny little realistic actions produce the result that you're trying to get. And I know a lot of people try to block this out along the way. And they try to say, well, this is a little milestone. And that's my next goal. And this is a little milestone. And that's my next goal. And that's fine. Except the actions that are taken in those little steps are always little. They're not massive. And we're capable of producing massive action and building massive results like dude, it's not that much harder to take action against a massive goal than it is a small goal. You have X amount of energy. It needs to be expanded. You have X amount of time that needs to be applied. And the time and the in the energy that need to be expected for a small goal and a big goal are really not that much different. So if you're going to be working and you're going to be putting the time in and you're going to be sweating and grinding and be frustrated and do all this shit that you got to do, you might as well try to be the best in the fucking world at it because it's going to take the same amount of time and energy anyway. So that's how I think of it. I think a lot of people really fuck themselves by listening to idiots on the internet who have never fucking done anything except maybe write some shit like we're inundated with advice from who from who you guys read these meme pages. You read these mental health pages. You read all these who the fuck are these people. They're writers. What if they accomplished? Oh, they took a pencil and they said, like bro, we got to we got to listen to practicality. What produces results? Okay. And we are mind fucked by the internet because there's so much information and there's so many opinions and hardly any of those opinions come from anybody with any real world results to point at. All right. Especially with the mindset psychology shit. Like I see so much garbage on the internet that people read and take seriously that is terrible fucking advice. I see him repost it. I see him try to live by it. I see him try to curve their life into these ideas when the fucking advice is wrong. I could tell you that for sure because I've been down the road. Right. So we have all these fucking people spewing all this shit and people who are listening to it and they don't know what to do. And one of the things that we hear the most about is setting these small realistic goals. But I'm here to tell you every fucking massively successful person in any area of life that I know sets massive goals and they follow it up with massive action. How would you address the fair part here because you know he's saying like even if he sets this big goal he's scared of this falling short. But are you really scared of falling short if you know it's still like way bigger than you would have fucking landed. What the fuck does it matter if you if you set a big ask dude there's a saying everybody's hurt it. Okay. Shoot for the moon and you'll land among the stars. Okay. That's one of the main pages. Yes. But there's actually truth to that. Because if you set your goal to run a hundred miles do you think you're going to be able to run a marathon eventually pretty easy probably. Right. But if you set your goal to run a marathon you're going to get to mile fucking 19 and be dogging your balls off. Okay. This is what I'm talking about. You get far better and make far more progress and win way more by setting massive goals, massive action. And you may never hit that goal. You may become 10 yard short. But the thing is is that when you're 10 yard short then you make a new goal and then you pass the goal that you set. Does that make sense? That makes perfect sense. Yeah. Like dude these the fucking internet is ruining people's ability to think and follow practical advice because there's too many fucking nobodies who haven't done shit who aren't qualified to give any mother fucking advice giving it. Yeah. Let me actually this Andy because you know this is really if and you've all you've you've pried yourself on telling people that honest truth right. And in this like concept right in this idea of like setting these massive goals. I want to I want to ask you like because okay. Yeah. You set massive goals. Take big actions. Get big results. What's the catch? Like what what what would you say like just being complete honest like what's the one thing about having that mindset that kind of sucks like is it like. Look dude here it is. Okay. Action plus time equals fucking results. And everybody emails in and they ask all these motherfucking questions and you got all these people on the internet saying all this shit. Here's the bottom line motherfuckers. You got to do the fucking work. You got to do it when you don't want to do it. You got to do it when you hurt. You got to do it when you're tired. You got to do it when you're sick. You got to do it when you don't want to fucking do anything else. And you got to do it for fucking years. And that is the real shit. Okay. Everybody had asked a mother fucking question about anything is ultimately usually trying to figure out how to get out of the fucking work. And if you can't you can't win without that. You can't win without it. So motherfucker. I don't give a fuck what size goal you set. But you better show up every day and follow a big action. You're gonna be fucking broke. I love it. Dude I get tired of this shit. I get tired of fucking people when when I put 26 motherfucking years into my life to build this fucking life that I have. Be 26 years January 1st coming to me like I'm burned out in six months. I've been doing this for two years. I'm burned out. Then you ain't got it, bro. Okay, because this is a fucking long sprint. You are sprinting as fast as you can for your whole life. That's what it is. Okay, and it's hard. And you can't get around doing the work. And you're not going to figure out how to do it. You're not the first person in the world is going to figure out how to do without doing the fucking hard shit and putting in the time. You are not going to do it. So you have to ask yourself is this the life I really want? Do I really want to pay that price? And what am I going to give for it? What's it going to cost me? Okay, because it's going to cost a lot. It's going to cost you a lot of the shit that everybody else gets to live with. Okay, or am I going to go live like everybody else and not beat my dick into the dirt expecting something that never happened because I think I'm the first guy ever to like fucking get around the work. You understand? Like bro, it ain't for everybody. The one of the biggest problems with the internet is that fucking makes people think that entrepreneurship and building a company and success is for everybody. There is a reason it's rare. And the reason it's rare is because it's incredibly fucking difficult. And it takes a long time. And it has to be the focus of your day every single fucking day. And there is no relief that it's relentless. It'll punch you in the face a thousand fucking times in a row and not give a fuck how bad you're hurting. Okay, and if you ain't wired for that, you better figure out how to do it. That's the entire fucking point of a live hard program to build you into a mentally tough individual who has the fortitude, the perseverance, the discipline, the mental toughness to kick ass on a daily basis and laugh when the world kicks you in the fucking face. Okay, that is what you have to become. And any of this shit that you guys think where you think, oh, I can get around doing this. Or it's work smart. Okay, motherfucker, go do it then. Go do it. Let's see you do it. And what do you see in fucking six months? Oh, they're doing this. Now they're doing this new thing. Now they're doing this new thing here. And the reason that happens is because they think that they can get around it or it's going to be easy. And so when it gets hard, it's like, fuck, this is too hard. I'm going over here. Well, you guys are going to be broke. That's it. You're going to be broke. Just accept it. Just say, fuck it. I'm going to fucking go live my life. I'm going to scrape by. And that's fine with me because dude, it's hard as fuck. I'm truly let it be fine with you. Yeah. Like you don't have to fucking drive lambo's and shit, bro. Like not everybody has to do that. Like it, you know what I'm saying? You got to weigh what the fucking cost is. There's a heavy cost to living that kind of life. And it fucking cost you almost everything. And you may say, oh, well, that doesn't sound like a good deal for lambo's. Well, there's some good deals. I get to go over to fuck I want anytime I want do anything I want. Buy anything I want. I don't have any fucking restrictions on my fucking finances. Ever. That's pretty fucking good. What's your main problem in your life? You see what I'm saying? Right. So I just get tired of people expecting that this is going to be fucking easy. Are you going to be the first fucking kid at 22 years old figure out of get around the work? Fuck dude. Yeah. If you figured out fucking call me, tell me. 26 years. I'm doing some wrong. Yeah. Right. Let me, there's actually a perfectly way into until our next question though, because you know, I've met a lot of people in it. And I would say you you you you you you you tackle this in a much different way than I think most people pretty much anybody does. And it's a great flow to our second question. So let's let's get to the high 80 and I'm on the second round of 75 hard now. I felt the first time for missing the small details for got a photo on day 42. I read both books and listen to every episode. You talk about loving the fact that you're the only one out there doing the hardship, but I can't seem to find that mindset. I'm on day 48 up in Canada and today was zero degrees Fahrenheit with a 40 mile per hour win. It was hands down the worst outside workout. I've done and it fucking suck. I hated every second of it. How do you learn to reframe that into the mindset you talk about? I want to have that feeling of pride for doing hardship, but I can't seem to see past the suck. Thank you for everything you know. You love the hardship. How do you how do you how do you not how do you not when it's zero degrees and there's a fucking foot of snow on the ground and you're fucking out there and no one else is out there and you're doing what the fuck it takes and you look around and you can't see of another fucking human for miles. You don't see a car. You can't hear anything. How can you not stop and be like bro? I'm the only one. I am the only one paying the price. I am the only one doing what's required. Everybody else is sitting at home eating fucking Doritos and I am out here in the fucking snow getting better. How can you not be excited about that if you can't get excited about that and you can't find that mindset go eat some fucking donuts and get the fuck up. I'm being serious because you don't have the competitive nature that is required to fucking win. Okay to win you have to be competitive. If you're not competitive and you think that this is going to be easy you're going to get stopped. All right so it's competitive nature against all humans. Where the fuck is everybody? Oh they're in by the fire. They're on their blankets. How do you not fucking think that so that I can't help you because I'm so wired the other way that that's just what the fuck I think I look around I don't see anybody I come in here I come in wherever I'm at and there's everybody's got the fucking clothes on like their coats and shit and I'm just like yeah that's right that's why I'm me you see what I'm saying that's what the fuck I think and if you don't have that little chip if you don't have that little cockiness if you don't have that competitiveness fuck bro you ain't going to make it it's too fucking hard now if you're just trying to gain some you know you're trying to build some of this shit you know I don't know the answer because I've always been that way I'm a competitive person everything's a competition yeah like I can't put competitive into you bro I can't I'm sorry there's been an entire generation of human beings that have been ruined by fucking bad parenting strategies teaching kids that it's not important to be competitive and then everybody gets a fucking trophy and everybody gets to show up and be celebrated even if they turn up last that's not reality bro and if you don't have competitive nature in your heart if you don't have it in your soul you cannot fucking put it there it is you're there or it's not there so I don't know what to tell you dude but I can tell you this I can't not look around and be like dead that's right I'm out here they're in there that's why I'm me in there now how the fuck do you not think that yeah I mean maybe that's the thing right like you just make it like a mini game almost you know with yourself yeah you call it test days yeah right like I'm angry I mean is that a good place to start like just turning that into a game with yourself just that one it's it's test days is a different thing man test days is like when the shit's so fucking hard and you don't want to do it and you can't fucking wrap your mind around even getting it started and you do it anyway and you pass the test and that's that's a test day you know what I'm saying like what we're talking about here is competitive nature and the ability to find the mindset of doing hard things that other people aren't willing to do like I don't really understand how you could do all these things that are hard and look around and see very few people doing it and not have a sense of pride and respect for yourself you know what I mean yeah I don't understand that yeah so maybe you just need to audit how you're thinking about it and maybe you need to get a little bit of a chip on your shoulder and realize like you're doing a lot of shit that nobody's willing to do bro that's a big fucking deal it's not a little deal it's a big deal like when you're out there and it's zero degrees and there's nobody out you should be saying fuck yeah I'm the man that's what the fuck you should be saying yeah that's definitely what you think yeah this is the truth though it is the truth yeah if you're whoever's willing to do the fucking inconvenient hard shit tends to win I love it man I love it guys and let's get to our third and final question guys Andy question number three hello Andy a long time listening before uh roe roe hit my questions are how do you deal with the competitor copying everything you do from social media post copying parts we manufacture to even trying to poach our sponsored races from us I work for a UTV parts manufacturer and build race cars that win we are one of the leaders in the UTV industry and it's every day this company shadows our moves we make a post about a shipping parts out two hours later they make the same post we post about a new chassis we developed here they come with some bullshit about being an innovator and making some part I'm honestly deflating because I've spent 22 years building who I am in the fabrication and welding industry appreciate your time is what do they say that is impersonation the the highest sign of no what they say no they say impersonation is the highest form of flattery but it's not it's the highest form of unoriginality and you have to understand what ends up happening here is people try to copy and then they don't realize that they're one two three years behind and they can never catch him all right so if you're the market leader which I don't know if you are not you say you are but I don't know if you are if you're if you're not you need to become that you need to figure out how to get more eyeballs get more traffic become bigger and it's not going to matter if they copy you or not there's lots of people that copy everybody all day but there's always one company that stands above and sets the trends all right and if you're the company who is setting the trends you don't worry about what they're doing you just decide what's going to be best and you do those things and yes they're going to copy you're never going to get people to not copy you but you have to realize that it's not going to affect you because there's they're behind you already like if I come up with an idea and it takes a year to put into play and then another year to actually fucking really start kicking ass and then someone over here says oh look at that they're fucking two years behind already yeah they're always going to lose okay this is why you have to think of your company as its own thing and not focus on what everybody else is doing when we're in business it's easy to focus on everybody else and you know try to uh you know you don't want anybody else to have any business you know that's that's what you do when you're competitive um but at the end of the day you have to realize dude that if you're the market leader and someone else is copying you they're never going to catch you because they're always behind they're always behind and if you're the copier you have to realize that you're always going to be behind and you're never really going to make it happen and here's another thing if you are the market leader and you do have someone who's copying you and they're running ads and you've already saturated the market with ads and familiarity when customers see their ads they're going to think of you right okay so do we used to have the same thing happen on our radio ads here we would have cut little company we do local lot of local radio with our retail operation and um we'd have people you know straight up start copying our radio ads and in our business we'll go up you know say in because it was like a similar app or a similar product but we had spent so much that people associated that ad and that product with us so then the other company came in and spent money trying to get us and then they inadvertently pressed people to us because of the familiarity so that's why you want to become the market leader that's why you want to make sure that you're you know grasping the market properly uh to become top of mind where you know when even if they do copy people are thinking you anyway are consumers smart enough to see the difference to know the difference like note to know the difference between the OG you know fruit loops versus the fucking knockoff fruity serve no I mean look dude that's another thing is you got to remember there's customers for every price point and every quality point so like just because someone does something similar to you doesn't mean they're going to get your customer there's tons of nutritional supplement companies we got our own customers yeah they're not getting our customers right our customers are ours right because we're an original brand um and that that's how it works man yeah no that makes sense I want to ask you this uh with 26 years of experience tell me if I'm right or wrong and because like I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of this this entrepreneur right and this may be like an immature move but this is something I was thinking about like I would do right I would fucking intentionally make you know a bad not not bad move that's gonna fuck me up but I would intentionally make you know a bad decision a bad move posted just to expose them and the cop now nobody cares dude it's that move yes that's that's that is ego small business owner irrelevant emotional shit you're not focused on building the best product you're focused on outdoing this idiot over here yeah that's a recipe for losing yourself so stay focused on what you do do it better than everybody and the fucking cards are gonna fall where they're gonna fall you know what I'm saying I love it man I love it man that's the way to start a Monday bro yeah bro all right guys uh pre sure we had a lot going on so we'll see you guys tomorrow
