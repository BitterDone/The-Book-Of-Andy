What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate. This is where we put topics of the day up on the screen over here we speculate on what's true what's not true and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world. Other times we're gonna have real talk real talk is just five to twenty minutes of me giving you some real talk that I think needs to be heard and then we have 75 hard versus that's where people who have completed the 75 hard program come on the show they talk about how their life was before how their life is now and how you can use the 75 hard program to reframe your mindset and change your life as well now if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard it is the initial phase of the live hard program which is the world's most popular mental transformation program ever you can get it for free at episode two zero eight again that's two zero eight on the audio feed it is not on YouTube there's also a book you can buy at Andy for solid calm called the book on mental toughness it includes the entire live hard program top to bottom it also includes a whole bunch of chapters on mental toughness along with a bunch of case studies on some very famous people have used mental toughness to become the famous people that you recognize again that book is available Andy for solid calm it is not required you can get the whole program at episode two oh eight on audio feed so that's that now if you're new here we always got new listeners we do things a little bit differently we are probably the biggest show in the world that doesn't run ads I'm pretty sure we are but I'm just gonna say probably and we don't do that because we talk about the things that nobody really wants to talk about all right so I don't want to answer to somebody telling me what I can and can't say and exchange for that and exchange for not wasting 30 minutes of your time talking about shit that I don't even use I ask very simply that you help us share the show all right we deal with censorship quite often traffic throttling shadow bands etc etc please help us grow the show if you find value in the show if it makes you think that makes your laugh it gives you new perspective it's good information we're gonna get some today do is a solid and don't be a hoe show the show all right what's up man it's going on man nothing dude yeah what's up with you go a little lighter huh use restroom oh there you go yeah that's always good shut the fuck up I must have been a record yeah I must have been like it was quick I must have went back in time or something you got that brown time machine what's that do what's that do yeah it eliminates your 45 minute poops yeah 88 miles an hour do I actually read something apparently it's not good I don't know why it takes me so long it's not good to give you hemorrhoids yeah well I have those that I'm yeah well that's probably why with a minor genetic what genetic hemorrhoids is the thing I don't know about that no it's for me sitting on the toilet for an hour every fucking time you go over it no I mean it's genetic yeah it's probably the same genetics that everybody else has when they sit on a toilet for an hour yeah are you looking it up it is genetic see can it be genetic yes okay because my old sister has them too yeah I best she appreciate you telling the whole world yeah well I'm just saying I can't control and cis I can't control him he's a wild animal you know it happens yeah yeah I think my dad would probably have him yeah dad too you're telling your whole family here huh what else about your family it's been a minute so I don't know if he's you know I'm saying yeah all right let's let's get into the show we're here to get better today not tomorrow's the jokes yeah hey learn something new every day miss let's get better guys we already learned that hemorrhoids can be genetic we're already off to a great start this week so I'm saying all right now we don't know now you know now you know well let's get it to these questions back I got three go with for you man all right man guys Andy question number one hi Andy oh I love this like it's just always a nice salutations hi Andy I really appreciate everything you do 75 hard was a game changer for me moving moving me through a company to now running my own business I'm 30 and I resonate with your intense operating style I'm aggressive and always pushing to move forward my business partner who is 20 years older operate to the slower pace more patient and methodical while we're fully aligned on the direction and goals of the business sometimes the lack of urgency frustrates me I understand a respect as approach and I know it's what makes us work well together but I'm curious if you face something similar with Chris has he ever operated at a different pace than you how do you maintain alignment without losing momentum I love to hear your advice on managing this dynamic without sabotaging a successful partnership well look everybody naturally runs at a different pace okay and the truth of the matter is it's actually probably a really good thing that your partner is a little more mature and a little more patient and moves at a little slower pace because when you are an intense operator you sort of need someone to counteract act that and balance that out because that can be a lot for people to handle it's like drinking from a fire hydrant okay most people aren't built to handle that level of intensity and so it's good to have someone who has sort of gone down the road who you know may have a little bit more experience who understands that the things that you might get intensive out don't really require that level of intensity because some of the time when we put too much intensity on tasks that don't require that level of intensity you can actually end up with a lesser result because it adds undue pressure to people that don't need to feel that pressure in the moment so that's a hard discipline to learn especially if you run naturally hot I run naturally hot like I'm always intense you know one of the most common things that people ask people that know me in person they say always is you really like that in real life and the answer is yes I am like that and that's that can be too much for people but that's serves as a good litmus test like if it's too much for you it's this is probably not a good place for you to work if you drive with it you're gonna respect and you're gonna love it because you know it's pulling everybody down the fucking tracks okay so there's good and there's bad and as you mature you're going to learn when to apply it and when not to apply it urgency is one of the most important aspects of anybody's outcome because most people will tell you oh take it easy oh you're working too hard oh you're taking this too serious but those people never become great at anything they never produce anything they never become anything they never contribute to anything and they end up in the same spot that they're at at 45 or 55 that they were at when they were 25 all right and I'm here to tell you that life doesn't end to 25 it's just starting so having good intensity having urgency is a massive massive massive advantage and and I'm gonna say this I would much rather have way too much than way too little okay so I'm gonna say that now I'm gonna say something else as far as my experience okay Chris is not the only person that I've dealt with as a business partner I've got my brother I've got Jason I've got these other guys who are all part of this big conglomerate of companies that we own they're all different okay and I would say I'm the most intense however those guys all run at different paces and it's good because they can decipher what I'm saying like there's a lot of times when I say do this that this this this and it's so intense and so hot that the team doesn't necessarily understand it so it requires one of those guys to translate it you see what I'm saying so this is why you know I only talk to I'm chairman of the first form I'm not even the CEO anymore haven't been for a couple years I talk to Sal I talked to Chris about the companies that he runs I talked to Jason and that's all the fucker that's who I talked to okay because everybody else it can't handle it all right yeah you know when I talk to you guys and I mean you guys know I get fucking pissed I get hot I get urgent I want to win now I don't want to win yesterday I want to win today I don't want to win in two weeks I want to win today I don't want to win in another fucking year I want to win today and that's a lot of urgency compared to what most places are like so the fact that you have a business partner that is a little older bidding down the path has a little bit more patience is probably a really great thing for your culture and you just have to learn that you're the pace setter and that person is you know sort of like not an anchor but just a little bit of a parachute to kind of slow you down so you don't burn burn everybody out does that make sense it's perfect sense I also think of it like to like I mean when you're moving so fast if you don't have at least another set of eyes looking at shit shit gets missed 100% especially when you're urgent especially when you run hot like there'll be a number of times where I'll say do we got to do this and you know one of the guys Sal Jason Chris they'll say well what about this and this and this right and I'm like oh I didn't even think of that okay well what we'll do this and then we come through and connect that we all know it needs to be done right now but we don't make mistakes because they're able to slow it down a little bit and think it through instead of just like jumping in right see I come from a place where you know all the companies I founded we started with nothing we don't we don't owe banks money and we don't owe people money nobody gave me fucking money so I had to win I had to survive and that breeds a different kind of fucking intensity when you have to okay when you don't have any other options when you're back is against the wall when you if you don't execute today you ain't eating this weekend that is a lot of pressure dude and that pressure was on me for so long 11 years actually that it's it's become part of who I am and I hope it never changes because I feel like when people change that about themselves that's when things start changing and they're wise and while it may not be everybody's cup of tea I enjoy it and every other time I've tried to like be more calm and be less urgent and you know accommodate other people I've gone fucking insane it fucking drives me insane I cannot be around people who are not intense and urgent about winning it drives me fucking crazy the number one thing that bothers me is when I look at someone and I'm like bro do you even fucking want to win like do you even want to win like when I can't tell if someone wants to win dude it drives me insane you know what I mean so we got to have the balances out and it's not bad to be intense in fact I think you know it's a great it's a great place to be if you're setting the pace for your company because do business moves fucking fast and all these people I hear on the internet that tell you to calm down and relax and take it easy and you know you're going too hard and this that and the other broke those people are going to be in the same spot that they've always fucking been all right you may not know that because you're young but I'm telling you everybody who ever said that to me they are where they are they are where they were when they said it and that's that's just the truth man yeah there's a lot here but I love this question I want to actually this too I mean because when you talk about you times that you've tried to change your own personal pace whether that be from you know external advice from whoever right so do you is it also say and you said that never really worked out is it also safe to I guess the same like you shouldn't try to change somebody else's pace like they have to be willing to change their own pace whether that speeding it up or slowing it down like you should not be trying to make somebody else change their pace if they're moving that I think it depends on if it's working or not you know I got some advice you know when when I already had I was already a wealthy person I was already a great speaker I was already great at the things that I was doing to tone it down from someone that I actually respect and I try to tone it down it fucked up my whole game fucked up my business fucked up my ability to talk fucked up everything about my about about me because it isn't me and I think the main thing is to be authentic to who you are that's what it comes down to like you you're not crazy you're not broken you're not you know something that needs to be fixed just because you're not like everybody else right maybe you're not like everybody else because you have a fucking gift that they don't have so that's something to consider as well and I found that to be the case more than not when it comes to listening to critiques or judgment or advice from other people okay I'm me you're the recipe is the recipe and it is what it is if you don't like the way it tastes don't fucking eat it you know what I'm saying you're probably ingredients yeah right fucking guy yeah I love that man I think to the other point of low two like even for people who are not as outgoing you know like be authentic in that sense like you shouldn't try to like be more you can't start cussing and thinking you know that they can do dude and we see that all the time bro we see these kids especially men on the internet who are you know they state they want to be more masculine so they go find this who they think is an alpha male and all of a sudden they go from being a well-mannered well-spoken you know person to like screaming and like dude that is that is not masculine man just because someone has the trait of being loud or cursing or it sounds this or that that's not that that's that's not authentic to you it's authentic to them most likely so what's authentic to you right what do you feel the best at and by the way doing nothing and being nothing and saying nothing doesn't count so what do you feel the best when you are executing not when you're not doing anything because everybody's gonna say well I feel the best when I'm sitting on my couch watching Netflix right no I'm saying when you go out in the world and when you execute what is your natural style and how does that produce results and if that's something that produces results and they produce results well it probably doesn't need to be mess with if it's something that you know doesn't then you can look to change and find your authentic self most people most people don't feel adequate dude so they think their authentic self isn't good enough right they think that their authentic self is a two boring or two plane but what they miss is that everybody else is trying to be something they're not so when you're authentic people can feel it they can they can smell it they can hear it they can see it and whatever that is it's way more appealing even if it's boring than to someone who's manufacturing a personality so your authentic self is your competitive advantage if you're willing to truly live that way I love it man I love it guys Andy question number two Andy how did you know that your product or service was the one when you opened your first business I know I want to start a business and go through the hardship of creating a lasting legacy in my area but I'm unsure of knowing if my product or service will solve a problem big enough problem or even be profitable enough to scale it any advice on this to be greatly appreciated thank you Andy and for all you do yeah make a decision about what you're going to sell dude what are you selling okay I didn't end up in the supplement industry intentionally you guys don't understand that I started I want to open a tanning salon okay Chris and I were going to open a tanning salon we were going to be for the fucking sun tan boys this is legit yes we couldn't afford to buy sun tan beds because they were like 50 fucking grand so we ended up selling fucking vitamins all right so the truth of the matter is is that it doesn't matter you need to make a decision you need to start something and the skills that you learn along the way will actually help you adjust course as to what you're offering will be so most people will sit in this place that this person is in and never make a decision so I don't know what to sell should I sell books should I sell computers should I sell snow cones should I sell ice cream should I open a pizza place should I you know sell fucking bikinis like people will just throw around all these ideas well let me tell you something dude ideas ain't worth fucking shit executions where it's at so it doesn't matter if you're selling ice cream or bikinis or fucking you know whatever dude what matters is is that you go do it and if you start to sell shit and it doesn't seem to work now you've at least learned how to set up a website how to set up a marketing funnel how to set how to fulfill product etc etc etc etc and then you could switch the product into something else which never been easier to do that than it is now so whatever it is that you think you want to do whatever it is you have a propensity to enjoy and be into it's probably a good place to start I wouldn't start with something that you're completely not interested in because there is an aspect of passion that is required and a lot of people don't understand why they think that passions required so that you never have to work a day in your life because I'm just so passionate that's not true okay there are gonna be days no matter how much you love something that you fucking hate doing it that's the reality okay but what is it that you are into right now what do you like to do back then I like to work out I was an athlete I like to lift weights and be jack and tan shit okay supplements were always they were always in my in my zone of interest yeah and uh and we start there right so so like a lot of people are like well you know I'm not really interested in anything well what do you look at online do you look at puppies do you look at butterflies we what do you what do you look at you could be the fucking butterfly bandit okay you could start up a page on Pinterest with all kinds of butterfly fucking shirts and blankets and pins and pendants and this and this and this and this and dude there's enough people out there like butterflies that you could fucking make a business out of it okay the point is pick something all right and the reason that you should pick something that you're interested in is because there's a high likelihood that there is going to be a time from when you start to when you make good money that you struggle okay and what's gonna keep you interested in executing during that time it's going to be your natural interest in the thing that you are offering all right so for me you know I didn't get a paycheck for the first three years I was in business now we didn't have the internet like you guys have it all right so what kept me going for three years well I still trained and I still took supplements and I was still interested in it and so during that three years where I made no money at all none I learned more and I got better and I learned more about nutrition I learned more about supplementation I learned more about weight training it gave me an excuse to even dive deeper into something I was already into and already passionate about which then eventually made me an expert after you know a decade of doing that but if you pick something that you have no interest in and no passion for you start and then during that time where there's no payment coming in and it's hard like that three-year window for me you're gonna get so frustrated that you're gonna change into something else and if you do that too fast you're not giving the idea or the plan enough time to materialize which is gonna short circuit your success anyway because every time it gets hard you're gonna do something new and it's like starting a marathon over that mile seven every time you try to run a marathon you're never gonna fucking get there so you know what are you interested in what are you passionate about what's something that you would do for free and how can you make a business out of it those are some questions that I would ask outside of that it doesn't really matter as long as you fucking start and you can make adjustments as you go I love it man I love it guys Andy I third and final question and the question number three Andy I've started this email a couple of times but kept deleting it I can almost hear you saying quit being a bitch overall it's been a great year my wife and I welcomed my first child in January I'm on month 10 of staying alcohol free down 30 pounds and sticking to my diet workouts and jiu jitsu training I'm also keeping up with my goal of reading 10 pages a day but the past couple of weeks have been tough I feel like I'm stuck in a rut every week feels like I'm on repeat same work challenges same workout same routine what do you do when you hit a rut any advice I'm breaking out of it thanks for any insight well first of all I mean congratulations 10 months alcohol free down 30 pounds your first kid sounds like you had a great fucking unit sounds like you're doing awesome now on to the rut you're not in a rut that's just the way shit is okay when you do the same thing day in and day out day in and day out day in and day out day in and day out it gets mundane it gets boring this is why most people quit this is why most people can't be successful because they cannot master the mundane nature of becoming successful it is about day in and day out execution and a lot of those days are going to look the exact same so when you think that you know you're in a rut what you really are is you're in a place where most other people quit because it's boring and so you have to understand that mastering these boring days is the part that nobody else can do because they feel the same way you feel now even though you're winning even though you're doing great you are sitting there saying fuck this is boring this sucks I don't know I don't what else do you want what else do you want bro you do know the answer to your own question you need to quit being a fucking bitch all right that's the reality and by the way there's an entire podcast on this that I did if you want to check out that episode it's episode 240 on the MFCO project that is behind the real AF feed if you scroll all the way down you'll hit MFCO fee and when you hit that go to episode 240 and you'll listen because that is the nature of winning the nature of winning is doing the exact same things at a very high level day in and day out day in and day out day in and day out and when it gets boring and when it gets mundane that's when everybody else fucking quits and if you can master that process you're going to be infinitely successful because most people cannot continue to go once it's not exciting anymore and by the way dude it's not going to be exciting forever just like you know any area of your life fitness is not going to be exciting you're not going to feel like working out every day just like your relationship it's not always going to be the most exciting shit in the world okay but the successful ones the people who are successful in business successful training successful in life and relationships friendships they understand that these mundane times are the times that count the most but dude at the end of the day dude you know we have to realize that we have to look for opportunities when everybody else is going to quit that we continue to go and that's wonderful let me let me because I feel like we we and you have had a conversation about this and this was a couple of years ago and you said something that just made just made sense and you were talking about like you know I think you put it in terms of like you're planting season harvest season and it's like you know the the shit that you're doing today is not for you to you know reap in a week or two weeks it's five years down the road the work that you're putting in today that's right and I think sometimes like that that is the like misconnection a lot of people get stuck in because they fail to remember like you're not doing this for tomorrow you're doing this for you five years from that's right you know I'm saying can we just dive into that a little bit man because I feel like that's such an important piece there you know what which part I mean putting in the work and knowing what it's going to well most people don't know what it's going to because they've never experienced harvesting the the results of their work because they've never done the work hard enough so how do you train someone to understand that what they're doing now is going to pay off later if they never stuck anything long enough to see a payoff it's a very hard concept for them to understand that's why you have to train them and tell them and coach them and you'd say hey bro as long as you keep going it's going to pay off as long as you keep going it's going to pay off and it's going to take way longer than you think to start paying off all right there's a story I talk about it all the time about the Chinese bamboo tree okay you go out you plant this motherfucker in the ground and it has to be undisturbed for five years okay and if you go out and you dig it up and check on it guess what it doesn't grow if you go out there and plow over the soil guess what it doesn't grow if you forget that it's there and you build something on top guess what it doesn't grow so you have to make sure it's undisturbed you have to make sure it gets water and you have to make sure it's it's you know cultivated properly and then after five years it grows to 60 to 80 feet in eight weeks okay that's what your success is going to be like it's going to be like that you are going to work you're going to work you're going to work and then you're going to see a little bit of progress and that's going to cause you to believe a little bit oh shit all right this is actually starting to work and then you're going to work some more work some more work some more and then it's going to get even more results for what the work you put in you're going to say oh this is actually working and then eventually you start to realize exactly how it works you don't doubt it anymore so now like for me I've been doing this a long time I know exactly what to expect but someone who's 20 that's never harvested they don't know what to expect so most of the time they quit because they think that whatever work they're doing isn't going to pay off when in reality dude uh it's going to pay off but it's just going to take a lot longer than you expected it to take and this is a problem that we have with social media and all these things right now because everybody's promising the quick easy fast overnight way when in reality that's now how it works it just doesn't it just doesn't work that way so yeah um I think the the instant gratification kills a lot of that for sure yeah yeah it's and it's a total lie look man the more you could delay gratification the bigger the winnings come the back end that's the truth yeah um do you do you think let me actually this do you think that this is just like you're carrying me do you think that like the reason instant gratification works so well negatively obviously but it works so well on so many people is because the the opposite of instant gratification in the negative sense like you know whether a batch had happened you know those things tend to happen so quickly or so people think but you mean like negative shit just happening in your life like how quick stuff can go wrong and go bad they assume then good shit must also occur as quick or as fast as the batch it must happen I don't know it's possible I guess people could think that I just I don't know I'm so far removed from that thinking I can't remember what I thought whenever I didn't know what I know yeah you know what I'm saying like I know how this works it's not I'm not I'm not guessing I'm not philosophizing like I'm you look around at my life like look at fucking my life bro I can't point my camera anywhere ever and it not look like I'm bragging okay and that comes from me doing shit when there was nothing to show for the results and doing that for a long long time showing up every day doing what the fuck I thought was the right thing was it always the right thing no but I learned it wasn't and I adjusted course and I kept showing up and I kept showing up and I kept showing up you know people made fun to me I kept showing up girls left me kept showing up people fucking gave up on me kept showing up people told me I was shit kept showing up and and and doing what I need to do and eventually materializes and I don't think I know because I mean that I don't have special skill sets that y'all don't have the only special skill sets I have come as the result of me showing up and getting my ass kicked for way longer than anybody else is willing to do okay because there's a couple things about me that I do have one I'm not a pussy I have a lot of courage I don't give a fuck okay and number two I'm tough I take a fucking beating all day over and over and over you gotta fucking kill kill me to stop me okay so you got those two things bro you're gonna be in a good spot and and I'm telling you a lot of you guys are smarter than me you have more gifts than me you have more intelligence than me and if you could just hone that in and understand the game you're gonna be super successful and the game is very simple you got to keep showing up long after you lose interest and and executing at a high level and eventually things materialize and and you know this is why we talk about the work coming before the belief you know people people say oh you got to believe in the beginning no you don't you don't have to believe in the beginning at all what you have to be willing to do is trust and have faith that the work that you were doing is going to produce a result all right and so you show up you do the work you go home and nothing's happened you show up you do the work you go home nothing's happened you do that for a long fucking time and eventually something happens and you're like oh and then you repeat that cycle and something more happens and you're like oh and then all the sudden you're producing some real results and you're like oh fuck this is how this works and there's no doubt anymore so so like if you could just get to a point where you can remove that doubt it's so different than someone who has to lose a hundred pounds in the gym dude they show up on the first day and they're like fuck I work I work my ass off today or sweatin you know they can't breathe the next day they their source fuck they show up they're sweating they can't breathe they look the same you know they do that for three or four weeks they still look the same and they're like fuck this isn't working and someone puts their arm around them and sells them the truth it says hey motherfucker it takes five six seven weeks to even get this going because you've been a fat fuck for a long time and it's going to take some time past what you think it's going to take to start seeing results so stick it out and once we get over that hump it's going to start accelerating tremendously just give it another few weeks the dude sticks it out the lady sticks it out all the sudden they're down 30 fucking pounds and they're like holy shit this works and then they keep going and they transform them lives but but like dude that doesn't happen enough because most people will just quit too soon most people quit too soon and everything that's what it comes down to their life their marriage the relationship the friendship and their business and their fitness they quit on everything way too soon it just takes time I love it I love it man guys Andy I'm gonna get a Monday in man all right guys see you tomorrow on CTI don't be a hoe show the shot
