What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the real estate of out of the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome the motherfucking reality guys. As always we are starting the week off with a little Q and a F that's where you submit the questions and we give you the answers. If you want your questions answered on the show you can do so a couple different ways. The first way is guys you can email these questions into ask andy at Andy for sell.com or you go on YouTube in the comments sections on the Q and a F episodes drop the question in the comments and we'll choose some from there as well. Now through the week we're going to have different formats of the show. We like to say we have shows within the show. Tomorrow we're going to have CTI that stands for cruise the internet. We're going to put topics up on the screen. We're going to speculate on what's true and what's not true and then we're going to talk about how we the people have to solve some of these problems going on in the world. Other times throughout the week we might have some real talk. Real talk is just five to twenty minutes and me giving you some real talk and then we have occasionally seventy five hard verses. For someone who has completed the seventy five hard program comes on the show talks about how their life was in disorder and how they got it in check using the seventy five hard program. If you're unfamiliar with the seventy five hard program it is the initial phase of the live hard program that you can get for free at episode two oh eight on the audio feed only now live hard and seventy five hard on the world's most popular mental transformation programs and they're available for free. Now there is a book the book is not free and you can get that at Andy for salad. Combs called the book on mental toughness and it explains the entire live hard program inside now plus ten chapters on mental toughness why it's important and how to implement it in your life along with real life examples of people that you know who have utilized mental toughness to become the people that you recognize today. Now one thing about this show is we don't run ads you're going to notice that there's no ads. We are the only show that is this big in the world that does not run ads on the show. So the reason we don't do that is because I don't want to listen to somebody tell me what I can and can't say I try to keep it real with you guys and I don't want anybody influencing that. So in exchange for us not taking ads I just ask very simply that you help us share the show. The show makes you laugh it makes you think of it gives you a new perspective. It's an important message please share the show. All right. We're dealing with censorship we deal with traffic throttling shadow bands all the stuff because we talk about all the stuff we're not supposed to talk about so help us get the message out and don't be a hell show the show. All right. What's up dude getting a little red over there. Red. Yeah. We talking about. I'm just looking at the arm like you got a little burn or something. It's not. I don't get burned. I don't think you did. It's not red. Do I look red for real just a little bit. No. It's called tan. Is that tan? Yeah. It's called tan. What the fuck is that? Yeah. It might be red. It looks it just looks like it looks like there's a red under zone. That's just cuz I just got done having a annoying conversation. Yeah. You know when the hawk starts to turn green. I love it. When I start getting red bro it's time to move. It's time to move along. I get it. I get it. No, everything is good man. What's going on with you? Oh Not much is Doing the thing man doing Everything I can to be better every day. Yeah, you know, I do want to extra This is outside of the I got three govins for you guys of course, but I wanted to ask you this I was thinking about this the other day man because you know, you were talking You know how you went ten years basically making zero money, right? You talk about that. What was that first check like for you? When you first check like when you first were finally able to kind of like pay yourself like what was what was that like? After you know, I'm saying cuz fuck you wasn't making what like 700 bucks a month. Yeah, right? What did that first check feel like for you? Well, I mean, I had a lot of debt that I had to pay so like the first few checks. I never you never really it wasn't like I got money. Yeah, I remember I bought a new dirt bike. Oh, that's focused. Yeah, that was cool. That's sweet. Yeah, and it was like 10 grand at the time Which was like something I've never bought I never bought something for $10,000 without having to like finance it and that was pretty cool, you know um and Then you know, I paid off my debts and started saving money and When I got money saved up I started spending money Yeah, and you know, it was it was cool, man. You know, it's cool with the first time you go from You know, making just a little bit of money to some reasonable money. It's it's a good feeling, you know That it takes a lot of weight off it takes a lot of pressure off and I think a lot of people can relate to that, you know I think the difference here though is like the fact that you had to you were already you had already built up that discipline Like kind of just buy default from not making money, you know, I'm saying so like it didn't like lose your mind When you started making money. I think that's what no yeah like dude. That's the thing is like even still today like I only spend like 10% of what I make, you know what I'm saying so like But you know and people see my lifestyle. There's no fucking way. Well dude I've been doing this for 25 fucking years a big pie. Yeah, so You know, it's not you know a lot of guys when they're younger and I was one of these guys too You know, they're spending their cash flow to live a life right and You know once you start to figure out That you know, it's better to have some money in the bank You get right back to that habit of being frugal and discipline with your money And here's the thing about discipline with money is if you're undisciplined when you don't have money You don't automatically become discipline when you do have it So it's important when you have when you're not making a lot of money to really get into good habits about what you spend and what you say And living within your means or below your means Um, so that you know, you're your wealth so to speak can accumulate and you have the opportunities to Do things that you know actually make you wealthy or long term. Yeah, so you know It's it's discipline and a lot of people think they're going to cultivate that discipline around money once they Start making it and get it. Yeah, and dude. That's not the case. You and I have had this talk before You know, you have as a young person you have to Get your discipline in line with the money Uh, when you don't have any and then that way whenever you start to get it you you know, you're responsible with it I mean bro look this is just real shit like if I wanted to I could be on a fucking yacht floating around in the Mediterranean and not have to fucking Even think about shit, you know what I'm saying, but like There's more work to do. Yeah, and I love what I do I love when I come in here and and get to work with the team and with you guys and with the guys around first form and s2 and The univity guys and like just all the things I'm involved in it's it's You know, I can't imagine not doing that. You know what I mean? There's no amount of money That I would get that would make me not want to do that for sure. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Like it's fun Dude like we get to come in here. We get to create shit. We get to build shit. We get to help people get better Like I mean real talk dude like I don't think anybody has a cooler existence than I do No offense to you guys, but like everything we do here for the most part is you know I mean we're building an iconic brand a couple of them You know, it's not many people get that opportunity and I'm very very very thankful for that and people always asked or like Why don't you travel? Well, because I like coming here man. Yeah, you know what I mean? I like being around the team. I like to travel You know what I'm saying? But that's not like the identity You're not gone every fucking weekend. I think that most people have a life That they want to escape from I didn't build my life that way. I built my life as a life that I want to live in and I enjoy it And I think it's very hard for people to hate their lives to really understand that you know what I'm saying That's real man. That's real Well guys, Andy I got some good ones for you. Let's let's dive into these questions Um guys any question number one. All right. Good morning, Andy Good morning. It was more. I guess it was morning when he wrote it. Yeah, it's not morning right now I mean depends on when they're listening. That's true Good morning guys. Good morning guys Uh, Andy. I've been listening to the podcast for about a year And thank you for everything you do teach and preach. I'm only 25 But you've given me more knowledge than many of my mentors at this point I have a question. I haven't been able to find in the Q and a F feet How do you deal with the coworker who's a teacher's pet brown nose Uh, my shop is mostly full of competitive people who strive to do better and always wanting to reach that next step in life for their career My work is well funded and often has a handful of training opportunities or to work with different teams The issue we're running into as one individual has been getting every single training and work opportunity for quite some time I'm not the only one noticing it as others have mentioned it When he is not in the room initially we were wondering if he is simply performing at a higher standard than us Only to come to the conclusion that he actually does less work than most of us yet is still afforded all of these opportunities We realize this when he does actually come and work on a project and has no idea what he's talking about or where to get started Um, he's constantly in the boss's office and will hang out with them after hours I loved my job when I first got here, but it's discouraging not being allowed to enhance my skill set When I could very well use these trainings in my day to day to do a better job for my shop any help would be greatly appreciate How do you deal with with this teacher teachers well first of all I'm just gonna tell you the truth, you know 99% of the time people say this shit they're in the wrong All right, okay, do you know why most people become the favorites because they're great at what the fuck they do Okay, it's very rare that you just pick some random favorite in your office and give them all the opportunities because You like them No, I like motherfuckers that get their shit done do with a positive attitude set the standard for everybody else around them And give it everything to have and produce actual results And then what happens is I get close to those people because they make my life easier They take the headaches away. They handle shit. That's usually the case In my entire 25 years in business I have never had what he just described and so the way I'm reading this is you guys who are asking question are full of shit All right based upon my experience The reality is is you probably look at this person and see them and want them to be unskilled and want them to be Someone who's not contributing But if you have a leader of your business and they are trying to win the people that they are going to be close to are the people Who like to win the most as well and that doesn't mean that they were friends before that means they became Bounded and friendly because they both are aligned in the mission Do you know who I'm friends with in our company? I'll give you a clue The best ones Okay, you know why? Because they're the best and then we become personal friends and then We go and have a drink or a dinner or a smoke you see what I'm saying So that's usually how it works out now. I'm going to try to address the question even though I think it's bullshit Um If that's really the case then you should have a transparent conversation with the boss Uh About your frustrations and you should go in there with some documentation all right evidence Because a lot of employees they like to come in and they like to say well it seems like you're favoring so and so And you say okay, well why why would you think that? Well, they're in your office all the time well you could come in my office if you want Well, they're always here. Well, you don't ask me to do those things Well, you guys go to dinner. Well, you're not You you you aren't available for dinner, right? You know, and what happens is because employees Like to get in these little culture bubbles and yap together and then they make up these stories that aren't even fucking true And then they hate the boss and they hate the guy and I say it's all about favoritism and then And then they carry that attitude from this place to the next place to the next place Creating cancer everywhere they go and the people who run the businesses are smart and they say that guy's cancer We got to work that guy out. That's what happens So, you know, if you really think this is happening document the evidence Document all the shit that apparently he doesn't do and go to the fucking superior and say hey, man The team and I are kind of feeling like you're fucking us All right, this little dude here. He's not doing this and this and this I got evidence of it He's got you snowball bro. We all like him, but like we're we're high class hardworking Motherfuckers too not just that guy and this is bothering us and it's creating this in the team Have a real conversation, but you know what I bet you won't because that takes fucking courage and that takes balls And most people would rather yippy app amongst themselves than to actually address the problem like a grown adult I feel like a lot of times. You man. It's like you know people There's there's there's there's for some reason there's a delayed reaction and In taking advantage of the opportunities that come your way Right and like just because you missed that opportunity that doesn't mean you can just shit talk everybody else that did take it You didn't take it DJ you have the same train like you i'm saying that email for those trainings came out to you too DJ, you know, this becomes the the reason that it's like this and you'll be able to recognize this when I say it and so will you guys The reason it's like that is because those people misunderstand the dynamic of opportunity taking Why do you think it says take the opportunity? It doesn't say receive the opportunity right it doesn't say have the opportunity granted to you It doesn't say get lucky with the opportunity. It says take the opportunity. You know what that means That means you have to seize it that means you have to take it no one's going to give it to you No one's going to come and say here. I got this path You can make a million bucks a year or 10 million bucks a year Isk you do no one that's how it works bro True high achievers They they look for the lane and then they take the opportunity by taking initiative and a lot of people don't like to do that because they do this Well, what if I do all this shit and I they don't recognize me I'm not gonna put in all this work and you know, fucking have them not pay me for my blah blah blah Let me tell you something bro. That's loser talk because here's the reality if you took the opportunity You learned the skills you learn how to solve the problems and you were actually valuable and you're fucking place of business Doesn't recognize it you just learned a whole new set of skills that you could take elsewhere and make more money You see what I'm saying? So it's fucking take the opportunity and these people have a misunderstanding Of that they believe that if I show up every day because they do they all got parents to think like this That's when it always comes down to if I show up every day and I put in my time and I'm there five minutes after five o'clock And I'm there three minutes before eight I show up early and I stay late and I double blah and they're not and they're fucking me over So there's no point to it. So I just won't even try because they're just gonna they're just gonna Do they're gonna take advantage of me. They're gonna build their company on my on my back You know, I read this thing on the internet about about quiet quitting You know, I'm just not gonna do my job and you know, we're gonna see how long I get paid and when they yell at me I'll do a little extra, but that's all I'm doing and that's what the fuck they do. That's what they do Okay, there's a you gotta understand I have fucking managed thousands of people There are two fucking kinds of people there are the kind of people who say I'm gonna fucking become an asset I'm gonna take advantage of the opportunity. I'm gonna take the opportunity. I'm gonna be the best I'm gonna put points on the board. I'm gonna score fucking touchdowns and I'm gonna get fucking paid And then there's a kind of people who say If I show up long enough and I'm here long enough eventually, I'll be owed the opportunity those people lose and it's that it's that simple I love it man. I love it guys any question number two What's up Andy? Uh, and DJ I got a quick question On when to not be heartless but just use my heartless I think of myself as a driven person. I love my work and often get obsessed with it to the best I can be Uh, and often get made fun of for it by my coworkers. However Um Often I get caught upon for this or that issue by some of them because I pay attention to details and pick up on things Do I stick to my morals and just be the better person and let them figure it out I'll often battle with myself on this as I've grown with uh, uh, a people pleaser mentality right, so like what should take on Using your heart or like keeping emotions. I guess out of certain things when it when it comes to this this path You're on is it a heartless path have you found yourself? No look look If you really care about someone Are you gonna take it easy on them or are you gonna tell them hey dude you suck right here? I need you to get better Are you gonna are you gonna let them have a pass because you like them or are you gonna look at them and say hey But I want the best for you. This needs to be fixed. This needs to be fixed. This needs to be fixed Okay, a lot of people will take this I gotta use my heart less Because they don't understand the dynamic of what actually caring about someone looks like Actually caring about someone is not letting someone slide. It's not letting someone get away with less than what they could do It's not letting someone you know flounder and rot and sit around and just let life pass them by If you really care about someone you're gonna say hey motherfucker You got a lot of potential dude But here's what you're doing wrong and you need to fix this and this and this or you're gonna be this and that's what Carrying about someone actually looks like okay So when you say use your heart less How I hear that is you're just gonna let people flounder versus Actually giving a fuck about him and calling him out on their shit and you're asking the question from a perspective of Well, I've got to use my heart less so I can have more direct conversations Bro, you you got a fucking confused, okay? Using your heart less will produce a situation for your friends and your employees Where they are worse off Okay, using your heart more and realizing what it looks like to use that actually makes you an amazing leader So I don't buy into this shit about I've got to keep it real with the guys. I got to be use my heart less That's not what leadership is about leadership is Hey, dude, I fucking love you, but like look You got to fix this and you got to fix that and you got to fix this or you know, I'm gonna have to make a change You got to understand I'm here to do this and as much as I care about you if you continue to go down this path There's not gonna be a spot for you in the boat All right, and I love you, dude. I love having you here. I love who you are as a person But you got to improve this and this and this and then that person goes and proves this and this and this their life gets better They make more money and then they come to you and they say thank you Okay, it's not about making them like you now. It's about making them love you 10 years from now All right, and that takes some uncomfortable conversations But I can tell you for sure, dude if you're in It once you get used to communicating this way and you understand that caring about people equals telling them the truth And giving them good critiques where they can help themselves be better It's not that hard to do Okay, it becomes easy to do because you understand the intent behind it But when the intent behind it is I got to have a hard conversation with Joe and I know he's gonna be upset And I don't want to piss him off and he's my friend So I'm just gonna not say anything to him bro you ain't that guy's friend You're a fucking you're you're actually the opposite of that person's friend So let's get straight on what using your heart more or less actually means I believe all leadership Should use their heart more but also make decisions based upon facts not feelings and you can do both All right, just because you use your heart more doesn't mean you know, you're going to Uh Let things slide when the results are very obviously not ideal or less than what they should be Usually your heart more in that situation is to hey come here What the fuck is this? Why is this this way Here's what you need to do to get this in the right spot. You see what I'm saying. Oh come on man I thought we were boys. No, we are boys. That's why I'm trying to fix your shit So you don't fucking end up broke being a piece of shit over there complaining about how life fucked you over So we are fucking boys if we weren't boys, I wouldn't say shit to you. I let you fucking flounder And you know, you know, you know, that's what I do. That's how I lead Okay, and I think it works pretty well All right, no, let me actually this on that though Andy is there at what point Do you have do you have to stop like at what point? I mean, there's a saying like you can't go like a three I got like a two or three strike dude like if I gotta mention something to someone three times. I usually fire them You know, I'm saying. Yeah, if it's not a if it's a performance thing Yeah, if it's a if it's a moral violation or culture violation, I was firing right away Like no matter how much you you want them to win or do good or it's excuse me if somebody does something unethical They get fired. Yeah, if someone does something because they don't know or their work ethic is off or they're dealing with something personal You get you might get a little chance, right? But you ain't gonna get forever chances You know what I mean, right? That's where people fucker. Yeah, because dude when you do lead like that What happens is and everybody starts to know that you lead like that they start to take advantage of you They'll tell you this every time they're not doing something they tell you this sad story about you know How life's not going their way right now or they're struggling right now and at the end of the day I feel I feel that because I've been through those times too But at the end of the day you got to show up and you got to put points on the border You don't get to be on the fucking team You think that in NFL they they let somebody come to and stay on the team that comes in every other week It says bro. I'm having mental problems. I'm super depressed mental health. Yeah, I don't do and that's the new thing That's the thing that the that's where they try to leverage it because if you fucking say no, you're not Then then you're like an insensitive fucking piece of shit. You hate people with PTSD. Yes Well, I do it. It's not a reasonable excuse We are here to do a thing. We are doing that thing We are doing it well And if you cannot do the thing well You cannot be on the team and yes you will have certain situations that you know Like maybe you're going through some shit The super killers the people who fucking kill they don't know people don't even know what they're going through No idea they have no idea You know what I'm saying real champions don't bitch about their circumstances. They get the job done either way and That's what they do every single one I person. I know that operates on a high level they handle their shit And they do the thing and you say well, you know, maybe they're not happy maybe they're not But they don't fuck up their lives because they're fucking feeling a certain way You know what I mean? Well, I mean, I feel like even even just that bro like that that's it like a misconception that like I have to be happy to produce Like I have to be in this perfect state of body, mind, spirit soul to produce and like I Well listen have you found that to be the truth? No I feel like people are liars people lie You know what I'm saying like they lie about how bad things are for themselves They make up these crazy stories. They make it way worse and Then they end up imploding because they've told themselves the story so much that they can't even function You know what I'm saying like bro, you got to grow the fuck up Like you got to grow the fuck up dude like this shit nobody cares. Nobody really does care dude. Nobody cares You know, have you ever you think you've produced more in times of darkness than in times of like I do I think was perfect I've produced more when I'm pissed off Like when I have a chip on my shoulder. That's when I like The best thing that can happen to me is someone disrespect me or talk shit or One of my competitors Slight me or do something like dude. That's that's where you're giving me free fucking game And I and like I can take a little bit of that negativity and turn it into a lot of productive action And I operate from the dark side. I always have I put the best fucking I put my best shit out when I'm the most pissed off and You know not everybody operates that way But I I don't know the most effective people I know do even if they don't admit it You know the most I've had the chance to interview Literally some of the richest people in the world some of the most crazy Hall of Fame athletes. I mean I could go down the list bro like it's it's a true VIP of culture people that I've been fortunate enough to To meet and get to be friends with and know and have real conversations with at the highest level of whatever they do And I'm just gonna tell you dude This pie in the sky fucking feel good shit It doesn't exist with those people those people fucking hate their competitors They fucking want to win more than anything nice people they're nice. No, they will sit down They will sit down with their competitors and drink beer and shit right they know the difference between competition and friendship In fact having high competition actually cultivates better friendships But most people are so fucking weak. They will never figure that out Okay, so but I'm telling you dude. I've interviewed these people I know these people I'm friends with these people these are people I fucking talk to when I'm on the phone These motherfuckers will kill you Okay, now they might go on TV and smile and make jokes and blah blah blah But you put them in a competitive environment bro. They are out for fucking blood and that's the reality dude And so like Yeah, I think hard times actually produce better action when you know how to harness it um But a lot of people don't a lot of people think you know, they listen to the internet And they listen to a lot of these you know quote-unquote mental health professionals who fucking Fill their minds with a bunch of idealistic shit about the way things aren't and should be and never will be and because they never will be This person spends their life in a cycle of perpetual fucking aggravation and frustration Idealism is terrible for you bro. You have to be a realist You're not gonna feel good all the time things aren't gonna go your way all the time It's gonna be way harder than you think it's gonna take way longer than you think you're gonna be fucked over by everybody that you know You're gonna fucking lose girlfriends. You're gonna lose boyfriend's you're gonna get sick You're gonna have things happen and guess what you still have to learn to operate when those things happen when life happens and That's the game, you know, I mean, it's it's I think it's required personally. I love it dude. I don't think being I think that society especially young people Put far too much emphasis on being happy right now Then they do on focusing on a career in a life that they want to build that's gonna make them happy Now I'm not saying you have to work your life away, but I'm saying You have to understand that when you're young that's when you should be building right you shouldn't be Floating through life and joining the fucking weather like people who do that They're gonna have to build later and it's gonna be harder for them to build or they're not gonna end up with anything So they won't have the life they want they won't have the the the shit they want in life and they're gonna say well What happened well you ran out of time because you used all your time Doing these other things and that's okay, but don't be mad that you didn't get something that other people have when other people Fucking invested their time differently when you were out Sniffing the fucking roses. You see what I'm saying It's real shit. I do I get a lot of I get I get people say comments to me all the time You know like I had this dude message me and he's like I love you. I love your shit But dude, I'm gonna tell you what the last thing I ever want to see when I come home from work is your fucking car collection It pisses me off. Well fuck bro. Sorry. It makes you mad. What'd you do for the last 25 years? Because I'll tell you what I did. I did the same shit you see me doing now for 25 years And I bet if I were to go back and play your fucking tape It looks a lot different than my tape, okay? And when we go back and we say okay, well, what have you done for the last 25 years between eat breathe shit and complain I bet you people have a hard time saying anything 25 years. What have you done for 25 years besides breathe the air Be alive eat and shit What tell me one fucking thing and if you could tell me one thing then Fine, but you can't I've been doing this for 25 years. I don't give a fuck what you think of my lifestyle fucking love it I oh If I didn't earn it after 25 years You who hold on who gets it? So when do you magically get this when do you magically get to live your life No, yeah, you still get these motherfuckers talk is shit, you know And they can't come to terms with the fact that for for all those times when I was doing all that shit They were out doing other shit and then they're mad today that they don't have the result that I have You can't do that. That's not reality, bro And if you're gonna think that way you're fucking loser That's real shit, man That's real guys Andy our third and final question Andy question number three Hey Andy, I'm 26 and I'm seeing some of my friends doing really well In their careers and starting families getting married and I've been focused maintained in my lane And I'm continuing to improve myself every day. Here's the issue though I feel like I'm starting to get some jealousy that is sneaking in This is actually great at least right over this question. We just have man I'm I'm feeling some jealousy that is starting to sneak in And I can't tell if I'm more mad at myself for not having any results yet Uh or if I'm just genuinely pissed at them for winning I just want some clarity on this bro. Thank you. This is perfect man. Let's go back and play your tape What you do on your tape? What they do on their tape? It's no different than NFL game tape, bro What'd you do? What they do? Did you do the same things they did and you ended up with a different result? I highly doubt it I highly doubt it. I don't think that happened. I don't think you showed up and did the same things they did and you just got screwed out of the result. That's now what happened. What happened was They did different things You did different things the things they did produce the result the things you did did not produce the result and now you're mad about it So you have to understand It's practical. Okay, one you can learn what are they doing and how do I get better and how do I do it better? Two there is a literal law like gravity All right, and you may argue with me that it's this is that's focus focus Well, I don't know people thought gravity was focus focus for fucking a thousand fucking nine thousand years before it was discovered. Okay So here's the deal It is what the fuck it is if you hate on people's success, you're not gonna have any It doesn't just have to be verbal either. It's inside of you All right, so you have to learn how to be happy for people's success How I deal with that is I look at other people and I think very simply what one man can do another can do So when I see someone winning bigger than me I look at them and I say okay, what are they doing different? I think it's awesome that they're winning How how can I win like that? How can I win bigger than that and that's how I think about I don't think about it like I'm a full stock. No, because I look at it and I say that is literal fucking Undeniable proof that I can win too So why would I be upset about that? You see what I'm saying yeah Let me actually because I mean like I was reading this and like I mean he's young is it also possible both at like The plants just haven't like but it up to the fucking soul yet man. Well, I mean look dude There's only real two real things that that can be going on if If you are maintaining and if you're moving yourself and if you're doing the work And you're actually working hard and you're doing things the right way and you're executing There's only two reasons that shit hasn't material as one you could be working the wrong plan Which is why you need to look at everybody else's success Objectively and not emotionally all right, you got to look around and say okay. What's that guy doing? What's this guy doing over here? That seems to work Why doesn't that work and you need to become a student of what works and what doesn't work? Okay, I'm in a practical way So if you're clouded by emotion As to you know when I look at someone who's winning bigger than me and I'm like fuck fucking hate that guy I can't see the technique Clearly which keeps me from understanding what the real plan should be right and then the second the second part of that is You maybe haven't been working the plan long enough and this is a big problem most people have a very disconnected Viewpoint of what it takes versus what it actually takes and I believe that this is because of all the deceptive marketing On the internet get rich now. It's easy Buy my course and I'll make you a millionaire and fucking six weeks Do this do that Work from anywhere have no worries be your own boss bro all of this shit is nonsense It's nonsense bullshit and it sets an expectation for people That is unrealistic about the amount of time about how hard it's gonna be about what it's gonna actually take and for that reason People who go down the path they think they're doing something wrong too early All right, and that's a very difficult thing to know if you don't know right how do I know I'm working the right plan All right, well, I got to look around here without getting emotional How do I know if I'm doing it long enough? Well, how long did it take him how long did it take him how long did it take the guys you really Fucking admire not these internet boners that tell y'all this shit, right? Okay? How long The real guys telling you it takes and we get ignored people like me get ignored for the favor of quick and easy and fast But you're gonna know and you're gonna find out that I'm right and you're gonna waste fucking years Chasing something that doesn't exist. There is no easy way. There is no fast way Those things are the anomaly and guess what motherfucker you ain't the anomaly Okay, so while it might have worked for this guy and he invested in crypto in 2010 and now he's a billionaire That's him not you okay while it may have happened in You know two years for this guy because he developed some proprietary technology or proprietary product that just took off or he had You know an immense amount of celebrity and was able to market the product guess what That is not the norm that's the anomaly and that is not who the fuck you are You're a regular motherfucker that's gonna have to build it from scratch It's gonna have to grind it to fuck out and that's gonna take a long time. That's not gonna happen in Six months bro, so so look at the plan Analyze a plan unemotionally. What's that person doing that's working? What's that person doing that's not working? How can I improve upon that? Am I doing my plan wrong? How's it compared to the plans that are working? And then make a decision about what plan you're gonna work and then realize that you know When you get tired It's gonna take a million miles more from that point on all right So the greatest things in the world were built by tired people all right, I know you're tired. I know it's hard I know you're exhausted The fucking wonders of the world guess who they were built by exhausted people the buildings that you admire Guess who they were designed by and built by people that were tired Everything great in the world was built by tired motherfuckers So it doesn't matter if you're tired you just have to keep going. I love that man I want I feel like there's something else here too man like even just analyzing this and you know I know you touch on this Quite a bit man, but it's like something to just ask yourself dude like Is what you're actually seeing real Is you know I'm saying because it's easy to portray things are all good and you know perfect You know at family house kids cool, but like is it real like is that it is really really any substance there You know when you're when you're looking out like you got to verify that stuff is is that stuff actually even real? What you're seeing what you think you're seeing well? This is what I ask people to do I ask people to examine You know, there's so many fucking wealth life Business coaches out here that don't haven't done anything but sell a program about that Okay, so why do they have nice shit because they're selling people like you these courses that tell them how to do shit That that person has never done so you have to do your due diligence you have to ask yourself Who is this person really? Do they actually have a business? Are they actually where I want to be do they have customers? Can I use their product? What are their employees say how many employees do they have? Where's their headquarters? Where's their place of business? Do they have a real business? Or is it this one of these magical you know I own 50 companies and you can't figure out which ones they are right with a PO box. Yeah, bro look dude a lot of these people are fucking Lyrus that's just the fucking reality of it. Okay, so you have to ask very basic questions To keep yourself from getting fucking taking advantage of and you know, I see people complaining about well This guy took advantage of me. Well, this did he really because you knew in your heart and in your soul That that was a quick easy way and what it really tells me is that you're just like that motherfucker You you want to do the same thing that motherfucker's doing you want to tell people this shit works super fast And you want to charge him a bunch of money and you want to have your money that way well you deserve to fucking lose You see what I'm saying? So like dude this shit it's not that hard to verify the difference between someone who's actually done it And someone who pretends to have done it. I mean, it's maybe it's hard for the younger guys to be able to tell But I mean it's very easy for me to tell yeah for sure I could see where it would be hard if you didn't know yeah, because of Rolex is a fucking Rolex That's what I'm saying. Yeah, that's what I'm saying and Ask yourself some of those questions go back and listen to those questions take a piece of paper out Fucking write all those questions down and any person that you consider that you want to help you or coach you Or you want to be a part of their thing write the answer of those questions that I just gave you down On the right side of the paper next to the questions And the motherfuckers that have an answer for all of them those are people you can learn from yeah, I love it I love it. Well happy Monday guys. Guys, Eddie. That was three. Yeah. Let's go kick some ass this week. All right. Don't be a hoe. I'm sure to show
