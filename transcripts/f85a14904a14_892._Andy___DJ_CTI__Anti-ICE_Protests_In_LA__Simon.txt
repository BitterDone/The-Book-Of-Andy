What is up guys you're listening to Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realist. Say goodbye to the lies, the thickness and delusions of our society and welcome to the mother fucking reality guys. Today we have Andy and DJ crews the mother fucking new that's what we're gonna do. That's what CTI stands for. Yeah let's get right into it man. We didn't get a show out this week very simply because I didn't have a voice to record the show until today. So we had summer smash last weekend. I wasn't able to record because we were doing a live show for calling and then I lost my voice until today. So but we ain't no hose we're gonna post the show. That's right. Yeah. So what's up? Oh man yeah I'm still recovering too man that was a great fucking week though. Yeah it's a great week a lot of exciting things. Most amount of people I think we've ever fit in the parking lot. Oh yeah. And but it was fucking it was it was sick man. It was sick. It was a great time. Lil Jon was cool. T-Pain. Yeah. Two fremming dude. They were all cool. Yeah it was awesome week man. Yeah. Live podcast was cool. Got to be on bus and with the boys. That was good. So live podcast was fun. Yeah that was fucking sick. A lot of people are asking about that. Plenty of comments on that for sure. Oh yeah what they say. Like it'd be a good idea to do like a live podcast. We just did one. They want more. Oh they want more. The people want more man. What kind of comments are we in? Yeah like we should make that like a thing. You know to do like a rolling tour of live. Relive. You mean like we've been talking about for like the last two years. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good idea. I agree. It's a great idea. No it's definitely a good idea. Yeah. No I think it was sick though man. It was really cool. You want to tell everybody how you got nervous? Oh I mean you know it was my first time you know I'm saying that. I forgot that you don't go in front of crowds. But I'm always behind the stage. I didn't even think about it. Always behind the stage. Yeah. And like the crazy thing is like it didn't even hit me until like I stepped on the stage and I'm like shit. There's a lot of people here. Yeah. There was quite a few. But no man it was cool man. You know pop the chair. So we're good. I don't even I don't even think about it. What are you doing it though? I know but I'm just saying I didn't think about it so much. I didn't even think you would have problem with it. Yeah. No yeah. It was a cool experience. Yeah. I really really enjoyed it. I think the people enjoyed it and you know we might have to take that idea up. Yeah. But it is CTI guys. You know let's catch in on what's what's happening around the country. Remember if you guys would like to see what we talk about here on the show we link all of these articles for you guys you know do your own research and check out what we're seeing. We can always come check us out on the tube and follow along with that man. But before we get to our headlines I got something I would like you take on. So we saw this pop up and like you know we we do talk about this on the show. You have talked about this specific thing plenty of times. And so it's interesting to finally see it come into fruition. I guess. Gen Z is taking adulting 101 classes. Is it as dumb as it sounds. So apparently there's a lot of colleges universities around the country right now that are offering these adulting 101 courses to teach young people how to be adults. Let's dive. Well I mean it depends on what they're teaching. 100% yeah like you know pronouns and shit like they're teaching real stuff. So let's dive into this. So universities are capitalizing on Gen Z's apparent lack of knowledge of budgeting, personal health and general happiness offering classes to fill in the gaps. General generation Z typically referred to as those who were born between 1997 and 2012 apparently need help with adulting. According to the University of California Riverside quote unquote adulting encompasses learning how to succeed with basic needs being ready for a career and learning financial wellness. So they're navigating the complexes the complexities of everyday life as an independent adult. Not only is UC Riverside teaching the youth how to adult but so are at least for other institutions. Newsweek reported Michigan State University and nonprofit J.C. I Santa Clarita have similar classes while CBC News reported on to Canadian universities that are doing the same. So Michigan State held a class held monthly seminars in 2024 to conquer real life skills like resume writing, building credit, building healthy relationships, even cooking basics and making jellies and jams made for made the cut for the adulting 101 course. Yeah what we will be is this cool. I mean we do talk about this right but I mean I think we usually talk about it like maybe the many jellies and jams are adulting okay. I mean I do like jellies. Yeah we all like them but I mean is that is that it? Yeah. No. Yeah resume writing. I mean the things that they're that they're trying to teach are things that can easily be discovered with it's like they're getting desperate to teach classes. Yeah that's what it feels. Nobody signing up for the liberal art shit no more. Yeah or really anything because no big companies value. Look the communist takeover of high level universities in their curriculum which is happening for the last 20 years where they subvert and teach children young adults the opposite of reality. They teach them that competition isn't real that idealist thinking is the right way to think opposed to realist thinking that the world will bend to your will that you know things should be this way and if you pout they will become that way. You know everything should be fair you're entitled to quote unquote equity none of these things are real and because the universities have pushed all these things including things like you know there's 47 genders and all this other shit they've lost complete credibility with all of us out here in the real world. Yeah and because people are unemployed now right like they go out to the fucking real world they're not unemployed they're unemployable yeah right because they have no skill set right so now you have a group of young kids who feel wronged by the system which is how they're supposed to feel that's how they want them to feel who feel that they need to rebel against the system and rebellion against the system to these kids is trying to tear down any parts of the system that are based in science fact mathematical reality and general truth and so we these these kids were built to be rebellious and to be little soldiers of the communist ideology for the last 20 years and so when they're taught the backwards of reality their whole entire lives they have no idea how to operate or function in reality and these kids want to be mad about it which they should be but they should be mad at the people who taught them the shit they taught not the people who were operating in reality who understand you know truth in fact in science in mathematical you know fact so you know I mean according to this I feel like this is just a desperation move to collect some money because the truth of the matter is all the information that you would need to quote unquote adult that is probably taught with far less bias and far more truth is available on the internet from other people who were teaching these things there's a lot of wisdom on the internet there's also a lot of fake wisdom you know people who just read quotes and like talk about shit versus guys who have their people men and women have their own critical thinking and experience to talk from so it's just I don't know dude like there's a lot to it but at the end of the day you know these kids have been failed and they're gonna have a hard time do last school you they're doing the fucking classes on table swift you know saying like that was a real course being offered a lot of schools that was offered at Harvard yeah right right right and something it is an interesting movement I don't know I think I mean even in the class wasn't like how did Taylor Swift become a multi-billionaire let's study your model it was like it was some ridiculous bullshit yeah yeah so it's a little too late like I mean I think it's we got to hit the kids when they're like fucking middle school well and by the way why where are these kids parents like these parents don't teach them how to adult you know that's what I yeah that's all fucked I mean a lot of a lot of people are a lot of people will never be able to overcome the propaganda that they've been fed they're gonna see it as truth they're gonna see it as reality and they're gonna go through their whole lives wondering why the world is completely opposite of what they're taught never putting together the idea that they were intentionally handicapped through the training that they received for their entire lives I mean think about that dude like think about what it would be like to be told that everything you were taught in school was actually the opposite of what you needed to function at a high level for the purpose of control that sounds absurd because you just went through 12 years of grinding to get to this point there's no way that that could be true dude that's conspiracy theory that's you're insane that's a hard thing to convince people you know what I'm saying like when they it's kind of like doctors doctors go to school for 12 16 years and then they assume they're smarter than every single human in every single area of life and you ask them why and they're like oh I want the med school you know like okay yeah it's hard to convince people the truth when their identities embedded in a different reality so yeah I thought I was crazy guys adulting 101 let us know what you guys think down in the commentary man got a lot of stuff to cruise through yeah tired because here's the other piece it's perfectly leads into our first headline those unemployable people then become activists yeah and that's what we got going on right now so let's talk about headline number one guys let's go to California it's burning once again anti-ice protests spread across country as unrest in LA continues into fifth day let's dive into it man let's just jump into this anti-ice protests that erupted in Los Angeles over the weekend of spread to cities in at least 12 states from New York to Chicago Portland to Dallas the smaller copycat demonstrations come as LA has been roiled by protests since Friday in response to federal agents they are arresting illegal migrants including violent convicted criminals and gang members more than 30 protests alone were planned across the country Monday in support of David he read a herta president of the services employment international union of California after he was detained during Friday's ice raids he was released later Monday so so far none of the demonstrations outside of LA have matched the size of those in the city of angels where 700 marines and 4,000 national guard members have been deployed by the Trump administration to maintain order and help protect federal personnel and property borders are Tom homins that the marines were needed to quell the protest which have been occurring in pockets of downtown LA and neighborhoods in south central Los Angeles now want to make this this is a quick point here too because I think this is important for everybody to kind of just keep in mind right it's not the entire state of California it's the same play that happened here in Ferguson right yeah where they had six blocks right where some disturbances were happening they made it seem like all of St. Louis was burning down exactly so everybody I knew that wasn't in St. Louis was texting me saying are you okay are you okay be safe right you got you you got your guns loaded just be strong brother yeah we're praying for you dude yeah dude that's what it was like it was the same thing as a did a Seattle but chop you know more chai as or whatever call you know I'm talking I get well clearly the entire listen this is in tech look it's the same thing that happened with George Floyd mm-hmm they Matt it's the same thing that happened in Ferguson like you just said they amplified a small group in order to instigate larger groups right in other places right right right right right and I get that's I'm not I'm not saying that it's not bad in those spots where that where the shit's happening but by no means is it fucking the entire state of California or the entire city of Los Angeles but it is bad in those areas where it is happening there's no doubt about that you got again 700 Marines being deployed by the orders of President Trump that being deployed to California to help control riots you know and dude it's so crazy because like it is it is like deja vu it is literally deja vu remember the CNN protests CNN anchor to them out you know mostly peaceful protests while the ship was burning right behind them there's another slip up there's an L.A. news anchor he sparks fury calling rioters a bunch of people having fun watching cars per so this guy right here okay uh jory reyend is his name um he's given some commentary um there's a clip let's check it out large group of people it could turn very volatile if you move law enforcement in there in the wrong way and turn what is just a bunch of people um having fun watching cars burn into a massive confrontation and altercation between officers and and demonstrators yeah there's just watching car having fun watching cars burn bro bro you know I thought about this to me and like all those climate activists talk about you know caring for the environment and shit meanwhile all that fucking bad commissions coming out well I mean dude it's the same thing it's the same thing those are the people setting the cars on fire that's right and it's the same thing that happened during George Floyd you know COVID's killing everybody but the the protests safe yeah safe everybody ignores all the hypocrisy yeah well and it's not a stop it's nonstop um Kamala Harris jumped in on this um she made a statement from the office of com what what is I don't know where her office is but she has an office thought the office of Kamala Harris um well yeah I mean and she's basically like you know putting some fuel to the fire down there um saying protect quote protest is a powerful tool essential in the fight for justice as the LAPD mayor and governor have noted demonstrations and defensive our immigrant neighbors have been overwhelmingly peaceful I continued to support the millions of Americans who are standing up to protect our most fundamental rights and freedom yeah so keep going keep burning the shit down that's mostly peace well I mean she's called for it openly before mm-hmm there's there's time for she said you know uh that the just the civil disturbances would not stop they won't stop once she's in office like she's an instigator she's a Marxist she's all yes she's a Marxist um and she's been called out by by you know the sheriff down there um now there's here's an interesting take okay because I found this video um it's actually been going viral right now a world star um it's a Mexican American calls out the protesters angeles um let's check this clip out and let's let's let's hear thoughts on this so let me get this straight just like a clarify it you don't want to go back to Mexico you're protesting to stay away from Mexico but you're waving the Mexican flag and you're waving it with pride you're waving it in the United States the country you're trying to stay in the country you don't want to leave but yet you're waving the Mexican flag with pride okay that seems normal to you that seems logical that's that stupid at all none of that's stupid all right you guys you guys are embarrassment to the Mexican culture and to the United States culture you guys are embarrassment to everybody around you and you should be ashamed of yourself do better well I mean yeah it's actually called an invasion when you go into a country that you're not allowed to be in and you wave your own flag usually those people are killed because they're it's called an invasion um so that's what that's called secondly I wonder how many of these people are actually for Mexico I wonder how many of these people are actually um Marxists that are being paid to do these things you mean like once you take the pool noodles away in the trash can yeah yeah mask off yeah like how many of these people are just regular you know these these communist George Soros recruited dorks that have been paid to go out and do some of this we do it so interesting you're giving them saying it's just like whenever George Floyd was happening bro a lot of the people out there were not black people there was a lot of black people are like bro that dude was a fuck criminal not only that bro we go back to fucking Ferguson man where I think it was like 68% of the arrest were people that were not even read from here of bordering states right like I mean they were bust in they were nowhere like nowhere near home okay um and and you talk about the level of organization again like I've seen Ferguson we've seen the round of George George Floyd's bro and I remember you got trucks dropping off pallets of bricks just on the on the fucking side of the street like how do those get there who who paid for those trucks like you got to trace that stuff back um and again it's deja vu but we're seeing the exact same things happen I got this clip right here I wouldn't I would like to introduce so this is a clip for those are audio you want to check this out this is a clip of a a black pickup truck pulling up and literally unloading gas mask off to the crowd off to the protesters off to these fucking rioters I'm not even calling them protesters not protesters the rioters right literally dropping off these fucking masks and and just for context these masks I looked them up they cost $60 a piece okay like they're not cheap like you're not talking fucking you know the covid mask people will win like these are expensive uh mass used to fucking avoid gas and and and and uh cx gas and shit uh let's check this clip up this scribe where it just feels like something's going to happen and you're waiting for it to happen let us clarify because we've been showing a wide shot and from a different angle uh a whole lot of officers on the other side and who's fucking around there instigating violence preparing for violence and let's look at the people around all of these people okay um they look like exactly who I just described they look like white little skinny fucking dorks who've never been punched in the fucking face that's what it looks like that's what I don't see I mean maybe like these two guys here on this side could be maybe Mexican or something like the guy in the blue hoodie there and then the gray hoodie maybe maybe that guy in the blue hat blue shirt with the hat on but most of those people are fucking white and you could tell even at a distance so very pale huh pale skin for sure yeah no tan yeah they're definitely I mean they're not yet look bro they're who we say they are that's a ginger right there yes that and that thing in the back of the pickup truck is the is the epitome of what we're talking about these are weak confused they've never been strong in their whole life they've never done anything real in their whole life their whole identity is to oppose the system when they don't realize they've been swallowed up by the system and you know it's usually big mouth fat loser incapable people who who do this they've never had to deal with any physicality ever from anybody and you know they're gonna fuck around find out and I'm gonna like seeing it yeah they are and do this I saw I saw I saw some really good footage to name me smile like the police were running through on horses and had a big stick and they were just beaten shit out of people you see the one the guy get fucking hit in the face with the rubber yeah yeah and then and then they were like that then they were like arguing the cop in the that the the dude was like aren't you supposed to protect and serve and the cop looks at him like you're just trying to kill us bro right like these people were fucking bitches you know like fuck the cops until they need the cops you know I'm saying and then it's it's you know it's it's the same play they always pull they bait you and bait you and bait you it's just like these little dorks with their cameras right right in your face talk of shit run in their mouths doing it and then you punch them in the fucking face and then they act like they're the fucking victim right and like that's their mentality dude this weak little fucking twigs bro and dude I don't think America's gonna put up with this shit anymore I mean I don't know what the national temperature is on this I've seen everybody talking about it but let's be real bro these people deserve to get the fucking skulls cracked oh yeah okay real talk yeah and you know people who are arguing for you know this not to happen and saying Trump's no this is what needed to happen a long time ago these these people are not supposed to be here they're breaking the rules it's getting amplified by this other communist element and there needs to be an example made and that's reality bro and do the other piece of it too like because I saw Tom homin and by the way who the fuck called this I've called this years ago many many times that we're getting to this point yes that we're gonna get to a point where they try to create a situation where we are fighting against the illegal migrants and they try to suck everybody else up into that so it essentially ends up being illegal migrants and then all the protected classes you know the LGBTQW XYZs you know any uh pox right and everybody against fucking white people Americans yeah right and that's that's what they're gonna try to spin this into oh yeah so it's coming bro and rose I talked about this two fucking years ago three years ago no it's definitely we got clips we got clips put the fuck clips in you you guys think you know George Floyd was bad wait until this summer when it's the migrants versus the citizens of the United States and you're forced to join in because there is not enough police and there is not enough military to handle the millions of migrants that have been let in what kind of chaos do you think will happen when those riots start to pop off do you see the acceleration of the promotion of these crimes that they are committing across mass media that is a ramp up they are starting to ramp up migrant crime just like they ramped up crimes against police police officer crime against black people in 2020 now they're doing that with migrants against citizens and what they're going to try to do in my opinion after observing this starting to ramp up is to create a riot situation all summer long total disruption that the American man and citizen is gonna have to participate in that's right it's going to ignite a bunch of debate people are gonna pick sides it's gonna become the next thing and then the next thing we know in June right on time we're gonna have migrant riots where military age males from other countries who shouldn't even be here are running up and down the streets now shit up it's definitely coming because I mean again we're seeing we're seeing the same place but it's amplified and there's I think there's more money being dumped into this from from that side to really push it but you know like even just on the the migrant situation real quick because I saw Tom Homan talk on this and he said you know basically like you know people got to understand what's actually happening when it comes to these you know migrant deportations that they're trying to implement and he's like the thing is like we want to get him in the jails we want them in the courthouse right where we're already there it's very simple safety taking care of officer safety and migrant safety keeping them you know I'm saying all cool but they don't want that to happen so then we got to put manpower together to go to their house oh well then we don't you know they don't want us to do that then we have to put manpower together to go to their homes or or go to the jobs or whatever they're working it's like that takes more resources if you just let us grab him from the jail like let's just let him get him where they're at where they're already at and just get him out yeah and it makes no sense but the the the organization behind what we're seeing right now I do I did some homework on this and I would like you to I like like to introduce you guys to an organization called no kings okay no kings dot org you guys can go here yourself so this website popped up this is a this is one of the big dogs and apparently there's supposed to be a national protest on June 14th okay now this is this is on the website these are all the registered hosted protests across the country on June 14th cool okay literally everywhere we got a buncher in st. Louis that's going to be coming through cool DC I mean they're everywhere right the red stars are like the where you know I think it's over I mean that looks like a perfect opportunity around everybody up the shows up for every single one it's very organized yeah you look through their partners right just go through their partners and who they're you know who all is contributing to this and you guys will see some familiar faces got black voters matter they rebranded you got Bernie Sanders is up in their um Chicago women take action common defense blue wave of ACL you you gotta have the bullet proof pride um so basically all the causes I just mentioned yeah yeah exactly what I just saw all in there I mean this is a dim list I mean this is a long list um and and they're in there and so I start doing some dive you know some diving in on this and there's no kings and I found that like I mean do they've been playing in this since April 30th of 2025 this was a document that was created that has their host toolkit and what they give out and like okay well I mean who is this organization where do they come from I guarantee you for I don't know anything about it I guarantee it's too white nerd communist or Marxist people yeah well I mean they get the majority of their funding is coming from a organization called united university professions they also received a large amount of funding from the Jewish voice for pieces funding network which is the NGO monitor um so the Jewish voice for peace is funding any partnership with you UP is funding no kings national protests which is designed to protest what the no kings I think they they put it out saying that they are they've defied our courts deported Americans disappeared people off the streets attacked our silver rights and slashed our services the corruption has gone too far no thrones no crowns no kings okay that still doesn't say what we're protesting for so you're you're that's what that we're having an insurrection that's what sounds like that's what it sounds like now hold that thought because I got something on that all right this I know if I I know if I were to organize a nationwide protest they would call it an attempted coup right right right right right hold that thought Andy because I got something for you all right but you do a little dig in on you UP just briefly here you UP member services trust fund they have a trust they they quoted the revenue of for 2024 it's $4.76 million with William E. Showerman as the the head organizer trustee of this organization that was established in 2008 or at least they received the taxes then status in 2008 and you dive into a little bit of who William E. Shureman is and it's very I mean it doesn't take much to look into it he went to the Frankfurt school which is known as a leftist synagogue if you will in Germany where he explored the intersection of reason radicalism and the rule of law you look into the Frankman Frankfort school and you see that that was founded by a guy named Felix wheel a Marxist researcher who you know you see it there for yourself there's an interest in a full circle jerk there but your point of insurrection right because this is what's interested right like you remember you're glad you remember J6 yeah right the insurrection is you remember the dims crime that there was no national guard right but now they're complaining that we got national where are coming in for this insurrection that's happening in LA and across the country and they finally got one to squirm and ask him that in front of a camera let's check this guy's reaction now you mentioned that you want to have a national guard withdrawn you know having that's already been involved and as you also mentioned the insurrection so to speak on January 6 that was back when the national guard was pulled back and was waiting for a long period of time and then there's a big investigation that was that was put into that and people said where's the national guard we have been installed these uh these are rioters who came into the capital where is the national guard then all of a sudden here we have the national guard that was put in there because there was let's let's face it a lot of rioters and a lot of violence that was going on there that you're calling peaceful protesters a lot of people didn't see that on the TV screens so either you what you don't have a national guard that didn't come in on time on January 6th or you do have the national guard that where there was violence we did see it on our TV screens what do you want so for what wait a second so on January 6th I was here there was 50,000 people outside they were scaling the walls scaling the walls they were bashing in breaking in with members of congress members of congress trapped in the gallery including myself and they did not bash and break in they were let in and there is literally hundreds of pieces of video that show that they were let in by these mystery people who were all dressed in black who happened to have the keys where what about all these people who came right into the place where they apparently smashed and grabbed and break into and then walked over and shook the hands of the police yeah right after they were handcuffed yeah right walked over to the other police officers then they fist bumped after they're out handcuffs and they were let go so so who did who were those people right right right right okay so let's not raise our voice and act like you know I love how these people try to weaponize what has already been exposed to be untrue not only that and he's exposing itself because okay so so members of congress are more important in the the actual Americans who have to live while those rioters are fucking you know destroying the neighborhoods burning down their fucking cars setting the cars of course like that's that's cool well of course they're fine but lord forbid lord forbid we get some some some protesters in j6 to protest these fox that's a problem bro the violence at j6 was committed allegedly by FBI agents undercover yeah right how many cars are burned in j6 I don't think any I don't think not one not fucking one you have you have a bunch of people literally guiding them through they fucking walked in through the fucking guide ropes yeah right they were taking a tour we low lady oh my god high school field trip bro let's let's finish like we didn't watch the whole thing yeah right you know I'm saying like like like it what like yeah yeah let's see what let's see what he had to say though here we go including a lot of the people here like that was a a a dire situation where the police were run over people were beaten with so and then and then the and the differences speaker Pelosi asked for help very different situation and here's the thing Donald Trump is the one that was actually inciting that and here's what's going also going on how many police officers have died in LA zero how many people died on January 6th five how many people were their heads were beaten in here at least one or two or maybe more that's why there was like so when people say that it's a like it's Democrats are being uh not consistent is completely wrong next question that's fucking total lies bro that is total lies the only person killed it was in January 6th was Ashley Babet who was shot you know and honestly dude she was trying to crawl through window I don't know what the appropriate thing is but she was unarmed and she was shot by a government official okay he received a firm award for that there was no other fucking deaths okay people to knock at their heads bashed in with fire hydrants or with our fire extinguishers like they initially tried to say and this guy's hanging on that narrative to prove the point and then to like you said to like what you said so that's more important than this bro these people are clowns they're clowns look yes look there we go right there that's who we're dealing with listen dude we are dealing with the weakest fattest least physically capable dumbest ugliest people and that that is just reality bro they don't fit into society they've been told all of these things they believe they're the quote unquote revolution they've read some Karl Marx maybe they you know like these people think that and by the way they've been allowed to think that they are the superior people that they are equipped for what they're calling for and dude what they fail to realize is what I've said on this show and I believe I said this years ago in these clips the minute that the leash comes off of the American people and people understand that like okay these people intend to fucking hurt us and capture us and kill us all these people are gonna get wiped out and we cannot continue to tolerate these people because in every instance in history when they've been tolerated it has resulted in the deaths the genocide of tens of millions of people okay that's what happened in the whole of the morse that's what happened in the Bolshevik revolution we are in another Bolshevik revolution currently all right so these people need to be dealt with the proper way now and I don't really give a fuck what that looks like I don't care if that hurts people's feelings I don't I don't care about anything other than these people do not belong here and these Marxist people they don't belong here either like they don't appreciate America they don't want to be a part of America they want to burn America to the fucking ground and I think that anybody that goes into any country across the globe and says hey I'm here to destroy your country what's going to happen to them they're going to deal with that they're either gonna put them in prison or they're gonna make an example of them and we are far past allowing these people to gain any more power than what they have currently otherwise we're putting ourselves voluntarily into a very dangerous situation like we can't allow these people to continue to get power they're to continue their agenda it needs to be squashed because do the minute that they have the fucking ability to squash it they're gonna they're going too well just need a few of them man they're asking to go home together a few of them a few of them what you impale them yeah they're gonna dude I'm listening dude that's a lot of the impaling the question you really think that that do you really think that that woman that you just showed on the screen who's what five foot tall and five foot wide for those of you listening she's wearing an abolished ice shirt she's probably she's probably 35 but she looks she literally looks 55 okay she's wearing the colored glasses and all the ship the fucking rainbow sandals she hasn't shot I mean dude listen when do you think she took a shower last but it wasn't today okay and I don't think it was yesterday you don't look at anything so but these are a friend of mine calls them the unfortunate okay they they are the unfortunate meaning they're disgusting human beings and they can't fit in and they're they're they're involuntary you know they're in cells they're and then they don't fit in anywhere so this is their purpose and dude they've decided that you know because they've been picked on and bullied and made fun of their entire life they're gonna fucking take it out on everybody else and dude quite honestly I'm fucking tired of it like unleashed the mother fucking house bro because these people are completely out of line with reality if the regular American person was allowed to handle this however they see fit and the American man was told hey we need your help let's fix this this would be over in fucking five minutes because the first person of from their team that was legitimately like fed into a wood shipper and they got to see it they don't stop it's over yeah that's enough larkin for me today yeah that's right and like dude the punishment hasn't been harsh enough for a long time it's been tolerated for a long time they're they're disorder and their destruction and their their language and their their untruth and everything they stand for it's been tolerated and do their unreasonable demands that's the that's the key that I think people people need to realize you cannot reason with these people there is no middle ground with these fucking people yeah like we have to remember that bro they don't care yeah so why should we I agree I mean I don't know man well I mean I came that crucial a time ago yeah I mean I think people forget that man I don't know but guys let us know down in the comments man what you guys think about this this conversation let us know like bro I saw this video on you know the nature videos that are on the internet like the graphic nature was yeah which I don't like nature's metal cuz yeah but I don't like those because like dude I don't like seeing animals get killed but I saw this one yesterday where this crane in those you didn't know what a crane is like a it's a fucking boat but it looks like a flamingo not pink yeah had flown into this tiger encampment all right and there were seven tigers like bangle tigers and by the way did you know that of tiger can kill a lion super easy no no tigers tigers are way more vicious than lions really yeah they said that and and and 90% of the time a tiger will kill a lion in fight geez yeah I didn't know that I know that yeah so apparently tigers pretty bad I like them they look nice yeah so there's they're much bigger than lions too I didn't realize that they're longer same height but longer but they anyway this crane fucking flies into the into the little enclosure right and the lions are all kind of like looking at or the tiger tigers are all like looking at it and they don't know what to think and they're kind of like like this nigga doing yeah and in this this thing starts getting his wings out and he runs up and they all kind of go back and you know he starts to realize oh maybe they're afraid of me and so he does this like two or three times where he flaps his wings and finally unlike the the fourth time he runs up there and a fucking one tiger just grabs him and bro they all ripped him apart like in like 20 pieces feathers in a millisecond fuck and that's what this reminds me of that's what this reminds me of deer and headlights yeah like these people are so ignorant to what they're doing they don't realize that they're poking the mother fucking bear bro and one time that bear is gonna turn around and swipe them and they're gonna lose their fucking heads it is what it is man guys let us know down

do that's pretty funny hello number two this was an interesting little tip for tat that uh resulted in a in the ending I was not expecting let's go ahead on the two hell on two reads I apologize some on bios backs down in Riley gain spec calls for fair competition have you I mean we're listen we don't typically get in the gossip shit that's not what we do here um but we'll gladly get into this one I like Riley gains a lot yeah and I don't like small bios all right well I mean this is good start yeah starting to head line to so let's jump into this let's dive into this see what see what transpired no pun intended for trans so yeah so that's that's that's that's that's that's it is man some on bios apologize to Riley gains on Tuesday for their online spat over trans identifying males and women sports the Olympus Olympic gymnast adding that she believes the current women sports system is flawed to athletes clashed on Friday when bios attack gains seemingly out of the blue calling the former university of Kentucky swimmer a sore loser and telling her to bully someone your own size which would ironically be a male so let's see what have this started all right so Riley she's an OG she's freaking phenomenal yeah um she uh she she retweeted a post from the minister minister of state high school league so they posted this um this tweet on June 6th meet chaplain park the class a a a a softball state champion uh state champions for 2025 um right very you know off whatever cool problem is this like you mean the one that's a foot higher than all the other ones you mean that's it that's you mean the one that's massive compared to all the rest is actually a boy that's a boy oh that's a that's a boy I'm sorry I was definitely confused about that wake up your little racist because she's seen ball with the little thing hit the ball can he or something wrong with him I'm sorry all right but so they post this all right but now they posted this and then they had to turn the comments off because they were getting some heat um so that's what Riley games called off or or called out um she reposes that saying comments off lol to be expected when your star player is a boy yeah I'm sure the fucking kids hitting like down yeah but for some reason Simone decided to jump in on this all right she decided to jump in so she replied by the way this is high school high fucking sports softball yeah yeah and you still parent let the kids play this is not kids playing this is competitive sports yeah this is not fucking T-ball yes T-ball is kids playing T-ball the kids don't even know look that's some of the kids they can't will before they get the fucking big of flowers and shit right like they don't know what's going on to be ready man they got no this is where we figure out if your kid is like you know retarded or you got them not that's right like can your kid play baseball or is your kid retarded yes that's where we figured out this is the truth okay that's how I get mad I didn't fucking I might have said it a little differently than you're used to hearing but it's still the fucking truth like shit man some kids are made for pick a flower it's it man the kids are made for sports the fucking pit there's a video of a little fucking kid it's like T-ball bro he's like running home from third base and he says like dancing in cartwheel and that's okay that's cool that's okay but we don't change the whole fucking game of baseball they'll make that kid the start no no no get that motherfucker off the feet yes get him off get him off get some get some figure pates we got one you fucking dude don't say it out man it's real though but then this is we're talking about real athleticism don't let him have the glue fucking eat it I'm not like the strawberry crayons oh yeah so some of you up did on this all right so she she immediately tweeted out right after that uh saying bully someone your own size which would ironically be a man yeah because Riley gains is fucking huge she's right there dude like I mean just for reference like come on man yeah that's an actual dude yeah that's who she has to write these not like a big girl she's she's a petite athletic woman yeah um so Riley she's she said she retweet replied to that sweet saying this is so disappointing my take is the least controversial take on the planet some own bios being a male apologist at the expense of young girls dreams didn't have that on my bingo card maybe she could compete in pommahorse and rings in 2028 um to which some on clap back at Riley gains you're truly sick all of this campaigning because you lost a race straight up sore loser you should be uplifting the trans community and perhaps finding a way to make sports inclusive or maybe a transgender category at all sports but instead you bully them one thing for sure is no one in sports is safe with you around uh yes sometimes you have first of all so these young girls are having to compete with boys aren't being bullied right right it's not bullying for uh liatomas whatever it's Robert Thomas or whatever the fuck his name is sure uh because he was 700th place with the men and he gets in the pool and wins a national title that's not bullying you know what I'm saying it's not bullying to be in a locker room with your dick hanging out in front of a bunch of other girls that's not that's not bullying I mean I don't know I think it's I think that's what it is you know and on top of it small bios gets a lot of I mean yeah okay she's amazing gymnast blah blah blah she got terrible attitude she always has she fucking flaked out of the Olympics for fucking quote unquote mental health she's always been super well she's always been super political it shook the fuck up and do your thing like you know yeah and by the way you're out of fucking touch with where the narrative is right now which is why she apologized yeah she didn't apologize because she apologized because she was like oops I guess cultures moved I guess that wouldn't the right one yeah right and and if if culture had turned around destroyed Riley gains she wouldn't have fucking apologized I shit no fuck no yeah she she I think she's a terrible human yeah maybe I'm wrong maybe she's not but she certainly has some people around her that have her head filled with some bullshit oh yeah bro well I mean that's the thing it's like I look at it like this like what a waste of an opportunity you know I'm saying because the truth of the matter she's a great athlete Simone Bob is a great athlete great gymnast right does well and like you literally just listen to your entire base of young women that like hey like it's okay to let a boy compete against you yeah not only that I'm pretty fucking sure that if you competed against men and anything you're like is it she like four foot six yes she's like she's very tiny she's a gymnast yeah like if you competed in any male sport against a male you're gonna get hurt yeah I mean she's tiny yeah you know you know eight hundred and four pounds and just for discussion say Riley gains is five five one thirty six yeah so not he's not huge as a man she's not even a big woman yeah right right nowhere near average I think people think she is because of that picture most women are tall that's what I think yeah I think people think that because of but not I mean yeah now she's she's not like fucking you know abnormally tall you know so here's your tweet she was fucking killing it here's a tweet I wanted to follow up from my last tweets I've always believed competitive equity and inclusivity are both essential in sport the current system doesn't add to adequately balance these important principles which often leads to frustration and heated exchanges it didn't help for me to get personal with Riley which I apologize for these are sensitive complicated issues that I truly don't have the answers or solutions to but I believe it starts with empathy and respect I was not advocating for policy that compromise fairness in women sports yes you were you were my objection is to be singling out children for public scrutiny in ways that feel feel personal and harmful individual athletes especially kids should never be the focus of criticism of a flawed system they have no control over I believe sports organizations have a responsibility to come up rules supporting inclusion while maintaining fair competition they they are already inclusive if you're a fucking boy you play on the boys team right if you're a girl you play on the girls team if you're a boy that dresses up as a girl you play with the boys wearing a costume doesn't make you fucking Batman bro you know like you know again we're all the little you know trans girls competing in the fucking yeah why is that why we never see trans girls competing on the boys team don't have it you know if if it's all equal and fair then why do we not see why are they dominating sports because everybody knows everybody knows she knows oh it was not advocating for policies to create you know compromise fairness women sports yes that's exactly what you were doing it you were doing it for social and political clout you thought you were going to misjudge the culture and you you don't understand because you live in a little bubble of celebrity and you don't understand that people I hear fucking tired of people like you running your fucking mouths about shit that you don't have to deal with it's real shit man yeah to me it sounded like a word salad see sad down I was like okay I screwed up what should I do now yeah right a long paragraph that should sound like okay maybe I'm apologizing but I'm still okay on the other side and that's how to achieve the tweet yeah because these people eat themselves bro because they can't they can she's been woke enough to wear her anybody who's still supporting her is usually of that mindset and now she's pissed off both sides okay and that's the problem with cancel culture in general all right and it goes on both sides all right I I am not an advocate of cancel culture I don't think it's right but I am an advocate of people taking responsibility for the things that they say if you send something stupid apologize for it but mean it she doesn't you know I don't know that doesn't feel it feels like she's walking the line yeah for sure if you read it from a neutral standpoint it feels like she's trying to please both sides yeah well you can't please both sides on a topic that is very clearly black and white issue all right um and then fifty fifty you know she says oh the system is flawed no the system isn't flawed you're thinking you're thinking about the system is flawed system is actually very perfect has been for a long time you know I mean dude look there are girls that wrestle with boys and their girls that are they're they're it happens yeah sure okay and but to make that the rule no well I mean yeah I you know I mean you don't see here's what you don't see you don't see fucking girls wrestling and boys and and and and her winning and the boys being like oh that's not fair she's a girl who played the girls yeah right like they kind of like fuck I guess I should get better but you know I mean there's very listen there's very few sports like that yeah there's very few sports where people could compete on a on a somewhat level playing field I mean I really I don't I don't even think wrestling is a good example because that's an exception not a that's not an exception that's why I say yeah like if I have to lift with Tia Claire I would lose yeah but she's an exception because she's like a specimen yeah so that exists in almost all sports yeah yeah yeah guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think man let us know that being said let's finish off with a third of final headline let's do a little follow up on the biggest break up ever ever yeah ever Elon Musk hints that explosive fallout with Trump maybe cooling off after prayers wishes him whale so we had we talked about it um a lot has changed since our last live show is it a little bit maybe I haven't been asking because I haven't been paying attention a little bit um tech mogwee Elon Musk signal Monday that his white hot public feud president Trump maybe starting to cool off quote we had a great relationship and I wish him well very very very well actually the Trump told reporters at the White House Monday in a clip reposted by ex-influencer ALX um let's check this clip out are you gonna get rid of the Tesla and the Starlink service that you have here at the White House no I haven't heard that I mean I may move the Tesla around a little bit but I don't think what we're doing that with Starlink it's a good service where are you gonna move it to move it around what do you mean I have a lot of locations I got so many locations I don't know what to do with them all did you ever see Elon Musk get physical with the Treasury Secretary no I didn't and I tried to have an argument but I didn't see I didn't see a lot of physicality there I noticed the New York Times report that he did not want to talk about Elon Musk that alleged that he towards the end of his time in the White House was blurring the lines between recreational use of drugs and medicinal do you think he ever had drugs here at the White House I really don't know I don't think so I hope not look I wish him well you understand we had a good relationship and I just wish him well very well actually yeah oh man I don't know bro I feel like when somebody like Trump says very well actually even after the fact that kind of means I'm gonna fucking destroy you well well Elon Musk replied through with the heart so I mean I mean maybe I mean maybe it would be nice if they would not allow their egos to make us look fucking stupid which I think has already happened but look man Trump's Trump's not the fucking animal that people make him out to be he's a classy regular dude the media runs runs his name through the mud they make him sound like a fucking idiot he's not an idiot he's a very intelligent man he's a good man and you know I don't know anything about Elon I think Elon is it's hard to read to me well I think Elon is a little bit you know I mean bro he's a richest guy in the world so like there's a there's a there's a different mentality that comes with that that you and I and everybody else is never gonna really understand so plus I think he's a fucking super genius so like when you're the richest guy in the world and you're also know that you're smarter than everybody and the evidence proves it you're gonna walk around with a big ego it's gonna be hard for you to take direction from literally anybody and then you have Trump who has also lived a very successful life who's done a lot of things who has a lot of experience and rightfully so he also has a large ego because he's fucking earned it okay and those two personalities it's very rare that two personalities like that can coexist without one of them not really caring about their ego like they have it but they're like brought on fun care because the mission's more important right then when that happens egos can coexist but it's it's you know I said this would probably happen and you know and I definitely after watching it for the last few days I don't feel like what I said on the last show about it being a intentional play no I don't think that's what it is I think it is what it appears to be I think it's two guys with very large egos that's not a knock on either of them having conflict and sometimes you know like dude some like real talk sometimes those end up in even stronger relationships no because you look at someone you're like fuck I was being an asshole and he's like I was too it is what it is and then you end up coming to a better understanding of things you know what I'm saying I mean you on taking it straight to Twitter that's that's terrible move you know like that's that's kind of a bitch move you know where I'm from if you got a real problem you solve it off the internet and then if you don't solve it you just fucking know say anything you know I'm saying right unless you start getting attacked and that's what I said dude because I mean even if and then you let them have it but like dude you all started the attacks yeah you know and and and also you know there's another side to this and you know our job is to explore all the sides you know and by the way when I say Trump is when I you know like everybody gets pissed when I talk about Trump whether I talk about him good or bad which is like it's a fucking testament to our to our inability to think critically like I don't have to like everything someone does to like them as a person that's not how I am I could very easily look and bro I think that's what makes me an effective leader I could very easily look at any one of you guys or any of these people around here and I can say that was a huge fuck up yeah you fucked up that doesn't but I don't carry that in I don't like that person right right and um you know I think people don't have the ability to do that anymore to be objective yeah and they just say hey I don't like that decision but I like that person or I don't like uh that person but I like this decision you know and those are those things don't always go together and like dude I know enough people that know Trump that I trust I mean one of my fucking business partners is one of his best friends you know and and I trust him very much and I believe that Trump's a good man like a really good man I believe that he makes some decisions sometimes that you know maybe maybe I don't agree with but you know I don't fall into one of these camps where someone's like like the guy last time the show oh I tired Andy shitting on Republicans what are you talking about yeah I don't shit out the only people I shit on are the Marxist far left fucking useless waste-to-aid dumbasses which we all can't stand right okay so but if I if I see Republicans doing something goofy I'm gonna say that's not fucking good yeah right you know what I mean like what where has where have we been where have we lost this like where have we learned nothing man's house yeah yeah yeah like I don't know man I think that's a very dangerous place that we've been manipulated into and I think it's intentional I think you know cancel culture was created by the elite cabal to divide people and get people argue about literally everything and make them believe that if you're either in this camp or that camp and you can't see anything good in the other camp otherwise you're a traitor to that camp and then you and dude here's what I say Simone Biles is learning that right now okay and that's not right I don't like Simone Biles I think she's malady I think she talks about dumb shit bad at it I think bad terrible attitude I wouldn't even let her work here yeah she would not be allowed to work in this building that doesn't mean that I can't say she's being caught up in the bullshit right because she is yeah okay where she's gonna be too work too woke for the right and not woke enough for the left yeah and you're gonna be left out in the middle and dude you know what sometimes when you're left out in the middle you start taking it for yourself and maybe that's what's needed well I mean that's what happened to me if she uses that opportunity to be a good thing for I mean did listen dude I've over the last 10 years of podcasting I've pissed everybody off there's been things I've said that every single listener of mine has been like I don't really agree with that but they know my heart and they know my intent and they know where I'm coming from and luckily I have a gracious following that is willing to understand that we don't have to fucking agree with everything someone says to like someone you know and that's what America used to be dude like everybody used to be like that like those of you guys who are young you know when I was growing up dude up until probably I was like 22 or 23 the the way the world was what it was that way it was yeah fuck dude that's that's fucking you know that's Bob like he's kind of a dick but he's a good guy yeah like and you just learn to tolerate people and it was some of your best relationships were with people that you didn't like it first and then you end up like understanding their character and you understand what they're about and then you know some people you learn more about it like I definitely don't like that but like you know yeah but but not everybody gets put into the category of shitbag because they said one or two things off off off base like bro I saw this comment yesterday about me like from some dude doesn't know me never met me he goes he goes that dude is a is a horrible person what makes me a fucking horrible person bro you don't know shit about me you don't know what I do on the off the internet you don't know about I don't brag about all the good things I do can't brag about I know because then I'm a brother right right like it's like bro people are just comfortable saying things that are complete lies about people because they didn't like one thing that they said or two things they said motherfucker I have for everybody neither is Trump neither is Elon and by the way neither is anybody who's ever done anything of significance that's ever walked the motherfucking face of the earth almost everybody who was ever significant is somewhat polarizing okay they're not a middle ground person they're they're not a half-ass person they're a whole-ass person all right and they stand on their fucking ground and dude this is something that a lot of you guys need to learn in your own lives in your own you know this is getting off into another tangent but like you know all these guys who talk about authenticity but their authenticity isn't real authenticity it's manufactured authenticity it's acting copying somebody's right right real authenticity is not showing extra vulnerability or extra transparency or putting things on the internet that are very personal that is not that is not authenticity authenticity is who the fuck you actually are and then showing it right and most people can't do that they confuse authenticity with the manufactured form of authenticity that they think is authenticity as opposed to learning who the fuck they actually are and what they stand for and having the courage to share that that's authenticity and and dude um you know I think Trump is an authentic dude and I think Elon's an authentic dude and I think anybody who's on the internet Dana White's a very authentic dude you know anybody who's ever created or led or done something big they're fucking authentic people bro and and I'm a big believer that that's why they got in the position that they're in so you know I just think we need to get to a point we need to get back to a point where we can talk about things critically without yeah without saying oh I fucking hate that guy because of this or that like bro you don't stop defending everything just because you yes god that's even worse that's even worse like the the fucking fine no fall it's even worse it's crazy I don't know what's worse the people who can find no good or the people can find no fault yeah both of them drive me nuts equally stupid to me yeah yeah yeah now man listen we're not for everybody but if we are pinkies up motherfucker yeah speaking of pinkies up do we get that sponsorship yet from uh fuck no beautiful form energy job we just lost cause the fucking country yeah it did yeah that was not an ad the the you know I rallied at the latest board meeting for you know a few shows to get sponsorships but I don't think we made a cut hey they got me more objective man I don't think they want to pay for my I think they want me just you know keep you know what fuck you guys pay me bitch you know it's great you know a flavor so that right you know you know a flavor so that right now fuck grape grape is out now no what do you know what I was just stolen what do you mean do I know yes I fucking know it's my old fucking company bro yes I know it's stolen man it's off the shelves bro we knew it was gonna we gotta put grape in them little fucking no like boxes bro like that so now I know why we want sponsor the show yeah guys let us know down in the comments man with you know what you got it to you well you just gotta you just gotta write a letter in say I think you guys are racist and then we'll get a sponsor racist if you don't sponsor you know that's it then we'll get one now man you know I know that when we sponsor you I see we're gonna be paying for that shit so y'all my fucks better pay me too yeah but guys let's get to a final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up what dumbest fuck this way bring a headline in we talk about it gets one of those two options Andy my man you take supplements right no right I mean just massive amounts of steroids that's it yeah I don't even work out yeah I just fucking just mainline juice mainline it yeah fuck yeah yeah straight into the main my dick main man yeah yeah that's right that's all the

same same same just in pill form now yeah yeah you're drinking with about oh well uh let's dive into this man when uh when we dreamt of a magic pill that could cure everything we weren't weren't weren't thinking of poop heels also known as crap seals oh but these little capsules packed with freeze dried fecal matter have recently shown promise in treating everything from advanced cancer to deadly liver disease some even say fecal transplants in which the poop of a healthy person is transferred into someone else could be the key to crushing it at the gym and reversing some signs of aging but lord forbid you do 75 hard and drink a gallon of water a day that is deadly you know fucking die but we can ingest other people's fucking shit that's completely it that's for our own piss too put

let's see if we could be drink their whole piss call the crap cells yeah let's see if we could be to sun their butts fuck dude let's see if we could be shoot coffee up their ass yeah right like dang dude that's not bad listen man coffee animals yeah Reese's feces Reese's feces that we're probably gonna get to you for that now i'm just saying man like they're in there's somebody's pulling some jokes bro let's see if we can get them to cut off their own dicks fuck dude give them the purple hair dye yeah man this is crazy but there's some research to this so so UK researchers are testing like dude how does that how does that not sound like a joke for real like like it sounds like real mean like joky play on your friends yeah fuck you know fuck dude he's fucked up let's see if we get him a car was sick no no that's too much no let's do it you know like that's some evil shit you know that they're fucking sit back there laughing dude dude he's looking at the dude yeah that guy that guy on the internet that drinks his own pee he's a fucking hop you know like he straight up they hired that dude okay man let's go on let's go on YouTube make some fucking videos and you drink your own piss i bet these will do it last minute we got you bro oh yeah you wrote the two girls one girls one girl that's how that was the predictive programming that was the start of it yeah that's where it started yeah fuck me in but yeah so i mean apparently there's some research to this i don't know they're they're putting freeze dried stool from healthy donors can uproot antibiotic resistant bacteria hiding in patients guts translation someone else's shit could save you from a super bug is a theory so they had a trial 41 patients with recently battled drug resistant infections for splints of two groups one received three sets of these poop pills over three days while the other was given placebo so month later those on the real treatment were found to have healthy donor bacteria successfully colonizing their guts assign the pills may have flushed out the bad bugs quote it's very exciting dr. Blair Merrick the lead researcher at guys and st. Thomas hospital in London told the BBC quote there's a real shift from 20 years ago where all bacteria and viruses were soon to do you harm to now where we realize they are completely necessary to our overall health poo bugs Andy poo pills pro imagine what you're like breath would be like when you burp oh man as nasty yeah brings new meaning to your breath tastes I mean these people the teeth are already fucked up and shit right like that I mean there's not really a lot of dental hygiene bro you ever take like a like like a low quality fish oil supplement bro you'll burp that shit up it's one of the nastiest things ever which by the way first forms fish oil does not see the bottom of it but um who pills I mean it makes sense like putting back to like all the the concepts yes put the healthy bacteria in somebody's body I mean you know I know the one thing I would say to that is that they've known for much longer than 20 years that you need a healthy bacteria it's just they kept that shit in the dark just like they kept you know astral projection the fucking our ability to transmit transmit frequencies to create new timelines and quantum physics they lie to us about a lot of shit um the release it wants to know they can make money well they release it once they know that awareness is coming about on its own and they can make money but uh yeah I mean do you want me to order you something no all right you know what I'm good man yeah yeah good all right my shit's good it is it's good literally yeah it's good all right we're gonna problems thumbs down on this I mean I I'm sure I'm not sure I don't know I don't know what to think to be determined yes it makes I think it makes sense uh huh scientifically sort of yeah I mean it you know does the freeze-drying process not kill the the bacteria in the you know in the in the poop because like over-processing kills the the bioactive fractions of amino acids you know which is why most proteins give you a terrible fucking burps and gas and all that shit so you know I don't know I mean I guess I stand by what I said the theory makes sense yeah but I mean the application of the theory you know freeze-drying I don't know I don't know enough about that sort of bacteria to say yeah yeah but I'm sure if they figure out how to do it effectively it probably probably will work yeah yeah all right well to be determined on this one man yeah but I mean I'll I'll let you guys figure that out yeah let me know we can yeah but guys Andy that's all I got man all right guys sorry for the lack of shows we'll pick up back to normal here for the rest of the week and uh don't be a hoe
