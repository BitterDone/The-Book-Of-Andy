I know you think I know you feel that way because you think that but like no 40's year old dudes ain't fucking no no you're good no no no but it is a difference. It's different. I mean it's a different class for sure. You know like senior citizen. You're not like silver sneakers club bro I got you. I don't know bro fuck man.

Yeah I mean really good I wear a new balance. Yeah. It's gonna be new balance. I'm cool. I wear some of them. Yeah. Yeah I'm like I mean I got honestly thought about getting the gardener 2000s you know I'm talking about. No those are the those are that's not called the gardener those are called the barbecue 2000s you do both though. I mean you can grill all whites. Yeah with the high socks. Yeah. You know Sunday afternoon. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Cut the grass go straight to grill grass staying on the shoe at the grill. Correct. Yes. That's the move. That's called patina. That's called that's called subdivision. That's called safe. No but I mean it's just always it's called safe. It's just always interesting man. You don't have to duck if you're wearing no shoes. You know saying like you hear a gunshot in those shoes and you know that it's not shoe. That's like shooting at an animal or something. Yeah right. You know they're the hunting or it's fourth of July. Yeah you got to worry about it. You were going to be where those shoes you're not worried about nobody stealing your shoe. Yeah. It's like a force field of safety. Why are you in flux with those guys man. You don't fuck dude you don't fuck with those guys. Let me tell you something. No. You do not fuck with dudes that wear shoes like that for this very simple reason. Because if they're going to wear shoes like that you know they don't give a fuck. They give two fuck. They'll fuck you up. They'll fuck a put you in a hole with their grass staying new balances on bro. That's how they got the grass stains. That's where you don't know. You think it's from cutting. Yeah it's from cutting out story. Yeah right. Cutting pieces. You know but it's just always interesting to kind of see the dynamics there. You know stuff that was cool then. You know now it's coming back into play. You know but there are some things that this generation is doing. They're creating some they're pioneering creating some new words. And it's causing some riffs and some places. So I want to bring this in let's check it out. This is an Iowa. So the headline is free speech organization. Torches Iowa classrooms banned words list. So this school had to create a list of words that are banned from being used in the school. Alright and so I just want to say you know kind of go through these and see you know if you guys had any of these words or if this is true like a true pioneering feat of humanity here. Okay so yeah it's causing some riffs so like the free speech advocates they're crying foul play here. I'm saying the school is limiting the free speech of these kids from these words that there are banning in the school. Let's check the list out or by the way if you say any of these words in the school it's a 30 minute detention per minute per word. Oh per word or per infraction here so you can't say Pimp. Diddy party you can't say that Pimp you can't say Pimp. What the fuck is that? Oh Pimp is my favorite words bro. You can't say Diddler oiled up baby oil oil what's that? Skibbity toilet. Skibbity.

It's not like it's not like it's like. You know. It's not like it's the easiest fucking thing to make fun of ever in history. Fuck dude. Yeah. This joke this school is no fun bro. I would want to go there bro you come out of there with no sense of humor. Sucks man. Why you got to ban all this shit bro just let people say what they're going to say if it ends up being stupid it would be stupid they get made fun and they won't say it again.

I mean listen I mean I would be I was known for cursing like on the football field I would yell that all the time by the rafts by the fuck coaches. Yeah. Like I could help it. I'm fucking sorry man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And a lot of this stuff didn't exist. We had different names for these things. I like that. Pimp is making a comeback though. Yeah. Pimp comes coming back. Yeah. Pimp's coming back.

I get pissed and quit and you just fucking yeah. Oh fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah man. How the fuck do you ban words? That's what that's that's the legal thing man and so it's like you know the freedom of speech that's not like aged you know it doesn't like there's not an age requirement. I mean when we were in school bro really you could say anything you wanted but and you could bully people like everybody bully each other that's how you that's kind of how you uh the hierarchy formed you know like if you can't take the fucking bullying then you're you know you got to get tough yeah mentally and call us then um you know the words that we couldn't say were just like the curse words. Everything else would no one ever tried to tell us yeah three balls but they would say like that's a dumbest shit I ever heard or you know that's not very classy or that's that's not how you want to talk. The standard would be set yes. Yeah. That's how it should be man. That's how I said well I mean they're getting some heat you know they try to protect themselves saying that you know they made a statement the school districts at uh in a statement quote our goal is not to censor or stifle student speech but to guide students toward language that fosters a positive and inclusive learning environment. Um that's a rural district man like it's weird like yeah I mean I don't know. Some of the shit's kind of stupid though you know but again it'll weed itself out on it's own. I don't know. Guys tell us what you guys think down in the comments. Let us know um that being said let's get into our headlines remember if you want to see any of these articles pictures links videos go to Andy for sell it. Com guys can check all of the stuff out there for you we link it for you um and so with that being said let's check into our first headline headline number one this is uh this is interesting we talked about this you know Trump's not in office yet um so I have to get to inauguration um but you've said multiple times we talked about on the show that like they're going to make it very very difficult for that transition um and you know here we are uh second week third week of December and uh here we go so um check this headline out Democrats hastily trying to push through bill that would cost average couple twenty five thousand dollars ahead of Trump's presidency um so there's this new bill this Omni bill that they're putting in it's like thirteen hundred pages or some shit like that um that they're trying to push in right now um with a lot of stuff tied into it and one of those things is this this uh measure of it um Senate Democrats are rushing to push through a social security reform bill ahead of Donald Trump taking office one group estimated would cost the average couple twenty five thousand dollars in benefits now the Social Security Fairness Act with repeal to provisions that currently reduce payouts to public sector employees like cops firefighters teachers and US Postal workers now the committee for a responsible budget um a bipartisan think take argued this change would make Social Security insolvent six months earlier than current projections um so as a result we estimated typical dual income couple retiring in twenty thirty three would see their benefits cut by an additional twenty five thousand dollars with additional eight thousand dollars of that uh coming in roughly half a year of advanced insolvency so you know you got that the taken money that's not the biggest thing you know the other thing is included in this bill they're giving themselves raises so let's take twenty five fucking grand from people who are already struggling to make ends meet and let's give ourselves a fucking wrote every single one of these people should be in fucking jail yeah it's so crazy man and like that crazy dude it's tyrannical oppression financially and this country people always say oh we live in the freest country in the best country blah blah blah no the fuck we don't that's not real shit that's a delusional fucking line that they tell us all growing up so that we want question what's actually going on when we pay upwards of fifty sixty percent of our taxes all in for our to live here okay that that is fucking wrong the government is designed to protect us the government is designed to protect this country and keep us safe and really that's fucking it and it's become this all encompassing mammoth of an operation where we're supposed to work more of our lives for them then we work for our own families that is not fucking free dude and so we need to quit saying oh we're so free no we're not we're financially oppressed slaves of this country and until our taxes go down to a reasonable amount like ten percent might be reasonable okay I'm not talking like down ten percent I'm like talking ten percent all in total and the government is built to operate on that ten percent until we get to that we can't talk about fucking freedom okay because we have families in this country who are suffering financially really more than they have in the last forty years and these people are want to take more money from them yeah like dude fuck all of these people well I think there's like I mean like listen out it may not be a popular belief right but like I mean just on a pure business side right like let's say you have an employee they do they don't even do the bare minimum right like they're still in a bunch of shit they're doing a bunch like you don't give them a raise you take away you you fire their ass or you fucking demotum or you demotum you know you don't fucking like what no but well here's what they're thinking they're thinking well shit the cost everything went up yeah everything's you know that my salary that I fucking make didn't go as far no shit it didn't go as far for everybody else either right and you're not the priority you're a fucking civil servant you are not the priority the priority is the people like dude we need some real leadership bro I really really really hope that Trump and Elon and Rama Swami and these guys get this straight I know Vivek agrees what I'm saying because I've talked to him about it but like bro I really hope they go in and fix this because dude if they don't it's just another failed four fucking years our biggest problem in this country is the financial oppression that comes from our tax system yeah you want to stimulate our economy you want to create an amazing country you want to create wealth the opportunity for you know happiness and success and all the things that we're supposed to have here in this country um life liberty in the pursuit of happiness you want that shit you lower the taxes to a to a reasonable point 10% all in and you make the government operate within whatever that is you make everybody pay it poor people pay it rich people pay it companies pay it everybody pays the same you're all required to pay if you don't pay you can't vote and we make some other rules about that whatever I don't I haven't thought all the way through but the point of the matter is is that until that happens we're not free and it needs to happen if you want to fix shit that will fix shit that will fix almost everything just that one thing but we have so many blood sucking fucks in our government system and so many bureaucratic lazy fucks when was the last time you went to a courthouse or a fucking licensed bureau or some place where you had to get something done and it was run efficiently right where it was easy and it was smoother than it was fast no that's not what you get when you go into those places most of the time you get some fat fucks sitting on the fucking ass not doing shit and acting like you're not even fucking there right like you're just you're fucking inconveniencing them for whatever it is and you got to sit there for two hours while they fucking stuff their face with Doritos like bro that's the shit we're dealing with and then they have four people for that same job and they're all sitting there talking and then they put their little sign up it says come back in an hour right no fuck you like don't you dare say shit to them or get there seven hours yeah right yeah like bro it's just it's the wrong culture it needs to be fixed it can all be done through blockchain technology every fucking license every renewal we need to eliminate 90% of the license you require anyway that's a whole another thing or phone but the point is is that all this shit could be done with like it's not our job as the taxpayers to provide security for this massive government of of unnecessary fucking labor force yeah those people should be required like everybody else to go out and be productive not sit on their fat fucking ass while you're trying to get something done and they just fucking treat you like your shit when you're paying for their salary bro like this has to be fixed dude or the country will never be fixed well on the other side of that coin though man and like that's why this might be an unpopular belief but like bro like if if if we had a very efficient government and we had i don't care if the salaries was a million i wouldn't care at that point well you wouldn't you wouldn't you you could do that because the mother there would be only fucking a hundred of them well that's what i'm saying but like like if they were actually doing the job that they're supposed to be doing i wouldn't care about this increase nobody would care because we'd be so happy about the the results of the fucking work there you know i'm saying like the inputs should equal the out imagine your business like losing you know you got a hundred million dollar business and it's losing fucking ten million dollars a year every year and you're getting people raises it's wild yeah it's wild you know another big issue too that a lot of people and you kind of hit on them and but like it's it's not like you know people and it's an ignorance a lot of times because if people really truly knew like how deep and common-looted and departments within departments and sub committees and all these fucking things that get these ridiculous budgets right and that's another big issue man like one of the things that they're also pumping into this bill i'm not sure if you saw this uh... but this continuing uh resolution bill is going to fund this state department agency that was the pinnacle of all of the twitter files that they said was not supposed to be happening no more supposed to be going to the wayside yeah they're getting a bump and pay to the tune of about seventy five million dollars um which originally it was sixty million uh when the agency was first created now they bumped it up by almost fifteen million um i mean this is the one that Matt Tijibi who did all the the twitter files reporting like this is what that when you're talking about who was doing this shit it came out of this direct agency this was the link between social media and our government the portal all of that stuff was created through this agency which is a violation of first amendment because through proxy they were censoring 100% yeah you know and so it's like you know like uh but like that's included in this bill right the global engagement center has been included in page one thirty nine of the continuing resolution um and although it doesn't specify its budget allocation a previous inspector general report shows the agency's twenty twenty budget total seventy five million of which sixty million was appropriated by congress um you know so like like they keep putting this shit in man and it's just like a what point uh do we say stop you know and and like I said I mean along the same line as you man I just hope that when Elon and and and and vape get in there bro they fucking him or all of the shit out yeah you know like the another question is like I mean it's gonna be a massive surplus of money in that sense what does that money go to does it start going to you know paying down the fucking debt like I don't know I'm not an economist I don't know how that shit works but I mean it needs to happen bro and he's that and guys fucking bullshit jump in on this combo yeah and start being vocal about the real shit that we need to fix like this you guys get to strut everybody in the country gets distracted through all these things and they don't ever talk about the things that are very obvious like why do none of these politicians talk about this tax why do they not talk very few of them talk about it you know why because that's how they make the fucking money yeah that's how they're able to pay the friend that's why they don't teach you about it and fucking high school dude they don't teach you about taxes they don't teach you about personal finance because they don't want people to know how bad they're getting fucked you know it's one of my favorite clips of of Trump I think it was during the Hillary debate in 2016 and she's like he doesn't pay his taxes and he uses a tax loophole he's like yeah the same one is that you and all your donors you know like they all use the same fucking shit yeah I'm saying is like I'm like damn I mean I can respect you at least say it yeah yeah I'm saying but like if you don't understand the shit you get taken advantage of even if even if we were paying the exact amount now and this place look like fucking Dubai I don't think people would say shit no cool that's what I'm saying yeah give yourself a fucking raise cool it's not that bro people would be okay paying 50% of their fucking tax if when they walked outside it was clean and nice and beautiful and safe but it's not it's not even close to that no nowhere near it man nowhere near it but with that let's go check some comments out chat see what this uh let's see what these comments look like the chat yeah let's go to the to the chat uh this first comment is from uh at christian kelly 90 46 he says uh was interviewing a guy for a job yesterday in my office I

guys saw this out there I thought this was interesting there's always something deeper going on too um but Ukraine kills Russian chemical weapons chief Igor Karilov in Moscow you see this yeah so this is interesting so a top general uh top Russian general accused by Ukraine of being responsible for the use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops was assassinated in Moscow by Ukraine's SBU intelligence service on Tuesday morning in the most high profile killing of its kind to the general Igor Karilov who was chief of Russia's nuclear biological and chemical protection troops was killed outside an apartment building along with his assistant when a bomb hidden in an electric studer went off uh Russia's investigative committee which probe serious crimes said um an SBU source confirmed to roaders that the Ukrainian intelligence agency had been behind hit quote the liquidation of the chief of the radiation and chemical protection troops of the Russian Federation is the work of the SBU the source said um so this guy is right outside of this fucking apartment mom goes off on the scooter kills him him and then this is um now you know Russia's intelligence is pretty good they're pretty quick when it comes to that stuff so they got a guy they have a suspect detained um in this they uh just announced today at the time of recording um that it had detained an ooze-back man who had confessed to planting and detonating a bomb which killed um the general um in Moscow uh so here's a picture of uh of the guy this is him um meeting it uh this guy did it yeah looks like they put a little beat on him yeah they always do yeah they always do should have been worse um but you know and then he directly said uh that uh he was he was uh ordered to go to Moscow and carry out this assignment for Ukraine's intelligence services um so they have that now so this guy's dead either way now oh I mean he's fucked yeah yeah he's he's fucked you know you're dumb mother fucker you know uh you know but but but there's always something deeper what do you think happens to these guys you think they fucking play call a duty enough and then they're like fuck I want to be a spy and then they're like fuck yeah I want to pull like they watch all these movies and shit and then like they're not they end up like that yeah bro listen I've seen some pictures of shit of like what the Russians do oh they're gonna pull all his fucking fingernails and his toenails off bro I'm gonna pull hold on I didn't know what they're gonna do yeah people don't understand they're gonna pull your fucking fingernails off pliers each one one by one then they're gonna fucking pull all your teeth out one by one then they're gonna cut your tongue out then they're gonna cut your fucking fingers off then they're gonna cut your toes off and they're gonna cut your dick off that's what the fuck happens these guys bro I've seen I've seen pictures man and like like I mean I'm talking about upside down stools roomsticks going in places yes I mean bro there's shit you could think it's ruthless yeah it's ruthless but it sets its home it's set the tone you know what set the tone that's what we ought to be doing here to pedophiles I will do it so I'm the man for the job roomsticks and all dude you do all that shit and throw them in the wood shipper bro they'll be begging for the wood shipper it won't even be against their will yeah right they'll be asking for it you know it yeah yeah I mean listen it's at the tone that's all I'm gonna say set the tone nobody would be fucking little kids anymore they knew that that was the fucking punishment they wouldn't do it not well I mean like do you think the next Ukrainian spy like seeing this shit no one was gonna have like how eager is he gonna be to see a role of like having motor scooter up you know I'm saying it's at the tone but here's a thing man like there's always something deeper there's always something deeper always and you know the initial thing that came out like going back to the original article they were saying that Ukraine had accused this guy this general of using chemical weapons on Ukrainian troops right that wouldn't it that wouldn't it you know you know the importance of this general here this ego or krill off you know why he was so important we have to go back to to to 2022 and we actually reported on this guy this one they blew him up or crashed his plane or something no that was a different guy okay um but we we talked about this guy on a cti back in 2022 um this general is the general who accused the United States and our Democrats of funneling profits from those secret secret Ukrainian bio-lapse to fund their elections remember this chart right here yeah bro that was him that was the general that general created this and he's the one that blew the whistle and and and and talked about all of this shit and he just got assassinated right outside of his home by Ukrainian and going to stop what's going to happen to these people it's not gonna I mean yeah the cabal here in the United States they're fucking done no I mean like I mean there will be a black swan event in the next fucking 30 days yeah I mean dude cuz I mean everybody's talking about it bro like I mean I get buddy Sean Ryan has an awesome podcast love Sean Ryan he's just fucking dope he lit legitimately people don't understand how good of a dude that guy is they see him on the show and he asks a questions and he's a good guy but like that's a good fucking dude this is a solid dude yeah you know but you know and and and he

talking about the shit very open like in like the problem is nobody's listening to her you know I'm saying like and she has the fucking intel on this stuff and nobody's trying to take her serious you know but like I mean it's it's it's just so crazy to me like I mean just this I mean even this system right right here the optics of it you know I'm saying this guy blows the whistle calls out Obama

already out there yeah to your point yeah I'm saying so like that doesn't stop this like the information has already been put out we know it yeah you know um so I mean dude it's it's it's just interesting times man it is interesting times um I just thought that was so so crazy man yeah that is crazy dude so really like I mean he's not the only guy saying this yeah he was just the first yeah like he's because I mean he runs Russia side you know I'm saying like and he was he put it out there he's like no this is what's happening Ukraine well this is also why they don't let us see any of the communications that come out of Russia they don't let us see Putin talk they don't let us see Kriya love talk they don't fucking let us see it and it's for those reasons man it's just wow I mean look like that this is the picture right outside of the apartment where it went off and uh and yeah I mean it's just wild though wild look there's this body yeah yeah I mean this is you ever look at you you like looking at dead bodies how do you two man like when I see pictures like the answer I mean I don't I mean like the gory videos and shit like you watch that shit Joe I do too I see it what the fuck up what is that it's not like I like it it's just like I can't help I can't well that's why I say like I don't I don't think I would say I like it yeah like it's just like I'm all right cool yeah man I mean it's some crazy shit out there for sure um yeah man guys jump it on this calvo that's what you guys think down in the comments uh let's get to head on number three yeah now I gotta preference this all right we're on a California and we're gonna go to Cali okay all right now now I want to say this before we even get into a bro I per I believe we should just exile California the entire state we give people like a week to get out like the good ones let them out and then just fucking like you know now blow the fault call for me is such a beautiful part of the country bro the reason that everybody goes there is because like the weather is perfecting so like you get all the homeless people and you get all the the the you know the vagabonds and the drifters and because they can live year-round and not be cold right and then and then on top of it you get all these young people that think they're gonna be the next fucking you know Leonardo DiCaprio and if you ask them they're already there you know everybody in L.A. has got a bullshit story about fucking what they're doing and where they are who they know and what a movie in production exactly it's like dude like you spend like literally two weeks there and you're like what the fuck is this place yeah it is full of fucking liars and bullshitters yeah and uh and what I think is that we should reclaim California I don't want to give it to them so let's take all those people okay the ones we don't want let's just throw them over the other side of the wall you know what I'm saying fuck them. Fuck them dude like they're fucking ruined the country yeah I mean they are they are if you don't pay taxes and you fucking them making the country worse fuck out mm-hmm I'm with it listen I'm with it I mean I I haven't seen enough for I've seen a little bit of California I mean I'm just an hour or we could pick a shitty state and send them there you know what I'm saying but I don't want to say that the shitty state because it's likely not shitty now and then people will be mad that we said it but I mean there's some shitty states yeah I mean I can name a few yeah but let's not don't name them well if we send everybody to New Jersey they'd all fit we get most of the country to be ours they could all fit New Jersey we'll build a wall they got a little ocean front like the worst one in the country and I'm gonna say it like it's nice we can't let them have fucking California bro it's cold California is beautiful yeah Cali California is nice you know what I don't like about California though like I could never live there not like let's just say it was you know safe culturally cool and everything was good new balances I couldn't yeah I couldn't fucking live there because by the time

12 it's fucking yeah yeah yeah so I would rather I would rather be over here on the east coast you know that way when I wake up at my normal time which is usually you know eight which is late for business right but like you know if you wake up at eight on the east coast it's seven here six mountain five west coast so you get the whole day yeah that's real yeah it's real because California's

woman to tell me no man but it gets worse bro it gets worse in California okay it's not just you know uh overweight fat sex activists okay that Californians I want you to look at this at like district attorney forced to refer to male rapist as she heard in California court it's insane bro what the fuck is happening out there man that's what I'm saying like just annex look bro the the the the woke culture is done and they're still trying to hang on to they not realize that no like this is where it comes from yeah that's where it comes from bro it comes from California fuck man everybody else is just like fuck California California to keep doing California shit bro yeah I just don't get it man it's like yeah like this is crazy listen to a California district attorney along with other participants in the court including witnesses and victims are being forced to refer to a convicted male rapist using she and her pronouns 51 year old Traumae Carol a biological male that identifies as female and was incarcerated in a women's prison has been charged for allegedly raping women in prison and as facing charges including two felony counts a forcible rape and one count of dissuading a victim uh witness excuse me um he was removed from the Whitman uh women's estate um but during a preliminary hearing Carol asked his attorney to require the prosecutor to refer to him by his preferred pronouns of she heard I think I think the people who allow biological man to go into a women's prison should go into the opposite prison of what they are as well and have to live for like a year yeah you know I'm saying like if you think it's a good idea to put a biological man in with women because he's gonna tell you he's a woman you're a fucking idiot and you're you're a you're a danger to society and those women were raped because and it doesn't matter if they're criminals no this is the right no it's not right those women were raped because people wanted to seem virtuous on the outside of the fucking prison and that is fucking wrong you want to say it's fucked up because someone wants to say I'm open-minded and I'm virtuous and I'm on this team women are facing life ruining life altering traumatic events and these people go home and think they're good people dude now I mean to be fair I'm sure dudes get raped in prison too right like yeah but it's by other dudes like you know I'm saying yeah that's that's kind of like the prison fucking hierarchy like if you don't want to get raped don't fuck around yeah or learn how to fight or whatever you got to do I mean and men kind of understand the hierarchy of primal fucking control right you know like at least men of my age do you know like like if I go in there and you know I don't fucking fight and I don't fucking handle shit and I don't treat people right politically you probably gonna get fucked up you know keep your fucking mouth shut keep your eyes down stay to yourself stick up for yourself it's pretty fucking simple don't drop the suit yeah don't be in there for molesting kids yeah I mean oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know but I mean listen I mean it's just crazy man that's why that's why I was saying just in next the whole state bro I know it's beautiful and all but I mean if we can get them out of New Jersey then brother is like mostly people in California aren't with this shit either man yeah you know I'm saying like I see other thing that it's like because like we went out there we're I think they're cheating the elections just like they just they cheated the election in 2020 I think they've been doing that in California for a long time yeah it's just like because like nobody's with it now you go pull people in the streets now like this is fucking stupid you know I'm saying but then it's like but then like why is this so common out here though you know I mean we got plenty of listeners on the show from California yeah like yeah not to do it normal right you're Mike Taylor who fucking awesome dude he's from Cali you know I don't know if he likes uh bread at glizzies but um it's just weird man I don't know guys jump it on this combo tell us what you guys think uh down in the comments I was that being said let's get to our third or let's get to our final segment sorry we got thumbs up or dumb as fuck that's where we bring a headline there we talk about it it'll get one of those two options um this one's interesting not not really shireen got bears today no bears no bears squirrels squirrels I had a raccoon this morning really I think it was like had rabies or some shit it's like outside my house like what's it doing walking on sidewalk so what made you think you had rabies the eyes were kind of blue what does that mean I don't know like I mean it was just a good looking raccoon but in the morning aren't they supposed to be like moving around at night and shit I mean yeah but you I've seen him during the day yeah it was it was acting fucked up though yeah yeah like it just stole something yeah like it needed first form energy you know that was terrible I don't know it was pretty bad why don't you give it your best shot let's do this again I don't know if I can recover from that yes we're not going to let you do that so it's your time to do the ad do the ad you know that record I'll be keeping with that my fucker do it we need we need we some product placement got a plug see what you got uh you know I was thinking about that raccoon man you know and I'm like man that's raccoon would have been just fine if it had some screaming freedom not of that that's it that's all I got man you're for real that's all you got once you got man you guys on that man I was you know I looked outside today and I saw this raccoon and he he looked a little crazy but I think he was just thirsty and so I happened to be drinking one of these amazing first form energy drinks best energy drink in the history of earth and I took a little dropper and I got some out of there because you look thirsty yeah and I put it and he drank it up bro and that raccoon he fucking and I am not bullshitting you he fucking started to fucking fly and he flew away yeah and then he waved at me when he was going by so thanks for the first form energy Andy yeah and I said you're welcome buddy hmm I had it good so get yourself some of this bro because I'm gonna tell you right now it's gonna turn your day around yeah how about something like that that was good I let me try I had a raccoon this morning and I was drinking the grape one my fucker stole it the coon stole my grape in a oh dude yes like that that was good that was a lot better in this well fucking storage for good that's what I'm talking about that was actually better than mine yeah we got squirrels baby we got squirrels from the thumbs up man let's check this out California back to California actually we didn't we didn't leave uh there's where it's shit so even the squirrels are realizing that they are no longer vegans and vegans are not good for you California squirrels are eating another rodent for the first time new study finds squirrels are no longer vegan in California so we got like zombie squirrels apparently um so traditionally known for stuffing their cheeks with nuts oh wow I don't know a few of those oh see you know what the fuck y'all doing bro hey what no traditionally known for stuffing their cheeks with nuts what the fuck oh see it in look you're coming in hot squirrels can be carnivorous through the recorded instances of the rodent hunting and killing other live vertebrates are rare with few species known to have done so now scientists have found unprecedented evidence of another type of squirrel exhibiting carnivorous behaviors including hunting killing and eating voles according to a new study the research published Wednesday in the journal of ethylogy is part of a long term behavioral ecology of California ground squirrels project at brian's regional park in contra-coaster county shit say that five times fast uh the project examines how California ground squirrels native to the state's grasslands adapt their behavior in response to environmental changes in this case and increase in the local voe population um so these squirrels are now going around and hunting and killing dude that looks like a different kind of squirrel it looks it looks like a vegan squirrel it looks like a fucking mango squirrel needing protein is what it looks like shit man that don't look like a squirrel from here no no no I scroll I scrolls we got some fucked up squirrels some places too though no bro our squirrels are much bigger than that yeah and like they that one looks like like that that looks like a fucking rabie squirrel it does that does not look like a real squirrel from here that's a squirrel bro yeah he's eating some meat yeah tired of them nets these cheeks he went for the whole meat yeah brother but they're like hunting them this shit like like they developed a whole different fucking you know way of life now man it's so weird it's California yeah maybe we got no fucking squirrels out there man everything's weird in California oh it really is do you remember that lady that was hula hoopin dude no she was whipping herself with a whip yeah that's right that's right yeah she's swinging a whip around and fucking and whipping herself it's weird on the fucking side of the street just give it here I'll do if bro remember all you show you how it's done remember all those fucking trailers and camp camps and all that like bro tense and the fucking Starbucks cups yeah shit on the sidewalk yeah fucking California man I don't know man bro we rented that nice ass house and like you walk outside a house and if the fucking whole street was littered you know what I'm saying like people it's weird how people think like oh I'm in California and like they think they're at the cutting edge it's like yeah no shit nobody else wants to be there yeah nobody you know like saying you're from California is not a fucking bragging no it's like you can't afford to leave there you know sorry California people but I feel like most of the good ones have left maybe I don't know I think they cheat their elections I think most people in California aren't like the shit I think most of them hate new some and I think they all just think like oh well everybody else here votes for this shit so what difference does it make we're gonna we're gonna be this way no matter what so they don't get good voter turnout and if they do the election's probably fudged but I mean dude like I've known I know you know all kinds of people of California people that don't even agree with me on everything at all and they don't like this this the shit out there so I don't know yeah man what we got on these um meeting squirrels meeting meeting squirrels no longer stuffing their cheeks with nuts maybe cool to see kind of I kind of want to see it I give it a thumbs up yeah you know adapting yeah I think it's pro guy do what you gotta do protein's good for you yeah meat prog it's I mean I'm down you know whatever man oh man oh man what guys Andy
