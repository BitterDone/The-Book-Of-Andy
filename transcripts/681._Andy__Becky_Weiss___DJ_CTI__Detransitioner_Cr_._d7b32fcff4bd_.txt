building I think Russian it I am a I'm on 75 hard again last time I was here I was on my first round of 75 hard after avoiding the program like the plague for three years like every excuse in the book as to why I couldn't do it why I didn't need it every excuse and then finally last summer like you know the the lower levels of a downward spiral we're starting to come into view and I was like shit man something's got to change like I got to do something in one morning I was listening to the podcast you guys were talking about 75 hard like you always do and I was like let's do it let's just do it let's full send and since then you know I completed 75 did phase one did phase two back on 75 right now like my life has gone better literally in every single aspect it's been incredible well that's awesome dude if I can you do yeah I know shit you look great killing it dude I'm literally in the best shape of my life and you know the physical aspect of 75 is just like the smallest component of it like the mental changes have been insane like I always heard people talk about how it's a mental toughness program how you can develop so much mentally from it I don't think it's something that you can really understand till you go through it yourself because all the changes are things that I never really anticipated or things that I didn't even think that I needed to change but like I've leveled up in literally every single aspect of my life since going through it and like I haven't even come close to reaching my potential yet so it's cool man I'm in it I think I'm gonna

irreversibly damaged hmm have you seen this no I haven't seen there's a lot of stuff going on put this in here just because Becky's on here what would that what do you try and say huh what I make fun of trans people online almost every single day yeah yeah I know that's because I'm just saying like I wasn't it's it's it's hilarious yeah they ask for it well they're assholes yeah for the most part I mean yeah real talk like I mean look like you said yesterday I don't have a problem with trans people but a lot of them are fucking assholes yeah that's like I mean it's the truth it's the truth it's not that I hate trans people I don't like do what you want I hate mental illness being celebrated on social media yeah yeah worlds collide every single day yes every day yeah and and dude the the bullying that goes on like towards regular people like you accept this you do this you play our game or you're a fucking piece of shit fuck you fascist like dude I'm so sick of hearing this shit man fuck off how about that how about fuck you mind your own business out my my own business and we can get along we could sit at the bar and have a beer I don't give a fuck that you're a dude and you want to dress as a girl or be a girl I don't care but what I do care about and I would care about this from anybody is you jamming your life perspective down my throat and saying there's something wrong with me if I don't fucking go along with it could you imagine that conversation the other way like going to you know like like that even with just like the over the over like fucking just down your throat just with just with the LGBT stuff together right I mean it's like three months and all of this shit could you imagine if roles were reversed and a straight person is like going up to a gay person and like all dude pussy so fucking great like you know I'm so happy I'm straight do you see me you like could you imagine if that was flipped I couldn't even fucking imagine it no it would be ludicrous um but they they do it because they act like they're the most oppressed group in the world right now they're not the most oppressed group they're the most celebrated and uplifted group their privilege group protected privilege protected celebrated all of the thing they're 60 fucking holidays for them 60 60 days out of the year I thought it was more than that well I don't think that includes the month you know because you got the entire month of June and now you have the entire month of October and then you got all these days sprinkled throughout the entire year yeah yeah I think it's higher than 60 well yeah regardless I don't do math shut the fuck up I don't not not good at math um but yeah let's let's check on this so uh because this is an interesting story and this is I got some other stuff with this but uh a former transgender person who is detransition crashed a Disney's shareholder meeting on Wednesday by calling into the public line and accusing the studio of pressuring young girls into undergoing sex change procedures quote Disney has become the Ursula that is stealing the voices of thousands of little areas uh Chloe Cole told CEO Bob Eager uh here's the video we're gonna have to she limit the presentation to two minute at most there are others open now good morning I am Chloe Cole patient advocate for dune alarm a group that seeks accountability in the medical profession I am presenting proposal number seven titled report on gender-transitioning compensation and benefits sponsored by national legal and policy center Disney pays for gender-transition interventions but not detransion and care therefore the company discriminates based on gender identity under EEOC regulations I speak from personal experience as someone who was deceived and physically harmed at a young age by gender ideology validated by the medical industry and pushed the masses by corporations like Disney influenced by modern media and social networks I began a transition to mail at age 12 by age 16 after practitioners I trusted and encouraged me to take puberty blockers and get a double mastectomy I tried to come back to reality but it was too late my body has been irreversibly damaged and years later my chest is still in bandages my doctors have abandoned me your doctors look and shrug as a result I am suing those professionals who steered me into taking these destructive steps that have permanently scarred me but Disney in its arrogance has responded to our proposal by stating that I am only trying to generate attention for a limited agenda mr. eiger disney under your watch it's pushing the limited agenda of gender ideology Disney has become the Ursula that is stealing the voices of thousands of little aerials across the world by telling us that we can be something that we can never become the lawsuits are coming sir it's only a matter of time before current or past employees whose bodies and lives have an irreversibly harmed will show up at your door looking for justice and rest restitution please vote for proposal number seven yeah see us so Chloe Cole that's fucking horrible wow you know in 12 years old are you familiar with her in her story no okay she's phenomenal she's one of the most vocal detransitioners out there right now she's been on the absolute leading edge of people speaking out against what's going on she is just absolutely phenomenal but yeah she went through a very very young detransitioned and now like she is on a mission to end this very very vocal yeah yeah I mean it's awesome and the stuff that she's referencing her I mean her we've covered a lot of the stuff on the show also you know but like you go back in time and you look at the stuff that Disney was pushing you know with this animated children series called Baymax that came out where this character was buying you know who who presented as a male was buying menstruation tampons and pads you know I'm saying this is for a kid show you know and so there's a lot of damage there and the interesting thing is that you know something that just came out I believe yesterday actually was a study that came out this headline reads most gender confused children go out of it landmark 15 year study concludes as critics says shows being trans is usually just a phase for kids and I think that's been the most the the biggest thing right because there was no long-term looks at any of this right it's just like okay well like oh you feel confused or you know little boy puts on his mom's high heels and it's like okay cool cut it off right and there was like you know there was no long-term looks of the effects or any of that stuff and the study apparently has been going on for 15 years just just got released and it's showing yeah no like it's just a phase no shit out of it right yeah just like goth was a phase just like these spinsters yeah but dude the problem is is that when these people are 25 years old 30 years old 40 years old and they want to have a family they can't have one right right it's a phase irreversible that's a listen to exactly Becky what's your take on this I think it is extremely predatory I posted about this not that long ago because if this was going on whenever I was young I probably would have fallen into it because you were a tomboy right yeah I've been a tomboy my entire life like I ran with the boys I wanted to be like the boys you know but I was not a boy but I think it's incredibly predatory to children who are awkward who don't really have a social status something to belong to maybe they're not good at sports they are not popular and it gives them something unique about themselves they become unique they get attention and suddenly they become part of a group so as predatory to all these kids who don't really have a sense of belonging then they come into this it gives them some sort of personality it gives them a sense of belonging it gives them a community it gives them something to identify with which all children want right kids want something to identify with some with adults but these children who are trying to figure out who they are and they don't know who they are yet it's a very easy pathway for them and it's predatory right and I can't pass up the fact that this is propagated by of course the medical industry because it's extremely profitable these are lifelong customers these are hundreds of thousands of dollars and you are going to be a patient for the rest of your life so I think that there is um and I'm not trying to be dramatic here but like it is evil the idea is being pushed to grab all these vulnerable children who don't have a sense of community and belonging it gives them community gives them belonging and then they have them for the rest of their lives yeah I mean I think that's the dangerous part it's like how can how can any good be you know this idea is oh you know we're affirming them we're taking when when the profit margin that they have in this industry this is not like you know a couple of million dollars a year industry we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in this industry the profit margins are huge I mean anytime that you can put a lifelong uh lifetime long customer in that system you cannot argue and tell me that there's anything wholesome or good about it doesn't make sense I think that when it's all set and done I think this will be one of the biggest crimes so to speak against humanity that's ever happened ever and I think the doctors who perform these surgeries and encourage these kids belong in fucking jail and that not jail for a year they belong in fucking jail forever I say fucking monsters I say do the surgeries on them yeah no shit dude that's what I say but uh but speaking about this you know it's just a phase thing I thought this was interesting bro those little kids are victims man I want to know like when we speak out against this trans ideology you know we get we always get people that are like oh you're fucking big no these kids are victims bro you're stealing their childhood you're forcing them to read books about you know that are not appropriate for kids that promote things that are not factually true like a man can be a woman and a woman can be a man you're confusing the fuck out of them you're creating a scenario where they they want to be something that they're not which you know is not a good place for them mentally they're stealing their childhood they don't get like dude when I was a kid brought in thinking about this shit right I wasn't like dude I was like 11 or 12 or 13 years old before I like even saw like a porno you know I'm saying like a magazine you know like these kids are seeing this shit in a dumb down way and three years old and then you got some of these psycho parents that fucking have a baby and they're like oh my baby is trans you're fucking baby is a two months old the fuck are you talking about like this shit is insane and so when people speak out about it people should understand just like when COVID was going on just like when all this shit's been going on the last four years people were trying to protect people they're trying to stop this from happening and what's going on with the children our education system when it comes to this trans gender ideology is unacceptable yeah it's unacceptable and we as society should be ashamed forever accepting it at all in my opinion two things that I think are important to note number one I do believe it is modern day conversion therapy if you have a more feminine boy they're telling him that he should have been a girl and more of a tomboy kind of girl like myself saying hey maybe you're supposed to be you know a boy right which neither is true but number two and I don't know if you guys know this or not but transgendered individuals are up to six times as likely to have autism so essentially it is didn't did you not know that I know that okay so trans individuals are about six times more likely to be autistic then you know non trans individuals so is a really strong correlation between autism and being transgender or not identifying with your own gender so one of you look at it under that scope modern day conversion therapy right you're telling you know what's not okay to just be gay or a little bit you know different you got a transition but also it's captivating major like for the majority autistic individuals autistic children that's messed up like what does that remind you of maybe Germany yeah the Vimar Republic exactly yeah that's exactly what it was and then you got Joe Biden on TV saying Berlin in the 1920s and 30s was the hub of gender I yeah no shit yeah and it's like what do you know the the whole autism thing gets put like really far under the rug right people do not talk about that but I think it's extremely important one of your dealing with autistic individuals that you cannot affirm their their delusions about their gender in all they're being did all that's being done is that they're affirming them it's it's disgusting these are kids who need help not conversion yeah well I don't think people understand either this is all part of a communist subversion okay and a depopulation agenda they do not want people to to continue to produce so they push a lot of this ideology knowing that a large percentage of the people will not be able to produce they're confusing people they're demoralizing people they're removing the sense of reality what is true what is not true what is fact what is not fact and they're doing so for the for the for the purpose of globalism and like people have a hard time tying that together because they just look at it surface level but this is this is already happened in history this happened by communist in the 30s and Germany this was the same shit they tried to pull then they're trying to pull it now and it's got to come to a fucking end yeah I mean there are lots of different things that are going into that you look at the TV for probably the last 10 15 years where all of these men are kind of doofuses the data is portrayed as we he's a doofus he's stupid the mom is the rock star of the house and then they're demonizing kind of the um you know the normal standard family yeah the nuclear family if you will yeah demonized as going away men are being you know in the black community they're actually being incentivized to remove the father from the household yeah so the nuclear family is being demonized religion being demonized men are losing their masculinity and then we have the gaiest generation that has ever existed now coming up because they're all being force fed all of this you know gay propaganda yeah and whenever you tie all those things together it becomes very clear the goal to depopulate the earth and slow down repopulation you know what I'm saying yeah yeah yeah we look at these things individually is like oh okay that's just a TV show right we're talking the grand scheme of things you put all of those fucking dots together you're going to get to pitch it's propaganda the picture yes it's a social initiative people don't understand dude they look man do you think cancel culture was an accident no do you think political correctness like not being able to say what you know to be true because it offends certain individuals do you think that's an accident do you think it's an accident that they branded silent majority to be some sort of virtuous thing look dude these are social constructs that are intentionally installed in our society for a reason and the reason is is because they don't want people to reproduce they want people to be quiet they want people to be weak they want people to be dependent because when they're dependent on them then those people have the power all the time and that's what they're trying to do and when you look at COVID and you look at all the other things that have happened over the last four years and you look at the transfer of wealth from middle class to the richest people on the planet pushing the middle class and the poverty like dude this is all lining up and people still argue that this is uh bro you just you don't understand what communism is no you don't understand what communism is yeah because what we're going through right now is legitimately a communist subversive and attempt at a revolution you know and that's that's what's happening and communist don't go around saying I'm a communist like the Antifa people it's a fucking behind the doors thing that's what like uh if they were communist when they say they're caught no they're not going to say that um back to the Disney thing real fast um because it is everywhere in Disney and Disney has been very vocal about you know having a gay agenda it is sprinkled in so subtly to so many of their cartoons and then some are very obvious they have very obviously like transgender characters or you know non-binary characters but then there's a lot of subtlety going on as well um you know I canceled my Disney plus subscription probably year and a half two years ago I won't let my son watch it anymore like it's just there's so much both subtle and in your face that it's hard to ignore that they are trying to you know get that message into these children's heads and you know plant those seeds very very young oh yeah yeah uh I think something that was interesting like I saw this you know so the study comes out saying that it's just a phase right and we see all of the the the trans athletes right um dudes in the pool etc and I just thought it was perfect timing because it's another article comes out while this article about this stuff being just a phase uh comes out and I don't know if you guys have saw this um bearded trans player who injured a opponent was suspended from rowing team for learing at girls so did you see the uh I know we covered it did you remember the um that uh that that that the man the boy who's playing on the women's basketball team that injured the opponent the female opponent right we cover that here's the video like slam drama going on or something yeah something this guy right here in the middle or here with a beard that's a fucking boy very obvious Jesus very obvious right so apparently um he was looking at some titties he was looking at titties yeah yeah yeah he was in a locker room he got caught looking at the titties not only caught looking at him he said something to you didn't he oh look titties hey man this is why you don't let fucking do listen dude let me tell you this let me tell you the truth people to be boys no people do not understand this they think this is not true when you are a fucking teenage and college age boy man whatever the fuck you want you will do anything to see some boobies fucking anything fucking anything and if that means wearing women's clothes and going in the women's locker room and playing on a women's sports team there are dudes that want to see boobies bad enough that they will do that uh if people do not understand that man this guy right here did it yes he's having the time of his life and you all mother fuckers think this guy is actually a trans this is a fucking man a boy I don't know how old this guy is high school or what uh this was in high school when he got suspended for looking at some titties okay so so so dude all I got to do is change my first name from Andy to Andrea I ain't going to fucking women's locker room but that sounds like a hormone induced fucking plan like that huh that's a thoroughly thought out plan like yes that's hormone enraged plan is what that is what are you talking about no shit that's what I'm saying I don't know it's like man you know what be so fucking cool see some titties all whenever I want how how how can I do this so there are way more of these people in the wild than you might imagine um I want to see one in person okay titties so very brave day jiana first time take it easy ball up very very briefly I downloaded a dating app just because I've been single for a while so I decided to download a dating app and see what's out there right I get on there you would not believe you would not believe the amount of men who identify as women who identify as lesbians were on there that app to die long well I identify as a lesbian brother I'm a lesbian on the inside the shoe tell you oh my gosh it blew that maybe trans I get if I'm a lesbian on the inside because I am no you're well raging do you I don't think you necessarily have to be trans identifies lesbian do you why I know if you say I'm not though you're a big it I am a big it if I yeah that's true well so like these guys want to date women but they but they like look they try to look like a woman yes so they identify as girls identify as lesbians and they're everywhere like I thought I was like maybe I'll catch like one or two but no they're they're everywhere out there so that I don't think it pissed when you won't date them too I mean I would I would assume so I never chatted with any of them because I you know no no I've seen it on on the internet on the internet oh yeah I've seen tick tock videos of men who identify as a lesbian who are like bitching that lesbians won't date them yes dude where are the feminists well most of the feminists or like the quote unquote feminist stand on their side you know why because they support all women right quote unquote all women there's only one type of woman in reality um I wouldn't consider myself a feminist per se never really have uh but I think that we're probably going to start seeing a little bit of a surge of women standing up for women in women spaces you know right now it's a lot of people like myself are like rightly gains people have got really coming on oh do you really yeah dude she's a badass yeah so like she's on the cutting edge of it but I think that we're starting to get more and more it's just right now a lot of women are very afraid to speak up because they're afraid of being called a transphobia or a bigger or whatever the case may be so they're afraid to say like hey no I'm not cool with men being in my space I'm not cool with a guy being in the locker room with me or my daughter or these bathrooms they're afraid to speak up and have that strength but it's slowly starting to build and you know what's sad is we also don't have a lot of men speaking up you know men should also be in the fight to protect women I truly do believe I agree you know I think that you know men have a specific role in society and part of that role is to be the protectors of society um call me old fashion but I do believe that that is true yeah and we have a substantial lack of courage and bravery out in society right now which is why all this behavior is going the way that it is just completely unchecked which links to why they've demasculized men for the last 10 15 years it's all intentional I get it all we both such a hard time putting that together oh I'm and when you look at it on the individual basis it appears it's just this innocent nothingness right it's just what's going on in the world the virtuous things to do right but when you put that stuff together when you take those pictures you put them together that at the same time that this narrative or ideology of feminism and strong and dependent women and all of this stuff is on the rise at the same exact time the demasculization of men right this equality thing that we know does not exist in reality we know that like hey you have a role I have a role they can be complimentary but they are not equal right and like it's what at the same time there's this push for feminism there's also the same decline and fucking throat stop on men and that's done intentionally we take both of those things and you put those together no fucking no no shit that's why the world looks like it does it's aggravating to me all these women who have been so fucking vocal for the last I mean bro I know a ton of them and I don't have a problem with them being vocal on per women I don't have a problem with that they got carried away with the me too shit but you know and now they're suffering the consequences of that because no man will even fucking hit on any woman because every time you did for five years we got fucking yelled at so you guys did that and you're also creating the same scenario that's erasing your own people that you claim to be an advocate for these women are being erased they are losing lifelong achievements and dedications and work and positions in their career and then in their sport and quite impagence in every place in society to men to men with dicks okay and like they're not saying anything the same men five years ago they were saying we're two talks that's right yeah dude it's crazy fucked up shit man dude feminism like real talk is bullshit like because dude if it was real they'd all be standing up for this exactly that like they'd be filling up feminists you got to not stand against this are full of fucking shit they're doing it to fucking

hall and mayor Tiffany Haynard controversy now I've been waiting to to pick this topic up uh because this there's been some ruffling is going on for the last couple of months ruffling some rufflings that sounds like um you know but but I decided to let's talk about this because again it's important that we point out uh when that temperature changes in society right and we're starting to see this all over American and all the cities all over the country where you're seeing residents are finally saying we are done with the bullshit yeah um and I think it's Americans yeah exactly we're Americans we're not black white yellow red Latino fucking gay straight whatever the fuck you we are Americans they have tried to make us think we are all those other things so they can get away with all this shit that they are doing that's making your life miserable once we come together and we realize we are Americans that shit will end yeah and that's exactly what we're saying so I just think it's important to to talk about this stuff address it get some light onto it um and uh you know that this is the right step that uh that's happened so let's dive into this a little bit um this is uh a city near Chicago it's right outside of Chicago uh Pignolinoire Dalton Dalton yeah okay Dalton Illinois it looks like Dalton well I mean that might be how you how you put y'all pronounce it y'all what do you mean you people the old saying goes that you can't fight city hall but in south suburban Dalton residents say they can't even get into their own city hall that comes after some residents was locked out of a village board meeting Monday night Dalton officials are blaming safety concerns but residents are pointing the finger at embellished mayor Tiffany Hayner Dalton's resident Cheryl Hill used her cell phone to document what happened when she tried to get some paperwork Dalton's village hall last week quote what do you mean people can't come in why can people come in Hill has heard saying on the video while a Dalton official stands on the other side of a locked door quote this is a government building I know you all know this is a government building right uh new security procedures went into effect on Tuesday last week the village says uh they're in response to threats against controversial mayor Hayner and village employees here is a clip and because there was also a protest there last night uh his clip yeah guys this board of trustees meeting ended early tonight with four trustees actually walking out abruptly the village clerk left early as well first I want to paint a picture of what all we were able to experience it was very chaotic and to be quite honest with you frankly honest with you it was even scarier times for those of us that were inside of the meeting there were folks banging on the windows and doors of the village hall I'm about 100 residents showed up at the meeting tonight but only 42 residents were allowed inside they had to walk through metal detectors and they were wandered down before I take you inside of the meeting I want you to listen to what happened outside first but at least the majority of the people in Dalton should be able to think like the mayor does she's scary she's absolutely scary why can't we get in our public building to have meetings why meetings being canceled why can't we have transparency was going on with our tax dollars several residents called it on Dalton mayor and Thornton Township supervisor Tiffany Hingert to resign she's been criticized for mismanaging village funds and dividing the board of trustees the meeting comes amid a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint against Hingert a former employee says she was sexually assaulted during a work trip in Las Vegas last year the complaint says the employee was disoriented and unsure how she woke up inside a village trustees hotel room when she woke up about the former employees claims she was when she spoke up excuse me about the claims she was retaliated against she says and later fired the FBI is now looking into village practices yeah so there's been a lot of stuff here she is she's miss they they say it too nicely she's mismanaged tax funds here's one example she had the taxpayers money and she bought a total of three 2023 GMC denali's now the MSRP and this was for her motorcade okay now the MSRP on those trucks are like 97 or something like that but she actually overpaid and each truck she paid them was like a hundred and fifty six thousand dollars which means the money got funneled back kick back to her okay right that's just one example but yes she's under federal investigation right now they've been doing police raids her police officer she's completely taken control of them and she has them attacking local business owners owners shutting them down she's been taking trips to Vegas and all over the country and you know like here's one of her things she she she increased her salary to two hundred and eighty five thousand dollars right and she put in a law that said if she does not get reelected the next mayor their salary has to be kept at twenty five thousand dollars no two oh shit twenty five thousand dollars so yeah it goes from two hundred eighty five thousand and if she doesn't get reelected the new mayor coming in can only make twenty five thousand right that's just one example she spent twenty four thousand dollars at restaurant so on company credit cards using taxpayer dollars in a twelve month span she she booked a first class ticket to Vegas for thirty seven hundred dollars she's mismanaged hundreds of thousands of dollars for the stole stole yeah stole absolutely and the citizens pissed and they're over it now they they did reach out to her office for a comment about all the stuff that's been going on with them locking the doors because they they literally put up a sign on the door that says the building's closed and locked to only employees only or something like that so they reached out for a statement and a spokesperson stated quote access to the Dalton Village Hall has been restructured to protect our staff due to the overwhelming amounts of threats and violence as a result of the continuous misinformation portrayed by the media and internet bloggers who are using Dalton as a means to generate ratings and revenue i.e. clickbait are still interesting how everybody who does something wrong in the internet claims that people are doing it for cloud that's the new claim right they just do it for cloud right no you're a fuckhead right right you're a tyrant and your people are sick of it yeah that's what it is the statement continues says quote our staff and elected officials have received several disturbing communications via email social media phone calls and visitors from across the country as such our security protocols have changed the statement continue quote the safety of our staff elected officials and residents is our top priority and we will continue to work with law enforcement to monitor the situation as it progresses there's Tiffany right there in the middle she also reportedly had a board meeting where she told the citizens that they better pay up and they played that song that bitch better have my money song she literally played that in the town hall meeting bro these are communist people bro yeah no excuse she's in a picture with yeah listen dude people need to wake up to what the fuck's going on these are not just irresponsible people these are people who are intentionally doing things in the face of the citizenship saying what the fuck are you gonna do about it no and the longer that we don't do anything about it the worst it's going to get and it's good to see those people standing up yeah I hope that's a beautiful thing about him I like said what I when I really like about it is that the mayor if you're listening on audio the mayor's black and the people that are protesting are mostly black and three four years ago those same people would have likely defended her because she was black and now we're getting to a point where people are starting to look at the individual regardless of their race which is the American way to do things we hold the individual's responsible not the color of the skin not generalization black people white people gay people no bad people bad people exist in every single segment of society in every single race in every single culture through the history of time for thousands of years and it is low IQ to generalize entire groups of people unless they're communist that they are pieces of shit real talk so it's good to see that are they're not like checks to keep these people in place like with all of this spending obviously she's doing criminal activity how is she still in office yeah so she came in I believe the story was like the the former mayor passed away and then there was like a you know a quick runoff election or whatever she won and then I think their term for mayor was like a it's like a five year fucking term and so she still has like two more year or three more years she looks she up how she is young I don't know how old she is she's probably me know they say about black people but black don't crack black don't crack let me see Tiffany Haneard she is she's 39 oh really yeah 30 yeah yeah um but you know she uh there there's also the story where she took campaign donations from a cancer and remission empowering survivors organization she took campaign dollars from them they donated to her and then she fucking shut down the fucking place because they were behind on taxes or like they missed their taxes or something like that and it caused a bunch of people to miss their cancer screenings miss their cancer cancer treatment she's a piece of shit she's a complete piece of fucking garbage by the way like we only got one denali in our motorcade yeah just one what the fuck and we pay 150 for it no like what the fuck man maybe we need some more yeah I mean yeah taxpayers let's get it taxpayers shut the show yeah man it's just crazy man like I said I just wanted to bring that up because I think it's important like I said we call this shit out um and we see in the temperature on the ground changing um I think it's just fucking awesome to see yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think uh but that being said let's get to our third and final headline head on number three um now we got to go into a little time machine let's go back a little bit um approximately two years ago okay and there was this headline that read uh Biden drains the strategic petroleum reserve okay now this is August 10th 2022 all right um and uh the the the key points in this article is that you know uh says last fall after months of rising gasoline price uh prices president Biden directed the first of several releases from the strategic petroleum reserve despite his action prices remain about 70% higher than they were when he took office uh the SPR strategic petroleum reserve was intended to maintain a reliable source of energy in the event of a catastrophe not to give a flounder in president political cover instead of draining Americans energy reserves uh democrats should abandon their anti-American energy plans and support domestic production now it's also came in uh you know when he banned fracking and he came in the first day and shut down all of the licenses for oil production in the country what was a few months after uh when he did this and November the 2022 the midterms yeah and if we remember the reason he drained these was to falsely reduce the gas prices so that democrats could get a more lenient position in people's opinions uh for the election right so which didn't even work people don't understand what SPR actually is for it's it's for wartime operations and it's for emergency operations and the problem with this being empty is that if shit cracks off we can't fucking go do anything can you see people don't understand it this is where like people are all crazy about the border and they're saying oh the fucking border bro this is actually way more dangerous than the border way more dangerous and it gets no fucking press and so I mean here's an example and I thought this was interesting because it shows you kind of where it's at but this doesn't show you uh the true intentionality behind this right which is like you know again like none of this shit is by accident or coincidence like these are intentional things and so like you know this snapshot here of the graph it shows from uh January of 2020 uh to to July of 2022 and you can obviously see the curve right you know is this like a ebbs and flows like what's the historical you know uh chart look like well I found it for you guys there it is yeah they've always had at least six to seven hundred million barrels uh six to seven uh hundred thousand barrels on what is that that's millions that's millions yeah it's millions I couldn't see it yeah six to seven hundred million seven hundred thousand million barrels right and so I mean that that that puts in a little bit no that's thousand no this six hundred million barrels million is mm not m m is thousand 363.64 million millions that's what that's what the strategic order was I was typically that yeah it's million huh right but here's the problem here's the problem now Biden promise that we would you know refill this that was this problem again that was two years ago that was his promise of the American people um but as of today yeah he's not had long reads Biden administration cancels buyback of three million barrels to replenish oil stockpile um and this is a three million per day that plan that they were supposed to be put in place okay um the Biden administration has cancelled two planned oil purchases aimed at replenishing the strategic petroleum reserve the Department of Energy confirmed Wednesday the planned purchases would have secured three million barrels later this year part of a broader goal to fully replenish the SPRs by year's end the energy department announced the plan by set to be delivered to a Louisiana facility in March quote keeping the taxpayer interest at the forefront we will not award for the buy you Choctaw SPR site in August and September and we'll continue to solicit available capacity as market conditions allow the reason they're not buying it no more is because the standard was too expensive now it's too expensive to purchase all that oil back um which is also called by the inflation and the proxy wars that we you know dumped hundreds of billions of dollars and overseas um you know I think that's interesting because what this means for the American people is we're going to see eight dollar gas prices this summer nine dollar gas prices this summer it's important to realize that they could replenish the reserves for about uh for let's see 30 billion 30 billion 30 to 40 billion and we've spent almost five times that overseas and just the last year yeah how much of we sent to Ukraine at this point like 600 billion or something like that no it's like it's like a hundred and it's over a hundred billion yeah hundred twenty yeah but but let's send all this to Ukraine let's put our equipment uh over there let's send all our see people don't people not understanding they're sending all of our munitions and all of our equipment all of your strategic reserves yes so we're sitting over here with fucking like bare bones in the cupboard military supplies like if people don't understand what that means that means that other countries could come here and fucking invade us and then when you combine that with the migrant crisis and that how many of these guys are military aged males it's possible that those people are already here okay so like I don't think people are grasping how dangerous this this is in the situation we're in if it is what it looks like to me it's very very dangerous and it's dangerous for you as an individual in your neighborhood like you guys are not understanding people tend to brush these stories off not understanding that this story is going to come to your front door well and just to solidify that any this last little uh follow up piece on this and I know if you guys saw this um Anthony Blinken says Ukraine will join NATO it's happening the whole reason the Putin even in you know invade it Ukraine was to prevent them from expanding NATO to the west uh our uh secretary of state Anthony Blinken just said on the organization 75th birthday that uh yeah Ukraine is joining NATO so is this another distraction I don't know um but his official statement said the support for Ukraine the determination of every country represented here at NATO remains rock solid we will do everything we can allies will do everything they can to ensure Ukraine has what it needs to continue to deal with Russia's ongoing aggression Ukraine will become a member of NATO our purpose at the summit is to help build a bridge to that membership and to create a clear pathway for Ukraine moving forward we will see very strong support for Ukraine moving forward with this relationship going forward with NATO uh we were equally focused as I said on the immediate um and on Ukraine's needs today tomorrow the day after to help it with staying this ongoing aggression from Russia they're going to instigate the war no matter what dude like that's the thing like they're going to instigate this war before November whichever way they have to anyway they have to because it's the only way they they can even potentially keep their asses from going to jail or being executed for treason yeah yeah back anything on this I think it's really frustrating that in that article that you read they said you know they don't want to put a weight on the taxpayers right you know that was part of it like oh this is too much on the taxpayers that is such a horsh it and we all know that because how much of our tax dollars are going to these illegals you know New York piloted that program to give all of them how much per month like like 1500 bucks or something like that this per month like prepaid visa cards like we have taxpayer dollars going in so many different directions right now but nothing is being spent to actually protect our citizens or to invest in our infrastructure to invest in our national security it is all going elsewhere so I think that that line to me is extremely frustrating to read to pretend like it's a burden to the taxpayers they don't care about a burden to the taxpayers they're intentionally impoverishing the middle class and making it the people who are low income basically the third world status right now they don't care about the taxpayer dollars that's very frustrating for me to read that all these big omnibus bills and these big funding bills where are they going they're going overseas they're going to fucking Ukraine they're going to Israel they're going to the migrant crisis like every literal every single time it's going to people who are not citizens of the United States our tax dollars should never ever ever ever go outside of this country until this country looks like fucking Dubai where there is no crime there is the most beautiful cities we have a thriving economy with a thriving middle class where people aren't tax to death until we get in that position which those people in Washington will never allow us to be because when we become that we are harder to control we are harder to resist and they have lost the understanding that they serve us we do not serve them right now we are serving them and they are intentionally keeping us impoverished so that they can control this country and stay in power and continue to steal your tax dollars continue to get rich in office which should be fucking illegal okay that's what's actually going on we're dealing with people who legitimately look at us like we are fucking peasants and that we exist as good little worker bees to fund the rest of the world and by the way we over fund the rest of the world so that these people funding the rest of the world get personal kickbacks and walk out of their office worth hundreds of millions of dollars that's what's going on and the American people need to stand up against it and fix it once and for all yeah every single person should be vocal as fuck about the amount of tax that we pay does it really matter what our political differences is can we all agree that we pay way too much in tax can we all agree that these people that go to Washington DC that we elect should be serving our interests and not their interests can't we all agree on that do I want to count you I would be okay paying the tax if our fucking country actually look right no shit you know I'm saying like no shit I would be okay well you go to Dubai bro they look what they've done since 1980 and Dubai right they don't even fucking pay tax and Dubai right okay you have responsible people funding the growth of that area they have no crime they have no litter they have no fucking problems okay you walk down the street at midnight bro you could put a key on your fucking Mercedes or your rolls in the middle of the street and leave it there all night nobody will touch it you know why because if they touch it they get their fucking hand cut off and that's the kind of shit that we need here people don't I'm tired of tolerating this fucking bullshit why as good tax paying citizens should we have to tolerate this criminal element that exists in our society and then be told that we should have some sort of empathy or sympathy for them because they grew up a certain way I don't give a fuck man I fucking work my ass off like most of you guys do and I pay a shit ton of tax and I want to fucking walk down the street not be fucked with I don't want criminals on the street I don't want bro fuck all this this is totally fucked up and bro we've been we've been inched into this to tolerate it other places in the world don't tolerate it and then our own media and our own government look at these guys in the middle east and they say oh they're fucking crazy tyrants no they're not they run an order orderly civilized society which is what we deserve to have here as well and until we have that not a single fucking dollar should go anywhere else but this country that's real shit man guys jump in the comments let us know what you guys think now that they said let's get to our final segment of the show we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck as always this is where we bring a headline up we talk about it again one of those two options and um you know I think one thing that is missing in society there's plenty of violence I don't want to say just violence right there's crime but we write people aren't committing violence that's what it is okay all right that's what it is and so that's what I'm gonna move me up on the list a couple of a couple parts but that's all right uh but yeah so uh we need a little bit more of this I like seeing toxic masculinity I like seeing it I have no problem with it so let's watch a little bit of it I had thumbs up or dumb as fuck hell I reached the wild rangers devils fight as you haven't seen it you see this yeah it's awesome bro it's awesome you know I'm not even I can't even say like I'm a big high I think I've been to like maybe two hockey games and I like awesome right and I don't understand a fucking thing about it it's real simple I like the fighting it's real simple yeah I mean school like you fucking fucking puccos in that bro I get that big horn goes off but like I don't know your beer yeah but like there's the the quarters and shit like what's icing me I don't even know what icing means when you shoot the fucking cake you know I'm saying all right well I'll take you to a game and explain to you it's about the simplest game in the world but what is icing it's when you shoot the puck over three lines without being touched by another player and they play it they blow the whistle the puck goes back in the other end it's made so you can't clear the puck down the down the ice uh-huh and just get the zone get the players out of your zone so like if you're in your end and you want to shoot the puck and get like the activity away from your net you will intentionally shoot the puck down the other end of the ice and then if the goalie touches or another player touches called icing okay and the reason they do that is because they want you're you're basically trying to cheat to get the play out of your out of your zone yeah so so then it's a net but so then they bring the play back and have a face off down by your net a basketball hoop has a net it's a net it's a goal you would be a good goalie you think so yeah I'm flexible no you fill up the net listen hey I could hey I'm flexible bro I can I can you know yeah you are pretty flexible I'm pretty flexible no I can I can let's watch the fight yeah let's watch let's watch some fight well this is the different angle um because everybody has seen the the normal video right it's like more of a you know first person view down on the ice you're seeing that we got we got I got both of those clips this was like a fucking from the up top you're seeing just madness and that's what I think it's great uh here so here's the clip that everybody seen both sides both sides both sides both Jimmy Vc and Lazar good roll has dropped them with Kevin Ball as well now it's five on five I love it and Rimby is changing blows what everybody has gloves off of the garden down to him Miller and John marina there's like five fights going on trying to break up what the can you know what I'm in the Germans still throwing y'all's right Miller got the better John marino down on the other end as McDermott still feeding right to Rimby the other four all done the goalie's fight still going the whole road got in the two two yeah jump and what it starts to this one right here with the durmets that it yeah a couple of uppercuts this is a marathon between Rimby and McDermott Rimby is a new guy and he's fought like every game he's whooping ass we'll do I think six seven oh that fuck yeah we'll see that's it like I know Chris probably like bro these are big dude yeah Chris prong is big dude but uh but like dude the didn't it just start like the game like you're what even two seconds off the fuck the clock and then just got each other these teams hate you that's beautiful to see man I like it here's the full few of the court um again right that's the fuck drink what does say the court I'm sorry there's a lot of black hockey players nowadays isn't yeah it used to be super rare we had one of the only black goalies ever grant fear St. Louis he was awesome there's no black person with the last time for yeah there is that was that possible f-u-h-r that was a nice yeah that's in my line Joe look it up is real shit yes he was fucking awesome huh but here's the full here's like the the from the top what do you call up here then is it still like the what do you call it the difference that's that's always bleeds or it's i view of the rink here it is yeah as soon as the puck drops this is just goes and the crowd loves it of course it's fucking great oh man yeah I fucking love it I love it do these fights have to like have a reason or can they just start fistfighting I don't know that much about hockey either they it can happen both ways so like you can be skating around and like it can just happen but it can like what that what happened there is before the face off they were like hey fuck you they're like fuck you and they're like all right let's go and they did it before the fucking before the face off everybody was on the same page it's almost like everybody no they were talking about it they were pre-talking about it yeah yeah fuck cuz I get was just organized like synchronized in the rest don't stop it they just let it go yeah but there's rules to it too right like I mean like if the guy goes down like it's done right well I mean I usually there's a level of respect amongst competitors right you know what I'm saying like you don't really see you don't really even the baddest dudes that ever played hockey like Bob prober or Tony twist or these guys I mean they didn't like beat people when they were on the ground mm-hmm and Bob prober was a mean dude yeah fuck I think it's great is that why they all miss teeth and shit too fuck yeah it's not from play they get well sticks pucks fists fuck yeah listen dude hockey players are tough as motherfuckers around yeah they're also the most fun to party with because they get fucked up yeah I love it so what are we what are we giving this over I think it's awesome I think it's fucking great yeah I feel like that would hurt really bad to be like bear nuckling someone with a helmet on because all these guys keep their helmets on and you're just whacking their helmets like those helmets are like super they're not like super hard they're kind of like flexible I could I mean the I think the part that would really suck is like your skin and your fingers up you know what I mean yeah these guys don't get the shit though now they don't care I saw the one technique where like you know they're because they both like grab each other yeah you know the punch in here remember you're on skates two punches with his left hand yeah I think that like macy barber shoulder punches yeah bro that's just wild she's badass and 12 yeah I I mean that's the only reason I would go to hockey game as just as he fights yeah yeah don't even care about who wins well if you learned hockey bro hockey is the best sport to watch in person not even compare well I'll tell you this the energy is fuck that's what I'm saying I've been to football games you knew what was going on bro it's like it is by far the best sport to watch in person I love going to the fucking blues games no even though I don't go anymore but I never should let's do it yeah
