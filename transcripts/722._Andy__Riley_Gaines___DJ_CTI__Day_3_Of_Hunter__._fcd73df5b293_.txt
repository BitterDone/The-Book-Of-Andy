on the show quite a bit in depth pretty excited to uh to have Riley gains on the show with us what's happening oh my gosh I'm just thrilled to be on with you guys so thank you this is um incredible thank you yeah we had a really good time covering this whole thing it was great it was a pain in the ass for you we got it yeah much a hashtag some is great yeah hashtag dick and a pool I mean it's like we started that here uh let's just start with this okay because you've been everywhere and this is sort of thrust you into a leadership role for young women which is really cool uh you're very outspoken which I love and DJ loves and I think people love about you um so you show up to swim and here's this man tell me about that I mean you you said it perfect that's that's quite literally exactly what happened um as you guys know I mean being an athlete started training when I was four years old graduated when I was 22 so dedicated 18 years of my life to my sport right the time the sacrifices the hours the work that you put in uh went to university of Kentucky the SEC is the best conference uh have to put that in there uh and I loved university of Kentucky um accomplished some really incredible things things that I will forever be proud of uh 12 time instead of play all american five time SEC champion actually the SEC record holder in the 200 butterfly making me one of the the fastest americans of all time uh SEC scholar athlete of the year SEC community service leader of the year uh two-time Olympic trial qualifier the list goes on but again just to reiterate it's a lifelong journey um uh junior year we'll flash forward dealt with covid which was uh miserable to say the least I was in my sophomore year March of 2020 right about three days before we were supposed to leave for our national championships which is the meat you work all your life for all your life for um gets cancelled we get sent home so we were robbed of an NCAA championships in that way come back junior year after a couple months at home um ultimately ended up finishing my junior year by placing seventh in the country which you know top eight you're an all-american it's it's a it's a pretty high honor but I wasn't satisfied with this I wanted to win a national title which would of course mean becoming the fastest woman in the country and my respective event and so senior year rules around and I am right on pace to achieve this goal about midway through my senior season I'm ranked third in the nation trailing the girl in second by I mean a few 100s of a second nothing really a girl I knew very well because like in most sports your top tier athletes know of each other regardless of where you compete because we've grown up competing against each other yeah but the swammer who was leading the country by body links might I add was a swimmer that none of us had heard of before not me not my teammates not my coaches none of us uh and this is the first time we became aware of a swimmer named Leah Thomas which you've never even seen no you just you see she see the leader boards coming in you're sitting like who the fuck is Leah Thomas I see the name I see of course it's a name I I didn't recognize they were from UPEN which is not a school that historically or has ever produced that caliber of a swimmer um leading the nation again by body links and events ranging from the hundred which is a sprint and all of the free salivants in between through the mile which is of course long distance uh and for those who might not necessarily understand swimming I mean think about that in terms of your Olympic runners that's like saying your best 200 meter runners your best marathon runner it doesn't happen but that's what we were seeing this person and to your point uh had I seen a photo things would have been a lot more clear but we continued to say in the dark until an article came out disclosing that Leah Thomas is actually will Thomas and swam three years on the men's team at UPEN before deciding to switch to the women's team and so when I heard this when I read this I was so shocked naturally we all were me and all my teammates my coaches everyone we were shocked but the feeling I felt really when I read this was like this like sense of relief like oh uh it's a man that's why this person is beating everyone by body links uh and I thought the NCAA would see it how I saw it yeah even more so you know digging into this thing that this was a less than average man at that that's actually probably generous I mean mediocre at best yeah these can smash in the men's defense 400 he was yeah breaking 554th right in the nation the year prior in the same event to again now beating every girl in the entire country but long hold uh the insavally did not see it that way see it the way anyone with any amount of brain activity would comprehend this uh they saw nothing wrong with this and so they announced about three weeks before our national championships in March of 2022 that Thomas' participation was a non-negotiable in the women's category meaning there's nothing we could do there's no questions we could ask no concerns that we could raise SVM athletes uh we were quite literally told we had to accept this with the smile on our face so that was kind of the lead up to that national championships and I'll say like how we felt during this it was I mean we felt I I'm kind of ashamed to admit it but I felt almost curious again knew it was wrong there was never any doubt in my mind that that this was fair or anything like that but it felt like a South Park episode or like an SNL skit or like a Babylon B headline which is objectively meant to be funny right it's like this hyper exaggeration it's it's satirical and I think that's how we were looking at it truthfully like as he as tall as Instagram pictures make him look will he be using our locker rooms is he going to to sandbag his races to make it look more competitive we had so many questions but when those questions were answered uh like I said I felt just I felt ashamed for ever feeling curious or intrigued I felt heartbroken is how we felt that's the response everyone yeah I can't believe that this is this is allowed in any form at all and when we were covering it when it was going on I mean we were covering it as like it was just so ridiculous like how could anyone think this is okay and they're telling you guys that like to not to just say hey just just take it not only just take it they told us we were the problem if we opposed it they told us we were the ones who weren't being kind we needed to learn how to be inclusive I'd go to training literally I'd go to to sensitivity training senior in college I mean 21 years old at the time where they brought in an outside professional whatever that means who sat me down taught me of course how to use she her pronouns oh my god to they you know there was this mock interview setting where they would ask me questions I had to answer the interview questions to their standard or I had to to re-go through the training to which as you can imagine I had to re-go through the training until they were satisfied and and I mean I could speak for hours about the different tactics and ways they threatened us if we even dared to even dared to question what was going on what kind of stuff did they threaten you with they said you'll you know you'll never get a job your employer is going to look you up and and they're going to see that you're a transphobia you don't want that you know Riley you're like social pressure oh for sure got you they said Riley you're going to dental school after this well you won't get into dental school uh you'll lose all your friends you'll lose your scholarship and your playing time oh yeah Riley speaking of that scholarship remember you sign that and when you sign that you gave away your rights to speak in your own personal capacity I remember who you represent remember whose name is is across your cat but across your chest because it's not yours it's ours and we have already taken your stance for you Thomas's teammates they were forced to go to weekly mandatory LGBTQ education meetings to learn about how just by being cisgender they were oppressing Leotamas 16 so they didn't like it either the team their teammates no 16 of those girls sent an email to their administration to you pin expressing their discomfort in the locker room I mean that a change I only had to compete against this man for one week long meet they did it every I mean every day practice 18 times a week they were addressing fully naked in front of this fully intact man so they sent an email to their administration again 16 of these girls expressing this discomfort to which I kid you not the university responded back with if you feel uncomfortable seeing male genitalia here's some counseling resources that you should seek in an attempt to re-educate yourself in the counseling resources were provided by none other than campus LGBTQ education center they even went as far to tell these girls that if they did speak up about this if they said anything in any harm whatsoever were to come towards Thomas's way whether it was physical harm emotional harm self-inflicted for that matter they said then understand your solely responsible and that would make you responsible for potential death and that would make you a murderer and you don't want to be a murderer do you they tell these girls they have blood on their hands he's definitely still got his thing uh well he did at the time he did at the time um and I know this did he cut it off well uh based off of what he posts on social media yeah um he has had the surgery down there now prove it but allegedly oh you want me to because he has his testicles pickled in a jar no on his mantle at his house yeah no how is this not a mental illness like how how are we here this is insane when I find out I'll let you know he put his balls in the mason jar on his mantle you want to see you you got it you don't get it they post it all publicly no fucking way I kind of want to see it ain't I don't look at what you can look I look away I'm gonna look I'm gonna make me a transform you guys you're fine but I want to see it that's fucking crazy yeah um and again but again I'll say allegedly but based off of what his teammates were saying he's still sexually active with women at the time of competing in a locker room yeah changing in our locker room getting fully naked again had no problem exposing himself taking off his women's swimsuit where of course he had a bulge um that's unbelievable to me that that's like allowed at all are you seeing it over there are you sorry you saw it I don't want to see it what did you look up to find that leotanus' testicles is that that's it that's his now like an allegedly like um boyfriend who also identifies as a girl so it's too man but yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's insane man yeah so here we are forced to participate in this fetish that's what this is at the hands of the instable a yes now what was the fuckery with with the actual national championship because the Nate like you guys tied yeah that's right so the first day of competition was the 500 free which is not an event that I typically do and so I watched on the side of the pool as he swam to a national title I mean beating out Olympians beating out world record holders these aren't scrubs okay they're the most impressive and accomplished female summer's this world has ever seen again he beat them by bodylings one second might not sound like a lot of time but in swimming a sport that's measured down to to the hundredth of a second one second is significant he beat the entire nation of girls by two seconds even the time he went that season would be every girl in the nation the next season by two seconds um he became the first man when a division won instable a women's title yeah trouble laser um but he and I competed against each other the next day in the 200 free so of course you know get on the blocks dive off swim eight laps of freestyle touch the wall at the end I look up at the scoreboard and almost impossibly enough we'd gone the exact same time down to the hundredth of a second meaning we had tied uh which is I think number one incredibly embarrassing for a six foot four man you couldn't even beat me uh but two it's rare right going the exact same time down to the hundredth um doesn't happen that often when you're racing for a minute and 40 ish seconds uh that's what I call divine intervention yeah yeah because we get out of the water uh we go behind the awards podium where the NCAA official looks at both Thomas and myself again Thomas towering over me and this official says great job you two uh but you tied and we really have one trophy so we're gonna give the trophy to Leah sorry Riley you don't get one uh I was you know my heart rate was still high having just competed my adrenaline was was still pumping and so the first thing that I thought ended up being the first thing that I said and I looked at this official and I was like isn't this everything that title nine was passed to to prevent from happening what do you mean you're gonna give the trophy to the man and the women's 200 free uh to which he didn't have an answer they didn't give him a script of what to say when someone asked why and so he's well uh the first thing he said was well we're just doing this in chronological order to which I said okay uh do you mean alphabetical because G comes with four T otherwise I have I mean what do you mean chronological about even in the alphabet like the LGBT LG oh so true so true oh I guess L for Leo would come up I was like one there's like that's what the alphabet he was talking about that's for sure L uh but he ultimately he looked at me and I appreciate his honesty I really do and and understand like he said this with a sad face uh his voice change I could tell he didn't even believe what he was saying but he looked at me and he said Riley I'm so sorry but we have been advised as an organization that when photos are being taken it's crucial that the trophies and Leo's hands you can pose with this one uh but you have to give your trophy back Leah takes the trophy home you go home empty handed end of story and that was the moment when for me like I said we knew all season we all did uh we knew the unfair competition was wrong we knew the locker room was wrong we knew the silencing that we were facing from our our universities and administration we knew all of that was wrong but it wasn't until this official reduced again everything we had all worked our entire lives for down to a photo op to validate the feelings and the identity of a man I think spends of our own uh that's when I can no longer wait and I say wait because truthfully I just figured someone else would say something I thought a coach will stand up for us there will be someone internally within the NCAA who says something someone with political power some other swimmer someone's dad quite frankly would come down there and yank this man out of our locker rooms which I'll I will say I had to refrain had to refrain mine uh my dad is a um you know he played in the NFL is a big guy at least he used to be now he's kind of just fat but um um when I told him that this man was in our locker rooms because we had no forewarning nothing like that the first time we we knew that this was happening was when we had to I mean we were being exploited and we were simultaneously being exposed to this and so I called my dad I'm like dad this man is in our locker room he said I'm coming down there and I'm going to handle this myself to which I had to say dad uh we already have one man in the locker room we don't need to and you'll go to jail and that's he would he would be in an orange jumpsuit right now um so this dude is changing your guys locker room at this tournament yeah fuck yeah yeah yeah now you mentioned on something because I got I mean we one of the things that we've always covered too because you talk about you know you waited to you know hoping that somebody would step up somebody would say something and that's always something like kind of a pucks that's on the show it's like you know where is you know you have this movement of feminism right and like listen there's been plenty of of great advancements that's been made in society you know right to vote you know all like there's been plenty of things right like the title nine they talk like everything has been done to to get women in in this in this country to a certain standard right and it's great then to have this dude walk in and just fucking ruin that completely shit on all of that right that's what he did you know but you know we always talked about like where are these die hard feminist you would think that there would be more cry from there you know I'm saying because like okay women's rights but this is a dude like like did you have it like what's your thoughts on that it's the same women who fought relentlessly for title nine fifty fifty two years ago now uh that are leading the charge they're at the forefront how do they how do they make that work in their mind they truly believe that this six foot four galaeth of a man uh standing in our locker room fully naked and all of his his glory or or or really lack thereof no shit they really believe I don't want to know so much about this shit bro I'm just saying like this is the second comment yes you're starting to tell on yourselves better be quiet over there like it's shocking yeah you want to talk about the balls and now you're talking about the dick this true Michael Jackson footsteps yes I am they um they really believe this is a woman and actually I don't even think that's true I don't think they really believe this is a woman because they're all virtue I mean how could you how could you really I mean like his hands are huge his feet took up the whole entire block he has an Adam's apple again the bulge like they don't think this is a woman neither did the NCAA neither do is does president Biden or the Democrats who are voting in favor of this stuff they don't really think this is a woman no they're not that stupid they're stupid but let's let's give them some credit they're not that stupid it is it's virtue signaling I think that's a big part of it I think they're pandering weirdly enough to to such a small fringe but loud minority here um I think a lot of them are terrified to to do anything other than be entirely locked step with what their progressive movement tells them to do um to be called any sort of name and I think a lot of it too is they're following right like a lot of these whether it's corporate America whether it's academia what have you they don't follow red or blue they follow green and I think that's a big part of it too now the NCAA I don't think they wanted to lose federal funding I don't want to I don't think they wanted to face lawsuits from from Thomas or the likes thereof um and so I think that's a contributing factor in why they they go along with this but speaking I guess to the feminist movement I've testified before Congress in the Senate many times now uh and most recently sat in front of Congress which it's unfathomable to me that a a recently 24 or 23 years old at the time has to go to DC sit in front of Congress I mean the the beating heart of the American Republic and explain to them that men and women are different and then to be on the other side of this table and watch as they have the super confused looks on their faces but that's what I was there to do nonetheless I was sat next to one of the witnesses one of the expert witnesses who is the president of the National Women's Law Center uh and in her opening testimony she said that women should just learn how to lose more gracefully and I'm sitting there thinking to myself she proudly calls herself a feminist and did she just say that that young girls and women should learn to lose more elegantly more gracefully that's the word she used so and Billie Jean King right that that that's who we have to a credit title nine two she played in the battle of the sexes and she won and it was this huge feat for women that that propagated women forward not just athletics but but as you said as as I mean in the world in the workplace within our personal relationships Billie Jean King is now actively fighting for male inclusion in women's sports and women's faces so now all of these girls who practice their whole lives who spend thousands of hours at the pool or thousands of hours at their sport it's irrelevant now because a guy can just say you know what I'm not very good at this so I'm just gonna go compete with them you know it's 534th here and row number one over here people don't understand if you're not an athlete you can't understand how fucked up that really is because the amount of time we come from sports as well the amount of time that goes into a sport from the time you're I mean what five six years old yeah to be competitive at this level and then to have it's it's it's it's it's disgusting it's disgusting and I don't give a fuck what name they call me or say whatever but like dude this is this is bullshit it's coming to shit dude is what it is well that's my thing too like I feel like there is a much more sinister undertone here you know I'm saying it's like you know why would that representative from the NCAA where we were advised advised by who like who made that advisement you know I'm saying like why is like there is something evil I think underneath all of this that's really pushing all of this shit and like you know and it's very evident too because when you look at it why don't we see it the other way around why don't we see women you know I'm saying go into the football field and you know laying out fucking patching your homes you don't see it well and that's the thing is in it something that naturally the media didn't touch at all was that at this same meet where we have Lea Thomas again six foot four man in a women swimsuit who we were told we fully had to treat as a woman we had another athlete who was transitioning but this was a woman who began to self identify as a man who we were told we fully had to treat as a man and so for optics purposes here 100 freestyle top eight women in the entire country and you've got a man and a women swimsuit with the bulge next to a woman wearing only a speedo nothing covering her top wait that was going on at the same time oh they both wrote on their arms and big black sharpie let trans kids play as if they both weren't playing in the category that best suited them and Izzy now goes by the name of Isaac keep up if you can swims at Yale which like of course swims at Yale which I think begs the question of what's up with the Ivy leagues and why I feel so compelled now to shout out the SEC or the Southern schools because it's insane I mean all large institutions are crazy and certainly liberal progressive but what the Ivy leagues are doing oh my gosh places that are supposed to be known for for their prestige forget that that is long gone at this point um but I'm sitting there watching this thinking to myself I must be crazy it's me I'm the crazy one this is the freaking twilight zone a woman wearing a speedo and a man and a women swimsuit that's what we were subjected to insane stuff but now to your point Izzy slash Isaac uh did compete with the men after this season uh went from being an all-american I think she finished fifth in the hundred free style which is an incredible achievement fifth in the country uh went on to compete in the men's category finished dead last every single time uh the one meet I watched of hers the next season uh the only man she beat was a man who had one arm yeah if your initial reaction is to laugh that is because it's like that south park episode I was referring to that is south park but it's reality south park can't even make it up dude so yeah it is what the fuck it is so how did all the up cuz like you were very vocal right away yeah and how how did the the other like your teammates and like you said you know when you're competing at that level it's a tight knit community nationally not just at your school what were they saying to you I had all the support in the world I'll come they stand up with you and say hey what we don't agree with this terrifying of what I so for a while I had sympathy I kind of understood I'm like you know what I'll bear the burden I'm fine I can take the arrows and I can I don't care I I never really have so whatever but that sympathy um and learning and learning about the topic and learning about our culture uh just understanding what's really happening understanding it's not just about not holding a trophy or or having to share my my spot on the podium with the man it is so much broader than that that sympathy has worn entirely thin I don't have sympathy anymore uh I think these these other girls uh specifically more so the adults right like the coaches and the parents what they are are weak need spineless morally bankrupt cowards yeah is what they are um and now I understand and again I didn't at the time because I believed a lot of what we were told I believe that I would be ousted I would lose friends all of those things which has not happened I haven't lost a single friend I haven't lost a single opportunity my dental school that I that I got into um that I was I mean I was attending um scoring the top percentile nationally of the dental emissions test could have got anywhere that I wanted had all this the scholarship money awarded to me I was so nervous to call the dental school and tell them that you know I was I was going to delay my life plans for a bit kind of veer off this path um I called them and I was so vague I'd been outspoken at this point but I didn't know what they knew about me I said hey you know something personal has come up in my life I'm gonna have to to put a pause on this for for a little bit and they said Riley uh we know who you are we know what you do and we love what you do you keep going you know dentists are a dime a dozen but what you're doing is far more important far more necessary and urgent than being a dentist is um whenever you want to come back your deposit will you have a spot here that's not what they told me would happen right um so all that to say I now understand that silence it is complicity if you're not willing to condemn something you can donate and I I that's the feelings that I had before speaking up is is that moment behind the podium right the whole trophy incident like I felt guilty that's how I felt like I felt like this overwhelming sense of responsibility I felt compelled I felt and it's because I had I had just participated in the farce of it all um and I wanted someone to stick up for me but I wasn't even willing to stick up for myself um that was kind of my thought process and so the support I mean so many people in secrecy or or in private or through direct message saying you know you keep going thank you for doing what you're doing you know you're fighting for me or for my younger sister or for my daughter and I would say this is great you know but but would you put your name to it run down athletes athletes both male and female that everyone knows who were messaging me and they'd say no I have sponsorships no I have endorsements I've got deals I I can't but you keep going uh even the president of the NCAA Mark Emmer at the time who publicly released a statement uh saying word for word I unequivocally stand in my decision to allow Leah Thomas to swim with the women because it's based in evolving science whatever that means but privately I see him at this uh NCAA woman of the year awards where I was nominated for University of Kentucky it's the most prestigious honor for collegiate female athletes each university gets one nominee across all their sports teams and my school chose me I was so honored uh until I realized that NCAA woman of the year was not exclusive to just women uh because Leah Thomas was also nominated for this award anyways I see Mark Emmer at this this event which I am like there's no way he's escaping for me and he says to me you know you keep fighting you keep you keep going but the audacity for him to say keep fighting as if he's not the one I'm fighting but everyone's response is the same same as the guy behind the podium our hands are tied but who's tying your hands you're the president yourself dude we have this problem here we deal with this we dealt with this for the last four years with the show at how many people will message me and they'll say dude I agree with everything you're saying and I go look at their page or I say dude why don't you join in uh you know I they gotta always have something about it dude we wouldn't be here in this scenario if people would just join in and be like this is fucked up you know it's the silence in the fear of the masses that's causing all this disturbance in the world including you know this transgender nonsense including all this shit that we're being asked to put up with in society and my thing is if you're not like if this isn't a hill that you're willing to die on what is then what in the world is I mean the premise of this again much bigger than sports is that we're denying the most basic of truths the most like a truth we've never struggled to understand in the nearly 250 years we've been established as a country but certainly much much longer than that being man and woman there is no simpler truth well if they can convince you that a man is a woman and a woman is a man who can not convince you of exactly I think that's why they attack it so hard because it literally is the fundamental truth and if they can fudge that and they can make that you know hazy for people to understand then the rest of everything else is easy to me super easy easy peasy I mean we have a sitting Supreme Court justice who can't even answer the question of what is a woman yeah because she claims she's well she's not a biologist she said yeah yeah well guess what I'm not a veterinarian but I know what a dog is that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard she knew with stupid tears remember a face she made when she did it she like smile it's insane so what so what so all of this goes down like and you talk about how you move down this different path so what's what's the what's this chapter of Riley Gaines look like now gosh um it's a whole lot of activism really which I was so hesitant for a long time and calling myself an activist because I picture someone with like blue hair who's screeching like Banchi and that's not me um but no I I proudly am an an activist I spend my time talking and teaching lawmakers how to talk about these issues testifying in different states that's a big part in what I do speaking on college campuses going to these universities putting myself in the belly of the beast and many times right like Harvard Princeton Cal Berkeley you name it but that's who needs to hear it um and what I found in doing that is these people while we might not agree on quite literally anything else uh there's there are a lot more people who are on the same page on this than it seems and the way our media is portraying it or the way um that our elected officials are voting making it seem as if this is divisive or falls entirely on party lines is entirely wrong it's funny you say that because you know it really if I was actually talking to Hawk Newsom last night about this so DJ has this friend his name's Hawk he's the leader of a BLM just would have been posted up in New York we had him on the show during all the BLM stuff and dude we disagree on the lick almost everything and he's even like what the fuck is this shit and I'm like bro I know and I haven't met now that you say that I don't think I met one person no matter how progressive they are that can like that has told me like yeah I think that men should be in women's sports my Uber driver on the way here big black guy so nice um you still got your wallet I should have got a check no I'm kidding he was um no he was so great and so we get to talking and he's you know how you can tell when someone like kind of recognizes you and he's you know asking me uh you know where are you from I'm from Tennessee oh where'd you go to school Kentucky said uh I know he or you're the swimmer who went to Kentucky um you know thank you for doing what what you're doing he said that's awesome you know I am so frustrated with the way this country is going he said I'm so mad that people look at me and they assume I think one way oh man and it was so like it was like the the honestly the greatest Uber I've ever had on my way over here today um but it was yeah he's like look me and my my people uh we're not on board with this uh he was telling me that he's so frustrated because with both sides and I understand he said you know Joe Biden he says that he thinks he if you're not black if you don't vote for me he said what an insult to my to my intellectual capacity that's right um so it was it was it was like a revitalizing moment for me give me hope for humanity I think I think the black communities are starting to really understand that those these people look at them as ponds oh for sure and they're starting to really get pissed off about it you know like when they get up there and say shit like black people don't know how to use a computer so they can't have access to it's like dude what the fuck well even the whole rest of the LGBT whatever community they're being used as ponds too oh yeah I think they're starting to understand like like lesbians right like I've talked to so many who have I mean they call themselves lifelong liberals who are like what makes them think that we want naked men in our locker room yeah we're attracted to women we don't like to see there yeah and then there be there being called transphobic yes because they don't want to date a trans woman yeah right and so they're I think they're starting to understand that the the gender ideology movement is inherently homophobic yeah and so I think it's waking a lot of people up people are realizing that like none of the shit that we're seeing came from the people like these were not you know what I'm saying like none of this stuff none of these movements like who who started these movements it wasn't actually people like groups of humans in this country like normal citizens that created this stuff this stuff is evil sinister stuff that is being pushed down a shutdown of thought to every every single time we make in books bro these are these books about this there you if you read uh rules for radicals or you read marks or you read you know any of this fucking marks is coming to shit deluding truth is a big part of the manipulation process right and so that's what we're dealing with and that's why we deal with these social constructs such as political correctness which nobody in here gives a fuck about um cancel culture you know the silent majority making that a virtuous thing don't say anything and then you're virtuous all of these things are geared towards them controlling us and making us question what is true what's not true and then he's brought the internet on top of it and the amount of shit that you could put out that's not even actually true it's hard it's hard for people to filter through and understand that it's not just like a an accidental trend or the ways of the world exactly well if you have any like even the slightest understanding which i will i will admit like i didn't i never took a government course i never had to i never had to take history but in reading and learning and understanding now right like the denial of truth like you say but even the shift in language like a no longer woman or mother or female it's like cervix have her or uterus owner or menstruator or bleeder or chestfeet or birthing person birth giver egg producer whatever other like derogatory term they can come up with that ultimately reduces women down to their biological functions and capacities that's what that's what our assistant secretary of health mr. Rachel Levine that's what he says he says his women are our egg producers which i think is hilarious because by this own standard he's not a woman and he's obese no shit for secretary of health so here's this motherfucker saying egg producer and he's saying he's a woman but he has a produce eggs it's hilarious you can make it up but even like this verbiage of biological woman which we hear all the time we and and both like everyone says it um right leaning media left leaning everything they say oh this biological male biological woman and i adhered for a while i thought it was necessary in in making the distinction right like like i'm a biological being i guess made of biological matter and i'm a female therefore i'm a biological female and Thomas is a biological male and i'm seeing there one day and i'm like uh you know it took a lot of upper level math courses in college and i'm like huh if this was algebra uh wouldn't that word biological just cancel out like why in the world are we saying that we were playing game what we were doing we're playing their and it's so dangerous because it's subconscious like we don't even know which is how they want us to be subconsciously admitting that there's an unbiological alternative to being a woman or a man or a girl or a boy or a male or a female and there's not god created the only distinction we will ever need when he created man and woman even the verbiage of sex reassignment surgery all things i'm just mentioning some things i've learned like it sounds harmless in its in its nature like sex reassignment surgery but when we say it you're admitting that you can reassign your sex and there's nothing that you can do there's no surgeries there's no cosmetic procedures there's no hormones there's nothing that you can do that changes who you are down to a chromosomal level who got so intentionally and uniquely created you to be perfect in his image um so the language shift write the breakdown of a faith we used to be a country that proudly said in god we trust or in one nation under god the breakdown of families pinning parents and kids against each other the breakdown of our freedom such as the freedom of speech right praying on our most vulnerable that being women and children the propaganda that's being spread not to mention you know the wanting to take the guns all kinds of different things but if you lay all this out for what it is it really is like Marxism yeah or communism or or some sort of socialist regime and you talk to someone from China North Korea Germany Cuba Brazil Venezuela the Czech Republic any of these countries that have once or currently embrace this Marxist regime and they'll tell you that it's a slippery slope and it's a slippery slope that by the hands and feet of our own leaders we're actively being led down I think you know I've said this on the show a million times but dude we're in the midst of a communist revolution like it's happening right now it's not it's happening like look at what they're doing in terms of the the weaponized court system with their not just to Trump look what they're doing to other people Steve Bannon today yeah he's going to jail for four months yeah dude are you looking like and you could say whatever you want about Alex Jones no they find him a billion dollars to rate a shit bro this shit's crazy and I don't know why more people don't see it take away political I think they start thinking that I think a lot of people at this I think in the beginning people thought okay well there's people carrying the water there's there is some people speaking up you got Rogan saying shit you got a you know you got Elon saying stuff you've got a number of big names saying things so they say oh well you know I don't I don't have to do that here and then now we're getting the point where they're jailing people like Trump or potentially and they don't understand that the next level of jailing is all those people that you think are carrying the water because you haven't spoke up and if you go back and look at what communists do and how they do shit they make an example out of someone big and then all the supporters underneath go bye bye and then you're left alone and so if you have a patriotic bone in your body or if you know that this is wrong you have a duty to speak up because they can't fucking arrest us all they can't fuck with everybody at the same time and that's our biggest problem we have too many people who are willing to let other people be the voice instead of just contributing in their own way like hey dude share this clip say this tell your friends at work to think this is real that it ain't real like just be the be the the voice in your little circle those things matter more than some five or six or ten big people saying it what matters is all the individuals who believe this but aren't saying anything just speaking up and what you'll find is is that everybody agrees with you like you said people coming to me all the time and they're like dude how do you do what you do what are you talking about it people love it easily yeah like everywhere I go like no one no one's out here like kicking my ass going down the street like everywhere I go people are like damn dude thanks for doing this shit this is awesome it's like okay well let's do your part bro totally yeah no I agree agree entirely 100 percent man well uh you guys want to do some cruising yeah let's see what's out there yeah well thank you for doing what you're doing for real it is awesome uh needed well it's nothing to do you just doing what you think to be as right it's that simple yeah and it is it is to your point people say all the time it must be so hard it's the easiest thing in the world yeah to say that men and women are different to say that they're two sexes if you can't change your sex in each sex is deserving of equal opportunity and privacy and safety the easiest thing in the world I can't believe that that's considered brave I cannot believe it yeah but here we seems like it happened fast too like it seems like you know like not that long ago just saying some of these things were complete common sense and not and then they got to the point where you say these things and you're a big it you're a transphobia or this it's like dude I think COVID expedited things yeah I think they realized they could control us again coming from a college during that time and understanding I mean they told us vaccines were mandatory and social distancing and mask contact tracing which how many I mean have you ever seen a swimmer in the water wearing a mask no but they certainly tried we essentially waterboarded ourselves every day this stuff was crazy that they were asking us to do that we were that we were doing and I think they realized that oh we can make them do some really weird stuff now we can control them and so then I did all come around that we're on the same time yeah yeah and that's when all this insanity and so but I will say like I I learned to stand up for myself during COVID and I said I'm not getting the vaccine you can't make me and I think that helped me my my senior year when dealing with this because I learned like you guys are just I mean this is BS yeah I can call you on it and nothing will happen to me yeah so yeah yeah it's fucking awesome it's a pure blood I'm a pure blood yeah that's right probably Missouri is SEC too so we're yeah I like you guys we count we count as long as we're not singing rocky top then I'm good yeah I'm cheering for any SEC team any of them well guys let's let's do we're gonna be good football this year dude I think so yeah I think so we we're ready cooks gonna come out I think I think they got they got some they got some heat call in the electric ginger that's my nickname for he's got a he's got text you be like what the fuck this is electric ginger sorry bro you are guys remember if you want to see any of these headlines videos articles links pictures go to Andy for seller.com I think all of that stuff there for you guys but that being said Riley Andy let's go to headline number one um biggest talk of the town of day um is just follow ups on the hunter Biden trial that's happening and there's been some some truths that are finally being um universally accepted as truth which I think is interesting but so let's dive into it uh seven takeaways from third day of hunter Biden's gun trial let's dive into this so this is bright bar covering this um this hunter Biden's gun trial uncovered seven more explosive pieces of information in the third day of proceedings um the trial is expected to last about two weeks with many witnesses and will likely expose more damning information about the dysfunctional Biden family the trial sets resume at 9 a.m. Thursday with farmer gun clerk on the stand so excuse me so uh day three these are the seven things they've uncovered so far um uh they they're and this might be the biggest thing um the the actual laptop itself has been officially entered in as evidence and it is a universal truth it existed it is real the FBI had it all along um and it was not this disinformation franchise we'll get into that a little bit um but not only that it was uh testified in court that there was no tampering uh that it was ever done with that laptop meaning nobody hacked it nobody put messages or pictures in that laptop or you know fudged anything in that laptop it was as it has always been since hunter Biden had it so that got put in there the ex-wife Kathleen Buell uh she characterized hunter as quote angry and short tempered um president Joe Biden reportedly is having trouble focusing on work because he's obsessing and worrying about his son's gun trial and Delaware um apparently hunter smoke crack every 20 minutes or so um per his ex-girlfriend Zoe uh Kastan she testified about their rampant drug use during the two-year relationship from 2017 to 2018 now I don't know about you guys I never had done crack but that seems like a lot like you're going pretty hard a lot of crack as a lot of crack every 20 minutes um a lot of crack um Kastan also testified that she helped hunter by drugs the jury apparently appeared to struggle to remain attentive at times um and then hunter's missing revolver also appeared um at the trial after six years uh which means they also had that since day one as well um so there's a lot of things in cover but let's touch on this this laptop thing um because that's I think that's the the big big issue here right we covered this laptop and I think the quick line for for those that you know don't really understand this this laptop came out uh in 2019 right there was an article that was going to be produced uh Rude Juliani is the one that kind of hey there's this laptop that has all this damning evidence right and then the moment and this was what a month out from the elections okay um all of this stuff comes out and then all hell breaks loose they deny that it exists they start censoring americans they censors social media companies that try to talk about any post that gets tried to talk about this laptop gets censored um they they censor any type of story that comes out about this and then they also do you guys remember that list of uh of people like said they they censored the twitter files and covered this um but then there was that list there was a list of all of those uh 51 intelligence officers um that signed uh this public statement on the hunter by emails and this laptop and it was signed by all these people with really nice letters and and and cool places that they worked at um that all signed this 51 and total that said no it's not real and in fact it's Russian disinformation and uh juliana juliani is working for the Russians and he's you know using that to help trump win this election in this election interference that was the whole thing when the reality they were the ones that were actually interfering with the election trying to deny this laptop and all the damning evidence that it had to not get to public knowledge and um when there was polls done um at the time uh 50% of the country had no idea that the the laptop even existed or was a real thing um to the point i got a 20 minute clip here and we won't play the whole thing um but this then this thing is going viral so this is uh it came out uh from this uh profile uh canokia or whatever can can koe of the great kani koe yeah sure um but it has almost 30 million views at the time of this uh recording um and this is a 20 minute clip of the mainstream media talking about this this laptop case we'll play a couple of a couple of minutes and tonight the trump campaign is accusing twitter and facebook of censorship after the social media companies blocked the spread of an unverified story about former vice president joviden sun and the laptop allegedly full of his old emails it's a story raising concerns about whether it's real or just designed to so confusion in the final weeks of the election experts say it has all the hallmarks of information laundering this looks like your classic disinformation campaign ericoneal is a former FBI operative steal the information with a cyber attack get the emails from hunter-bydance account and then put them on these laptops that are left at a repair store and that's how the information is now laundered into the public who do you think is behind this well the russians would be my number one guess social media outlets were quick to limit the spread of the story twitter briefly suspending the accounts of the trump campaign and white house press secretary after they tried to share it twitter and facebook have limited the distribution of that hunter-bydance story and last night twitter appeared to suspend at the twitter account of white house press secretary kelly machinini when she tried to share that story damn you know a story of shady when facebook is saying whoa whoa whoa whoa maybe people shouldn't see this for a long time juliani has been openly working to dig up dirt and promote disinformation on the biden's and now the washington post is also reporting that the intelligence community was so concerned that the russians were using juliani to feed russian disinformation to the president that they warned the white house about it last year we're being told by two people who have been briefed on what the FBI is doing is that they're looking into whether these unverified emails about hunter-bydance published by the new york post about foreign business dealings are part of the bigger russian disinformation effort which is well underway in these final days of the 2020 race the intelligence community has said for months that russia is very actively engaged in a disinformation campaign in the 2020 election in particular against joe biden to denigrate his campaign in favor of president trump i think there are a lot of issues related to this new post story that uh portally uh referenced uh hunter-bydance emails and as uh i am several abided former colleagues pointed out publicly that it does bear the hallmark so the russian disinformation telecommitting chair out of shift bear it bears the hallmark but again and it wasn't just these social media companies doing this on their own and i can't you know we probably need to this was at the direction of the white house and the FBI and the FBI through their their portal that they have with social media companies to to throw this story out um so now all this stuff is coming out also we didn't cover the fact that if you posted about it you got your account fucking deleted mm-hmm they they also took down the post from the new york post right and that it wasn't the poster the times that put it up supposed uh it's watching supposed here it is yeah new york posted it too and they took that story down they they literally suspended anybody's account to talk about it this is a election that is election interference this is wild to me because i mean i i could vote in 2020 and i did vote in 2020 but being in college and i mean i've always been a christian first and foremost which aligns conservative so so i've always been conservative but i had no idea that i mean learning about it now i had i think back to 2020 i had no idea that this stuff was happening the censorship it's it's so crazy to see now being involved in like the policy politics space had no idea even always being conservative well i don't think anybody really knew like how deep it was but more importantly like who was doing it you know i'm saying because it like the argument is like with the censorship shit is like okay i'm i'm i'm twitter right and this is my platform it's a private platform and you know if you want to come on my platform you agree to my terms of service and you know if i don't like what you're saying on my platform then i can remove you that would be fine right like legally constitutionally that's fine that's not what was happening it was people at the white house at the direction of the fbi the direction of this like they they are literally reaching out to twitter saying hey we don't like what Riley gains is saying which is a violation of first amendment via proxy because you have a government it's at the direction of the government which is like that's what messes all of the stuff up and it's sad man it's sad because had more americans knew what was actually happening with that laptop knew what was going on with all of the stuff at the time would Biden even be president and yeah you speak you say had more americans it took a south african to buy twitter he cares more about our freedoms than americans do yeah he's like he took an african american yeah he took a yeah yeah what it's true he's an african american he was nothing i'm not arguing that's an accurate statement it's just sad man it's sad and now you got all of this stuff coming out and so they're finally now agreeing don't forget they hit juliani with like a hundred fifty million bucks too yeah they did bro they destroyed that little man man they destroyed bad for him well there's there's still after them they're still after you so what do we got i mean do we think i mean i i'm asking this you know why do you both these fucking guys have that stupid crooked smile where the fuck does that come from i don't know i see hunters got cracked tooth crack tooth i just like i think it was point three and like the seven points that said uh president Biden is he can't focus because he's so he's so worried i'm like no he can't focus because he has dementia that's why he cannot do this oh yeah he looks like he like crap his pants he did he did if anyone who has a toddler knows that face they know that face they know that stance that is a 100% fact that is verified 100% yeah maybe interesting to see what comes out of this man you know i think uh also to mention to uh congress uh the uh the senate uh just referred chart criminal charges against hunter Biden um and the uncle uh for contempt of crime uh congress the same exact thing they're getting uh Steve bannon on right now um and so again like i mean if they're saying there is no politicization they're they're saying there is no bias in the system why should i you know if you do the exact same thing that you know this person you should get the exact same crime right like you should get the exact same punishment so we'll see if this stand is being held man i think i think i know that's not being held well i think in the trump trial we see it's not only the courts and the judges it's the juries it's the expert witnesses it's the media like all of it has become this hyper politicized weapons really so it's it's and again it's it's sad as a young person to watch this unfold uh knowing at least feeling like i have a relatively okay understanding of knowing what this means for for the future it's it's scary well i think a good a positive thing is though i think a lot of young people who were definitely blue voters or leaning left have now made a switch for sure i think i think we've we've seen that culturally in the last four years where young people are like damn dude especially boys yeah for sure like college age guys like come on yeah and we saw that too with all the stuff going on the middle east right these these protests and all this stuff and towards the end of like the semester recently we saw the almost this counter revolution by these frat boys yeah these fraternity brothers but it was awesome to see like they gave me a lot of hope like cool yeah they get it all they did it's hold the flag and sing the national anthem but that it says a whole lot yeah so that's pretty cool to see yeah i love seeing it too yeah well guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think what should happen to hunter hmm that's what i want that's why i want everybody to say every 20 minutes yeah smoke that's insane that's a lot like they said like that's that's a shit turn of that's a shit to the crack they said you're spending like 15 grand a month on just on crack just on crack bro that's insane yeah no way what they found in the white houses and exactly no way he was he was a easter what was it no that was some cell what were they doing at the white house he sure was trans visibility day don't get it mixed up okay yeah i'm sorry i apologize uh no there was something the white house there was some events right he's a big it yeah oh no there was something at the white house when he was like on the bow they were all on the balcony and he was coked out of his mind hunter was well forget what event that was probably all of them yeah every single last one of them just Tuesday sorry um yeah guys jumping on the conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments I was that being said let's go cruise on speaking of bigots oh wait wait talking about you no it's you man oh really this comes from uh at jj uh lw 9 oi bra white people are races black people are not races towards white people i like your pods Andy but i think you a little on the white supremacy side on the low and DJ you need to start checking certain things for us black folks i see you agree with with andies bs sometimes where i get it from DJ it's actually me DJs DJs rubbing off on me man he's like talking about jj for white supremacy i'm for everybody i'm for American supremacy yeah huh i'm for American supremacy yeah i'm i'm down with that yeah American supremacy i don't know the wrong with that i mean look bro uh you know to your point white people are only people up until uh i don't know three four months ago that couldn't get a job because of the race okay so if you want to talk about actual oppression and actual racism that's racism you know what else is okay for anybody to say anything they want about white people they say fuck whatever they want the the lady who just directed star wars was on the new star wars was on fucking tv yesterday she said the goal of what i was trying to do was to make white people cry what up bizarre yeah statement yeah so so let's flip the switch here brother well even everything that's going on with the wmba and katlyn clerk yes and what she is experiencing is blatant racism yeah you got the people on the view what's her name sunny sunny austin who says katlyn has um privilege white privilege she has uh straight privilege she has pretty privilege and she has tall privilege is what she said and then i call her on and she blocks me on social media yeah and jimel hill who's like a professional lifelong race bader yeah um all these people who are coming after katlyn clerk who has done nothing for the wmba or college basketball for that matter other than set records bring viewership put millions of new eyes on women's basketball which is something they touted for for so long like why aren't we getting the attention and and suddenly they do when they're self-imploding what a bizarre what a bizarre scenario i can't make i can't even make sense of it yeah it's listen dude that people people are so used to the anti white shit that it's not deemed racist okay when the star wars lady says i want to make white people cry what if i said the goal of my show every single day is to make black people cry what if i said that okay that's racist shit i don't say that shit here's the thing jj uh you can't recognize it because you've been so immersed in your entire life that you don't see a problem with it okay there's b-e-t there's black awards there's this and this and this there's all kinds of black privilege in this country and white people get called racist i don't give a fuck that you guys have your own things and do all this shit that's fine with me but don't fucking tell me that there isn't an anti white narrative going on in society because there is and there has been since the day i was fucking born i'm not allowed to say i'm proud to be white you're allowed to say you're proud to be black latinos are allowed to say i'm proud to be latino but if a white person says oh i'm proud to be white it's white supremacy okay so bruh you don't know what the fuck you're talking about and if you like the podcast maybe let's do a little closer right there's i'm not a fucking jj yeah yeah i was a prider wouldn't listen man i'm not trying to be a dick but like dude you're wrong here and and the thing is if you were sitting right here we would have a civil conversation explaining why you're wrong i could go to the fucking internet and find a thousand examples of black people saying ignorant fucking shit about white people and you have a very hard time finding public figures that are saying that same shit about black people in fact i can find one it does really Joe Biden yeah that's right that's right but that's not why supremacy that's yeah that's democrats yeah well they get a pass because he gets because he's a democrat but the point of this is guys is that if we're being honest and we want a functioning society we cannot look at people skin color and judge them on it we have to look at people as a character just like Martin Luther King fucking preach you can agree or disagree whether he was a Marxist or a socialist or this or that i don't care the guy's message was real and it was true we need to be judging people on the content of their character not the color of their skin judging people on the color of their skin is low IQ all right so while you say white people are racist towards black people and black people are not racist towards white people then why on the fucking internet is there millions of fucking black people saying that sounds about white why why are black announcers like Jamil Hill or fucking any of these women in the WNBA be able to say this shit about Caitlin Clark like it's like it's no big deal but if one fucking white announcer said anything close to that about a black athlete their career would be fucking over so you tell me where the fucking double standard is bro all right this is about me being white supremacy on the low if we're being real DJ's white supremacy on the high no argument so yeah so like listen guys replay that J.J. we just watched that whole yeah bro i'm just saying brother like you're wrong here and it's just is what it is if you pay attention a little closer uh you're gonna see that i'm right and by the way i love you dude we're all we're all the same kind of people this isn't a fucking black white thing week i'm trying to stop that shit now that's a black thing right now all right i'm just saying it look you know how can i be white supremacy i'm drinking great fucking energy come on man he's just to believe in making sense his appropriation bro uh let's end to the next one we got well that's a whole other thing okay white people can are are appropriating black culture because they wear a deedus and fucking dress like they're in a hip hot video which is fine okay but black women wear a blonde wig and it's totally cool we're culturally appropriating you but but black women can wear a blonde wig and it's no big deal so even the whole idea of like black face right understandably is not inherently good thing but i think with this whole trans movement just kind of relating it back it's like is that not woman face yeah exactly same shit man yeah so next comment come from on anyway jj i appreciate your comment bro but i disagree with you okay uh next comment uh comes from at uh mirrors uh hushed who said that who's it's um madat speak of facts as Bosnian

in in new york and florida people with felony convictions are barred from possessing a firearm now that's cool it's whatever you know he doesn't need it um and he'll get it back because it's just gonna get overturned i agree with Riley i mean what difference does it make it's just i don't know new york allowed them to have guns anyway yeah that's what i'm saying like i mean he's definitely gonna get one now shit i mean because that's definitely stops people from getting guns and committed crimes yeah honestly all yeah all this gun stuff is is crazy to me what we're seeing in these big cities i mean we saw in new mexico was it the governor in new mexico decided an albuquerque to to remove constitutional carry remove the whole concealed carry thing which like when they do that do they think these criminals are listening like oh man we can't do this now saying dude and then you put up a new sign no guns at the park dammit all right i listen dude like it's it's the most ridiculous thing because the definition of a criminal is someone who doesn't recognize the laws exactly listen this is nothing but a step that's fine that's cool yeah uh that's not even the story here today so we got we got some wins here so do you guys remember a while ago the the documents case down in florida judge uh ilean can and she suspended that that trial indefinitely right um so that happened and uh she noted uh in a five page order on Tuesday uh when when it was put out that it would be imprudent to finalize a new trial date now casting further down on federal prosecutors ability to bring trump to trial before the November presidential election so you got that happening right that happened a couple of months ago great and other great news uh down in georgia let's have a look at georgia court of appeals and definitely pauses the election subversion conspiracy case against Donald trump um so this is going down in georgia now um where the the court of appeals to completely suspended that case as well um georgia court of appeals uh has halted the election subversion subversion conspiracy case against Donald trump and several of his co-defendants a massive victory uh for the former president seeking to push further legal issues until 2025 if he can't beat them all together um and this is a CNN article by the way um so the new order filed on Wednesday from the georgia court of appeals is the latest indication that a trial in the state level georgia election subversion case will not occur before the 2024 presidential election i think because they're also realizing that all like this is election interference whether the it's at a uh a campaign person or a lawyer or a court committing it it's election interference that's how to do all of this shit before the elections like it's very very plain and simple well i think it's almost ironic too because trump could have done this to Hillary like he could have but then he just he's well looking now especially in understanding like the the tax that he's faced from the same people he essentially spared he's like look you know i beat you that's that you know go on with your life he stills cause or crooked which is kind of hilarious but he could have done the same thing all the email stuff but he chose you know i'm not gonna prosecute a former president but now look at what's happening to him i think i think yeah there's something important there though what's that well because like i think the like and who sets it he could they're setting the precedent for their own accountability he couldn't have been the one that set the precedent you know i'm saying like i think that's how i'm looking at it and i don't know if that makes sense i see it too dude yeah like i see he could have easily went in and then locked up Hillary and did i mean they knew about the shit with Joe Biden for years yeah i also think though it's him i think i think what we're gonna see moving forward because i think it's becoming very blatantly obvious to people to even them that trump is so far ahead that they're not a they're not gonna be able to cheat like they did last time with all the mail-in shit and i think they're getting they're getting nervous right because like dude they know what they're doing is wrong and because now they think he's gonna win they're trying to back off so they don't get caught up in the dragnat of who's gonna be held accountable and i think we're gonna see more and more of that i don't think that's gonna be everybody though i think there are gonna be people who are so guilty of the things that they have done like the fauci's and the biden's and the Hillary Clinton's and these people who are gonna press as hard as they can all the way through the election because they have no choice because they understand that if he gets in dude they're going to jail or worse so i think we're gonna see a small group of people continue to push and alienate themselves and sort of just expose themselves for who they are and what they did and their little cohort or horts that are you know the minions who are trying to help out we're gonna see them start to scatter and jump off the boat that that's what i see happening they're 100% now you got anything else on this one just like i don't know all the election stuff all the it like i it blows my mind for a couple reasons especially just like watching all this now which i try not to submerge myself in a lot of the times i cannot believe that joe biden is the best they can put up so do we think i'm sitting here thinking there's no way they actually run him but are they committed at this point i mean it's it's it's a run of it's crunch time kind of right i mean there's there's several months until november but it's like is that really watching the video of him crap is pants today i'm like is this really who they're running i think they chose biden because he was the most leveraged i don't i i i also then like Gavin Newsom or or michelle obama i think they chose biden because he appears to be inept and i think they needed someone like all right think about like this well plus we know it's not actually biden that's right so think about like this like newsom right everybody knows that newsom's pretty sharp he's happened to be a massive liar but he's pretty sharp like if you watch with me he's on top of it charming yeah and he's willing to yes he is willing to flat out lie because he has charisma he you could see when he's lying because he says the same tell every time if you play any amount of poker at all or know anything about when people lie he says the exact same thing when he's lying every single time right when he gets done with the statement he goes and that is a fact and everything that he says before that is always like this fucking lie yeah so see black people we say at first yeah we'll be like well looks what happened yeah here's the point though so if you had Gavin Newsom as president right now and he came in on day one and signed 17 executive orders and he opened the border and he shut down the oil and he did all these things to Biden did nobody would be saying god he's so stupid it would give their position away if they would be saying look how evil this guy is look how criminally is he's a communist but because Joe Biden is this decrepit old crusty dude it's easy to say look how stupid he is he's just stupid and that believe he is that keeps everybody thinking that he's just dumb instead of realizing that he's actually this is all on purpose you know when he goes out there and he says the economy is great it is great for them it's going exactly the way they want it that's what people do not understand so that's true yeah I think Gavin Newsom does he looks like a like he looks like a villain out of like a rival movie like a douchebag if we had spent the last three and a half years dealing with Gavin Newsom doing these things we would have already had a revolt it'd be different that's true yeah that's great instead we're just watching elder abuse that's right that's how it feels like it feels like we're watching yeah this poor old man this decrepit senile old man just kind of get touted along but in reality um he's the perfect fall guy for all the perfect one and we're there especially with all the bullshit that he has with this corruption sheet and you also got to think of it from his point of YouTube bro that guy's always wanted to be president like that's his whole thing of his whole life so he's an eager participant because he thinks that you know he's going to have his name up on the wall and he's going to be celebrated bro he's going to go down in history as a fucking traitor no because these people put him in position he deconstructed the country he hurt everybody in the country outside of the top 10 business people in the in the whole country that own everything you know the black rocks the fucking Googles the the Amazon's and shit I mean dude that that's you know I like the uh have you guys seen the uh the trump trump the videos that trump pushes out with the nursing home videos abiding who the nursing home videos oh bro they're great they're great I don't have one I don't know I brought it up but yeah they're you should watch them some time we'll see that trophy I gave you I wasn't a joke coming home wasn't a joke coming home where it belongs fucked up guys jumping on this conversation it's white supremacy that's what it's JJ hey yeah that's what you're saying bro um guys jumping on this conversation he told you to check me out for all the black people oh god guys jumping down in the conversation uh let us know what you guys think with everything said let's get out there to final headline in um let's talk about the border a little bit we haven't hit this contact topic in a minute you better look under the hood which you don't know these days all right we gotta talk about the border a little bit man we have it we haven't visited the uh visited this topic on cti in a minute um because quite frankly they haven't been that many updates with it you know people have come through our fucking border illegally right very very plain and simple um but there has been some interesting updates here so let's let's dive into to this uh headline number three uh border agents begin turning back migrants under new Biden restrictions now I think on the surface sounds good right people would think this oh see he is doing something but we're gonna dive into what's actually happening here so let's let's do that um article with us agents wins they began turning back migrants along the border with mexico and the president Biden's new asylum restrictions while administration officials sought to tamp down expectations for a sudden drop in illegal crossings a day after the president declared an emergency at the border and issued a suspension of us asylum protections to administration officials told reporters that migrants who entered illegally from mexico had been turned back uh the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity uh which why would they do that well but why would you not one of us what Riley said your cowards cowards um underground rules set by the administration declined to say how many migrants were returned it's like all of two exactly all two of them look at these 10 000 we just like go under the fence or the 20 million already here or the 20 million out of here but Biden's new measures imposed restrictions on asylum as long as illegal boarding crossings remain above an average of 1500 per day the official said uh it was too soon to gauge whether the restrictions would have a deterrent effect on migrants uh seeking to enter the us illegally and they acknowledge limitations and detention space and deportation capacity would blunt their ability uh to apply the restrictions um one official said the administration will increase efforts during the initial weeks of the new restrictions to take advantage of Biden's measures uh but cautioned that the effect on crossings remain to be seen now here's the interesting thing so uh Biden officials say uh they have increased the numbers of migrant uh migrants being deported or returned to mexico to the highest levels in a decade and plan to ramp up flights in the coming weeks uh us immigration and customs enforcement operates about five to seven deportation flights per day primarily to central america and other nations in the western hemisphere those flights typically carry about 100 to 120 deportees now the flights require significant planning and coordination in addition to their cost now i don't even care about how many are going i want to know who's going that's the important question that means be asking because you know they're not they're not they're not i think they're sending away the the good ones because they're definitely not sending back the bad ones you know like the ones that keep killing americans and attacking innocent americans all over our country they're not sending those guys back they're still here right the the the migrants that are attacking and beaten up our police officers all across the country um or killing young innocent americans on college uh near college campuses they're not sending those guys back they're still here so who exactly are they sending back we don't know um but i think i have a good idea um another news on this border stuff you got canada uh their border agents are about to go on strike um as soon as uh tomorrow uh Friday when you guys are listening um at four p.m. Eastern time um if there is no um coordinated agreement so now the canadians can escape that's good yeah i know that that's good um you got that happening um you know but but and the really interesting thing here and you got to go back um oh and the other fix too by the way uh Biden's closing the border at midnight that's definitely gonna help so for all you illegals make sure you come the morning come to business hours yeah midnight king cross but but the interesting thing here man if you guys go back you guys remember how many times Biden said that he had no power to do anything down at the border you couldn't do anything right and like i quote um i can shut down the border if given the power by by partisan senate legislation and that is still under negotiation he didn't have he didn't have the power to do it but now all of a sudden we got this executive action that's coming out of them um and i think it's one of those things that like at the end of the day the damage has already been done we got 20 million uh legal migrants in this country we have no idea where the hell they are no idea who they are no idea what crimes they committed and while our crime rates in this country are going up you see these other countries that are coming from their crime rates are going down what does that tell us who is coming into this country um it's sad man let's say so what do we got on this this this conversation let's talk about this border issue down we got going on down here what do we got guys i will say as i mean i care about the border issue for a lot of reasons but um in particular we see the effects of but i think we're forgetting how this harms legal immigration as well because i'm married to an immigrant um which he's from england he loves this country he loves guns he drives a truck and f 350 they don't have that in england like he loves it here he's honest he's hardworking he loves america uh we've been buried two years and they still won't give him his green card that's why yet you can just we could buy a flight book a flight to mexico and walk over not only would he get his green card uh in many cases his passport so so becoming a u.s citizen but we'd get a credit card with $10,000 and a double bag full of other stuff that and a Biden sticker and a Biden sticker and so that's the harm that it's caused me personally um it makes travel harder it makes him working harder he works in construction um but it it makes all of that harder because you have to have sponsors and different things and it's just beyond frustrating we just got a letter from immigration saying that he the reason they won't give him his green card is because he hasn't submitted his covid vaccination records i'm like the cdc has at this point said that the masks don't work fouches they even said that there's no really scientific backing between the mask or the vaccines they just kind of had to do what they had to do and it's just that's fucked up yeah but he's really cute and he's got this like awesome british uh country accent living in national you start to pick up a national twang well working in construction you're either dealing with rednecks who who don't have any education past fifth grade or you're dealing with illegal immigrants who don't understand the queen's english and so he said to uh his accent has has evolved and i take full credit it's awesome it rocks but that's a illegal immigrant as well how does that make you feel seen all this shit uh after all the stuff you had to do yes a little disheartening i mean i i think um i think they're giving us even a bad name too because we come here we work hard we have to go through this whole process and then they're just coming along coming across the border and they're getting all this stuff the kind of um you know i'm proud to be an american i'm proud to be in this country and i think we're kind of being something with these people too because even when people talk shit on immigrants it kind of lumps me into it too and i'm like no i'm i'm one of the legal ones i'm cool you're an american bro yeah absolutely yeah i think that's the point of it though right yeah i guess too lump all of that together you know because that's what they want i think that's what they do with the lgb stuff too it's a very consistent thing a group that you that defines you like the like my uber driver was saying he's like they think they know who i am because of color on my skin and they don't like what an insult that is but that's what this that's a lot of the cultural and societal issues that we're seeing it stems from that kind of mindset i mean you notice that the notice that never put us in the group of being americans no because the flag has now become something that is i saw today in Connecticut where the democrats voted one of an officer was attacked and killed i don't know if it was by an illegal or not but nonetheless an officer police officer was attacked and killed died and so they they were going to raise the flag at half-staff but they decided that the blue line flag and the american flag represented antagonism and racism and hate and so they raised the pride flag to half-staff because they said that is something that represents joy and happiness and and all of this stuff oh my gosh like that's today what they didn't so yeah that the flag has been labeled as anything divisive and negative and bad but in reality that is the one symbol that is supposed to unify everyone in this country for any other identity factor if you're an american that is something that is supposed to unify us but they've used it as it's become a symbol that represents conservatives which if that's the case i know which side i want to fall on yeah dude look i think that we have to you know just i think we've gotten to a point where everybody's starting to understand you know some people are a little further along than others but what we're starting to understand collectively is that they want us to be anything but americans they want us to be blacks or whites or gays or straits or illegals or feminists or trans and the reality is there's a read a good reason why they don't want us to identify as americans amongst the differences you know what where when i grew up in this country it was always that way it didn't matter what you were you were a proud american and they can't have that because the minute that happens they lose their power they lose their ability to manipulate they lose their ability to stay on top of everybody's throat and i think we're getting to the point where people are starting to realize that and i wish that they were realizing a little bit quicker you know but we're seeing it dude we're seeing the black america wake up we're saying and say hey i'm not black america i'm fucking american and dude that's the america that i grew up in and i it's it's it's sucks for a lot of the younger people because they don't remember that like they don't remember that being that way but that's all i remember like it's it's up until the last ten years where it's gotten weird yeah and um it's a shame but i think i'm optimistic that all of these things that are happening now i don't think that these people can continue to win i think it's time i really had a win in a while and years it's been years since they've had a win they've everything they've been doing has been by force and it's all getting rejected and that's the actual solution of what's going on here it's mass non-compliance it's mass civil disobedience it's not violence it's saying hey now fuck off we're americans you guys are shit bags and we're gonna we're gonna be americans and we're not gonna let you guys divide us and if we could get that going in in our country a lot of this stuff would take care of itself you know um and i think it's happening from when i can it's definitely happening much faster than it was two years ago or three years ago four years ago yeah for sure i feel more hopeful now than i i do too i have it since i mean i guess i've become politically active awake not woke but awake in the way that i have um i feel more hopeful now than than i have we're seeing states soon now the Biden administration of the Department of Education uh we're over 20 are in active litigation over just specifically title nine again the counter revolution on college campuses uh how trump is up by double digits in the polls which i'll say the polls don't really mean a whole lot um but it is we wouldn't have seen that two years ago right which is is hopeful yeah for sure culture's changing for sure yeah and it takes bad things happening absolutely and that stinks it's it's it's it's sucks that it takes someone like lake and riley passing away being brutally murdered uh her family have to being having to endure what they've had to endure it sucks that it takes a naked man in the locker before people wake up but that's the point where we're at and that's just the reality of it so i think the good news though is that you know when the pendulum swings back it's going to swing back in a way where i think and i'm i'm seeing this i don't know what you got but i'm seeing like a lot of young people uh you know find their faith and and become more grounded in Christianity and a moral standard and value system you know five six years ago i think everybody was just like yeah you know it's a free country you could do what you want and i think people are starting to recognize that we need a value system in a morality system to operate a civilized society you know we can't let grown men dressed up as women go shake their fucking dicks drag queen happy hour or whatever story time you can't allow that you know what i'm saying we can't allow uh quote unquote minor attracted people to be around children you know this and i actually think that's the point of contention that's gonna that's gonna unify everybody i think the more these trans people and i out i'm talking about the grown men who like we played in the political Tuesday pedophiles who said yeah they're pedophiles and they're hiding in the those people are going to be the people that wake everybody up yeah 100% man guys jump in this conversation let us know what your guys's thoughts are um down in the comments let us know with that being said let's get a final segment of the show thumbs up a dumbest fuck so this is where we bring a headline up we talk about it it'll get one of those two options um so with that being said we got to do a follow up man because this story is is actually pretty wild um my thumbs up a dumbest fuck hell on reads infamous zoom driver who went viral for logging into virtual court hearing uh from his car is jailed again as saga of his suspended license takes another dramatic turn this is wild bro this is this is like i mean this is crazy this is crazy so we covered this already um it's a Michigan man have you seen this it's um yes it's a it's a it's wild it's wild i don't know what happened all bro this all i saw was when he was go the only thing i know is when he was on court for suspended driving while he's driving right okay so the Michigan man who became an internet hero for logging into a zoom court appearance for a driving offense from behind the wheel uh never had a license in the first place the new development is the latest in the saga surrounding 44 year old quarry Harris after footage may 15th hearing for an october traffic stop gained ground online uh he was said to have a suspended license leading judge sedric simpson to express disbelief over his signing into such a hearing behind the wheel so so here's the original video a system public defender natal state for mr. Harris we should be present is there mr. come on are you driving um actually i'm pulling into my doctors off it's actually so so i'll just give me one second i'm parking right now look at the judge he's like wait a minute might missing something you station here you guys good what's wrong no at the second yes i have all right what are we doing uh you're on here we are respectfully requesting an adjurement in this matter uh possibly before weeks of the court allow okay so maybe i don't understand something this is the driving one license suspended that is correct your honor um and he was just driving and bro they're all laughing at the past could you say why didn't i didn't even see that he's like what am i missing like am i missing something is with the charges your honor yes no i'm looking at his record he doesn't have a license he suspended and he's just driving that is correct your honor he knows it's coming now he tried to raise his hand he's probably is sweating bullets hello one minute mr. hairs i don't even know why he would do that so defendants bound is revoked in this matter defending his turn himself into the wash and i kind of do it by six p.m. today failure to turn himself in will result in a bench warrant with no bond thank you thank you mr. hairs i'll be giving you a call okay so that happened right now it took the internet by storm but then it came out that he actually wasn't suspended um and that it was actually like this clerical error they forgot to update it in the system right and so then he became like this hero i was like no he's innocent like he's good you know i'm saying he was ready to drive right well judge simpson he's a very smart guy so he dig dug into it again and now it's revealed that he wasn't driving on a suspended license he never even had one he has never had a driver's license and we got a video from a new heated hearing that just happened where he was jailed again here's the clip with any reference to your client having had a license on that day and some indication or misunderstanding as to whether or not he had a license let me make it very clear based upon what the court looked at he has never had a Michigan license ever and has never had a license in the other 49 states and commonwealths that form up this great union he has never had a license in point of fact when they suspended his license and what people don't understand when they suspended his license in sagging off they don't suspend the license they suspend the privilege to drive in this state hence for example if he had had a Kentucky license he would be able to drive everywhere that Kentucky would allow him to drive he just couldn't drive in Michigan because his privileges have been registered. He never had one and not not just in Michigan and none of the other states ever so he was he was jailed again and he sent him back to jail man it's a wild story bro I like judge man judge Simpson he's got it he's my guy anyway we got on this this thumbs up or what we doing I think it's a I think it's a a little bit of I mean it's it's comical and there's so much in our world that is is has a lot of gravity and weight and as it makes you just feel hopeless but this was good to me I liked it look at him where he's trust me trust me trust me yeah dude this guy don't seem like the sharpest tool man no you know what I'm saying like he seemed surprised he probably surprised he didn't have a license maybe he didn't know he did he did have I'd either he had not he I was just gonna ask I know you got a point yeah not he just didn't have jobs that poor guy yeah man judge Simpson man that's my we should get him on the show yeah I'm sure he's got some crazy stories bro he huge like there's I don't know who I don't know if it's him or somebody like but they stream all of his his core hearing is bro and like he is he is a firecracker he should just let us stream while he's doing core in commentary sure we can set it up comment everything's allowed nowadays so that's true wouldn't it be a lot it's just true so thumbs up on this sure I give it thumbs up sweet well guys and you Riley that's all I got Riley thanks so much for stopping through and doing the show no I appreciate you guys what you've built and developed is is unique it's rare it's just like it makes me want to be a better person of course being at HQ here seeing everything you guys have it's it's the people you guys even are anchored by their anchors it makes me want to be a better person so it's it's really cool and just a privilege to be on with you guys so thank you well thank you and that's that's that's mutual man you're doing good work you're standing up for what's right and that's very rare so we're big fans of you as well so well thank you yeah definitely feel free to stop on the show anytime you want I'll go race in a pool when you build it yeah I'm so great I got pretty good backstroke yeah that's all right is there any way that people can support you got any initiatives things you got going on yeah yeah actually just wrote a book it's called swimming against the current fighting for commonsense in a world that's lost its mind just came out last month just found out it's on the national bestseller list so super exciting stuff there I've got a podcast it is called gains for girls it's through outkicks so we're doing awesome work there you can follow me on x it's Riley underscore gains underscore uh my Instagram is Riley G Barker but that's all I've got going on sweet that's awesome well guys go check out her book make sure you give her a follow and uh don't be a hub show the show got her on bank row can't fold does it know here's shot case closed closed
