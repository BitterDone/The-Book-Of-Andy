all right well let's get into our dumbass of the day I think that's self explanatory we can skip that all right well dumbass of the day number two this is this is just pure karma this headline reads LA mayor Karen basses home broken into while people were inside suspect and custody did you see this no oh this is great this is this is great so Karen bass the Los Angeles mayor right she was one of the first through the defund the police and criminal sympathizing her house got broken into what she was there suspect was arrested after breaking into Los Angeles mayor Karen basses home early Sunday morning Los Angeles police department said about 6.40 a.m. an individual smashed a window to break into getty house while people were inside getty houses basses a fish or home and it's located on south Irving Boulevard and Windsor Square nearly five miles west of Los Angeles City Hall when officers arrived the apprehended the suspect without incident please say said nobody was injured during the incident adding that the investigation was ongoing the incident comes as crime continues to rise amid the LA district attorney's soft on crime approach to court cases Los Angeles district attorney George gas foam barred prosecutors from pursuing advanced punishments from for gang members amongst other things he took away cash bail he took away a bunch of different things and she is the one the spearheaded it and now she's dealing with the repercussions and anything on this good yeah I mean it's cool and these people aren't these people aren't going to stop doing this insane shit until it starts to affect them and all it's going to take is one or two of these mayors or these people getting fucking killed by one of these situations for everybody to wake up and say oh shit you know the whole reason we have so much of this bullshit these people have bought into is legitimately because they're stupid they're stupid people and they bought into this Marxist ideology that you know criminals you know prosecuting criminals is you know not something that we're going to do and it's starting to you know it's it's been ruining society for years and years and years and now it's starting to make its way to these people who make those rules and you know quite honestly like you know it's only a matter of time before a few of these people end up getting killed and and you know people start waking up to the damage they've done and and the problem is is that the damage they've done is very hard to correct you know what I mean yeah so yeah yeah I just thought this was this was great karma yeah coming right back to her she's glad that uh you know that the people were home because has she not been home they probably would do that's quada shit that would have been hilarious yeah I mean I don't know fuck these people that's what I think yeah I jumped down to come let us know what you guys that's what I think dude yeah like I'm so like I'm so tired of seeing our society just crumble because these people are a quote unquote above it you know what I mean yeah it's unaffected people affecting everybody that's right and people who think they're above the law people well they are above the law mm-hmm they're not think they are I mean how much shit have we seen happen that you know if you're a democrat or you're a criminal you get away with it and if you're if you're a opposite you don't I mean bro even back during COVID you know I'm sitting locking down everybody and then you got Gavin Newsom going to fucking five started restaurants and shit with like 15 people and no social business no mass it's yeah yeah because it's bullshit and they know it yeah it's the rules for the man and uh back kind of backfire on her well it's it here's the problem bro everybody keeps saying oh can you believe they're doing this yeah man they're doing it and until the American people get together and stand up against it and demand these people resign demand bro we should be having some sort of tax strike or some sort of you know collective unity that says hey fuck all of you yeah like we demand that you resign and if you don't there's going to be problems like that's where we should be we should be there as a people already and we're not a boycott of the government yeah that's that's what should be happening and you know I still think we're a far away from that I think a lot of people are still two three years behind in their understanding of what they think is actually going on you know you see all these people talking about man you know Biden's been a terrible president not according to their agenda to their agenda he's done everything that they want and it's been great for them and until people realize that they're not going to we're not going to come to the understanding of what's actually going on when they get up there and say oh the economy is wonderful that's not to gaslight us that's because to them the economy is wonderful they're making more money than they've ever made they have a green light to print however much money they want and they get kickbacks in all different ways and fashions that benefit them and so when when they're not going to go up there when they're making more money they've ever made and say oh the economy sucks they're going to want us to believe it's good so they can ride it out as long as possible and what we're seeing in this scenario is the intentional devaluation of our currency in order for them to switch over to a monitor digital currency and and right now they're filtering out as much money as they can so they can take it and they can buy assets before the collapse and then sell assets into the new digital currency after the collapse and maintain their wealth when they hyper inflate the US dollar bro that's going to fucking break a lot of people that aren't prepared that don't have assets that don't understand the concept what I'm saying here about acquiring assets liquidating them under the new currency if you if you can't do that you're gonna lose everything you got and if you don't have anything it's gonna affect you you know a lot of people say well fuck I only have a thousand bucks that doesn't really matter to me yeah it does because it's gonna break so many people around you that you're not gonna have the opportunity to even work you see what I'm saying yeah or that you that thousand dollars you have okay here here's the new currency will give you a seven fifty for that and they're gonna fucking break all these people especially the people who hold enough like their retirement and their cash and you know let's say you have a fifty-year-old couple or sixty-year-old couple who saved you know five hundred or are a million bucks in cash or a couple million bucks in cash because they've been you know playing by the rules well they're gonna fucking make that currency go away and that person's not gonna have shit and they're probably gonna say well we FDI and C insure your account for two hundred fifty grand so we'll give you that in digital currency but now you're after that you know it is what it is because you aren't savvy enough to change with the times and so while they're intentionally inflating our currency and creating a scenario where hyperinflation is gonna be the logical result of what's going on most people are completely unprepared because for that to transfer you've got to have some sort of asset that will go from one to the other like for example you know if you have gold or you have a jewelry or you have cars or you have property that are you know assets not very few cars are assets I'm talking about collector cars those assets will transfer post collapse right because they're gonna have a value and you just sell them for but if you've got cash bro and they and they ruin the currency you're fucking done you know and that's gonna happen to a lot of people bro unfortunately yeah yeah yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think uh with that being said let's get into our crews guys remember if you want to see any of these uh pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them link there with that being said let's get into headline number one let's check in with your favorite person who's your favorite person Andy this is sarcasm obviously you lover Hillary Clinton yes Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton you know hell number one with Hillary Clinton what Trump really wants is to kill an imprisoned opposition exile journalist have you seen this yeah oh dude is great I got the clip uh so former secretary of state Hillary Clinton implied that if former president Donald Trump wins the upcoming 2024 presidential election he would go to violent extremes regarding his opponents and journalists now during an interview on the podcast defending democracy on Friday Clinton spoke to host Mark Elias about Trump's behavior and remarks the 2016 presidential election and the 2020 presidential election is a prem court president Joe Biden and the upcoming 2024 presidential election here's the clip and they say oh you know Joe Biden's old I always say look you're right Joe Biden is old um he's also effective uh he's compassionate he cares about people uh he wants to maintain our democracy he will abide by the results of a fair and free election and that'll trump is old and he has 91 felony criminal indictments against him and in a court of law it's not just rhetoric you've got to step up and prove evidence that's one of the reasons you win so many cases Mark because the other side is in there just you know carrying on you know making claims they can't prove and you actually step up and you got facts and you got evidence how novel and you win because you have a better case this man has been indicted 91 times and do we really expect him to govern in a stable appropriate rules based respectful way of course not and if you're somebody who thinks well yeah but he's entertaining and politics is boring and you know I don't know what they do anyway you cannot think like that in this election no matter what issue can you care about I don't care what it is uh you will you will find that the next president will have some influence on that and you want somebody at the very least uh who will try to find what the facts are and make decisions uh that are evidence based um and finally I think we haven't talked much about the international arena but you know his bromance with Putin and it was actually called that I think by the former prime minister of Australia who said he saw Trump with Putin and and and Trump was like you know just Gaga over Putin because Putin does what he would like to do kill his opposition in prison his opposition drive you know journalists and others into exile rule without any check or balance that's what Trump really wants and so we have to be very conscious of how he uh sees the world because in that world he only sees strong men leaders he sees Putin he sees she he sees Kim Jong Un in uh North Korea those are the people he is uh modeling himself after yeah so real quick all I can when I was watching this I just kept looking in the background and all those fucking vases were vases what do they call them and I'm just thinking like taxpayer dollars taxpayer dollars taxpayer dollars that's what I was just talking about bro that's an asset that that that's what that's here that fucking vases probably were fucking a couple million bucks boss yeah it's whatever and fucking she fucking this is what I'm talking about you know historic antique furniture is one of the greatest that's one of the biggest ways that people longer money yeah it's embezzlement I mean I mean I'm not embezzlement it's money laundering 100% 100% it's like it's like hunters artwork yeah yeah that's insane but let's check in on Trump we haven't done so in a minute but uh you know he has that case going on right now the hush money case the evidence prosecutors can present in form of president testifies so man hat and district attorney Alvin Brack can bring up information from cases brought against former president Trump by New York attorney general let's issue James and E gene carol uh in cross examination of the 2024 GOP presumptive nominee should he testify in his own defense the judge presiding over the trial ruled Monday so they're talking right now about Trump testifying in his own trial and they're saying then the judge just ruled that if he does then Alvin Brack can bring up all the other cases to kind of like paint this picture of this criminal to the jury thought that was pretty interesting but it's important to bring to note guys Trump has never officially been charged or I'm sorry convicted of any crime um but that's where they're the judge ruled that you know they can bring all those other cases that are still ongoing to uh paint Trump is this criminal judge Juan Merchant who is presiding over the criminal trial decided Monday the Bragg's office can bring up information from James's lawsuit against the former president including New York judge Arthur and Goren's decision that found him liable a fraud not guilty liable um so that's going on they also played did you they played that uh do you remember that tape is like you know the graph him by the the Aussie tape yeah they had they played that that was like in their opening arguments from the prosecutors they played that trump maths to listen to the whole thing um he was forced to listen to the full transcript of the access Hollywood tape that's what it was and it was read all out to the jury as well and uh it's just interesting with all this stuff going on and did you got anything on this well it sounds like she's terrified it sounds like they're terrified and honestly I don't think I my personal opinion and from what I've been saying and what I've been observing is the harder they pushed on this shit the more people go towards Trump you know like people are recognizing that the DOJ is out of line here they're recognizing that it's been weaponized and they're recognizing how aggressive these people are these people are not Democrats that's the thing you have to understand that they are fucking communist and they're not going to walk out on stage to say hey we're communist but when you hear this woman say her favorite book is rules for radical by Saloninski and put him down as some sort of mentor to her and all these other communist books and manifestos like wrote these people aren't gonna walk out and say hey guess what guess what we're trying to do you know and and this is what people say well this was true it'd be on the news dude or what the fuck is wrong with your brain that's not how these people operate communist don't come in and say hey we're running for office as communists they come in and they subvertly take over in a revolution that's what's happened every single time in the history of communism which by the way has killed more people than any war any plague any natural disaster in the history of humankind and that's just the last hundred years okay so we need to recognize what's actually going on here and it's not oh normal political cycle and what she's saying is all correct except that's what they want to do right they are everybody recognizes that these people are projecting everybody recognize that these people are gaslighting everybody recognizes that they are full of shit unless you are completely brainwashed anti-Trump NPC which by the way I still think they know it's bullshit they just refuse to acknowledge it because they hate Trump so bad which is interesting because those people know that their people are full of shit and they think one that they're gonna be immune somehow to whatever changes they want to make to America they think that like ban you know when they bring that's fine they bring in communism we're all gonna be rich they'll redistribute wealth tell me a time in communism history where people have been wealthy they go to starving because they make society so expensive to run that people quit farming they quit building they quit manufacturing because you can't do it these companies I know it's hard to believe run on fucking math okay and if you have operating process that is too expensive to actually operate the company we are not in a position just to print more money like the federal government and these fucking idiots up in Washington who have never run a mother fucking snow cone stand can't even do math to understand that so what happens is the producers shrug their shoulders and say fuck it it ain't worth it no more and society stars and these people who root for this fucking bitch and all her fucking friends you people are walking into a death trap of your own because you are the people that will be killed first you are the least likely to be able to take care of yourself you're the least prepared you're a verse to weapons you don't know how to grow food you don't know how to do anything and you're dependent on these people's promises which they do not intend to keep which makes you what they call a useful idiot they manipulate you to help get them in power once they get in power they do away with you we talked about this on two different episodes with Curtis powers and about a hundred episodes without them all right I'm actually getting tired of pointing it out you guys who listen to the show you need to be pointing this out you need to be explaining this to your friends you need to be you know become the voice in your little community to wake people up and wake up their minds and their hearts to what's actually going on these people are not Democrats if you are a Democrat and you listen to show these people are not for you either okay so we have to come to an understanding of what's actually going on do you think it's an accident that all these people are coming across the border dude they have the lowest approval rating from their own party that they've ever had in the history of politics and their answer to that is to say fuck our voters that voted for us we'll just bring in more people that's their answer okay that's what they think of you as a Democrat so if you're sitting there and you're saying oh Hillary Clinton uh you know I'm with her you're a fucking moron for real dude and like by definition there is a term for you if you would take two days of your life and read rules for radicals or read Karl Marx you would find out that these people think you are a fucking moron and they're right because you don't do any research you don't look into anything you don't you can't figure out what's actually going on and you guys didn't know what's going on you won't speak to these people you won't try to wake them up because you're scared or you're afraid bro listen this is gonna get real real real real okay real soon these people if they are elected again will 100% because it's the next step in the communist takeover they will 100% arrest and probably kill every single person of any alternative media source that speaks up against them okay and that's not have to that's not Fox News that's Joe Rogan that's me that's fucking PBD that's all these dudes that you guys listen to for your information they will put all those motherfuckers in jail guaranteed that's what they do and then they kill them okay so that's the next step so that you won't have any voice so U.S. citizens have a choice to either stand up now and speak up now or don't have anybody to speak up for you or be with you after after this starts to go down and that's what's happening dude you guys think this is normal politics it's not normal politics no these people intend to eliminate any resistance they try to do it in COVID if you guys would if people would have bought COVID the way they wanted people to buy it their plan was to remove people who wouldn't go along with the vaccine from society they said it openly in a soft way a bunch of times what are we gonna do with these people they're killing everybody they won't wear a mask they won't get vaccinated this is a pandemic of being vaccinated severe death and destruction over the winter for anybody like bro we had we had people legitimate like go on the go on the Instagram page occupy Democrats and read the comments under the post and you think these people want to be reasonable with you they want you fucking dead this is not fucking you know accept our light way those same people that tell you to accept their way of life or you're a bigot or you're a racist or you're a this or that they passionately hate your way of life and are trying to take it from you that's the reality so until the common sense America and i'm not saying left or right i'm saying common sense people who believe in a free and fair United States of America until those people stand up and say fuck you this will not stop and it needs to stop to the point of where if we need to get together and say we don't even acknowledge these people as there are government anymore as a whole like these people these 600 people in Washington DC do not represent us at all and it's not Republicans or Democrats it's all of them they do not represent us you know yeah you know the thought that keeps going through my mind is like you know you look at this and like she she she alludes to it too in that clip you know but one of the things is it's like they keep they're they're now starting to and i've been seeing this narrative pick up a little bit that you know Trump won't accept the outcome of this election election and i feel like they're saying that because look at stealing again the truth is is that they would not they're not going to accept the outcome of the action and i think it's important for people to understand you know it's like you know all the damage that has been done in the last four years these tyrants these communists are not going to go down peacefully or without a fight you know i'm saying like they're not broke like they won't allow that no because they know their asses are on the line she's saying oh they're going to do this in that in this because she knows what the fuck they've done exactly she knows what the consequences are yeah and these media people who have locked blatantly lied blatantly lied about the pandemic blatantly lied about all this shit you know what they do deserve to be arrested they do you know yeah man so it's going to be one or the other it's either going to be us or them you know and until people fucking understand that you know that's what they intend she this woman if they get in power they will call for the arrest of everybody look what they did bro they took they've already shown their cards they've already taken people who support down on Trump put them on domestic terrorist list they got guys like Mike Glover who served in the fucking military in the CIA for 20 plus years of his life gave his best years of his life to the United States of America and now he's on a domestic terrorist list people who five years ago seven years ago would be celebrated as patriots and lovers of America are now on domestic terrorist list it's because they don't need them anymore they don't want them anymore they don't want the United States of America to be a quote unquote superpower anymore they're trying to create a one world government and to create a one world government just like a communist country they don't they need everybody to be brought down to a level of poverty so it's easy to control you see what I'm saying so they need to take the United States of America running into the ground so that it can be on the same level as a lot of these other countries so that they can control it better because they know that if people are poor if people are starving if people and especially are unarmed they can do whatever they want and so you know we have to make a choice dude we can either stand up now and make our voices heard and demand that these people fucking stop this bullshit or who knows what's gonna happen because the longer it goes on the harder it is to resist and the good news is I do think people are waking up but you all need to wake up a lot fucking faster and you guys need to get aggressive about sharing the message and your own community with your own friends having real conversations looking into it yourself becoming well versed and well-knowledgeed on your own and showing people what the fuck is going on yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think that being said let's go cruise on yeah oh buddy do I got some for you oh yeah oh oh buddy this first comment comes from at dirty eyes dirty eyes dirty eyes all right uh 80 you sound like a snowflake get the sand out your badge and try to be a man oh I don't even know what to say man oh man I mean the sand in the badge is pretty painful bro but it sounds like a hoot yeah yeah it does usually a little rash you know you get a little chafing you know I'm saying badges still don't clear that oh brother you know man all right yeah I don't even know what to say to that man I'm a snowflake because I fucking stand up for you fucks and don't even know what's going on dirty eyes you don't even know what the fuck's going on that's a problem they have dirty eyes yeah that's right yeah you can't see that's what it is all right let's see all right this one might be a little worse okay uh this one comes from at Shelton John he's talking about the doctors who did his hair transplant surgery from his nut sack to his face what doctors I think we were talking about I think this because this is uh from iG's I think this was one of the comments I mean it was a real um about the um about where you would talk about all the doctors that like perpetuated the bullshit yeah well I mean if they're gonna cut Dix off they probably do pubic hair transplant impossible yeah I mean I should look into that bro because like down there it's still dark I still look into it for sure down there it's still dark up here it's all silver I think I can go back in my age yeah I like it I think it's funny all right Shelton yeah yeah good job yeah Shelton you made a funny all right and then finally let's let's get to some more notice how fucking terrible the the people on the left make jokes oh I mean it's pretty bad yeah it's

just like Hillary bro like Hillary say in the shit that she's gonna do and what she is that's what these people do you know that probably what's Hillary commenting that whatever yeah my badger so Sandy and he's got the Sandy Vatch Sandy Vatch oh man guys have a lot of number two uh this is the answer one because I think it's again there's too many games that are being played right now with too many world powers um and the shit's gotta stop hello number two reads I ran allied militia coalition claims its base in Iraq was hit by an air strike you see this fucking cares fucky people well look everybody over there fucking blow yourselves up I'll give shit a lot of saying I'm tired of hearing about it bro we got fucking five million people on the fucking streets in America dude I don't give a fuck I'm tired of it I'm tired of y'all taking our money and our fucking all our shit and all our fucking division is created over it fucking do what you're gonna do shut the fuck up that's what I think so an air strike early Saturday hit a base uh you has to do with fucking the United States bro I don't care I really don't know it's really I think it's wrong that people are getting slaughtered and all yeah I do but at the same time we got our own fucking problems yeah and I'm like I'm fucking I'm fucking tired of it dude I'm tired of like shouldn't our focus as Americans be on what the fuck is going on here and every time these things happen overseas all people do is cry about what's happening overseas and they act like what's happening here isn't even happening we're numb to it that's what it is bro I think most America I mean bro no they keep thinking America is the best country in the world that's because you haven't fucking been anywhere right right right we got a long way to go to get back to that bro and I think we can get back to it I'm not saying that I love this country but fuck bro to sit here and say that that's like the last team of the NFL saying we're a fucking great team uh your record would say otherwise yeah cowboys whatever anyway sorry yeah no you're good yeah so air strike early Saturday hit a base used by the popular mobilization forces a coalition of Iran allied militias and Iraq the groups had an assatement uh the attack on the uh kowsu military base north of babalon a farmer us post that was handed over to the Iraqi military in 2012 and wounded three PMF members set to a militia officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press now here's the thing so sent com or us central command denies the us behind the Iraq air strike um us central command or sent com is refuting reports claiming the us conducted air strikes in Iraq following a blast at a military base in the country that killed a member of an Iraqi security force um they put out a tweet um us central command tweeted out we are aware of reports claiming the United States conducted air strikes in Iraq today those reports are not true the United States has not conducted air strikes in Iraq today interesting right there was also a blast at kowsu military base around 30 miles south of Iraq's capital city Baghdad in early hours on Saturday local time uh killed one member of Iraq's popular mobilization uh forces or PMF and left eight people wounded according to rotors now here's the interesting thing this is where it gets interesting so there was no drones or planes in Iraqi airspace during the military base blast right so Iraq security services set on Saturday 20th there were no war plans or drones in the air during overnight explosions that rocked Iraq's military base housing a coalition of pro-Iranian armed groups uh an Iraqi security forces media units said in a statement that air defense command reported no drones or combat aircraft in the air space of Babylon province before or during the explosion now daily daily wire uh wrote this article says new uh helon reads new images show base of Iranian back group in Iraq was completely destroyed in strike um israel also denied that's the interest so this happens in the United States immediately comes out in Israel immediately comes out and say hey we had nothing to do with this um but they also denied uh any involvement Iraq said that did not detect any of the foreign objects right now here's the interesting thing the United States and israel are the only two countries that would have interest in this in Iraq they're the only two countries that have both both have advanced stealth jets that would be invisible to enemy radar right um here's a clip of one of the bases um they got hit and in addition to you know having those airplanes that are capable of stealth flight um the US and israel also both possess advanced missiles that have the ability to completely evade detection my enemy radar right and so i rec saying that hey we didn't catch anything over the skies and the only two countries with those capabilities are both saying it wasn't us is there another country that potentially has this like what are we doing um it's interesting now speaking of israel let's move top spring it back to home base here uh you see the protests that are happening here yeah they're massive yeah they're massive and it's causing quite an uproar Columbia University anti-Israel protesters five dramatic moments from a week of chaos so protesters at Columbia University have spent days protesting against israel war with Hamas forcing authorities to arrest more than one hundred of the agitators and the schools president has shifted all classes to virtual learning on monday amid safety concerns uh Columbian uh Columbia University president dr. Named uh Munech Shafik uh mostly closed the campus and urged commuting students not to travel to the campus and the statement posted just after 1 a.m. on monday uh in the statement the president said uh she was deeply satan by certain actions of the agitators who have formed an encampment on the campus and have riled students and faculty with anti-Jewish slogans and chance statement is the latest action from the schools administration amid the fiery protest and and around new york city campus to begin wednesday as dozens of anti-Israel activists created an encampment on the main lawn of campus um here's a few pictures of it right now it's interesting how many of them have the same exact tense in that in that interest though it's just Wal-Mart it's almost like same place i got the pool it's almost like they were organized hmm what's that remind you of uh let's see it reminds me of the bricks being dropped off during uh 2014 here right mic brown protests reminds me of the signs during George Floyd the t-shirts during George Floyd i mean it reminds me of all the organized protests that we've had the burned down the country in the last four years yeah kind of what that reminds me of me too um now i'll say this right america's america right freedoms are freedoms right to rights and we have to respect those um those rights of other people no matter if we disagree with why they're exercising those rights protests protest right now the interesting thing here is that uh you know this whole narrative of anti-Semitism and calling everything anti-Semitic uh just for simply asking questions perhaps right has been um has been on the rise um but now it's taken a whole different direction an entirely different direction um this video clip comes out from uh this twitter user his name is leacom um he posted this video um let's watch it let's watch it here's a clip we have to stop crying to educate anti-Semites and we have to hurt them instead decades of education has not worked it has not worked it is the worst it has ever been it has actually failed this is the most dangerous time to be a Jew in our living lifetime education has failed to stop those who are anti-Semitic stop trying to cure them stop trying to heal them stop thinking it's your job to be some kind of nurse or therapist for them or savior for their fucking hatred stop trying to heal anti-Semites and hurt them that will make them stop they will not stop because of intellectual ideas they will not stop because you magically put butterflies in unicorns and fairies and love into their heart they will stop out of fear because they know they will get hurt they will stop because it is unpleasant to get hurt and when I say hurt i'm talking of course within the law every legal means available to you if someone transgresses and his anti-Semite you must to the best of your ability ruin their fucking life ruin their fucking life as best you can without remorse without pity and without any excitement just factually objectively cause them pain legally with their reputation financially damage them hurt them maybe they'll think twice and maybe other anti-Semites will think twice too it's not your job to educate them it's not going to work by all means continue educational programs in order to reach those who aren't anti-Semitic or who have a transgress but stop trying to educate away anti-Semitism we need to hurt those who try to hurt us it's a deeper more immediate more emotionally understood thing in the very cells of your body to be scared of getting hurt to be scared of experiencing a cost to your life and reputation and your pocket and your freedom so that is the future of stopping anti-Semitism it's not education it's fucking hurt in anti-Semites and it's very important it's quite a subtle but big shift it's not subtle actually it's a big fucking shift of where we are that is how to do it the current methodology has not worked it's failed have the grandeur and the intellectual honesty to admit that this is the worst it's ever been and all of the programs and initiatives to try and educate people in anti-Semites they have fucking failed so we need to instill a fear in people and pain and let them know that there's a fucking cost if they hurt us and that we fucking on a shame and leave will stand proudly behind the pain will of minister to anyone who tries to fuck with us or fucking hurt us okay and that's all I want to say that's the fucking way don't heal anti-Semites fucking hurts them you know it's interesting because you say I'm like you know fire them financially and some of those like they would have control of those different places sounds like it not only does it sound like that that sounds awful like like cancel culture yeah hmm wonder where that came from and here's the other thing everybody's an anti-Semite just like everybody's a racist just like everybody's a massacres just like everybody's at everything that you don't want us to fucking be for asking mother fucking question and bro I'm gonna tell you this that little video you made ain't helping your cause okay it ain't helping your cause because and let's be real do we see of all these Jews getting fucking killed in the streets no we don't see that but what we do see is fucking tens of thousands of Palestinian children being fucking slaughtered and if we ask a question about it we're anti-Semitic that's not that's not okay that's not okay okay and it is not anti-Semitic to ask questions it is not anti-Semitic to point out statistical fact it is not racist to ask questions it is not racist to point out statistical fact and for this guy to get on the internet and say all this shit that he's saying that only furthers the divide and creates more problems are there legitimate anti-Semitic people yeah are there legitimate racist people yeah are there people out here are there people out here who who fake these victim protected classes so you can't criticize them in any way shape or form yes and and dude these people who are protesting for Palestine you know it's it's it's these people are it's it's very the economy the economy's weird here no it's very it's it's it's a lot of the base for Joe Biden it's a lot of the base for the Democrats that they're pissing off by allowing this to happen right and and so I didn't think they I don't think they counted on that to happen and and those people are not going to go out and vote Joe Biden they're not going to bro they hate him for what what's happening and uh I don't know man like real talk you know you can you call anybody anti-Semitic for saying that you're anti uh genocide but doesn't that make you anti Arab doesn't that make you anti Muslim right and that just as important you know like these people they say oh well we're God's chosen people so there's a fucking elitist aspect in a lot of these people and it's not all Jewish people in fact most of them aren't like that it's the fucking it's the very radical you know it's a sect of them and they have a superiority over everybody else which is why they get on here and say this shit you know dude I don't know man like guys like that are making it dangerous for all Jewish people and that's that's fucking wrong you know because most Jewish people don't even understand what the fuck is going on so fucking hurt them bro you've been trying to hurt people for the last fucking 20 years that's the problem people are tired of getting called anti-Semite people are tired of getting called names they're tired of getting bullied they're tired of being forced to go along with things that they don't want to go along with they're tired of being called a misogynist they're tired of being called a racist those name calls don't matter anymore because they've been completely overused and people are and now they're throwing a fucking temper tantrum because people are ignoring it when they used to say anti-Semite and then all the so oh my god no no no no no no no no no now it's like anti-Semite whatever bro everybody's an anti-Semite right and so like dude if we want to move this fucking society forward guys like this need to be fucking need to shut the fuck up because at the end of the day we're gonna all have to work together it's not fucking Jewish people versus white people and black people are fucking Arab people it's fucking we have a country full of all different cultures that is gonna have to get together just being intentionally divided by a fucking group of tyrants a lot of which are elite Jewish people and then there's other people that are not Jewish and it doesn't make these people are criminals bro criminals are fucking criminals that's right and so like dude this guy getting on here and saying this shit like bro you're just hurting the cause and like what I fucking hear when he's saying that is he's afraid I feel like he's afraid bro you know this is the worst time that ever existed for Jews I don't know bro we have all these times that were where Jews were persecuted hundreds of times through history they were persecuted more than any other person there's you know we we have all this all these stories about everything that's happened over fucking a thousand years and bro at the end of the day who gets them who can you not criticize Jews yeah you can do it why you can't do you criticize white people all day you could make whole fucking you know white supremac you make up whole narratives about whiteness you whiteness is evil whiteness is bad fuck whiteness white people are this and that in this you say fucking one thing about fucking Jewish people and it's like oh my god we're going to fucking take all your shit fuck you we're gonna fire you we're gonna cancel you fuck you fuck this fuck that and then they wonder why people eventually are like wait a minute right right right is there truth to this right you know I'm saying like right so dude this kind of shit doesn't help anybody it's not fucking good for anybody uh he sounds scared which I could see why because people are not caring about this shit anymore and it's been total intimidation it's been total fucking cancel culture you know and it's been mainly fucking geared towards white people white people get canceled what who else gets canceled does joy reggae cancel for saying the racist shit she says on national fucking television oh she's broke imagine if a white dude got up there and said exactly what he said about black people or Jews imagine that the exact same thing he said but white somebody white said that oh yeah you see what I'm saying it'd be national fucking news so there's a clear double standard and what people can say and not say and I want to be clear I fucking there's room for everybody here but they're in room for people like that no now and I'm not saying people like that Jews I'm saying individuals like him yes yeah he we need to stop generalizing and start saying it's this guy it's this guy it's this guy it's this guy it's this guy I've only said this a thousand times if we continue to generalize black people white people Jews Arabs we can't get anywhere because it's not a real discussion it's not true Jews have criminals I fucking hate to tell you I know you think your gods chosen fucking people all people have value all of us we all have that you don't have more value than us mother fucker I don't give a fuck what you think or say okay secondly not all black people are fucking criminals some are not all white people are criminals guess what some are okay so until we start fucking saying it's Steve it's Klaus Schwab it's Bill Gates it's this it's that or whoever the fuck we think it is and stop they want us to generalize that's where we lose yes because they can hide behind the generalization I think something else that was interesting to in this guy's video is I think he also is very aware of how the base has turned on that narrative too because if you notice what he said in there he said it doesn't matter how many rainbows and unicorn stickers we give them it does not matter did not help so I didn't read it like that I read it like heat what he's saying is trying to peacefully coerce them isn't working that's how I read that yeah I don't know maybe I'm reading it a little deep I just thought that was interesting because I mean that's the exact people that are in that in that that little encampment well you know what I'll be real dude you know saying yeah but here's what I tell you because white culture has been so hammered with racist and cancel culture and all this shit they're afraid to say anything you know like you don't think that white people here joy read and they're like they have fuck you of course they think that right and then if they say they think that they're racist the fuck out of here dude I ain't with that shit no no that doesn't make sense no it's it's it's intentionally does not make sense it's absolute double standard bro and it's very dangerous this is how this is how the Rwanda genocide started we had radio broadcasters in Rwanda saying these people are less than fucking bacteria they're these they're these kind of people and these kind of just like what they say about fucking white people in public they say and pop imagine the shit they say about white people being said about black people in public right imagine the shit being said upset on national TV the shit joy read says and other fucking people in the media say openly imagine that being said next time you hear them talk about whiteness or white people or this or that imagine that being said about anybody else right it's unacceptable and then it's something too it's like you know you look at the Rwandan genocide and what happened was like you know you had this build up of pressure of all these narratives and all these things being said and then one day tens of thousands of machetes just dumped just appear yeah just appear piles of them just appear yeah right and so like people got to remember man there is name there is a an intentional push bro behind the shit these people have already proved there's listen there is a fucking part of society that has already proven that they would be a hundred percent for removing people that don't agree with them from society meaning execute them we saw it during covid bro you don't think these people who were freaking the fuck out about covid remember the comments bro I hope you get covid and die how many comments I saw tens of thousands of people saying that I hope you get covid and I hope your family gets covid and I hope they all fucking die remember that they proved it already it's already been tested bro people better start standing up for themselves and black people and white people and fucking Asian people and Latino people and Jewish people that all are common sense need to start standing up against all this shit it's bad shit never ends good no never ends good no if people were saying this openly about black people I'd be standing up being like this is bullshit and you all fucking listen to show know that I would too if it was being said about Jewish people blah blah blah just like I say now when I say hey they're all fucking Jewish people like let's get to the right thing here there's bad people and they doesn't matter what fucking group they belong to we need to hold them accountable it's real shit man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think let's talk about some real racism what's going to happen on three so headline three is brought to you by the news outlet that brought you 75 hard challenge workouts dangerous okay oh yeah the same you remember that one yeah and

with crying blood tattoo as critics who believe it's real say she should have refused and warned he'll never get a job now you like tattoos I like tattoos right tattoos are cool you know some people get interested tattoos with no meaning and you know that's a separate group but I think this is in a whole different category so a tattoo artist has caused a stir on Instagram after claiming she gave a client a crying blood tattoo Atlanta based tattoo is Portia lay or Lee he Lee Lee okay Portia Lee all right see what they did there it's like Braxton with two X's yeah got it um share a video as if people have you know exceptional reading skills that's what yeah that's what it is is true yeah let's confuse them more this is a vow this is a castle oh fuck you see do you have to sound it out I mean they got me poor sure poor Shirley okay all right share it share the video of an unknown man who appeared to be inked with blood red tear drops which ran down from his eyes to his mouth the supposed tattoo imitated real tears with scarlic ink pooling and clumps beneath his eyelid before thinning out as it reached the lower half of his face Portia acts her followers whether they would consider getting the same tattoo but some people said the body art was too wild while others claimed it would ruin their chances of getting a good job although the tattoo looked to look 3d to be a real inking her followers were convinced it was genuine and reacted in the uproar here's the tattoo is that real yes real no it's real this is real he did it guess what he didn't do good job good job oh my god he wouldn't do that anyway I don't understand why these people are surprised they don't get a job I saw this video from this chick who had fucking tattoos all over her face like all over her face and she tried to apply to get a job at it was like Walmart or something and they didn't they didn't call her back and she made this like video on tiktok like being a kick you to job because of my tattoos they're discriminating no fucking shit no shit wasn't going to happen you know like bro if you tattoo your face and you know if you're an artist or a singer or something where it's appropriate and you've actually already kind of made it and you know this is going to be your career okay sure I can understand getting out there a little bit you know what I'm saying getting your neck done getting a fucking you know it's becoming more and more acceptable but when you get your fucking face tattooed what job could you actually do what can you do you can't be I mean that you're severely limiting yourself even if you're a talented individual because guess what you're weird you're fucking weird bro like I know you want everybody to accept you for everything and and this is the culture we live in we want everybody to accept every fucking thing about everybody you can have 4,000 piercings in your face and be look like fucking pinhead and you know oh they're discriminating against me yes yes we told you were told this before you got this shit you sure people told you this your parents told you this other people told you this and now you feel entitled to get the same treatment as everybody else I was talking to a dude one time who's fucking heavily tattooed like his whole fucking body his whole face everything because I don't give a fuck bro I'm friends with everybody done by me and we were sitting in a bar and we were drinking and he goes he said something he's like you know like he said something like oh you know it's like you know because I'm a minority and this guy's white I'm like you're you're fucking white dude and he goes yeah but I got tattoos all over my face everybody stares at me all the time I'm like that don't make you a minority like no shit they stare at you you're fuck you fucking have shit all over your face and all over the rest of your body and nobody else has what's he thought that he was gonna get all these tattoos of his face and nobody was gonna look at him I guess that's what these people think I don't know what they think bro I got I got lots of tattoos but like when I you know if I go on vacation somewhere or I take my shirt off and people stare at me I'm fucking I'm like yeah well it's because I'm fucking blasted you know what I'm saying so I like that yeah but I still wouldn't do that on my fucking face you know what I'm saying like and then there's something to do look cool like Dave's a little fucking tattoo that he's got on his chops that's cool yeah I like that it's not chopsticks no it is no it's not it's a fucking hammer and a fucking it's it's a it's it's a chisel or something or a pickaxe ain't fucking chopsticks motherfucker that's racist I'm being so fucking for real first of all Dave don't even eat anything but fucking chicken fingers and and grilled cheese bro Dave don't know how to use no fucking chopsticks betrayal he I'm just saying anyway I really not thought like jelly roll yeah why Emily calls them chopstick the chopstick that's because Emily calls everybody stupid as names Emily you should hear what she calls you when you ain't around bro no bro she's the most you guys think I'm fucking wild bro why don't you put her on your show there's a reason yeah it's funny because they said in the article they're like while tear drop tattoos have often been associated with murder or gangs it is unclear what the meaning behind the crying blood tattoo is yeah I don't I don't know man this is out of lighting the mold there why is it look 3d though like that's it does look like it's
