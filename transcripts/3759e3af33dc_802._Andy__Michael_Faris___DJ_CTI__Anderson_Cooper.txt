What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the real estate lives, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcoming motherfucking reality guys today we have Andy and DJ Cruz the motherfucker That's what's going to do that's what C.T.I. stands for stands for cruise the internet we're going to put topics of the day up on the screen over here we're going to talk about them we're gonna speculate on what's true and what's not true, and then we're going to talk about how either people can solve these problems going on in the world. Other time throughout the week we have shows within the show. We have Q and A F. That's where you could submit questions and we give you the answers. Questions are typically about business, personal development, how to kick ass and win it life, but you can ask us about anything. And there's a couple ways to ask those questions to get them on the show. The first way is guys, you can email these questions and to ask Andy at any for selling icon or you go on YouTube on the Q and A F episode, drop your question in the comments and we'll pick some from there as well. Other times we're going to have real talk, real talk is just five to 20 minutes and me giving you some real talk. And then we have 75 hard verses. That's where someone who has completed the 75 hard program comes on the show, talks about how their life was before, how their life is now and how they use the 75 hard program to reclaim their life. Alright, and if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard is the initial phase of the live hard program, which is the world's most popular mental transformation program ever. And you get it for free at episode 208 on the audio feed. Again, that's 208 audio feed only, not on YouTube, weren't on YouTube when that came out. So there's also a book. The book is called the book on mental toughness. It's available Andy for sell a calm. It's not required, but it is an in-depth book in very popular. If you're somebody that likes to know the ins and outs, you'll have the entire live hard program in that book, plus a whole bunch of chapters on mental toughness that aren't on the free version, plus a bunch of case studies, some very famous people who use mental toughness to become the very famous people that you recognize today. Now, we do things a little different here on the show. Alright, you're not going to hear 45 minutes ads and 10 minutes of show like most other shows. We don't do ads here. And the reason we don't do ads here is because we keep it real. And because we keep it real, we are constantly dealing with censorship, shadow bands, traffic throttling, and all kinds of other stuff. Alright, so we ask very simply to help us share the show, help us grow the show. Alright, so if we make you think, if we make it laugh, if we give you a new perspective, you think it's something that's important for people to hear, do us a favor and share the show. Alright, don't be a hoe. Share the show. Alright, what's up, dude? What's going on, brother? Not much. How you been? Oh, you know, lost changes yesterday. Yeah. Alright, it really was a whole lot, but I, you know, as always, we're able to pull it together and make it work. Yeah, there we go. Some stuff. Now, guys, we do have a guest on the show. My buddy, Mike Ferris is on the show with us. What's up, brother? It's a man. How are you? Good. He has a very unique story that we'd like to share with you all because a lot of people have forgotten about a lot of things that have happened in the past. So tell them why you're here, brother. Well, basically because there was a lot of unconstitutional activities that took place in the airspace of our skies in COVID. And so somebody had to hold them accountable. Looks like I'm the guy. Yeah. So let's kind of go through the process of what happened with you guys during COVID and how it, how it came to be and where you at now? Well, basically, you know, in the beginning, the airlines had kind of instituted their own mask mandate. Well, before the FTM, it was put in place by Joe Biden. And so in the, in the space of, you know, air travel, they have laws and regulations to abide by, just like us, lowly peasants down here. And in order to follow those laws, we looked at two regulations. One is 14 CFR, 3D, 2. And the second one is the ACAA, which is the Air Care Your Access Act. In those two regulations, basically, it tells them that they cannot discriminate against anybody for any reasons, anywhere in the world. And they did it anyway. I have a mask exemption medically from a doctor, Russell Soroski out in New York. And I didn't even realize I had the, the disorder until, you know, the mask became a thing. But anyway, nonetheless, the TSA by the arm of Joe Biden colluded with the airlines to prevent anybody not willing or able to wear a mask to travel the US airspace and beyond. So I had initially filed a lawsuit against the TSA in a six circuit. Two days later, was put on a terrorist watch list. Oh, welcome. It's not bad. I'm just a little disappointed I got to watch it. So hopefully, hopefully it's a brightening or something. I get rid of this Apple watch. But anyway, I had to file a motion in that six circuit to be removed from that list. And of course, the next time I travel, I was off of it now. Interestingly enough, you know, when you get put on that list and, you know, whether it's a mistake or not, you can file kind of some paperwork with the DHS and tell them they made a mistake. And it's been what two and a half years. And I even heard a word back from that reporter rebuttal. So quite interesting to see how that took place. Ultimately, we lost that case with the TSA because there was a lawyer out of DC, who basically just wakes up every day and sees a TSA for absolutely any fucking thing that he wants. Right. So in that space, because it's a federal agency, that has to be done in that quarter of a pill. You can't do it under like a state level federal court type deal. And so because his argument wasn't that great, it kind of got through to the side. So our next objective was hold the airlines accountable as well as a CDC. And so we had attached that three letter agency to those airlines because through the arm of that agency and then the TSA through their security directive, you know, they were trying to hide behind this mask that they were just following the rules, but that wasn't the case. So for me, I submitted, you know, the mask exemption of the airlines gave them the negative COVID test showed them I wasn't a threat to their airspace. And yet again, 26 times on American and 23 on United, they rejected my ability to fly mask free and my constitutional right. And so that's while we're sitting here today, I think in discussing this topic that has long been forgotten, it seems. Yeah. So where's everything yet now? So right now, the in the Western District of Kentucky, there's the lawsuit that's still active, which is actually, I think what brought us here from the Gateway Pundit article. And they covered the TSA watch list one as well, but it didn't really take off to, you know, certain people the way this one did. But I think it's because what you have is a guy following the very founding principles of this country and basically going after its government and its corporate entities for redress. And done it without a lawyer. And it's not easy to sue the airlines because they're basically shielded by all of these laws that are unlawful. When I say that, I mean like the deregulation act and the FAA act and the ACAA, which is that air carrier access act I spoke about. But right now, where it stands out of the 37 charges that we put in a complaint, a lot of them being to do with constitutional and state law violations, two of them stuck. One of them was the California Unru Act and the other one was under the Rehabilitation Act. So the Unru Act is pretty cut and dry and straightforward. And so basically, it's a California law that states you can't discriminate against anybody anywhere in place no matter what it is, whether it's physical mental, whether you can see it smell it, fill it, touch it, whatever. So the second one is the Rehabilitation Act, which because they accepted CARES funding under the CARES Act, you know, the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Structuring Act. The Rehabilitation Act basically says if you take this as a subsidiary from the taxpayers, then you will abide by this rule, which is basically mirrored to that Unru. And so we've now passed through the, what they call motion to dismiss phase. So we'll go into like discovery and get to start subpoenaing some documents and saying, you know, basically showing some true colors here, these, you know, corporate agencies that think that they're above the law, you know. So you are now, I could be wrong in this, but aren't you like the last lawsuit going with these guys? There's another one's on appeal, uh, Ghaniam Aaron Abadi, and they have, um, obviously dismissed his case at the federal level. So now his next step would be go to that same court of appeals, kind of like you would sue the agency, right? Because you can't sue them materially. That's basically just for an agency or policy change. And so much like what happened with the mask mandate itself and that Southern District of Florida with Judge Miselle, who set it aside or, you know, deemed it arbitrary and capricious due to it violating the Administrative Procedures Act. Um, that's what he's going into now. He's appealing the decision of the lower court judge. And, uh, but those are the last two that I know of, the conversation I had with legal counsel, their legal counsel, the, the airlines was that he had five left. I can't find the other three, but they bury this shit, man. It's not like they don't, they don't want you to know. They don't want anybody to know. No, fuck no, they don't want nobody because they don't want anybody else come out. They don't want them to know that there's a way, there's a path to accountability outside of paying a man of $100,000 who don't really have your interest in mind, right? Right. And he's only in it for the money because when we reached out to legal counsel in the beginning, though what the guy would speak to me without saying I want $100,000 up front, uh, basically told him to kick rocks. And so at that point, you know, you have an option to basically research the path and then follow it and just try to maintain and make it to the end, you know. So, so you've been fighting this stuff on your, on your own, is that what you're saying? Well, yes and no, like so I can't have, first of all, I can't make this a class action per se, right? Because I'm not, um, a legal counsel. I don't have a bar, you know, any license to practice in any state. So I can only represent myself. And so the same as these other individuals, we had a coalition of folks and there was about six of us that went through the, the court of appeals on the TSA side, all of them were shot down with that same, uh, theory that I told you earlier with the lawyer who sued the TSA for absolutely anything. But as far as those same people that used that airline or those airlines, all of those cases have been dismissed to this date. Now, the one from Aaron is in appeal, but mine is the only one left from the original complaint. And so I think what we've got is a little bit of, um, I don't want to call it luck or a guy who took the laws and read them as the textual structure is made and said, hey, you know, yeah, he does have a right to sue you because if you look at, um, those other acts I told you about the Dreg FAA and these ACAAs, basically they're going off of the Civil Rights Act of 1974 that the Supreme Court had decided there was no private right of action of the citizen to sue an airline because corporate America, right? So for instance, um, you know, if, if, if you get on an airplane with a, a wheelchair per say and they do them like they did me in the mask exemption theory, which is like, oh, you've got approved us that you have an exemption and then you have to basically prove to us that you can't wear it. Imagine if they told someone in a wheelchair, you can't walk these 10 meters and if you fall, we'll put you back in the wheelchair and we'll put you on board, right? Even if they were to do that to someone in a wheelchair and it was that egregious, you know, which I can't really compare that because I'm not disabled in that manner. I have an anxiety disorder. That's it. It's very simple, but it stems back from a childhood things, but ultimately, um, if they do that to that individual, that individual's redress is to follow the complaint with the DOT and let the DOT find that airline and accept that money to the government, not the person that they discriminated against. So there's no path for you to go in and say, you owe me either monetarily or on a policy change note for disrespect to me or discriminating me or crashing me down as a citizen, the government takes that money and they get paid dues off of your injury. Yeah, suffering. Yeah. That's crazy. It's wild. I mean, this ACAA has been there since 1986. I think the ADA has been there since 1974. Civil Rights Act since 1964. I mean, and nobody's paying attention because they don't care. I mean, it's not affecting them in that manner, but all of these acts and laws are kind of written blatantly against the Constitution. 100%. Yeah. That's crazy. Wow. I'd imagine you probably ruffled some feathers. I mean, like, because I mean, we talk about all the time, like the lawyers, the attorneys and shit involved in all of this stuff, like they're all buddies, right? So to see this, because you're from Kentucky. Yeah. I mean, see this guy come in from Kentucky, right? You didn't go to none of the Ivy League. You never been, you know, I'm saying, I bet it pisses some people off. I mean, whether deal with any bullshit on that side of things. What I've seen mainly, so, you know, the courts are supposed to take this really cautious approach for a pro-seilit again because they know that they're not scholar in legal functions and activities, but you still have to follow the process. I mean, you have to follow the rules of the court, the federal rules of civil procedure, things like all of that, you have to follow those. It has to be submitted a certain way. Basically, what you're learning in law school, you have to follow those things. I mean, you can't just go knock on the door and say, hey, I'd like to say these guys were bad to me, right? You can't do that. So I would imagine Roy Goldberg, who is the lead attorney of the other three high paid lawyers that are running against the red neck from Kentucky, must be a little worried at the moment. Good. Yeah. And bring it. How's the, how's the feedback been from people you know, when people around you, you know, you going through all this process? I mean, have they supported you? Have they told you give it up or like what's it been? A little bit of both. Well, I mean, my biggest supporter right now has been my wife, right? Because all this stuff takes time. And so you have to separate yourself from the family environment because you go to work, you got a business, I got a small business. I've traveled a lot to follow these helicopters on the world. And then when I'm home, I kind of got to be absent in researching this bullshit to tell them they made a mistake and you know, didn't follow the law. So most of my friends definitely support me. But if you want a sizable scale of kind of how society feels about it, I've got a give-sign go account. And it's been up there about two weeks. There's about $135 in it. So and it's shit. I mean, it's been shared. It's public. It's there. I mean, it's working. Working people get that. It's givesingo.com forward slash Michael Ferris or you can go to givesingo.com and just research my name. It's still in the. Michael sure. Yeah. F a r i s. Yeah. F a r s. Yeah. Michael Ferris. Well, do look. I've been talking to a lot of people about this too. And it's frustrating for me how willing people are to just brush that whole time frame under the rug because that was very much so crimes against humanity very much so unprecedented in our in our human history. And if people really understood what that was all about, they'd be a lot more pissed about it. But it seems like people, you know, they got so exhausted that they just want to move on with their lives. And that's pretty dangerous because what happens the next time they do it? What happens the next time they do it? You know, what happens the time after that? We have a new precedent now where they can just shut down our country and shut down our world and take our businesses and do whatever the fuck they want because not enough people are doing what what you're doing and standing up against them. You know, so I mean, I think too it's like, you know, we say this all the time too. It's like, you know, the shit that these tyrants do. It's always well within the law per se that they wrote. Yeah, they write well, they done it to well, man, just like I had this conversation with the gentleman who introduced me here. Very good guy. Colin, but, you know, insurance companies and lawyers have all gotten together with these lobbyists in, you know, the bureaucratic northern part of, you know, our country and and smoke the same cigars. We smoke have being patriots and protected themselves. Yeah. You know, so it's it's shitty because if if I may, I mean, I can go into the the whole collusion and conspiracy of it all, but basically, I mean, when you look at the laws and who they affect, right, I talk about, I'll try not to use acronyms too much, but I've went through most of this, but the ADA, Americans disability act, right? The TSA is governed by that act as well as the public space of the airports anywhere you go. As far as the airlines, because of those other acts of that preempt this ADA, they're not under the ADA. They're under that ACAS book about. Well, I'll tell you, based on my experience and actually, Ian Smith had the same experience with the quad S terrorist watch list and time and time again, he had to go through that extra security. You can act with him during this process. I did. I tried to, you know, I'd see if maybe it was good to bring him on it and I don't know, he's busy and I get it. But ultimately, it would have been nice to have him here because he could share to these same folks on this show that he did show that same exemption, which was almost mere same doctor gave him the exemption and it worked for him on Delta. But these other five that I gave it to Southwest, JetBlue, United American and the other one, sorry, I've lost my train of thought here, but anyway, I want to get to the collusion part. They all rejected it. Now to get through the security checkpoint with TSA, what they would try to do is say, well, you didn't get a mask exemption from the airline. So you can't come through this tax payer funded federal agencies checkpoint if you don't have that from them. Well, that's a that's a conspiracy. So, unfortunately, I can't fight them on the conspiracy because it's all preempted by those other laws. So it gets shot down on the merits, right? I can't legally go and fight the TSA on the merits of conspiracy because I can't prove it because they can't be sued by just the lowly peasant. So you walk to the TSA and you say, here's this exemption and eventually you have to end up telling them, look, read the the CDC mandate, read the security directive. There's a cause that says if this person has these things, which are in line with the ADA and they show you that they must be exempted. So okay, TSA must give you a pass. Once you're past that checkpoint, there's nothing they can do, but they tried to link it together by saying you can't come through a taxpayer funded agency without getting corporate America's approval first. That's not how that works. Right. Right. So that's the conspiracy. That's the conspiracy. That's the conspiracy. To working together because no matter what the airlines write, the security directive basically just told the TSA and they created this out of thin air because they can, you know, with the Patriot Act shit that you, you know, that's what all that is. Right. Basically, the TSA says security directive. Now we can be the long-form of Joe Biden's law by executive decision. And then, oh, by the way, if they can get out of it, we can say, well, we got to look over here too because he didn't follow that, which we know we're not, he's not going to get that because they don't have to follow this law with, it's just a jumbled up mix of shit. Yeah. It's only that they don't understand perfectly. And that like to Andy's point, man, that's a dangerous thing. It's like, you know, you look at this stuff. And while it's easy to forget and overlooking, overthink, it's like there were things that were put in legislation, law, that made it possible for those things to happen for you to get harassed at a fucking grocery store, for you to get put on a terrorist watch list for, you know, flying to not one of there were things that were put in place that allowed those actions of our government to happen. And so while it's easy to like just overlook and forget about and not think about, you have to be very, very careful to Andy's point is like, what's going to be the next step? What other things are they put in and push in that they, the laws that they create and then enforce on us all the while we have no idea what's going to be next? Dude, I think people need to be real careful about what they think was actually being attempted there. You know, I think a lot of people see it at surface level and they say, oh, they're people were getting sick. So they were just trying to be extra safe. Yeah. That was not what that was about. And you guys who think that you don't understand what was actually happening there was with they were doing a psychological manipulation of society. It was a compliance test slash shining a light on the population to see who would go along and who wouldn't. And then if it people would have went along the way they wanted them to, they would have rounded up the people who didn't go along and fucking dispose of those people one way or the other. So I don't think people understand what was trying to be attempted in that whole process. And the only reason that that didn't happen and if you don't believe me dude, go ask people in Australia who had to go to fucking camps. Go go go ask people in Canada where Trudeau was building camps. They had proposals to build camps in the state of Washington in the state of New York. Here, people don't remember that. They also don't remember the exaggerated deaths. They don't remember the exaggerated cases. They don't remember the lies that were told in the manipulation that we were put through. They just they people have memory hold it because it was so horrible. We hated it. There was so much happening dude. Listen, it was so that two years was so bad that people just don't want to think about it. But the important thing here is that we have to recognize what they were attempting to do globally. This was a big part of the global initiative agenda 2030 that the world economic forum Bill Gates and all these dudes put into play to try and identify and remove any human resistance from their plans for one world global government. And that's not some shit that I'm making up bro. They write books about it. They talk about it on stage. So it's not just as simple as oh, you know, they made us wear a mask and they were mean about it. No, this was a fucking test to figure out who is who and then to figure out who they needed to remove so that they could remain in power forever. And when that fucking test didn't work, they moved on to the next phase, which was to import 20 million people into our country to dilute the population. And if you think they're done, you're wrong because of commodities and power one way or the other, they're going to bring in 60 million more. All right. So we have to have people like Michael here who is willing to stand up, do the work, say fuck you to these people. And we need we need more of that. No. And and do the reason I brought you here is because honestly, I just respect the fuck out of it because it's one of the very few people out of millions and millions and millions and millions of people who understood what was going on and disagree with it, but did nothing. And it takes people like you and it takes people like Ian Smith and these other people to stand up and say, I'm a fucking doing that. Yeah. So I think to the point too quickly, though, man, because we're all stood up like he's standing up right now. The shit wouldn't happen. 400 people is all what it took across the airspace. Yeah. And it wasn't even that. You know, but the thing is to the point that it's okay, like maybe you aren't a person who has the time or the ability, the funds to go to the prosay litigate right like, okay, cool. Go support people who are doing that. Yeah. You know, I think that's super fucking important, man. And it has to happen, man. It has happened to converse on Andy's point. It was a Gestapo bro. Yeah. I mean, do that. You have this all of this whole thing like if you step back and look at the useful idiocracy and the voluntary injection of their own authoritative complexes on their own fucking people. And I mean, when I say that, I'm talking, it took me smashing my face on a fucking galley card in the front of an airplane from fainting with a mascot for a woman who even was such a tyrant about me having my mask off while eating a sucker on an airplane because I thought I was going to get very creative. And if I had this sucker hanging out of my mouth, well, obviously that's restrictive of wearing a mask. She told me I was an American citizen, I couldn't eat a fucking sucker on an airplane. Yeah. That's too far. Yeah. And it's too far for anybody to fucking say anything about it. Like when we go on the grocery store, bro, and motherfuckers were saying, oh, where's your mask? Fuck you, dude. Yep. Anyway. And so that like, really my battle in the beginning, because like I told you, it wasn't so much of rebellion. Obviously, I've seen the two weeks of slow the spread. It seemed like a pretty big hoax. I mean, I kind of felt there was something going on there. But it's like, okay, it shouldn't disrupt me because what I do, right? Wildland fire is still going on. COVID's not going to stop that. But let me get into a little bit about the mask if I, if I may. When you look at these studies, and there's about 68 of them that show they're actually more harmful to you than they are good. And that's what people need to look at when they revert back to this issue. The N95, which was as I like to call the warlord of their little, you know, social justice, you know, trink, whatever it is. Yeah. They were the final boss. You saw somewhere. That was the N95, bro. Yeah. The N95 and then the K in 95. Yeah. And let's not even talk about Trace and funds about where the fucking mask came from. But the N95 is deemed the name because it's 95% effective in reducing particular intake that are point three microns or larger. COVID was three times smaller than that. And as a matter of fact, we're going to fucking garden hose through a chain link fence. Yeah. Farging through draws. And then when when like when like the Dixie fire and the in the these complex fires were going on in California, the wildfire smoke itself, particulate size, right? It was like roughly smaller than that point three micron number. And so then the same agency, now this is interesting. The CDC tells you to wear a mask to reduce COVID, right? Transmission. But then puts out a basically a memorandum that says, please do not wear your mask in the midst of wildland fire areas because it's harming you. It's not doing you any good. Wildland fire particulate is larger than COVID and smarter than point three. So we're in that window. So you're going to tell me that it's going to protect me from this over here. But once we're in here, it does mean no good. And actually actually harms me that went on the CDC's website. So I mean, it's just wild, bro. Bro, it's it's criminal. It is very criminal. Yeah. I mean, when you think about the the entire and by the way, it was intentional damage that has happened to society, you know, we talk about the shutdowns. We talk about people losing their businesses, people losing their restaurants. We talk about the violation of of citizen rights and human rights. Can't leave your house. The fuck out of here. We talk about the detrimental effects on people's kids. We talk about all the people who had to watch their loved ones die on zoom. I mean, they couldn't even have a fucking funeral. Like people have forgotten about all these things, it's the largest wealth transfer from the middle class to the upper class ever in history. Okay. And when we look at like the entire picture of damage here, there's no undoing it. Right? There's no like are these people going to have to give back all that money they took from all these businesses are are the businesses that got closed? Are they going to get government funding to reopen? Oh no, we're going to send $180 billion to fucking Ukraine and and fucking Israel. You know, listen, it's crimes against humanity, dude. People died. People got people missed cancer screenings. People broke and it was all intentional. It was all intentional. You know what the worst part about that whole process that like every time I even think about it, it's the piece that like pisses me off the most was the bullshit with the therapeutics. Right? So like they forced this they bring this vaccine in, right? They bring this vaccine. They lied about effective therapeutic force everybody to fucking take it threaten businesses for not making their employees take it, right? And people forget like that vaccine was under this emergency use authorization, right? And the only way that it could be like put in under this emergency use, right? Is if there was no known therapeutics to battle it, right? Well, there were. I remember Macden, I dropped the chloroquine, but when they do with the news of that, there's proof they knew of that before before before it. Yeah, right? But they had to call us fucking horses and edit videos of a fucking people saying they took it because if they if they allowed that to get out, the emergency use would no longer be fucking valid and they could not fucking continue to make the billions off the vaccine. That's the same statement they made with the mask, though, because all the mask we're all EUA as well, because none of them read the fucking box. It says on there, this will not protect you from airborne pathogens. It's on every box you buy. I mean, you got to be really, it's just so much shit, bro. Like, well, I showed what I you know what I learned, bro? I learned that a large part of the United States is very gullible and very much lacking of the ability to critically think and they're willing to listen to someone and not even think and trust immediately, which is very dangerous, dude. Like when people are in power and they're telling you something and you don't question it and you look back in history, usually eventually those people lead the other people to their death in some way shape or form. It's not good to not question, not critically think. And you know, there was so much social pressure that people just weren't willing to do it. You know, even though, like, I think if you went through COVID and you didn't comply with the rules, you're an unbreakable mentally. Especially with the vaccine, you're pressuring working on you, bro. The thing, like, there's just so much bullshit. And like, I think it's a part of it by people, bro. Like, even looking at how they were treating people in the hospitals that increased the fucking death count. Like the ventilators. DJ bro, they wouldn't allow people to have a fucking vaccine in the hospitals. You know, it's just like, we're mask. If you weren't vaccinated, they wouldn't treat you at some hospital. Bro, I had, I had, we, I mean, they called COVID babies, right? But my oldest daughter, she was born during COVID. Like, I had to have a baby in the hospital during 2020. It was fucking terrible. I promise you, I was this fucking close. You're gonna rest it. Because like, you got to stay in for shit. I would be in jail, for sure. I mean, and nothing against you, but it wouldn't work, you know, because I got work for me. No, no, it didn't work. I got lucky with the vaccine thing. Because you know, at the time I was employed by someone else and I didn't own my company then. And when I found out they were trying to target basically federal contractors, luckily, you know, Daniel Cameron from the state of Kentucky was one of the first ones to come up. But like, no, that's not happening with our contractors. But it took a while for that to, you know, kind of go away. But the Forest Service in the beginning said, if you work on our contract, you will be. And I just went straight straight in the office and told the guys, look, we need to have a conversation because there's six of us out here, all of Milan with me, they're all following me to like, disregard of we all work together. I'm the leader, but they also align ideology outside of these doors. And we've already agreed the same happened. And so you might need to find six other employees or when you talk about how you're gonna mitigate that. And luckily, they just simply said, well, don't worry about it. We're just gonna lie to them, which, you know, it was bad. They should tell them, no, we're not doing it because that's what it's going to take to shut it down. Kind of like, when you look at the vaccination cards, you know, initially, sorry, I had a friend who worked with CVS and obviously I'm not going to say who it is, but they had access to the cards. I said, hey, make, make a bunch of them. But then I realized like, wait a minute. Hold the fuck on. Yeah. I'm playing into this shit. I'm not lying about this. And I just ripped the fucking things up. But because I was like, I was thinking if I lose my job and income, but then at the end of the day, it's like, you know what? I will go and dig a fucking ditch to feed my family. If that's what it takes, and it may be a ditch they lay in. So fuck them. I'm not playing into that. Yeah. Well, hopefully. That's shit, man. Yeah. All right. Well, you guys will do some cruising. Yeah, let's do it. All right. Let's get into these guys before we get to our headlines. I gotta show this because I love this guy. I think you like him too. Mike Tyson. Oh, yeah. Well, so you know, he's training to fight Jake. And so he was doing some sparring and some training and he knocked out his fucking sparring partner. No, he did. That's what it got. It's on video. Mike Tyson throttle sparring partner with vicious shot and new clip. And then gets pissed when his trainer like I ever done for the day. Let's check this out. Mike Tyson looks fired up while training for Jake Paul and the and his latest training video posted on Twitter. The legendary boxer is seeing knocking down his sparring partner with a clean left hook to the chin as if it were 1990 all over again. That's the farm Tyson will be hoping to display when he takes on Paul in the November 15th bout. As many have questioned the 58 year old's ability to compete with a fighter 31 years his junior. Let's check this clip out. Oh, that's good for today. Yeah, I sure. Yeah, yeah, he's fucking sure. Yeah, absolutely sure. Yeah, fucking, yeah, let's do this. We're done. You sure? Yes. I'm just getting started. Bro, listen, I don't be real, dude. And I like Jake Paul a lot. Bro, and I know they probably got like some, you know, back rules like, hey, you know, we're not going to fucking try to kill each other type of thing. Bro, but I think once that ring goat that bell goes, that's they can do. Yeah, dude, like, it just works out. Listen, I fucking love Jake Paul. I think he's a fuck. He is a great dude. I fucking know for a long time. He's a great guy. No matter what you think about him on the internet, the guys are fucking good dude. I don't know, bro. Like, bro, Jake's a big guy too. He's not a fucking little bit. Dude, he's a big dude. He's a great athlete. He works hardest. Fuck. And dude, they might be saying, all right, you know, 75% type thing or Mike, you go 75. I'm going to go 100, right. But I don't know, bro. Like, I don't think someone like that's capable of dialing it down. You know, like he's the guy that said the phrase, you know, everybody's got a plan till you get punched in the face. Yeah. You punch that dude one time in the face. And he starts to, he starts getting his temperature hot. We might have a problem. Bro, yeah. His trainer was scared to call the fucking train and off. Yeah, we're good, Mike. We're good. You sure? Talking about middle toughness though. Yeah. You sure? I got fucking, I'm just getting started. Bro, let's watch this more time. Look at this last push. Bro, what's good for today? We're good for today. I'm sure. Yeah, yeah, he's fucking sure. Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, he's sure. Yeah, fucking me. That's not that we did go with the you sure? Yes. I got a lot in me. I just got started. Bro, dude, I don't know. I mean, look, man, it's, I think it's going to be awesome. I can't wait to fucking watch it. Dude, I can't wait to watch it. Oh, man. Like everybody's like, oh, it's going to be this. I don't give a fuck. I want to watch it. Yeah, for sure. Bro, I feel a who you got? I got Tyson, bro. You got Tyson. I got Tyson. Who you got? If it ain't about money, I think Tyson as well. I mean, that's, that's a warrior, bro. Bro, I think he's going to black the fuck out. I mean, Jake is a good athlete. He is a lot junior and he tried. Dude, I'm telling you, I know he trains hard. He trains every day hard as fuck. And he's determined to become the real world champ. I've also, sorry, I've also learned not to bet against Jake though. Dude, that's what I'm saying underdog. Yeah, bro, that's grown man, strength right there, bro. I think it's fucking awesome. Yeah, yeah, we'll see, man. I ain't picking. Yeah, you know, yeah, you know, yeah, listen, dude, I really, I really couldn't pick yeah, because I don't, I don't know. Like I think, I don't know. I don't know. See, I usually think this was like a lose lose for a fucker just moves like he still moves like 25 bro. That fucking left foot. Maybe they both throw the same exact knockout punch. I mean, that's really that's really primal, right? I mean, yeah. So I used to think that this was like a lose lose situation for Mike in the sense of like, you know, if he wins, like, it's just an old man picking on a little kid, but if he loses, it's like, you got your ass wet by a kid. You know what I'm saying? Like, I thought I was like a lose lose situation. Bro, I could see Mike Tyson saying fuck whatever we talked about and walking right out there trying to kill him. Bro, that's what I'm saying. And now, like I mean, dude, I see it as like the little lion cub challenging the fucking king of the jungle, bro. Like the king still got it. Yeah, I'm saying. Hey, listen, I'm gonna tell you this. I'm watching. Keep on new zero off to, you know, empower your will. I mean, this and then he talked about how he's gonna eat people's children, bro. I think he meant. Look at that. I miss Mike Tyson, dude. I miss him his whole personality. Bro, he's great. He's great. Man, gosh, you know what these guys show, though? Like for real, both Jake and Tyson and McGregor and fucking anybody that you love or hate. It's about being polarizing, bro. It's about being a fucking character. And a lot of you guys out there trying to build a personal brand. You're so fucking pussy. You won't you won't say shit, you won't do shit. And you wonder why nobody gives a fuck about you. Bro, you're trying to ride the fence. These motherfuck every fucking great character that we think of, Deon Sanders. They all had a fucking persona and attitude. And it's entertainment, dude. I'm super excited to see this. To where even if you hated them, you still watched. Bro, there's guys, listen, I tend to like those guys. I like guys with a lot of swag. Yeah. I think that shit's badass. Yeah, man. Well, guys, let us know out of the comments. So you guys are betting on let us know with that being said, let's get into our headlines. Remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for so what calm you guys can find them all linked there with that being said, headline number one. Got a viral video of the day. Yeah, mom of the comala. Okay. Did you know mom? Well, comala in Spanish means suck, suck, suck, dick, comala, or suck it. I mean, it makes me suck suck it. Come on. Oh, that's it. Is what it means. It's a Spanish translation. Yep. So mom of comala, suck, oh, El Dico. I think that's banishing for it. Yeah. All right. No, for sure. That's bandish. Yeah. Pennsylvania's. Yeah. I had a lot of boy with comolas viral again today with Anderson Cooper. Anderson Cooper drops bombs on comala Harris. You've been in the White House for four years. Why having you done any of this already? So this is a viral clip that's going around. I'm getting a lot of numbers on it. So comala Harris, she participated in a CNN town hall for undecided voters on Wednesday night. She completely bombed. Comola Harris did so bad that even CNN admitted she didn't close the deal with voters. CNN moderator Anderson Cooper pointed out to Harris that there are voters out there who say that day one for her started almost four years ago, which it did. Let's check this exchange. Some voters that might ask you've been in the White House for four years. You were vice president, not the president, but why wasn't any of that done the last four years? Well, there was a lot that was done, but there's more to do Anderson. And I'm pointing out things that need to be done that haven't been done, but need to be done. Dude, did you did you see the other clip where her voice was cracking? Do you have that? I can get it. Yeah, I would like to hear that one too. Yeah, you're talking about this clip right here. I mean, you did raise your hand saying a debate when asked a border crossing should be decriminalized, but obviously that is not your position. I never intended nor do I will I ever allow America to have a border that is not secure. I believe we need to deal with illegal immigration. There needs to be consequences, which is why part of my plan that I have outlined. And again, please go to comlaheres.com. Sorry to throw a website on you, but why not? And you will see that part of my plan includes what we need to do to actually do more as it relates to putting resources in, including increasing penalty. Dude, she's fucking terrified. She's not she don't know what I'm policy now. She's fucking terrified, dude. You hear her voice cracking and then she stands and she says, Oh, I don't know what I'm talking about. So hey, to throw this website on you, but why not? Like, like, this is a fucking game show or some sort of interview for, I don't even know what, I've never seen anything like this. Well, we know why she's terrified. We know why she's terrified. Yeah, it's because shit like this keeps coming out. This headline reached Chicago resident blasts Democrats in epic speech and supportive Trump. I'm telling you, Brandon Johnson from my heart to yours, Trump 2024. Have you seen this clip? No, coming right out of Chicago. Resident by the name of Jessica Jackson blasted Democrats at a city council meeting and they blistering takedown for their decades, long failures in the city. And this is happening all over the place, but this lady is fucking awesome. Let's check this clip out. You're going to sit into the ground. We've asked you over and over again to stop with the spending. We've told you, Kronk is to stop with the spending. They won't stop you. They'll let you not ragged in here. They let you run the city through the ground. They won't stop you. So because of that, you can't give a nice no choice. We got to go to the federal lab. We got to go to Donald J. Trump. That's right. She's made a clear. She's going to do it. See, I got to have some help. I got to have some help. I can't let you at Cook County and the city take what my mother worked for and that for her children just because you feel like it just because the Democrats are part of you think they are like they are touchables. This is America. You bring these people up in here. That's from socialist countries and all this and that and y'all think y'all going to run that here. Like America said, no, no, you're not. The truth why America is saying, no, you're not. The truth Latino, the truth Asia. I say, no, you're not. I'm telling you, brand your jobs from my heart to yours. Trump, 2020, 2020. Don't be a blue, no matter who's right. Trump, 2020, 24. He's going to stop the bleeding. He's going to deal with this sanctuary. He's going to help us get you out. You anybody out who run with you. Right. You can sit there. You're like you're like you're paying attention. Like I'm going to cry to you. Oh, yes, it does. You ain't done it for either. Still for staying with comments for anybody. You're going to be about to go. That's right. That's right. That's right. Go right. How far you're going to do too. Well, that's what we need. That's what we need. We need everybody to come together. You heard what she said. She didn't say black America. She said black America, white America, Latina. How about this? Americans? Yeah. Like when are we going to get back to that? Let's get back to that. Like we all agree. This is fucked up. We all agree that this is wrong. We all agree that times are harder than they need to be. If you don't know they're harder than they need to be, you ain't paying for your own shit. That's reality. It's wonderful to see that. Yeah, man. The truth is, we've been talking about it. The obvious, the illegal immigration shit. It's fucking terrible. A lot of her speech, that's what she was referring to. Chicago's a sanctuary city where they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars directed to these illegal migrants who have come in and completely said, fuck the actual American citizens that live in those same communities. It's crazy because today, this report comes out. This headline reads, New Report reveals massive number of illegal immigrants benefitting from Biden, Harris, Atman's quiet amnesty. What are you talking about? What happened here? Over a million of these illegal immigrants, and that's just for right now, okay? We'll be staying in the United States indefinitely in this country because their cases, through the immigration system, their cases were either closed or dismissed or the majority of them will be staying indefinitely because the DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, failed to file the necessary paperwork in court for those illegal migrants. Now they're just here. It's sickening. It's sickening the sea. And I think the craziest thing, we know where they're going to use these migrants for, right? And we've been saying it all the time. They're going to try to use them to steal the fucking election. I think that's funny because as it comes out, now they're saying, we're going to steal. This early voting worries me too though. I mean, they'll have all the numbers and know exactly what they got to do to cheat. It's kind of like we should know. There should be no early voting. There should be no mail in voting. It should be everybody in person counted by hand, paper, same day decision. There's sands to be. They're saying that basically, this is the way to win at the Democrats game, but it's just too much information and not an, you know, they'll have too much time to just make up whatever the fuck they want to make up. Yeah, right. Okay, they got, you know, 50 million votes. Yeah, we just need 51 million. You know, like, it's all the takes, you know, in these counties, what it was at seven last time and it was the margin of 40,000 people. Right. Something just low. Yeah. And by the way, Trump was leading the night before. Oh, yeah. And then in my heart, I'm fucking votes. Pipe burst and oh, we can't, you know, you guys can't be here. So and the pipe never burst. So yeah, I just thought this was funny. They put people need to get involved in and monitoring the, um, the election. Yeah. I think it's real important that you, you guys legitimately get somehow involved in making sure that this doesn't happen in your area. Yeah. I mean, should even if it's just getting some friends pulling up with some fucking long cherries, good little barbecue going some candy corn. That's right. You know what I'm saying? And just chill, just to watch the shit because like, bro, they're, they're spicy shit going on. Even though, you know, like, you got this guy saying that's going to be the, you know, Trump side's going to steal the election. Well, I, I think they're still trying to make the Trump voters overconfident. I think they're intentionally downplaying themselves. I think the media is hammering Kamala intentionally. Like when Anderson Cooper goes on there and hits her like that, I think that's intentional to make it look like she's going to lose for sure. And to get people to think, Oh, well, everybody else is going to vote for Trump. I'm cool. I can stay home. And that cannot happen. That cannot happen because there's a margin that they, they have to, that we have to beat them by that, that they can't cover. And nobody knows what that is. So that means it has to be everybody. Everybody has to go vote. Like you cannot think that someone else is going to do it for you. It's, it's, that's what happened. That's what happens. Yeah, man. You guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. I think she's fucking terrified, bro. Yeah. I think she, I think all these people are panicking. I think they are fucking terrified about what might happen to them. You know, when they're up, they're saying Trump's Hitler and they're going to put people in jail and he's prosecuting his political, look what they've already done. Look what they've already done to Donald Trump over the last year and a half with the court system. They are the people that are looking to put their political opponents in jail. And when you look at everything they've done and you consider the fact that, and it is a fact that these are communists that we are dealing with. Their number one thing that they do when they get in power is to jail and remove all resistance from society, which is what they try to do with fucking COVID, but it didn't take. And so it's going to be, it's going to be very important that people don't comply with these people that that people stick together and that we resist whatever's coming down the pipe from them because dude, there's going to be some shit coming down the pipe between now and election and then from the election to inauguration and it's going to be big. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said. Let's go crew some of these. Let's go check some of these comments out. This first comment comes from at Christopher Cranes 54 or 61. He says, Eminem went from rapping about Sabine one. What world are we living in? Well, it is what the fuck it is because it will come from and what he overcame to get where he's at really. I mean, I like the stuff that rap, yeah, I like Eminem, but it's bad moves coming into this like this. Yeah, I think it just goes into though. It's like, you know, it makes me wonder like, what the fuck has he done? Yeah, what are they going to do? They got something on the bro. Yeah, on Marshall Mathers or whatever his name. That's his name. Yeah, what do they have on you? You go to some of them, Diddy Parties, bro? Like, what are you worried about? Like, I know the guys not that fucking stupid. He can't be. Yeah, he can't be. He can't be. And he gets up there and says, where are we going to live in a world where they censor the other side? What are you talking about, bro? The last since 2008 that everybody who has not walked lockstep with the Democrats has been abused. Like, I don't think these people understand how fucking annoying it is to be someone who doesn't go along with them in society. Everywhere you go, you got to listen to some fucking soy fuck tell you all this shit about all this shit who legitimately doesn't know anything. And they just repeat talking points off of CNN. And whenever you don't agree with them, you're a racist or you're a this or you're a that. And then they go on the internet and they try to get you fucking fired or they try to get hurt your business. What are you talking about, dude? We've been living in this abusive relationship with the Democrats for fucking 15 years at least. Yeah, okay. So when you guys wonder why everybody's running the Trump and why everybody wants to change, go back and watch that video from yesterday's podcast where that old woman goes up on somebody's porch and start screaming at him because that's pretty normal in day to day life for everybody that doesn't walk lockstep with the left. These people are ego-tistical, they're arrogant, they invade on your rights, they step on your toes, they don't live and let live. And the whole reason that we are where we are is because we have an attitude of, hey, just let them be who they are, we'll be who we are, we're my own business. But those people refuse to fucking do that. They're always in your business, they're always in your face, they're always making comments on the internet. We're the only people that get our shit censored on the internet. They don't get their shit, they can say whatever to fuck they want. Okay. So let's be real about what's been going on in society. It's been highly abusive from left to the right for a long time. And unfortunately for them, people are tired of it and people are done with your shit. And it's just like, it's like an abusive relationship where, you know, one party just abuses the fuck out of the other and eventually the person that's being abused is like, you know what? Fuck you. What are you going to do now? Right? And then it takes all their power away because these people aren't the strong capable producers of society. These are weak consumers of society. They don't produce jobs, they don't produce revenue, they don't produce product, they don't create anything, they don't contribute much. And they want to take from those people to themselves and people are tired of it. It's not like people who are middle and right, don't feel like we shouldn't help other people in our society. But that's not what it is. Now it's demanded. It's demanded. We are going to take your shit. We're going to redistribute your wealth. By the way, I'm fucking tired of being called racist for being fucking white. That's just real shit. I'm fucking over it. Okay. I've been called racist for the last 15 fucking years because I don't agree with Democrats. Fuck you. Okay. My parent, my fucking grandparents weren't here when slavery was here. I'm not a fucking colonizer. I'm a fucking immigrant. My family came here to produce, they own businesses, they create jobs, they've contributed to this country. In fact, my grandfather fucking died for it. So fuck you. When you sit here and call me all these fucking names for not going along with your shit. And I'm actually really excited for them to get a little bit of a fucking taste in their own medicine to be completely honest. It used to be, hey, you know what? We shouldn't retaliate. We shouldn't this. We shouldn't that. Now I'm like, you know what? You fucking won't stop. You will not stop. So now we're going to have to do what we have to do. And that's my personal opinion, dude. Like brother has to be accountability. By the way, on that Kamala clip, she's talking about and there should be consequences and accountability. What are you going to jail yourself? You're the one that created the fucking shit store. And bro, these people that continue to blame it on Donald Trump. Bro, you're you're fucking delusional. I'm sorry. Like you're not paying attention. What's going on? You're not in the weed, so to speak, on a daily basis. So I, you know, I think these people at the top need to be held accountable, dude, we're never going to get our country back. What's going to happen for the next four years? We're going to be somewhat normal. And then four years, not they're going to pull the same shit again. Right. Like bro, this is communist revolution shit. And it has to be weeded out of our country. And they are not going to go quietly. And I'm not talking about every day citizen. I'm talking about the people at the top who are doing this tyrannical shit. They have to fucking go. However, whatever that means is what the fucking means. Yeah. Let's check this next coming out guys. This coming comes from a Eden 609. Does anyone know where to buy that hat Andy wears can't find it online. But I'd love to have one. Which one they talk about the camera one? I think that's one of the camera one. Yeah. Then that come out next week. Yeah. Don't we have a drop on the 30th? Yeah. We got a release on October 30th at 7 p.m. So if you're interested in buying any of the real American freedom gear, that's where you get that stuff. We usually sell out pretty quick. So I would be online at 7 p.m. on the 30th if you plan on getting really anything. Yeah. And you can get that at realamericafreedomgear.com. Thank you. Yeah. Guys, we appreciate you real ass fans. Thank you guys for liking and commenting. And then say, hit the fucking hate today. No, no, no hate. Is he shondain sending in? No, you got to go on Instagram find hate, bro. Our community in YouTube fucking kills the haters. But you got to go on Instagram and you find some hate on there. Yeah. That's where I find it. I love it, bro. Fuck, I'm like, I don't give a shit. Like bro, I think it's fucking hilarious. Like a magic in so mad at someone that you got to write like a paragraph. You don't even know them. You know what I'm saying? Like, just really want you to know how I feel. Bro, when I used to post on Instagram and people would leave me like these long ass comments, I would just post her teeth. I'd re-know that shit. Yep, I ain't re-knowing that. Yeah. Let's go and tell a hell on number two. So remember yesterday we talked about that Hitler video, the Commonwealth tried to fucking push, right? The Atlantic they ran with it, ran with the story, tried to do this whole background story, all this bullshit. Well, guess what? It never happened. No shit, it never happened. Never fucking happened. Patently false form is senior pits advisors refute giant Kelly's Hitler comments about Trump. Not only them. I mean, and this is Pence's guys. Mike Pence. Yeah, I know Mike pussy pits. Yeah. All right. But not only him, you got a bunch of people, ex-national security advisor, Keith Kellogg. Hold on. We should be clear that a lot of these people have gotten the fucking smoke from Trump publicly. So it's not like these people are like all these people are Trump, you know, Trump die-hards or anything like, like even Kayleigh McAnany got the fucking smoke from Trump. Mm-hmm. You know? Mercedes Schlapp. She's a senior advisor. She worked directly for John Kelly. Said it never fucking happened. She doesn't believe him. You know, and that's not the only type of bullshit. There's another story that's even even Trump hating Mark Esper and mitzies never heard Trump praise Hitler. You know why? Because he didn't do it. You're the fucking president of the United States. And you think that you're even if he fucking thought it, which he probably doesn't. Okay. But even if he thought it, you're not fucking saying it. No, no, no. Dude, these, bro, listen, when you're in the public eye, like Trump is, you think that motherfucker is not smart enough to know what to say and what not to say and when to say it. Yeah, like he doesn't, you think he doesn't know that everybody's listening all the time. You think he doesn't know that shit? Bro. That's just how it's beautiful. Yeah, let's just make some fucking offhand in comments about how Hitler was the man. Mm-hmm. You know what? It's bullshit. And then Kamala comes out and makes an emergency press cop. These people are fucking terrified. No, I'll be honest, dude. It makes me happy. Well, I mean, I mean, not only like you remember when Trump was elected or when Biden got elected and AOC put out that tweet saying, so when are we going to round up all the Trump sickle fans? Uh-huh. Remember that? Remember that? Remember that? That's a list, didn't he? I'll never fucking forget that tweet. It was the day that they announced that Biden was president and her first tweet, AOC, who should be in fucking jail, says, when are we going to round up all the Trump sick offense? So dude, that's what they want to do. They just can't do it because they don't have the guns or the manpower or the police or the fucking sheriffs or any of the people that can do this shit on their side. They don't, they can't do it. The only way they could do it was to create a fucking civil disturbance, which they are planning to create if they stay in power between the American citizens and the migrants and to bring in fucking outside forces on our soil. Yeah. But it doesn't stop them from keep trying to do the bullshit. I want to show you guys this other story that came out today. This came out from the Guardian. Donald Trump groped me in what felt like a twisted game with Jeffrey Epstein, formal model alleges. All right. So this story comes out from this lady. This is from today. Yeah. Stacey Williams is her name. She worked as a professional model in the 1990s. She said she first met Trump in 1992 at a Christmas party after being introduced to him by Epstein. Okay. Now this is Stacey Williams then. Okay. In the 1990s. Not a bad looking lady. And this is the video she pushed out in this interview. This is her now. Obviously. But let's listen to what she had to say. Check this out. Another. When Jeffrey and I would talk, he mentioned Trump frequently. He was clearly a close friend and they were spending a lot of time together. She's lying. Completely. Yeah. Late winter early spring of 1993. I was on a walk with Jeffrey from his brownstone on the upree side down Fifth Avenue. When Jeffrey looked at me and said, you know, let's go stop by and see Trump. And so we went to Trump tower and went up the elevator and moments later, Trump was greeting us and. Yeah. Now here's the interesting thing. In less than 24 hours. In the matter of hours was debunked. This entire story was fucking debunked. Guardian hippies, alleging Trump growth model rapidly debunked on social media. And how exactly did they debunk it? This guy Greg Price. The liar in this story claims that she went on a walk with Epstein in 1993 by his upper east side home when she when he took her to see Trump. The problem is is that Epstein didn't even move into that place until 1996. So if you're going to be that specific about a date and the time. It doesn't add up. It doesn't add up. Now here's something that does. I think people go ahead. I mean, look, I think people got to understand how this happens. They pay these people to do that. She worked or they blackmailed them. She worked for Obama. Yeah. She's tied directly to fucking Obama. We're two weeks before an election, bro. We're going to pull every new when you start running for fucking president. They go find every fucking girlfriend you ever fucking had. And by the way, when you become Donald Trump, all your ex-girlfriends are a little bit jealous. They're not your wife. Right. And so like they say, here's a million bucks. Say this. That's what the fuck they do for less than that, bro. I'm just saying. You know, I mean, fuck. I mean, she obviously is not a model anymore. You know what I'm saying? I mean, I'm sure the funds aren't there. No, bro. Her whole life is it. She probably talks about about her glory days. All fucking say. Glory holes. Yeah. Okay. See that. But no, but here is something that that does the stick that has not been debunked. Kamala Harris's husband. Shits come back around. All right. Kamala Harris's husband, Doug M. Huff slapped me in the face so hard I spun around. I'm disgusted by his fake perfect spouse persona. So this is a story we actually touched this just a little bit, I think in like October 2nd or something. And it's now come back around full circle jerk. So let's dive into it. Doug M. Huff's ex-girlfriend has spoken exclusively today. We mail dot com claiming that he slapped her in the face so hard she spun around at a 2012 celebrity event in France. The woman a successful New York attorney is remaining anonymous, but decided to speak out after M. Huff Kamala Harris's husband denied the claims through a spokesman. M. Huff's accuser who daily mail dot com is naming only as Jane initially declined to comment on the record, but M. Huff's denial and his alleged hypocrisy by claiming to be a feminist and media interviews finally became too much for her quote what's frightening for a woman that's been on the other end of it is watching this completely fabricated persona being portrayed. Jane said quote he's being held out to be the antithesis of who he actually is and that is utterly shocking. So again, I mean this story came around on October 2nd and then they kind of like put this you know no it didn't happen completely denied it, but she's now come out on the record still remaining anonymous to protect herself. I'm saying it absolutely did happen. The bombshell allegations which follow dailymail dot com's revelation in August that M. Huff cheated on his first wife with his daughter's nanny, Najin Naylor, received literally no coverage from politically centered left major news outlets and it's interesting because my simple question is you know when Trump had those accusations that came out, all of the me two women jumped right on me believe all women right yeah where are those women that now right all the feminist celebrities are completely silent on these accusations coming out about impolish. It's just like they're silent about men and women's sports. It's just like they're silent about men and women's locker rooms. It's just like they're silent about men dressing up as women and pretending to be women and winning their awards. What do you think about that? Well, I mean when you look at it, I like to point to that baffa mat right because that's the destruction of your civility. That's right. Is to enter into the the minds of humans this idea that they're confused about everything. They have no moral compass, fucking taggerty, fuck honor, fuck respect. You live here where you have no fucking clue who you are what you're supposed to do. So just be whoever the fuck you want. You know, cut your kid shit off and whatever plaster this other shit on them and I don't agree with any of it. I mean, you know, I have some gay friends, but even they are like we weren't for this shit. No, they're not for us. We just wanted to fucking live in harmony without criticism. And but this is beyond 90, 95% of the gay community is against this bullshit. For real. At this point in time. Oh, yeah. Anyway, it is baffamit. It is fucking satanic. It's a tanic. I mean, and you know, you look at it, the baffamitant itself with the, I mean, actually, I think Cat Williams talked about it with that guy. Yeah, what was the name? Right. And they all said he was crazy. And then the shit started coming out exactly. Oh, he nailed it. Yeah. Just what is it? Three months later, four months later, after he was on that show, yeah, with that fella. And he said the same thing is the baffamit, man, that the horns with the tits and the male, you know, lower. And that's that's their fucking God. You know, fucking weird. When you praise that, you become a little deranged. Yeah. Listen, man, I don't care what adults do. I really don't like if you're fucking 18 years old and you want to do whatever you want. I don't even think 18. I think like I actually, I mean, I don't know. I'm a slow developer. I feel like I'm you're a late bloomer. No, not physically, mentally. I am about five to 10 years behind people my age in maturity. Okay. I figured that out over the course of my life. Yeah. You know, all my friends are getting married and having kids. I've still tried to party, dude. You know, and then like it's just the shit. I don't know. I don't know what it is, but it's truth. Okay. And, um, you know, let's say you're you're you're 20 years old 22 23 25. And you want to do whatever the fuck I don't give a shit. I don't care. That's your life, man. Well, you start pushing on everybody else. You start pushing on people's kids. You start saying that it's, you know, they're they're they're making sympathetic laws to pedophilia and all this shit, bro. No, that's a problem. You're not going to you're not going to do that. We're not going to allow that. So I don't know. Yeah, two all the dads out there. That's M. Holtz daughter. I know. Hmm. That's is that a dude? Uh, that's a chick. No, I'm saying it's actually my illusion. I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. I mean, that's that that's his daughter. I think. Yeah, but was a trance. I don't know. Oh, I don't know. She said it sounds like it. Okay. Definitely looks like a date. Um, this is a clip. Everybody. All the dads out there. I would say this is the time to really show your support. What are the others? What are the others and keepers? Girl, dad, I love how much smarter she is than all the guys in the room already. I can tell that she's going to be a powerhouse. She is already at two and a half. My daughter's 22 and a half is a feminist incredibly strong and has really, uh, I just inspired me in so many ways. I love her. I'm the proud. I was the biggest dad of L over here. My vote for Kamala is an investment in my daughter's huge. All three of them dudes are like, all three of them dudes are like, fuck. You can see those ball. I was dragging him down for checking. Yeah. My daughter Eric over here. Bro, speaking of this, wait until you see who we have coming on the show next Thursday. Hmm. That's all I can say. Okay. Just wait. All right. It'd be for Friday show. I'll wait. It's going to be amazing. I'm sure you don't know. Do you know? No. Is on the calendar? It's going to be amazing. Okay. All right. I'm just saying. Give me my fucking phone back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited. Yeah. You know, whoever it is. Yeah. I still don't know how to work this thing. Yeah. I know. Well, you know, you know, what the Democrats say about black people. Yeah. Right. Work electronic devices. No. No. Did you see it? You know who that is? Oh, shit. Okay. All right. Yeah. All right. Yeah. That's that's fun. Yeah. All right. Yeah. That's going to be awesome. I'm going to get a special outfit for that one. Yeah. Me too. All right. My God. Sellers. What you guys think on this topic? Let us know down in the comments. I was that being said, let's get to our third of. Who would you rather have your kids turn out to look like? Like Mark Cuban asked this. Did you guys see that? They're like, who would you rather have your kids be like? That girl or the Trump family? Oh, man. Yeah. That's a really hard choice. Yeah. Super hard. You got a bunch of good looking people that are successful, that dress nice and they're classy and they treat people nice. And then you got this thing that you don't know what the fuck it is and who, you know, who demands your respect for no fucking reason. Right. I mean, I know the Trump family. I know Donald pretty good. Don Jr. The dude is as good of a dude as you're ever fucking me. Respectful. No ego. No bullshit. He's one of the guys. He's a funny guy. Like, I don't know. I just I don't I don't understand it. Well, I don't get it, man. Yeah. Yeah. I imagine if you fucking came home, bro. And Alan and now and and Ryan says, I'm a day them. Daddy, I'm a day them. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Where's the rest of you? Having kids is tricky now, though. Bro, like, my son was trying to bring some of that home in the middle of the state of Kentucky. And I said, absolutely not. Let me show you some shit. Yeah. So he gets it now. How was he? Well, at the time, I think he was about eight. He's almost 10 now. Yeah. So he tried to pull that shit on you. He said, no, it wasn't him. He just came home. I was like, you know, dad, what is this pronouns and this? What does this all this mean? And I said, let me tell you what it means. Yeah. And he could he could probably tell you more negative things about Joe Biden at 10 than, you know, some others at the moment. So having a conversation with him is a pretty intellectual. I mean, look, dude, I heard you talk for 40 minutes. I'm pretty sure your son's pretty smart. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So what you do, what you do for a living, it's not like you can do that being a dumbass. Yeah. So basically, I go around the country chasing black hawks, servicing them, maintaining them or, you know, doing full builds, completion builds for customers who use them in a wild land fire, black hawk helicopter, black hawk, yeah, environment or utility construction. And I don't know how this building was built. But if the air conditioners centrally located on the roof, it may have been set by helicopter too. So they do a lot of that stuff as well. And actually, I appreciate you letting me talk about that because, you know, the prime hawks motto is quality through integrity. And that's all throughout this building. You know, my full experience of being here today, I have to give my hat to you, man, and this team because you're embodying everything that, you know, even though we live separate worlds away, like we're this we're saying the same thing, you know, just like prime hawks, you know, it had it's an acronym. It's professional road of craft inspection maintenance and engineering for the hawks, right? And then we went on to create triple nine, which was the three nines prime hawks integrity standards. That's triple nine. So that's the one we're going to use to operate our own aircraft once we can acquire that and get the funding to move forward with that. But it's honor respect integrity. You know, you you live it here and these people do too. So thank you for that. Yeah, you're welcome, bro. And I appreciate that, you know, we're very blessed to have the people that we have, you know, these these people, they're all good people. They all care. They all work hard. They all of them will give you the shirt off their back. And it's every day I wake up, dude, I'm super thankful that I get to come here and be around them. Yeah, dude. You got to be because this is amazing. It makes me it makes me better. It does. Well, and that's another like, you know, me and the guys that work with me make shit better every day and put shit back. And that's literally this entire building. Yeah, you can see it all over the place. Well, thank you, brother. That means a lot. I appreciate it. All right. Well, let's let's get to our third and final headline guys. We got headline number three. This is this is just an interesting one. I thought to bring up. And I think it's important because there's definitely some weird global power shifts happening right now. So not sure if you guys were following, but we have bricks. Bricks had a conference over the last couple of days. Bricks gathers pace as shared grievances with West fuel alliance. And I think this is going to have a lot bigger impact and implications than people will think. So let's dive into this a little bit. This articles from Reuters. As US election jitters hung over this week's meeting of global finance chiefs in Washington, a smiling Vladimir Putin was in the Russian city of Kazan welcoming leaders of countries which together make up nearly half the world's population. The bricks club of emerging economies may be a long way from rivaling the international monetary fund IMF or challenging US dollar dominance. But the first summit with its new batch of members showed clear signs of its growing weight. The final communique. What is the fuck is that? What the fuck is that? Communique communique. What the fuck is that? I think it's communique. Communique. The final communique was long onwards and short on detail about creating new payment and trade mechanisms which could bypass Western dominated structures, including notably in Russia's case sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine. Now there's a lot of very interesting thing. I think something very key to pay attention here is that these bricks countries, India, China, UAE, Iran, Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, South Africa, and Ethiopia, they all had a shit ton of growth over the last couple of years. As they're moving to get off of the dollar and trading, establishing their own system in place. While routers are saying that don't be concerned, it's not a big deal. The actual IMF, the international monetary fund, they're freaking the fuck out of this. They're saying that within the next four to five years that they will be the dominant fucking powerhouse when it comes to global dominance and money. I'm saying that there are already shifting changes. China's increased. Everybody but Western countries have done better off economically than them all together. It's scary. They're saying that by 2029 China will have about a 22% stake. The US is dropping in its stake and then all the bricks countries together, there's a big chance that we're going to be fucked. Look at that, Z-Shine. India's doing it. They made India brown. They made India brown on the chart, bro. Now, so all of this is happening, right? It made me think about this clip because we talk a lot about the economic situation of Americans now, right? How overly taxed we are, how fucking terrible our taxes them is. It made me start thinking about taxes. I look at when federal tax was even input. There was something that's interest. I know something that you've been arguing for and advocating for last couple of years. Did you see this clip that came out? This is a clip from when Donald Trump visited a barber shop and they had a very interesting conversation. With a very interesting individual. The very interesting. Pay attention to what he says and see if you've ever heard that before. Let's watch this. Well, all this extra revenue we're going to be bringing into the country. So, do you believe at some point in time we could find a way once the country's back on its feet and getting enough revenue and paid off our debt? Do you think it's possible to find a way to eliminate federal taxes for the way? There is a way. How do you feel about it? You know, the old days when we were smart, when we were smart country in the 1890s and all this. This is when the country was relatively the richest it ever was. It had all tariffs. It didn't have an income tax. Yes, sir. Okay. Now, we have income taxes and we have people that are dying, they're paying tax and they don't have the money to pay the tax. No, in the old days, 1890, 1890, we had so much money they had to set up committees, blue ribbon committees, how to spend our wealth. We had no idea how to spend it with so much money. Then we went to the income tax system and the rest of the sort of history. But, no, there is a way. I mean, if we, if what I'm planning comes out, it's a great question, by the way. Everyone could have taken the money. You have to make sophisticated cash. Everyone could have taken the American dream. If it wasn't for the high cost, the burden of high taxes and we tax it every step of the way. Yeah. When we make it, when regulations and regulations. So I cut more regulations in four years than any other president by four times. Yeah, let's go. You would have asked one question. I like that guy. I'm pretty sure I could guess what podcast he listens to. I would heard him. Yeah. If that, if you, hey, listen, if that dude really listens to the show, whatever that dude is, you hit us up, dude, you come on the show. I love that question. No, it's fucking great. It's real shit. And I think Trump alluded to something very, very important there, man. Like, I mean, this income tax shit, it's not, it hasn't existed throughout the entire history of this country, man. It just hasn't. No shit, it hasn't. And it was never supposed to be a permanent fucking thing. No shit, just like it was supposed to be two weeks slow to curve. You know, but then again, going back to that full conversation, they put this shit in laws. They write the laws. They enforce it. So now we're at a point where if you don't participate, and they will fucking jail you and take here's the other thing, dude. Like, you hear these people saying, well, if you put tariffs on everything, then everything's just going to cost more. Well, okay, that might be true. If you're continuing to consume items that are coming from the countries where the tariffs are enforced against them. Okay. Now, if you eliminate income tax, everybody's got to have a fuck to more money. How much more money would you guys have if you didn't have to pay tax? Quite a bit, right? Looking at that quite a bit. Yeah. So, when we take about how much more money, now if you take the more money and then you spend it on products that are made in America, now you're talking about major economic stimulus. And so all these morons that keep saying, well, if you go to tariffs, everything's going to cost a gazillion dollars. No, actually, it's going to force people to buy American and support American and create American products and goods and jobs and services, which will reverse that graph that we just saw about from China and India. And, you know, we'll be back at the top. That's how this works. And people don't understand economic stimulus because, dude, most people have never run a business before. They never they never even thought about it. So what Trump's proposing to do, if he were to go out today and put tariffs on everything, yes, the prices would go up on goods that are coming from overseas. However, however, central American goods would not be part of that tariff. South American goods would not be part of that tariff. It would be from China and Asia. Now, it would take time for the American companies to start to manufacture at the level that we need on the make. But once they did, you would be able to you would have way more money and the goods would be way cheaper, which means that you would be fucking way more wealthy. Well, wouldn't wouldn't that also because like, you know, as a business owner, you pay the same fucking rate that that guy pays when you pay him. It's a double did. I mean, dude, people don't get that. Wouldn't that also go away if you picked that out? That's to go. Yes, because you can't, yes, which would create a situation where companies have way more money to scale and Democrats don't like that because Democrats are ignorant to how well they're not ignorant. They just want you to think that they are. But what they do is they convince the common, you know, non-educated financial, you know, observer or consumer that if we cut any taxes for the business owner, they're just going to keep all the money. Well, first of all, if you knew how bad we were taxed, you probably wouldn't have an argument with that. But the reality is, if your argument is what your argument is, which is that business owners are greedy, you're going to keep all the money, then wouldn't they take that money and reinvest it in jobs so they can make even more money? See, your argument of greed doesn't make any sense because if you're truly greedy, the capitalist system leverages greed into good for all. That's the truth. Okay. So when you give a tax break to a company and the person at the top or the officers or the C-suite guys, they want to make more money. You know what they do? They don't keep the money. They fucking reinvest the money and grow the business, which gives people jobs and allows people to make more money. Okay. And this is why the cost of goods and homes and property has outpaced the price of or the amount of income for the last 40 fucking years, 50 years. It's because their policies under the income tax system do not math. The math does not math. Okay. So no matter how much you think you know about finances, you just need to understand very simply that if we switch to that tariff system and we eliminate income tax, it's going to make you rich. You as a person. Now, now if you're making 30 grand a year, you're not going to be rich. But you would have a lot more money in your pocket than what you have now, right? And if you had that extra money, wouldn't you be able to have more opportunities for yourself to make even more money just like a business owner would like, we got to think about these things a little bit more in depth than just go attack the greedy guy who's richest fuck. Well, the rich guy wants to get richer and the way you get richer is by reinvesting in your shit. Make the pie bigger. That's right. Yeah, man. I just thought this was interesting. I also wanted to invest part of Trump's play because this bricks thing is moving pretty quickly. I don't I don't think that bricks thing is going to be a real thing if Trump gets back in. That's what I'm saying. I think it's going to walk the fuck in. He's going to say, Hey, we're literally the biggest consumers on earth. This is what we're going to do. And if you don't like it, eat a dick. Right. And so do we still as America because we are the largest consumers on the planet are extremely important to those people. Yeah. Like we are rely on us. Yeah. Why? They still rely on. Oh, yeah. And if Trump says, Hey, tariffs for all your shit and they can't send shit over here. Bro, they're all going to go that chart will inverse all those guys will go down and ours will go way up. And everybody here will get rich and everybody over there will not be as rich. Yeah. And I think that's what the fuck we want to do as Americans. Yeah. Well, the value of our dollar is going to go up tremendously. Yeah. I know, dude. But what do I know? I'm just a fucking YouTuber. I'm just a fucking mouth. More on. Yeah, man. Guys jumping. As far as this or like just the consumers of America, I mean, yeah, man, we're at peak consumerism. I mean, I seen some shit the other day with a Stanley Cup and there's like 16 attachments for this fucking water jug. That's all resources that were wasted to whatever they're posting on this little thing and hanging off of it. I mean, that is peak consumerism. So you mean like decoration? Just like give the off of it to express themselves. I mean, it's like, there's enough self expression. I know exactly. And so the cracks. You've seen all the shit that goes with the crack. I was getting ready to go into that too. I mean, it's like, oh, kind of shit hanging out the holes of these cracks. You're a crox guy. I have a pair that are like, they have fuzzies like the fuzzy in them, but just because Kentucky's fucking cold. I don't always lace up to go outside and let the dog out. So it's like, I'm gonna throw these on. Let him, you know, throw him back into the bed. I'm not publicly wearing cracks. You know, not me, but yeah, I mean, I have some lazy days, but it's a tennis shoe and sweats and kind of thing. Not cracks with shit hanging all over it for sure. You got crox? No, you burqa scock. I'm a burqy guy, bro. Yeah, hurt socks and no socks. No socks. No socks. Sometimes socks if I'm cooking. Yeah. Yeah. See, I used to always be slides guy straight up slides. That was it. That was as far as I would go. No, no fucking in between the toe thong. You guys look fuzzy too. Yeah, I do. That's why I was getting to. I see. So I've evolved a little bit. All right. And I got a pair of canes. So my buddy Mason gave me a pair of canes and these guys are all ultra endurance athletes. They run 100 mile races. He's like, bro, let me get you a pair. I'm like, I am not fucking wearing those dude. Those looks super fucking gay. Okay. Like, let's just be real. But then you put them on. I did. I did. So then one day, like you said, it was cold and it was raining. And I already taken my shoes off. And the canes were sitting there and bro, they're ugly as flunk. And I swore I would never wear a pair of crocs. So I kind of felt like, you know, I was kind of violating my swore oath to never wear crocs by wearing the canes, but dude, they're fucking amazing. They're awesome. Yeah. They're awesome. And I am definitely a believer in the canes now. They have like a good arch in them. They make me feel good. They look a little different, but it is what it is. And then I got a pair Emily got me a pair of the like the foot, like those brown ones with the no heel on the back. I don't know what they're fucking called. Yeah. I think I don't know if you have the uggs or what you got. No, they're like uggs. They got fur on the inside and they're brown. Then no heel on the back. Right. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. Yeah. Just house slippers. Are those clogs? Is that what they're called? No. I think they're just they're just slippers. They're yeah, I don't know, but they're nice too. Yeah, I'll tell you what, you guys that make those if you put, if you combined it, the fucking arch of the cane with the fuzziness of the slipper. Bro, you have a winner, man. Somebody go make that because you guys will be you guys will be killing it free idea right there free game. You definitely buy a shit. Fuck yeah. Yeah. And to the guys at canes, bro, I stay and corrected. Yeah. Right. And they're so dude. That I used to feel that way about anything that was tapered at the legs for his pants. Yeah. And then actually, I got a hold of some good quality pants that do that that tapered the ankle. I was like, damn, she's not swinging everywhere. So I'm getting kicked and trapped. Yeah. Yeah. I know the feeling of just like I'm a jeans, dude. I used to wear skinny leg jeans for sure. No, no, but like jeans from like 10 years ago were like wide leg all the way down boot cut tight. Yeah. And I was wearing, I was wearing those exclusively. And then I, I got switched over to a G jeans. And my tailor was like, bro, you got to get and he's like, you got to wear him a little thinner here. You know, those the ones you wear look stupid. And so like, you got me a couple pairs of jeans. This is from David August on California. I'm just shouting everybody out. Yeah. Um, Shabby day of August is my tailor. And um, he made me a custom couple custom pairs of jeans that were like a little bit of tapered. And I started wearing them. I'm like, man, I feel weird wearings. Now like I look pictures of like the bigger ones. And I'm like, dude, what was I doing wearing those things? Now they aren't like full blown skinny jeans. Yeah, they're not like Tyler. No, no, but they're just a little more tapered than more straight than yeah, right. Yeah, I tell you who makes the best fucking jeans, bro, there's no bullshit. Rangler. I love it. If you go to fucking, if you go to Chuck's boots, look at this, I'm just shouting how I hear. You go to Chuck's boots up here and fit in Missouri. All right, get yourself a couple pairs of Wranglers. And bro, they'll ask forever with it without the patch. I like them with the patch. Yeah, I used to wear them all the time in hospital. Yeah. The brown patch. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, bro, I, I, I, real talk. They're real jeans. And they're great. Maybe I asked. I mean, you want, you want tap-notch jeans. You get origin jeans or blue deltas. Those are the best. They're American made. They're the fucking best. See, they're going to boom the fuck out with this shit. That's what I'm saying. When this shit comes in, bro, because, okay, so an origin pair of jeans is, you know, what, 100, up or 100. Yeah, they're expensive. Yeah. But when you're not paying any taxes, they're going to feel cheap compared to the other ones. Now with that, when the fucking, ones you get from overseas, you're going to be fucking 250. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Their way ahead of the game, bro, way ahead of the game. Jocco and those guys and Kip folks. Those guys are way ahead of the fuck. Killin' it. Yeah. Killin' it, man. Well, guys, let's get to our final second of the show. We got thumbs up at DumbasFuckers. We're bringing a headline and we talk about it. It'll get one of these two options. Got a little conspiracy for everyone here. You know, we like our conspiracies around here. So our thumbs up at DumbasFuckHellOnReads. Mysterious doorway discovered in AntArtic Ice via Google Maps and conspiracy theorists have wild ideas. Have you guys seen this? You see any traction on this? Mysterious doorway discovered in AntArtic Ice. Well, does it lead to the underground facilities that Hitler left and went to at Operation Hydra? We might have to see, you know, with his alien spacecraft. Can you teleport there? Let's see, man. Bro, are you dug into the conspiracy? Oh, yeah. I mean, come on, man. There is some weird shit, but there also is. There's grown men. There's grown men who say who swear on growth that they fought a fucking war on AntArtica post-World War II. Yeah. And they were all made to be like they were crazy. Yeah. And these are ad rules and fucking e-bird. Yes. That's right. Man, listen, I don't know. I'm just saying. The theory is Hitler and his dudes left. They didn't actually kill, he didn't actually kill himself. In fact, there's a theory that his skull is actually a female skull. And that all of his men went to Argentina and then Antarctica. And then we and the ally forces went to Antarctica and fought a war against Hitler in AntArtica called Operation High Jump. That is the fucking theory. But there's people that swear on growth. This happened. And they're like real ad rules and real, dude, that's the problem. We don't know what the fuck is true. How are they? I bro? Yeah. Yeah. That's weird. So let's dive into this. Article reads, Google Maps is a place of great discovery. And the latest sighting may be one of the oddest yet. In East Antarctica, just southeast of Japanese research outposts show a station, ego-eyed users spotted a mysterious doorway, which has become the topic of wild theories online with some speculating that it's Bigfoot's vacation home or a maroon shuttle craft from Star Trek. One Reddit user who noticed the ominous structure at the coordinates listed here simply asked massive door in it in Antarctica. So let's dive into it. You go in the Antarctica, you type these those coordinates in. I did this on Google Maps myself. Type those coordinates in. And there it is. You start getting in a little bit closer. They show a station. And then you keep zooming in, you get to this. Just this weird little doorway thing. Now, of course, you leave it to the internet. People start doing what the internet does. Somebody said just a blown off Boeing door. One person suggested a reference to a shocking midair mishap last January with another joke in the asking wonder if they get door to ash there. Quarant, what would we do without the conspiracy theorist? John Semele, a professor and volcanologist at the University of Lyshisher, joked to the Daily Mail regarding the many suggestions offered. After looking at the coordinates on Google Earth, pro and seeing historical imagery, Beth and Davies, a professor of glacialogy at the University of Newcastle, told the publication that the mysterious doorway, quote, is in an area of fast sea ice, just offshore of the coast. That is littered with quote, a series of islands where shallow water exists. Quote, this is an iceberg that became grounded and is now stuck in melting out in place. Davies explained, you can see many other icebergs in the area. So they're saying that that's a fucking iceberg. It certainly does look like a fucking door. What do you think that is? That looks like natural shit. You just look like some rock in there and a snow blown off of it and it's just sitting there. Yeah. Now to the iceberg theory though, I mean, to the Operation High Jump theory. I mean, there is some weird documentation that's out there. Yeah. Like this one here that was actually written in St. Louis, Missouri in 1818. It has to be true. You know, we don't fuck around here. This is the showby state. All right. This person writes, to all the world, I declare the Earth is hollow, inhabitable within, containing a number of solid concentric spheres, one within the other. And that is, and that it is open and the polls 12 or 16 degrees, I pledge my life in support of this truth. And I'm ready to explore the hollow if the world will support and aid me in the undertaking. And that was a captain in the infantry that wrote that talking about this stuff. I mean, it's just, there's a lot there. There's all kinds of theories, dude. Have you heard of the I-shelf theory? I-shelf theory. Have you heard of that? Elaborate a little in them, maybe. So the theory is basically that the Earth, you know how like there's a lot of people that believe the Earth is flat. And then when they do the calculations on the line of sight, it doesn't suppose to be accurate. It actually adds up to the size that they tell us the Earth is. So there's this theory that our Earth as we know it is actually just an exposed part of an ice planet. Okay. So what they're saying is, is that where we know like, you know, there's Asia and Africa and Europe and America and all these, you know, Australia and all these places, it's just the top of the cone. Like, okay, if it was a basketball, it'd be like, you know, this much of the top of the basketball. That was exposed and the rest is ice and that they've kept this from us. And if you go to maps back in like the 30s and 40s, all the maps were drawn that way. So they were drawn, the NATO maps, the international maps were drawn just like that. So they would show the entire Earth in a circle and then all around it was ice. And there's never actually been someone circumnavacate Antarctica. And one of the guys who tried to ended up sailing something like 60,000 miles, some crazy amount and fuck it, it might not be 60,000. It was something like that. And still couldn't get around the Antarctica. So there's, I mean, bro, who knows? I mean, you want the answer to that question. I'm sure you're familiar with him, but this is what they say. Yeah. Randal Carlson would be the one to have here to talk about that. He would probably know. What who's that? So Randal Carlson is like, I want to say he's like a self-proclaimed mathematician and architectural guy. But he's been traveling all over the world studying, you know, basically the shape of the Earth. And his theory is that it's an oblique spheroid, which is where like, you know, you have the flat top and flat bottom. And it's kind of shaped because you'll gravitationally, if it was completely around that we've just tipped around because it's not equally weighted. It's not equally weighted, right? It's like a top. You have to have a somewhere that's different than the outer. And basically, he explained that like from the equator to the North Pole, you like went down by like 13 miles because of how flat it is. You went downhill. Randal is very good at articulating his theories. And he's actually been on Joe Rogan and several times. And I want to say Sean Ryan. I don't want to shout out podcast on your podcast. No, no, I mean, they're good dudes and they're having great, they're having great conversations about, you know, just the earth and like what we believe it to be. So I, I also watched the Terrence Howard one, which was wild. Yeah, bro, that was crazy. Smart as shit. I didn't know that I didn't have any idea that he was. He's seen very, very into easy. They're very smart. A very full of shit. Yeah, he's really smart. I don't know what he ate. But like some of it goes against what Randal has talked about. And but Randal's been able to prove a lot of it with math. And then not only that with ice core samples that they've taken showing the age of like even climate change, you know, and I don't want to go too far off. That's all fucking. What he says is like basically, yeah, there's climate change, but it's not enough to where we need to be paying taxes to reduce what we can't reduce because if you look at the chart, he puts up about the little ice age where younger dryness, it's like a plant that was in that time frame. Basically, if you go beyond that, the graph he shows with temperature swings and we're talking like 13 degrees centigrade or something like what he was talking about. But that graph swings, you know, if you look at it on an 8 by 11 sheet of paper, it's like five inches, five inches, four, three. And where we're at now is the smallest the graph has changed since they can go back in time millions of years ago. But it's, you know, big swings until here where it's just barely moving. Yeah, because we're the most stable that the earth has ever been, which we were in homeostasis. Yeah, like basically, well, something like, I guess now we have to go back the other way probably. I don't know where it's going to start going and that, but that might take another, you know, several million years. Yeah, our tax dollars ain't got fixed. None of our kids kids kids kids would ever have a kid that would know a kid that would, you know, it's just that far, you know, no, well, fuck them. Yeah, that's all I'm saying. I want my tax money. I want to go to Antarctica. No, you don't know. Oh, you're seeing a fucking cold of kids there. Like like I want somebody was here recently that that worked there. I think I know, he's so many visited here. They were here. I worked at the fucking one of the science stations out there. Yeah. Yeah. Who was that? I don't know. I don't know. They were telling me like, he was like, yeah, man, when the sun's out, we go out there with our shirt off and I'm like, how cold is it? He's like minus 30. Yeah, fuck it. Dude, what the fuck? Yeah, not for me. I know. I mean, but like I'll be prepared, you know, how well, you know how prepared I was for the Ike in Arizona. Like I'll make Trump a pair. Yeah. Yeah. No, she'll have. I just do shows up to high shows and sleeveless shirt. And he was like, he shows up with fucking walking sticks. Oh, fucking canteen. You know, one of those rags that go on your head, like you're going to cross this Sahara. We're about to climb this fucking mountain that like old women do for fun. It's like a three-degree slope. Yeah. I'll tell you what. I thought I'm kidding. I thought it was going to be I thought it was legit going to be like a nature walk. It was harder than that. Way harder than that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you get like halfway up. There's a science as Steve fell off here. Don't fall off two weeks ago. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're like, what are we doing? All right. But yeah. So this is bullshit. You don't think that's a. That's fucking. That looks like a snow drift. Yeah. It's what it looks like. Oh, some of these people like look, I'm all about like digging beneath the truth. But like some of some of these people are like they're obsessive to a point where it's like probably really bad for their health. Oh, yeah. Because, dude, you don't believe anything. Yeah. Now, I certainly don't believe a lot. And there's a lot of history I don't believe. And there's a lot of lies that have been told. But you know, there's also a lot of evidence to show that. You know, but like I could do that that that's I don't know. That's not it. Yeah. All right. That's a Star Trek door. Fuck, dude. All right, man. Well, guys, Andy Mike, that's all I got. Well, Mike, bro, I appreciate you coming on, man, sharing your story. Keep up the good fight. Guys, if you feel so inclined or if you can afford to support him, it's an important cause because he's one of the only people that's fighting for, you know, what is right? You know, a lot of people have forgotten about COVID. They've forgotten about the tyrannical nature of COVID. They've forgotten about the crimes against humanity. They've forgotten about how much harm was actually done. And so it's very important for, you know, all of us to support people like Mike doing the work that he's doing and trying to get some accountability for what's happened. So hit him with that. Go find me one more time. Hopefully, we get a couple of bucks in there. It's give singo.com forward slash Michael Ferris and last name is spelled F-A-R-I-S. All right. Well, bro, thanks so much for coming up, man. Appreciate you. I appreciate all you guys having me, man. The welcome was just over the top, bro. And like, everybody paid attention to who I was and they don't know who you are, bro. They dug deep into who I was. That's cause they know who you are. Like, bro, we didn't give, we didn't give into this at all. Like nobody here did. Like when they came to check on shit, mask a shit, we fucking wouldn't even let them in the door. We said get the fuck out of here. Yeah. So like we appreciate what you're doing. Good. Very good. I appreciate all you guys. The whole team, you included that a lot of spectrary for many years and just thanks, man. Thank you, brother. Appreciate you. All right, guys. That's the show. Don't be a hoe. I'm gonna show.
