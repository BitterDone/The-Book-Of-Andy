What is up guys? I'm Danny for Sella and this is the show for the real estate goodbye to the lies, the fitness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality. Guys today we have Q and AF and if you're wondering about my voice I caught the flu and I've been sick for the last five days straight and that's why my voice is gone. So yeah, dropped about 15 pounds went from 260 to 246. I want the flu. I didn't, I didn't know that, bro. Fucking eight. I haven't been able to, I had to, I'm not to restart 75 hard by the time this air. I'm going to start tomorrow, which is Monday. Yeah, brain starting to work a little bit better, but yeah, got my rucks in. That's good. Yeah, got my rucks in was unable to do 75 hard. Just it was just too much, bro. Well, yeah, so here we are Monday back in the saddle. Get back to it. Yeah. So what's up, man? Not much, man. I'm going to skip the whole intro because yeah, I listen, try to say some of my juice efficient. That's right. It's the word. Yeah, no, everything's good, man. I got some good ones for you. Yeah, yeah, what you do this weekend? Almost got into a fight. Yeah, yeah, I don't know if you want to, I mean, tell us. He actually said, you know, he said he used to actually work for you. Oh, really? Yeah, I think he said his name was damn bad. I didn't get the last name off of it. Big fucking guy. Really? Yeah, a big guy. Almost knocked him out. Damn. You guys from USC fighting this weekend? Yeah, pretty good. What do you think of that? He's awesome. It was a little bit of a controversial decision. What do you think, dude? I think in order to beat a champion, you have to beat the champion. I don't think the plus C is really beat him. That's what I thought too, bro. I thought Strickland should have won that fight. The first two rounds were definitely Strickland. The second two were the plus C in the last round Strickland. Yeah, that's how I saw it too. Yeah. Yeah. Man, it was unfortunate. I really like Strickland. How do you become a judge? Like, what's that process like? I'm not even. Huh? I don't know. You know, that'd be cool to do. I don't know this, but I know I'm a big fan of Sean Strickland, dude. It was a great guy. He exercises his freedom of speech. We talk about exercise the right. It's not given. You got to exercise it. That's it. That's what he does. That's what he does. That's what he does. That's what he does. He does what he does. I tell you what. It asks us to exercise in everything that he says. But the fact that he says whatever he wants to say is the important part. What's the backlash about that? When he hasn't become the most popular UFC fighter right now, I think he's the most popular guy right now. Right now, easy. The reality was just top American peanut exploding, which is nothing, just a sag correction from poor mental health. Yes. Yes. And all you did was just talk to him. I think we're gonna try it. We were just talking with it. We're gonna try to hit that That Mike Chandler Connome Gregor fighting June. Yeah, yeah, go. We got a fucking go go my challenge for right down the road here Yeah, I support home to a great fucking guy and I like Conner too. So it's like yeah, I love Guinness I'll leave you room for Mike Chandler. No question USA baby. Yeah, that's right from St. Louis. That's right. You gotta do it. That's right Sweet man. Well, it's getting to these questions guys Remember you can see these questions in the email them in asking to get Andy for selling that con guys Andy question number one Andy I'm a professional actor in the TV film industry within the last few years. It's clear that Hollywood is nothing but corrupt How could someone like me who's been in the industry almost 10 years who's put their blood sweat and tears into something Be part of a crooked community when my ideals and beliefs don't align with Hollywood's I fear that my career won't advanced if I don't see eye to eye with the decision makers of the industry any thoughts on this Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of different angles on this first of all I think I think we got to recognize that Hollywood's always been full of shit. All right This isn't just the last couple years. It's just that the last couple years. It's been it's become very obvious. So that's the first thing Second thing is You know, we live in this day and age where you don't have to be beholden to Hollywood to become influential or successful in the entertainment world You know most of the most successful entertainers on the planet are on YouTube now and these these are independent people These are people who independently create content and then get paid through sponsorship deals You know and then monetizing their platform in different ways and a lot of these guys wake make way more money than any of these Hollywood people do um Third of all, I think if you're going to recognize what's happening in the world We have to acknowledge that the momentum is swinging back towards common sense and away from very progressive woke ideology Because we're what we're seeing is every movie that comes out that's ultra woke So to speak is floundering and flopping and these actors who continue to push this are just driving their careers further and further and further down We could go back four years and look at some of the biggest actors in the world And then fast forward to today and look at the ideology that push this woke leftist shit And their careers are significantly Reduced and in a worse off place than they were four years ago and some of them are understanding it and some of them aren't But those those people if they stay on that same line They're going to continue to flounder and it's just like any other product in a free market If your products no good and the consumers rejecting it you don't continue to try to force them to buy it And so this is free market capitalism working filtering out the product is rejected by the people and demanding the product that is you know Uh Wanted by the people and if we're being honest, I mean my show this show we're doing right here is is evidence of that You know the show this show is Five times bigger than it was when I did MFCO project And it's because we come on here and speak the truth. It's very similar. We're talking about Sean Strickland right So We have to we have to understand all these concepts and basically You know, you have a number of options one you could go make your own shit and push it out your own way And become independent and you know if you're good enough you could possibly do very well I don't know how good you are you know a lot of people think they're really good at this stuff and they suck at it You know, and then they talk about how those shits, you know It's not fair and this and that well if you're if you're good you're gonna get the views if you're not good You're not gonna get the views and that's reality To you could stick it out because I do think that Hollywood's gonna have to come back to If they want to survive they're gonna have to come back to cultural American values traditional cultural American values um Otherwise people are gonna stop watching their shit and we've seen this over the last four years So, you know, that's how I feel about it. I don't I think it's not like I think you Out of options I think you just have to look at the situation accurately and try to figure out, you know, where is your best play? And um, you know, I wouldn't recommend anybody doing anything that Or staying in a situation where they don't you know align with the value system That's a sure way to make yourself miserable nobody likes that and it's not good for you either. So there's plenty of options on the table um You could stay there and things are going to get better because the culture is shifting the right way The momentum is swinging towards common sense the momentum is swinging towards traditional culture American values We see this everywhere we look and if you're not seeing it yet, it's because you're not paying attention um Or you can go on do some independent stuff That's that's what I would recommend there I love it, man. Yeah, I mean look dude It's I mean it is definitely changing me no for sure dude And you could see it in the numbers and these people who promote These The people who've been pushing this they have unlimited amounts of money right but even if you have unlimited amounts of money And you continue to push this narrative like dude if you go but you could see interviews of Larry Fink who's the CEO of BlackRock talking about how They want to change or force change behavior Right amongst the employees by pushing down certain cultural values through organizations and this includes Hollywood But even people with unlimited amounts of money are going to get tired of losing that much money And what's going to end up happening which will eventually get them to switch is that it's not about the money They're losing it's about the influence that they're losing and so Hollywood you have to look at Hollywood for what it really is Hollywood is not for entertainment It's for influence. Okay, it's not about us going to the movies or us Click it on Netflix and watching something and saying oh man. This is a great movie. I loved it That's what he used to be 20 years ago. All right, but it's not that anymore What it is now is is how can we drive a certain social social narrative for people to Adopt behavior so they make certain things look like everybody else thinks they're cool And they push it out hoping that it will curve behavior in society and it's propaganda That's what this is and so what what's going to happen is when they lose their influence They're going to go back to the thing to build credibility. What's the world economic forums? May objective right now may objective rebuild trust Because they've eroded it and they realize they don't have the influence they once had So to get the influence back They're going to have to do what communist ideology typically does which is push push push push push Step back step back push push push push step back step back And we're entering one of those step back step back phases But the problem is is their own mechanism for awareness and influence is blowing up in their face called the internet to where too many people recognize What's going on? So I don't think they're going to be able to recover the trust aspect and if you think about how most people behave You know it's it takes a very confident almost high-test Osterone alpha type person to stand alone and say I believe this Whether you all believe it or not all right and most people just can't do that most people will make decisions based around what they say they believe Based around what the other people think so it's safe because they can't actually defend themselves Physically, okay? So these people can't physically defend themselves They so that the safe decision is to agree with what everybody else thinks and the whole game of Hollywood is to make it seem like everybody thinks this So that people will go along with whatever the The initiative is So that they can curve behavior So what we really need to understand is why people say they believe things that they don't actually believe and it's because they're afraid And the reason that they actually say that they believe these things is because they think that everybody else believes them But when everybody else starts to stand up and say I don't fucking believe that which is happening right now now these people lose their Structure of influence so to speak so I think we are in for some major cultural change moving forward Which is something that I've been talking about for a very long time But you have to understand that most people aren't going to stand up on their own and say hey I disagree with the whole entire world because they're not able to and this comes down to a very basic psychology, you know like I mean and people people gonna disagree with me on this and this is fine, but like bro I'm six I'm six one two hundred and sixty fucking pounds bro. Well not today two forty six today But like I'm not too worried about getting my ass beat pretty much by anybody, you know, I'm saying like it might happen But I'm not worried about I don't walk around and fear most people walk around and fear Most people walk around incapable to stand on their own opinion because they don't have the ability to defend themselves intellectually or physically so they adopt the mentality of the herd and this is why we see this collective mindset that's been going on For the last few years where people will say one thing, you know, like we see these tweets, right these tweets to say shit like uh You know Fuck Donald Trump. He should be arrested, right? And then that the same person will write a tweet two years later and say uh People calling for the arrest of Joe Biden or insane. They're blah blah blah blah blah. Right like it's show it's just because these people are Echoing the opinion of the collective because they are weak individuals and so we have to understand the psychology of the group And how that plays into How culture flows and how it moves and we are entering a phase where it's becoming increasingly obvious To a large number of people That a lot of the shit going on in the world is not okay Okay, and as that happens and as the collective starts to wake up people become more comfortable standing on their own opinion And that's a that's a big deal and I don't think they're going to be able to recover their ability to influence the way that they have So if you're in this position You know, I think you can go a number of the ways like we discussed, but I think ultimately what we're going to see is we're going to see Entertainment and culture and everything go back to traditional American values at some way shape or form I'm not saying it's going to go back to 1950s apple pie and you know Plad tablecloths, but we're going to find a sweet spot You know where comedy's funny People accept people, you know nobody there's there's not bigotry everybody's getting along Which is what they're trying to avoid from happening because when that happens when culture finds that sweet spot of all of us getting along All of us having a sense of humor all of us working together. That's called fucking unity and if we're united They can't win so it's it's naturally happening and I can I can see it happening But traditionally, you know, I'm usually a year or two ahead of of It playing out. So we'll see what happens, but that's what I think's gonna happen. I love it, man All right guys, Andy question number two Hey, Andy my boss came up to me and asked if I wanted to train the new guy at work This is the first person I'll be training I'm a super hard worker and have a bunch of drive and passion to be the best person or diesel mechanic that I can be Do you have any tips on being a good teacher and trying to get the new job to half passion and drive just like I Well There's a lot to that question, okay? Yes You could teach someone to be a great diesel mechanic But the question that you're asking is how do you train someone to love being a diesel mechanic? And I'm not sure that you could train that the only way that you could truly train that is if someone has a little bit of an interest in that naturally And you're able to somehow tie a bigger purpose to that job to where they become more and more and more passionate, right For example like in our business, you know our main businesses are all in the nutrition space You know a lot of people like to work out a lot of people like to eat right a lot of people like to look good And they come into our ecosystem very Excited to work in that space right because they like it But when you start to make them understand how much it impacts other people's lives and the change that you can have on other people's lives That's what gets them truly passionate and truly excited. I believe that true passion doesn't come from us wanting things in a selfish way It comes from us providing things of value and creating value in other people And and being able to observe their growth and then feel good that we contributed to it and that's that's what real passion is about Right like so how do you do that with a diesel mechanic? I'm not sure man But I'm sure there's a lot of guys that work on diesel mechanics that that fucking Can figure that out that for sure, you know what I mean? So we're talking about technical training versus like personal development training And I think if you're ever going to become an amazing leader You've got to be able to train on the technical which is whatever Point of interest that you are Working inside of but you also have to be good at training someone how to how to personally develop themselves And I think a lot of managers and a lot of leaders of organizations whether it be a team of business Or whatever a church the reason they struggles because they they abandon the personal development training And just focus on the technical training and I think to be great you have to have both a great leader you have to have both so Um if I were you I would focus on Developing that person's character developing that person's discipline developing that person's ability to operate as a human being and And then work from there Can we can we push a little bit on that uh on the idea of like you know the technical training being able to develop that That's a fundamental basic right like yeah But then take him to step further and try to develop that person Personally on a professional level personal mental level right What what do you see is like the biggest hang up with that though because like what do you look for? How do you know that person? I mean is it like a little gleam in their eye that you okay? This kid's got it. I know he's going to be interested in this like how the like how does that work Because you got some guys have just come in just for the money right like I'm just here A lot of those people there. I have a saying for that okay and the saying is the world needs fried cooks too You can't have a great hamburger joint without people making great french fries You can't have a great company without people that are great at packing boxes like there's gonna be people who will do that for their entire lives And that doesn't mean that they're not valuable. It just means they're really good at that and so we have to understand that um But ultimately I think if you want to Bring someone out in a personal development way The most important thing that you have to do to even be able to see the glimmer That you're talking about is being able to live that example every day yourself right when people see You living and doing a great job and a great life Do it let's say these you're the best decent mechanic in the world right, but you're also fit You're also healthy you're also intelligent. You're also working to be the best that you can be That's going to inspire that person because that's a cultural difference and a cultural abnormality To most jobs. Yeah, you're changing the definition of what that that diesel mechanic is correct So so that comes from our example. Yeah, and that's why That's why I tell you guys so often that personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion because it's very hard to change anybody unless you change yourself first It's impossible actually So and that's where a lot of leaders fuck up. They show up. They're a hundred pounds overweight They they drink five nights a week and they can't get their people to perform or be any better and they're shocked as to why because they're paying them Well, bro, that's paint your pain for the technical you're not paying them for the character The character has to be developed through the example that you said you see what I'm saying. Absolutely there. So that it's You know, I think it's cool that that that this guy's asking this question um Because I don't think I've ever gotten a question like this around around Building diesel engines. Yeah, you know what I mean? But it's really cool that there's people out here who are who take that level of yeah They're fucking blue collar. They're they're they're working with their hands. They're building shit They're doing shit that matters and they give a fuck about the quality of human being that they are in the quality of the human being that that That is around them and that exact want For this this meant that this man is expressing for his younger people that he's got around him Is exactly what's going to change the country? This is what's going to this is what I talk about This is what I'm talking about when I say personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion be better You know set a better example because when you set a better example They become better and we have a better community these this is this is what I'm talking about. So I really really love that question um But it's going to come down to the example that you're setting through your own life And when you set a great example through your own life and you're you know doing a great job technically But you also living a great life and being a great example of an American and a human other people are going to want to join you This is proof. Yeah Yeah, man. I love it All right guys Andy our third and final question question number three Andy What point did you even think about or realized that was time to start delegating some of your responsibilities to the team? I run a very small improvement company and have a few guys working under me I am on the majority of job sites with them to ensure the work is being done to our standard And as well as doing all the behind the scenes work I struggle with leaving my team on their own Uh to work on tasks that grow the business because I've been burned in the past what advice do you have for me? Well first of all There's nothing wrong with being evolved as much as you want to be The problem is is that you have to understand that if you're going to be someone who wants to have their hands on every single Part of the business at all times you can only get so big you can't get very big at all actually um when we started in business It took us five and a half years to get our second store open and Had I not had the fear of delegation and the fear that We could find people to do the job that we needed to do We would have been much further along at this point in time because I could have done what we did the first ten years In the first five years But we were afraid I was afraid people were going to steal I was afraid that people were gonna let me down I was afraid that people weren't gonna do his good enough job and you know what happened all of that Yeah, that's what happens to yeah, yeah so So we have to understand You can choose to be the person who has their hands on every aspect of the business But you can't choose to be that person and also grow your business to a Large-scale type business in any way shape or form so delegating is a necessity if you want to grow a bigger company and You know when it comes to delegating you have to realize like go go drive up the the main road in your in your city Look at all the companies look at all the businesses. You're not the first fucking person to ever have to deal with this Every single business that we operate or that we are customers of that operates Has to deal with delegation So you don't think you can do it too You see what I'm saying? It's an irrational fear that holds a lot of people back and it keeps people broke and struggling When in reality if they understood That most people want to be on a winning team most people want to be part of something cool most people want to contribute and help Build something that's bigger than themselves What's we realize that we're free to start delegating things out and becoming the actual Personnel developer and leader Which is useful in a number of different ways it helps grow the company it helps grow the person And you know what you figure out that the better you are delegating and leading it helps people the people who work for you earn more money Become more successful in their own take care of their family in a better way It makes sense to learn how to delegate and lead because it actually benefits everybody It benefits you it benefits the company it benefits the employee it benefits their family it benefits the customer because you're able to help more customers and do more of what you do so No, it's an irrational fear that a lot of small business owners have but It's not something that you can't get over and I think a lot of times you know we tell ourselves these stories as entrepreneurs Yeah, but you know my company is just this much more complicated. No, it's fucking not No, it's not you're just telling yourself that because you're confused on how this is actually going to work You know, and um This is where getting into a program like arte syndicate or getting around people who've actually scaled companies will be of big help to you You're afraid of something that you shouldn't be afraid of and that fear is going to keep you small It's gonna keep you struggling. It's gonna keep you broke now if you want to remain a Small one or two or three person operation. You want to run a small business like that? Great. That's cool too lots of people do that But you're not going to grow into a an actual bigger company, which it sounds like you want to do without learning how to delegate Big deal. Yeah, I want to actually this so I mean because it's almost like you know It's like from when I when I'm hearing is a lot of small business owners They do their best trying to prevent all of these scenarios from happening the theft or the stealing or the You know people walking out they're trying to prevent all of these situations from happening so they just don't do anything Whereas you're saying you probably ship your brother off that that what you just said is the reason that people leave Yeah, okay, because when you're trying to handle everything in micro-manage and take everybody's job That means that their job is completely unsatisfying and unfulfilling. They're not able to contribute They're not able to build your misunderstanding the nature of most humans most humans are built to operate On a team there are very few leaders and there are a lot of people who want to contribute and an entrepreneur minded people are there's there's there's basically three different kinds of people in business There's entrepreneurs people who create Design and build and they don't need a set of directions to do so they just do it, okay? Then there's second-tier entrepreneurs, which are franchisees These are people who need a plan they need a model They need a plan to follow but they also are entrepreneurs So if you give them a plan they'll go out and execute it very well These people actually make a fuck ton of money, all right? And then there's entrepreneurs these are people who work inside these organizations Who need to embody most of the qualities of the entrepreneur But they also have to be developed into that, all right And these people want to feel wins they want to feel like they're contributing they want to feel like I did this for the brand I did this for the company I did this for this project and they want to be recognized, you know, there's a saying out here People will work for money, but they'll kill for recognition and it's because everybody has that deep desire to contribute to a team win, all right? And so a lot of people can't delegate or develop personal in their company because they're wired like the entrepreneur All right, the first guy or maybe even the second guy And they look at everybody else and they're like I don't understand why they would even want to work for me Why wouldn't they because dude most you're the abnormality and you can't recognize it Because you've lived your whole life being that How can you recognize that you're you're an anomaly to everybody else when that's who you've always been You can't recognize it because it's what you've always done. So you have to understand People in general the most amount of people they want to be a part of a team They want to contribute to the wins. They want to be recognized for their contributions They want to be paid well for their contributions But they don't want the fucking stress and the risk and the anxiety and the frustration and the pain And all the shit that the first two guys got to take home with them every single day And never escape from you know, and that's a big problem with the entrepreneur You know content Space or whatever you want to talk about everybody's out here telling everybody to start a fucking business bro These people are gonna get fucking killed Okay, that's what people don't understand you have to be built for that All right, you have to be able to tolerate that you have to be able to have this on your back 24 hours a day 365 days a year for your entire life Most people do not want that and that's why I get so pissed off of these entrepreneur dumbasses out here Telling everybody all this shit because they're they're they're telling people It's easy. It's great. It's free. It's this. It's sad. It's this. It's so awesome when in reality dude It's fucking brutal. Yeah, it's brutal and you got it you get your ass beat every day a thousand different ways and dude Most people don't want that part they want the part to contribute and you can give them that They want the part to create and you can give them that they want the part to get paid well and you can give them that And you can leave you get to keep all the rest of the shit But most people are of those of that mindset they want to contribute They want to get paid well they want to be on a winning team But they want to go home at night and have a regular life and if you're an entrepreneur of the of the first sort That's not reality man and and we could talk about balance and we could talk about You know, I live a perfectly balanced light those people are fucking lying If they're lying, I don't know a single entrepreneur Who is a tier one entrepreneur builder creator that has balance in their life of any sort They and they're successful. It's not reality dude. It's just not no And that's why I guess so upset with all these people that are just Grambling this trying to say that it's not like that. Yeah, man And it's the reason they say it's not like that it's because they never built anything real You can't buy a product from them other than their course. You can't shop at their company. They don't have Fucking hundreds of employees. They might have a little assistant over in India or something that fuck you know what I'm saying This is not real business. It's fake business Right, and they're selling the idea that this is easy and for everybody to all these people who are going out and getting fucking crushed This is why I try to tell the truth about the journey that it's so fucking hard And your only option if you really want to win in it is to build yourself into someone who can tolerate that path over the course of time So and that's the truth and I don't care what anybody says if I if I fucking said the other way like everybody else said I probably fucking have a whole bunch of more followers and a lot more success And but I also be contributing to the downfall in the personal failure of a lot of people It's not for everybody bro. It's statistically not seven to eight percent of the population is built to be entrepreneurs Less than one percent of those people are actually successful at it It's very very the small percentage not saying you can't do it But I'm saying there's plenty of fucking people if you're one of those people that want to be a part of your thing That will help you build your thing and be fucking thrilled to do it If you if you give them the opportunity to do so and the fear of delegating and and not understanding that people want to contribute to these things Is what keeps most companies from ever becoming anything? Yeah, I love that man. It's the truth man, you know and I I don't Is what it is man Even to be a successful entrepreneur bro your life's gonna be a little bit out of balance You're still gonna have to work fucking ass off the balance thing is not true for anybody trying to do anything great No, it's just not you have to fucking fake. Yeah, feel good Buzzword on the fucking internet for people to get clicks likes and shares and for overly do good or people who have already quit in their life We've already chosen the easy path to judge Morally people who have chosen the harder path. That's what it is. Oh, you know what I gave that up because I want to have balance in my life Well good, but even those people don't have fucking balance like what is balance? It's fucking bullshit, bro Yeah, your life, you see that bank account balance. Let's see that Look dude and then and then you know it's half of that we could talk about we can even wrap wrap into this Look how many people like I saw this meme the other day Said Money's not the goal freedom is the goal. Don't ever forget that yeah dumbass You're correct, but to make money you have to make money to go first before you can actually have fucking freedom And this idea that you're gonna get X amount of dollars and you're gonna be free is actually a Y anyway Because the more money you make the more responsibility you have We're tied up you are It's fucking it's all lies so that these entrepreneur fucking gurus can sell these kids on a fucking lie This shit's hard. It takes a long fucking time. It's gonna take everything you got and that's that and if you want it You you could do it But you should understand the cost of doing it before you fucking jump into it the point is There's a whole bunch of people that want to fucking be a part of your thing But you're not allowing them to be because you want to put your hands all over everything and it's hurting you It's hurting them it's hurting the customer and it's hurting your entire legacy You have to be able to trust people you have to understand there's so many great people that want to build with you and create with you and help you do your thing And as long as you treat them well and give them a great project to work on a great mission You pay them good and and get that they're gonna get up in the morning with the same vigor that you get up to win That's reality, but that you don't know that until you start to delegate Like do and by the way, here's another point of delegation um You're not the best at everything bro I walk in this building every day and there's I don't think there's anything that I'm the best at I might be the best I'm the best in this building at getting on a stage and talking to people That's what I'm the best at well you're steering the ship hold on seeing lies birds yeah my vision that's correct Outside of those two things there's everybody in this building every single mother fucker has skills that they have that they are better than me at every single person Okay, so why the fuck would I try to do their jobs? They're better than me at it. Yeah That's what the fuck you hired them to do. This is what I'm saying so like you're you're having me capping your growth by by mentally blocking yourself from delegation because you're not allowing Higher skilled individuals to contribute to your project You see what I'm saying? So like dude, it's just it's it's it's a fake and I went through it too. There's no judgment here But I I wasted five and a half years like I told you so I've learned this lesson very very expensively um If we could take five years from now and add it on you know, let's project me five years in the future from where I'm at now That's a lot of fucking money that five years cost me You see what I'm saying So it's an expensive fucking lesson and you shouldn't fucking have to repeat it just because I'm here telling you about all about it right now um But ultimately man, it's an irrational fear and you need to get over it if you want to be successful for real Well guys Andy that was three Yep, go pay to feet Can't fold doesn't know here shot case closed
