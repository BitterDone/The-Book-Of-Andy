What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about the lies and thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to mother fucking reality. Guys we have shows within the show okay if you're a first timer I like to give down the breakdown of what we're gonna do now today we have Q and a F that's where you submit the questions and we give you the answers you can submit your questions a few different ways the first way is guys you can handwrite those letters in a mellum into no you don't even know how to address a fucking envelope I know how to address an envelope all right we'll tell them what to do you said envelope I said tell them the shit email it in to ask Andy and Andy for something I come all right or you can go on the YouTube episodes of Q and A after you can drop your question the comments will pick some from there as well now the questions could be about anything but usually they're about personal development business how to win an entrepreneurship how to kick ass in life we are at the core a business success entrepreneurship show now you might be wondering then why do we have shows within the show well here's why we have CTI that stands for cruise the internet we put up on the screen what's going on in the world we talk about what's true what's not true we speculate on it and then we talk about what we need to do as people to solve these problems going on in the world so we talk about success how to kick ass and then we talk about what the problem is and then we can go kick ass and then we can solve the problems that's what we do here so we have Q and A after they we're gonna have CTI tomorrow we're gonna have real talk sometimes real talk is five to 20 minutes and me giving you some real talk and then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus is where a person comes in who has used the 75 hard program to drastically improve their lives they talk about how they were before how they are now and how you could do the same if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard is the initial phase of the live hard program which is the world's most popular mental toughness mental transformation program you get it for free at episode 208 on the audio feed only it is a free program now there is a book you can buy the call the book on mental toughness which is almost always out of stock because it's fucking awesome but it's not required but it does go through live hard program nuts to bolts top to bottom and it does have 10 extra chapters about mental toughness why it's important why you need to implement how to use it to build success in your life and that's on the website antiferselva.com now something we do different here that then most shows is we don't do ads you're gonna notice that I'm not gonna talk for 30 minutes about what the fuck you should buy that I don't even use myself all right and the reason I don't do ads is because I don't want to be told what I can and can't say we the

show all right don't be a hoe share the show all right what's up dude yeah when's the last have you ever when when's the last time you actually wrote a handwritten letter I'm out of it all me I don't even think they teach that shit in schools anymore I still do sometimes I still write handwritten cards and send them I mean people send me a lot of shit yeah and I can't get to all of it because it I do I get a lot of fan mail bro and so much so we fill up a pallet in the back for just that kind of stuff so if you sent me something it's not that I probably didn't get it it's just it's I don't have the time to get back to it but there's still there's things that people send me that are very very special that I try to sit down and write that out but you know that's about the amount of writing I do plus my hand writing is so fucking poor is it bad bro I write like a doctor yeah you can't read my shit damn like if I wrote you a card you know I wrote it because you can't read it this real talk and then it just has my signature on it I would be I just make a bunch of lines yeah and then write write my name yeah just send it to yeah I would be able to read it anyway why are you trying to make some sort of terrible joke swing in a mess yeah well we know you can't read we hear you try to talk about CTI all the time bro yeah man hey listen it is what it is but it is Monday and so let's let's start this week I'm making people better that's the only way to start the week that's what I'm saying we start to week by getting fucking better get better get beat that's right yeah let's do it hey you ready yeah I'm ready all right give me give me the juice guys Andy question number one Andy I recently read this quote from Richard Branson that says quote if someone offers you an amazing opportunity and you're not sure you can do it say yes then learn how to do it later this hit me a little differently 32 years old I look back and realize I've missed out on a lot of opportunities that could have been big how does someone realign themselves to just go I am tired of the complacency but whenever I see opportunities present themselves I always tell myself that I'm not prepared or not good enough you thought for me a lot all right well look this is the major reason why most people never get anything in life they think they gotta know everything before they go when in reality you have to go to know everything all right you got it backwards and this is for all of you you all think that there's gonna be a lesson or a course or a speaker or a school degree or something that qualifies you to go we think there's gonna be an approval process or sometime the more successful people that we know are gonna come down and they're gonna say hey DJ all right come on you know I think you're ready now yeah okay when that doesn't happen what happens is we just assume that we're not qualified so when we assume we're not qualified that paralyzes us and we don't go and it's because you misunderstand the game the only way to learn things in a real way is through experience okay and everything that I share with you guys almost all of it came from my experience now did I learn some things from some books absolutely but most of the shit that I talked to you about and the reason I can talk to you about it with such certainty is because I have done those things and I have experienced those things and so that builds the confidence in my ability to say yes to opportunities and because you guys will wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and never go you never feel like you can go which begets this cycle of learn more do nothing I'm not qualified learn more do nothing I'm not qualified learn more do nothing I'm not qualified and because that becomes the cycle where is the room for you to go do and we have to lose this fear we have to lose this reservation that someone's going to approve us or some success fairy's gonna fly down from the heavens and say you're ready that doesn't happen it never comes along you have to say I'm ready and you have to say I'm going to make this happen no matter what opportunities are not given they are taken and when you miss out on an opportunity you didn't miss out on an opportunity because you didn't take it you missed out on an opportunity because someone else took it from you okay so if you don't become the person who takes the opportunities you will always have them taken from you by people who are willing to take initiative who are willing to go and learn along the way the number one asset that a successful person has is what we're talking about here they are very comfortable going into areas where they may not be an expert understanding that we can learn what we need to learn and get it done we can make phone calls we can do the work we will make sure it gets done and that's an attitude that all successful people have successful people are the opposite of what most people are most people like I said they believe they got to know everything before they go successful people understand that they will learn along the way and so you have to realign your mindset and reach your brands in this correct it's he's 100% correct it's not even a little bit correct you have to be willing to step outside into an era you might not be an expert at take the initiative to start learning what it takes to be an expert at that and then eventually you will make enough mistakes you will do enough good things that it kind of gives you an idea of what it's going to actually take and you will become an expert over course of time you'll never become an expert you'll never become a higher owner you'll never become one of these people that kicks ass by waiting to learn more information now do you have to have a base of information sure do you have to have a basic idea sure do you have to know a little bit sure but it's way less than what you think it is to go out and become an expert every person it's ever been great at what they do I'm sitting in front of a bunch of creative people here on the team Madat Keith like did you become an awesome videographer but because you took so many courses or did you just go make shit and you figured out along the way when you make your art did you just did you go to 15,000 courses to make your art or did you start fucking around and figuring it to fuck out fucking around figure that's right and that's every musician that's every athlete that's every successful business person that's anybody that you've ever admired that it's done anything they figured it the fuck out and they were not afraid to go down that path so my thoughts on this are what I'm saying you need to understand that it is not accumulate information then go it is have a little bit information go and learn the rest through that experience yeah you know I think you know I was listening to your answer on this man it like there's a lot of this just would you put most of this on people's fear of just failing or afraid to make those mistakes that are necessary right like when you look at yourself you think back now 25 years in what's more important to you is it the wins or is it the losses or is it the mistakes like what what's actually more valuable now looking back the losses and mistakes are infinitely more valuable than the wins infinitely more valuable and because people are willing willing and I think you're right okay by the way the losses are infinitely more valuable than the wins all right because the losses provide perspective and lessons about how to avoid those losses in the future and if you are smart enough to take the lessons from the losses and the hardships that come along with going down the path and apply them moving forward you become more equipped and better at moving forward okay so you're you're starting out to be an entrepreneur and you hire someone and this person ends up doing all kinds of terrible shit and then you figure out why they did that and you figure out what to recognize and you figure out what to look for to avoid that in the future the next time someone comes and they do start behaving this way you can fucking see it way ahead of time and you could start to address it and that's in every single area of business or life so staying there and thinking that you know I'm gonna fucking figure it out before I go that's that's ridiculous to think I think that most people and I think your question the answer is twofold I think yes most people are afraid to fall in their face which is ironic because they're afraid to fall in their face in front of people that won't even matter fucking five years from now which if you're gonna sacrifice your entire success your entire life story everything great all the potential you have because of people that won't matter in five years that is the most ridiculous shit ever if you actually think about it and say it out loud you are sacrificing your entire life everything you want for the opinion of people that won't even be in your fucking life five years from now that is the definition of dumb mother fucker okay and the second part is this I think people misunderstand the game I think people think you have to be qualified and all the great shit in the world was built by unqualified people so I think that's the two things that keys people from going I love it man I love it guys Andy question number two Andy with all the things that you do on a daily basis the companies the shows you record how do you process and handle stress is stress real or is it more like your definition of anxiety that signals you know the signals that you're not doing something you know you need to be doing where stress is a signal that you just maybe doing something inefficiently what's your what should take on stress is it real how do you handle it stress is absolutely real I mean look there are physical manifestations of too much stress too much stress can can harm your body too much stress can make you go crazy but here's what I'll say the amount of stress that you mother fuckers think is that much stress is not that much stress okay most people feel a little stress and they're like fuck I'm so stressed out I need a drink right bro the reason you're so stressed out is because you've not been able to fucking do any of the shit you want to do you lack the ability to adhere to anything which can be fixed with the live hard program by the way which is free so you're pissed off you're disappointed in yourself things aren't going the right way you're not able to get any traction you have to pay bills you have to eat you have to survive you have obligations and you're not able to get unstuck from the mud guess what you're going to feel stress so a lot of the stress can be overcome by just building yourself into an effective person that can do what it is they say they're going to do they can adhere to the process and the path moving forward which is accomplished by creating a better you a stronger you a more resilient you which is exactly why I designed the 75 hard to live hard program which you can give for free it up with so 208 okay it's fucking free now it doesn't cost money but it ain't actually free it takes a lot of your time it takes a lot of your effort but when you fix that problem of adherence and you can actually go do the things that you want to do that reduces stress because you're not worried about being stuck in the mud anymore all right so that's a real thing but here's the other to accomplish great shit you have to become someone who can operate under pressure and operate under stress and bro you might feel stressed right now but I can promise you in most cases you are not even close to the threshold of what would physically affect you in that way okay so stress is like a cold plunge you're a cold swimming pool all right when you first experience your stress and entrepreneurship business whatever it is you're working on it's it's fucking shocking you're like fuck yeah okay but if you keep moving what happens is you start to acclimate and you can acclimate to that pressure you acclimate to that stress and this is a tremendously huge competitive advantage over most people because most people they get right into that shit and then they get the fuck out and they're done okay but we don't try that that was good exactly so if you get into the pool and you stay in the pool after 10 minutes the pool doesn't feel cold anymore so now you're you're acclimated to the stress and you're able to perform in situations that other people cannot performing and if you are able to get better if you are able to improve if you're able to execute in situations of high stress when conditions are shit how the fuck can anybody stop you if it stops everybody else and it doesn't stop you what can stop you you see what I'm saying yeah so you have to understand one you're you're probably not even close to the threshold two you should build yourself into someone who can acclimate and operate during hard times three remember that if you learn to acclimate and you learn to operate under stressful conditions it makes you far more valuable because most people cannot now can that go to an extreme where it bucks you up absolutely but I promise you guys I know this from experience you are likely a million miles away from that we we have a victim culture in society we have a soft culture in society any bit of uncomfort you know people got to take a mental health day they got to relax they got to fucking take a break and bro those people will lose their entire lives they will not they will not be able to push through because they don't have grit they don't have resilience they are not tough people and bro building shit is a competition winning in life is a competition mother fucker there is only limited spots like I know other people say there isn't but there is okay so to get one of those spots you have to become someone who can operate in conditions that other people can't and that comes from you know just pushing through when things get uncomfortable yeah I think the interesting thing here is that like I feel like a lot of people will look at somebody you know like yourself we're just successful people in general like man they don't have any stress right and so what you're saying is not that they don't have stress is just they've acclimated to that and so they've made that stress appear easy or appear easy to do that's what it is I think one time I heard you like kind of described this in like like weightlifting terms right you know like you know you go to the gym and like you know you're gonna pick up 50 pound fucking dumbbell that's heavy and then you see this guy walk up he picks it up no problem it's still 50 fucking pounds right he's just been working that he's acclimated he's built up the strength I think that's all I think a lot of people have a problem understanding that it's not that it's easier for for for these people they just acclimated yeah and the bigger you get the more successful you get the harder it is and the more you have to acclimate bro I'm gonna tell you this I'm not saying this to be a dick I'm not saying this to be rude I'm not saying this to say I'm better than anybody because I'm not what I am saying is I've been living my life for a long fucking time and I'm very confident that if 99.9% of the people went through a single fucking day of what I have to go through to do what I do they would fucking crumble okay and I would have crumbled do like if I would have started on day one yeah doing what I do now I wouldn't have been able to do it you go pick up 19 year old Andy today he fucking very quick he would have there's no way he could do it a break him in one day you see what I'm saying yeah yeah now I'm responsible for fucking thousands of people bro you know what kind of stress comes with that if you're an actual decent human if you're an actual decent human being and you care about the people that work for you do you understand that I have to walk around every mother fucking day with every one of these fucking people's families and their kids on my mother fucking back you see what I'm saying yeah that's a different kind of response stress because McDonald's gonna have your order right that's right it's a different thing and you get acclimated to me guys Andy question number three take it uh Andy and how do I set the court on quote unspoken norms I keep hearing business owners like yourself speak of I expect everyone to take initiative be detail oriented before thinkers amongst other things I sometimes find myself being scared to impose my opinions uh in fear that I'm not sharing it in a way that is receptive to others having worked for it to tyrannical boss before I'm scared that in imposing my opinions I create a stressful environment that actually hinders my teams output so how do you create those those unspoken norms I guess in your business culture I don't understand what unspoken norms means I guess yeah like you're you're staying as things that are not necessarily those are those are not norms that's why they're abnormal that's why when you walk in here that's why you hear everybody that comes in here and they're like holy fuck because it's not normal it's not an unspoken norm it's an intentional creation of a culture okay and how do you create it you create it firstly by living it all right where a lot of people fuck up as they expect all these high standards from everybody else but they expect that they can cut corners and they can pass over and they can look the other way and then nobody else sees it there's only one way to fucking lead Vince bombard he said it fucking a hundred years ago 50 years ago whatever fuck it was probably seven years ago all right he fucking said the best way leading by example is not the best way to lead it's the only way to lead so if you want to build a abnormal high standard culture okay you have to start there and it has to be on mother fucking point it cannot be 90% it can't be 97% it has to be 100% and then when you miss on that 1% you got to go in front of all of them be like guys I fucking fuck that up I'm sorry this is what it is okay because you got to hold them responsible and they got to learn to admit their mistakes so whatever you do they will do all right so if you're a business owner if you're a leader of an organization if you're a member of a team of any sort and you think that you can hold other people to a standard that you're not living you are in for a brutal awakening because it will never happen for you and here's the thing a lot of you guys struggle with holding people accountable like you're saying this right now and if I had to bet I would bet just about anything that the reason you have a hard time holding people accountable is not because you had a tyrannical boss it's because you had a fucking tyrannical boss that didn't live the standard and then when the guy came up to you and said you know do this do that do this you were like fuck this guy didn't do any of that shit and I bet that you know that you're not living the standard the reason that I have no problem and the reason that my people respect me and the reason I don't have to raise my voice and yell and scream which I used to have to do when I wasn't living the standard the reason I can walk up and I could say hey I need you to do this or hey I need to do that and everybody's like all right cool I got it and there's a good culture is because they know that I fucking live what I preach they fucking see it they see it everything I fucking do okay so if I would bet that the reason that you have a problem with this is because you know that you're not living that standard and you don't want to be that dickhead that used to work for secondly you have to understand and this is another issue when it comes to new leadership your people want to be led there is nothing worse than being on a team or in an organization without clear leadership or clear direction it confuses people it demoralizes people it removes their purpose they don't feel like they're actually getting anywhere they feel like the company stuck in the mud and it fucks the morale and culture all right so you have to come to terms with this you need to become the leader and you cannot reserve yourself of saying hey this is what I think or this is what I think or this is what needs to be done because you feel like you're trying to be better than them that's what used to hold me back when I was a young entrepreneur I had a hard time telling people what we needed to do because I felt like it was like I don't know like dickheadish yes like man I'm not there fucking boss yeah I don't like be wait a minute yeah I don't look I don't like looking at it as boss like I don't I don't I don't I don't think like I don't think I look at it as a boss I look at my team and our teams and our companies as I'm a part of the team and I think this will help your perspective with this if you stop looking at it like you're the boss and you start looking at it like you're just part of the team and this is my responsibility on the team my responsibility on the team is to live the standard it's to hear feedback and ideas it's to empower people and then it's to make the best decision possible okay your your ability to do that will change because no longer are you seeing hey I'm the boss of this other human being that's an uncomfortable position for someone who's got morals and respect for other people now there are fucking people out here who love that shit and if you have a boss like that you should probably go find one that actually sees it the way I'm talking about but true leaders look at themselves as they're playing a role on the team I'm playing a role my roles do these things and if I don't do these things these guys can't do their thing and if you look at it like that it gets a lot easier to say hey we need this done or we need that done or we need this done but again if you're not living the standard that's not going to work so it starts with the standard and then it starts with you getting comfortable and readjusting your perspective from I'm the boss to I'm a member of the team and my responsibilities as a member of the team are to develop my people to empower them to communicate with them clearly to give them direction to listen to their opinions and then make the right decision for all of the team involved and then what happens is when you start operating like that and the team knows that you're operating within their best interests they start to respect that because they have they feel value they understand their contributing and they understand that you're not going to make the best decisions for you you're going to make the best decisions for everybody and and that's where the great culture comes so it's not that's it's not like when you say abnormal on spoken norms now bro it's totally abnormal like completely normal about this way nothing it's not unspoken norms it's intentional creation that is abnormal because most people don't look at it like I just described it to you for the last five minutes I love it question number four Andy I'm 19 years old my question is simple when you are setting a new goal for yourself what are some things you go through to better ensure that goal is successful so like a checklist that you have look there I believe that the entire goal setting process of achievement is total bullshit all right okay like these people and they cite these studies from like the 60s and the 50s to say oh it takes 21 days to make a habit first of all that's bullshit all right it takes way longer than that that's why when you go to the military they train you for fucking 80 days or 100 days right like it takes longer to build new habits than 21 days it just does so the first step that I would do is worry about building you into the kind of person that can execute day in and day out regardless of what's going on in your life that's why live heart and 75 heart is such a great program because most people's problem fact 99% of people's problem isn't that they don't know what to do to get to the goal it's that they cannot fucking do it when they're not motivated so they lack the discipline and they lack the grit they lack the fortitude to execute when conditions aren't perfect when they don't feel right when things aren't going their way they can't execute and most people during that time stop or they quit or they pause and this is a game of longevity if you took out if you took from where you're 20 to 80 and you said how many days did I win okay versus someone who quits every time that it gets hard you're going to win exponentially more days than they won which means you're going to be far more successful this is legitimately a game of math how many touchdowns did I score did you score 21 points well they scored 100 points which means you fucking lost all right so the first thing I would do is understand what the fuck we're talking about here we are we are talking about a goal that is going to take some time it might take a year it might take three years it might take 10 years most likely it's a lifelong project that goal to be happened as quick as possible means that you have to execute every single day possible to shrink the timeframe of where you are now to where you want to be if you take you and you do that you'll achieve the goals in a much shorter time and I'll get to what that means in a second but if you take that versus someone else someone who is not resilient who doesn't have grit who quits when things get harder takes mental health days or stops are fucking makes excuses that person will never ever ever ever ever ever hit their goal they won't do it because if you stretched out like I said over the course of 60 years from 20 to 80 that person's only executing 5% of the time where the person who executes when they don't feel like it which by the way is the majority most people don't wake up every day feel like fuck I love hard shit but you can learn to love it because you love the outcome that it produces so you need to become the person that can execute no matter what the fuck is going on no matter what's going on in your life no matter how you feel and build yourself into that person before you even go for the fucking goal make that your first goal okay now to achieve the goal to raise the percentage of chance that you're going to achieve the goal which you can raise to 100% if you do what I just said if you can win day after day after day after day you can achieve your goal it's very simple because if you win six days out of the week and then you win six days out of the next week and then you win five days out of the next week and then you win seven days out of the fourth week did you win your month yes you won the month most people didn't if you do that every single month for 12 months straight did you win the year did you execute on more days than you didn't yes exponentially more days that means you won the year now if you win five years in a row where the fuck you think you're going to be you're going to be in a great spot the question becomes what is the goal and what are the steps to get there which I explain in detail in depth on the win the day episode which is episode 16 but I'll give you a goal listen to it it's on the audio feeds episode 16 fucking stop this goal listen to that what you need to do is you need to decide where the fuck you're going which is a whole another issue most people cannot make a decision about what they're trying to do they think that life is just going to like oh we'll see what comes my way when in reality you have to go out and create it so just make a decision what do you want to be bro and don't make your decision based upon what other people tell you or what school tells you or what your parents tell you what the fuck do you want to be what do you want to be what do you what your life look like what kind of house you want to live in what kind of car you want to drive what kind of friends you want to have what kind of respect you want to have in the community what do you want your life to be like take some time think that through and pick it and then say what's it going to take to get there and work backwards from that vision that you create into actionable steps on a daily basis and when you take a goal that's maybe 10 years away you're going to break that down into what you can guess are the best actions possible for today which we call critical tasks this is not a to-do list this is not do my laundry this is not brush my teeth this is a call an email a conversation and an action point that moves you one centimeter closer to that big outcome that you are imagining okay and you start that today so go listen to episode 16 it'll explain the whole process of how you do it it's probably the most powerful production system ever created because if you do it and you do it right you can't lose it's impossible you're 100 percent it's the only way that I think you could 100 percent guarantee the outcome and that's the power list system so you have to kind of ignore what society tells you about goal set a goal and 21 days you'll have new habits and then you just continue those new habits and the goal material that's flawed thinking because those habits that you create if you just continue doing them they're not going to get you where you want to go you have to take productive action critical task action that are specifically geared towards that goal right like if I want to come an astrophysicist I've got to get myself enrolled in astrophysicist classes I've got to read those books if you just did those habits for 21 days it kept going yeah you probably become some sort of knowledgeable person on astrophysics but you're not going to become an astrophysicist because there's other steps that have to be created you've got to enroll in school you've got to fucking meet people you got a network you got to go to this seminar you got to learn this shit you got to go and that's that's a fluid process yeah so like I talked about earlier in the show you have to go and then figure out the tasks as you go that are going to move you forward it's not know all the tasks and then go so this goes back to I think we did my first question yeah so go back and listen to that first question understand go listen to episode 16 it'll give you a very clear understanding of breaking down the goal process and to raise your success probability as much as I know how to do which I think it's 100% if you execute and then go do 75 hard and live hard live that lifestyle because that lifestyle will build you into a fucking weapon that can execute when other people can't and if you can execute when other people can't you will gradually over time create space between you and them and you're moving towards where you want to go you'll eventually be there and they never will so that would be my advice to you let me actually this what what do you think is more dangerous not having a goal or that envision set at all or having a goal or vision that is set but it's too small what's more damaging to somebody's like not having one at all because even if it's a little one this there is some truth here okay even with a little one if you do accomplishment you're you're at least building a little bit of belief that you can accomplish things if you live a passive life where you say fuck I don't have any goals and shit just comes to me you're guaranteed a terrible outcome guaranteed yeah it's guaranteed terrible outcome but my point is is that goal that little goal process is not good advice because little goals beget little actions and little actions create a little life and so when we talk about what your goal should be what I'm talking about is what is your ideal outcome where are you trying to get and let's work towards that and then you know we we don't build the confidence by achieving the little goals we build the confidence by going through a program like live hard 75 hard which teaches you how to adhere and once you know how to adhere and you can execute on a daily basis day in and day out and day in and day out and you have these days that are test days where it's hard as fuck but you still win your confidence goes up your self esteem goes up your belief goes up and all the while you're not achieving little goals because you're not achieving little you're not taking little actions you're actually working towards big goals because you're taking big actions so that's my gripe with that advice I think it's terrible advice and um you know that's it I love it yeah I love it with guys Andy that was four all right guys hey listen make sure you're tagging me in your wins I want to see your wins all right that's the only way I get to see those things and I want you to do that so I love you guys I appreciate you guys and let's go kick ass
