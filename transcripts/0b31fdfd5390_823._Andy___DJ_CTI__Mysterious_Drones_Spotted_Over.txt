Yeah, I'm really not paying attention to what's going on So it could be a Yeah, let's just do it. Yeah, we have to be interesting guys. Don't forget we got a fee We do have a fee. Fee is very simple share the show. All right. We don't run ads on the show We don't waste 30 minutes of the show talking about shit that we don't even use for money Maybe we should But since we know we ask very simply that you help us grow the show We're constantly dealing with censorship throttling traffic bands all the bullshit that they said they don't do they do it And we need your help to So the show brings you some value of Misha laugh makes you think it gives you a new perspective you learn some shit Do it's a favor and don't be a hoe sure the show All right, man, well, let's get into let's knock this out You know, I think coming off the break a A dumbass of the day would be appropriate. Okay, um, and this would just great I mean, it has all of your favorite stuff. It has white savior syndrome. Okay, it has virtue signaling. All right It has all of that in one, man. Okay, this is fucking great. All right, we gotta go to CNN um So the CNN investigative journalist decided um, she was gonna be a heroine and uh, oh hell we is a heroine You know what I'm saying like a foot female hero hero She's uh Heroine what's equal now, so she's just a hero hero yeah And uh, she thought she was gonna be this hero and save the day and uh, everything's not as it seems so man filmed By CNN being rescued from side jail Was the fucking torture What This lady breaks into a fucking Syrian jail and rescues this guy as she thought was like a fucking you know left behind dude and he's a do-cutting thing or something All right, let's see it and there's a video of it. It's great, bro. It's great So see it in is investigating the identity of a man the network showed being rescued from a Syrian jail As he may have given a false identity The investigation was lot uh, launched amid claims he was a member of bishar al-assad's forces The man found under blanket in a prison in Damascus by Clarissa Ward Uh, the broadcaster's chief international correspondent claim arrested three months ago and interrogated about his phone contracts uh phone contacts So the footage was described as remarkable by CNN's head of communications at the time praising Ward and her team For finding a Syrian prisoner left behind in a secret prison alone and unaware of the Assad regime was no more. Let's check this clip out I can't tell though it might just be a blanket But it's the only cell that's locked Is he gonna shoot it? The guard makes us turn the camera off while he shoots the lock off the cell door We go in to get a closer look It's still not clear if there is something under the blanket Hello I'm a civilian he says I'm a civilian He tells the fighter he's from the city of Homs that has been in the cell for three months Oh, we're gonna save you You're gonna save you from all your oppression Oh fucking chop and digs up No way bro, how do they know that's that's torture? Well, it's funny you uh, you bring that up It's because it's the name that he gave him was a Dale Gerba, but verify side it's a Syrian fact checking organization They later claimed that his real name was Salama Muhammad Salama And that he was a first lieutenant in Syrian Air Force intelligence he managed several security checkpoints and Homs and was involved in theft extortion and court Horracing residents into becoming regime informants it claimed uh, verify side also alleged that the man had killed civilians detained or tortured numerous young men on fabricated charges And taking part in military operations in 2014 when the sides forces seized Homs from Syrian rebels following a three-year siege So see in a release the statement on this they said uh quote we have subsequently been investigating his background And we are aware that he may have given a false identity. We are continuing our reporting into this and the wider story Good job For these people are in such a hurry to like make a fucking story. It's like Sports announcers They never listen to sports announcers like try to like Make the ultimate call on every play like you know, they hand the ball off to some dude in the backfield He's like oh he's gonna go braggd He's ramed yeah, it's like It's that's what these people try to do they try to sensationalize everything So that they can have something to talk about yeah, and she's think she's doing some sort of social justice. Bro. Yeah, I need to sit You know most dangerous fucking criminal right not to jail Well, dude, it's great man. It's great. But uh, yeah, I thought that was interesting man But let's get it to our headlines like some we got a lot of catching up to do yeah a lot of stuff to dive into We remember guys if you want to see Anything that we're talking about on the show we link all of this stuff the pictures the videos The headlines articles we link all of this stuff on any for seller. I can't for you guys to follow through and check out on your own So that being said, let's get into our first headline That number one This is uh, this is interesting. Um, this has happened up in New Jersey Um, a very interesting state of all places. I'm sorry. I'm just probably gonna piss a lot of people off. I went to big fan of New Jersey Wasn't not me either. I mean like the gun line. I like I like the people from New Jersey people are cool Yeah, but the state yeah, I agree You know, I could feel a little historic going up there, you know, I'm saying but like but not like Boston But not like Boston. I know it was like a different like history, you know, I'm saying But uh, gotta go to the Jersey of the man. Let's check it out. We got drones mysterious drones Spotted over in New Jersey's Bergen County. They're just pacing back and forth Um, so this has been a story that's that's been going on for a few days now Um, with a lot of very interesting updates and developments um, but this originally broke uh, this is article from New York post on December 9th Saying more mysterious drones were spotted pacing back and forth above New Jersey new video shows As government officials assured garden state residents that there's nothing to fear Uh, this footage was captured by a new Jersey mom and shared on Twitter shows blinking light It's buzzing over Bergen County on Sunday night quote. They're just pacing back and forth going very slow the mom said in the clip Let's check the slip out There's one The plane went off in the distance One where's the other guys okay Here's the other one right over the library Oh Now it's it's interesting. I mean they got marker lights like an airplane. Yeah. Well, I mean here's the thing though These aren't like you know, keeps drone that he flew up into the fucking power line, you know, little small ones It was for being reported that these things like the size of fucking cars That's one who's reporting that though the people Yeah, there's a bunch of like like first-hand accounts on this. I got a couple of clips here um, but I mean these things are like massive drones massive drones Um, you got Homeland Security FBI. They're deploying detection detection tech to probe mysterious drone sightings over New York and New Jersey um Saying that they finally have stepped up their efforts to investigate the rash of mysterious drone sightings um You know and like the weird thing is like they're not really saying much on the situation at all And we're not saying like I mean this is not like 10 drone reports like bro, there's thousands over the last couple of days Yeah thousands Of all individual accounts um, and uh, so let's go to the Pentagon. Let's see what they had to say. This is uh press secretary for the Pentagon Check out this So, Brynn can you tell me what the Pentagon is doing to address this issue of drone sightings over New Jersey? It's near sensitive um Installations the FBI is involved. What is the Pentagon doing? Sure, um, so at this time so aware of those drone sightings that have been reported At this time we have no evidence that these activities are coming from a foreign entity or the work of an adversary We're going to continue to monitor what is happening, but um You know at no point where our installations threatened when this activity was occurring Can you rule out that these are American drones or um, as military drones These are not US military drones um Again, this is being investigated by a lot local law enforcement what our initial assessment here is that These are not um Drones or activities coming from a foreign entity or adversary um representative Jeff Andrew Who is a Republican from New Jersey was just on the air saying that Iran launched a mothership probably about a month ago That contains these drones and that that mother mothership is off the coast of the east coast of the United States Is there any truth to that? There is not any truth to that There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States and there's no So-called mothership launching drones towards the United States The fuck she talked about mother shit. There's weird Like are you talking about like fucking like like like independent state like staunch right Yeah, like there's a there's a floating drone and then all the other drones come out Like what poop some out. Yeah What it bro is weird listen is weird shit all right now Initially all of this stuff was kept on the east coast right in the Jersey, New York What are they trying to distract people from that's the thing man like there's something this is a bullshit story It's something there. Yeah, it is something weird All right now both like most of us been on the east coast right until uh today until last night actually Um where uh is being reported now that right Patterson Air Force Base, which is in Ohio they had to shut down their operation because of drones showing up there Again these same like massive car sized fucking drone and then just let them do it. Well, we got to shoot them down. Let's check out the audio here Patterson tower med flight 1900 feet about seven miles southwest of the field like transition or delta northeast bound med flight at better send tower use extreme caution for heavy ua Movement on the base security forces is handling the situation suggest that or above 1700 ageo Is that what you will maintain 2000 on our transition for med flight And I gotta keep the lights down so that security forces can see Roger that no problem So they shut down the whole fucking base Right the airfield air operation. I mean it's just weird then like this other like bro This stuff happened and all over and I think I know what it is Potentially But I mean even stuff like this this is now coming out of Georgia At the time of the recording now this happened last night This dude sit in the parking lot you remember that movie the Obama's made yeah Right where it shows like all the Tesla's driving autonomously and like crashing into each other right Well, this is in Georgia. This was last night Check this clip out Okay, but yet I had to like pull over and like Pull this back up because I thought maybe it's a car party right there's a bunch of like those weird looking Tesla Vehicles over there and I thought maybe it's like a car club. They're just all mean up And it's a Thursday night I just want to show you but there's There's no one over there. There's not a body. There's not a person like it was a car Club those are pretty common around Atlanta Look at this. I'm gonna zoom in just so The video that I heard was it was like this girl who was saying like have you seen any of like the Lights flickering or anything like that and then there was a guy in Jersey who's like yeah my apartment car I mean my my like house lights. I'm sorry My house lights have been going off and like flickering and she made a video of like lights just like this Do the same thing in a parking lot Bunch of Tesla's in a parking lot has the lights on nobody's over there. I mean just weird shit now Trump waited on all of this Um, which I thought was a little interesting. Let's see what he had to say quickly Good to see you. Can you comment on the drones that are flying around? New Jersey ports and it seems like there could be people have a big distance. The government the government knows what is happening um Look Our military knows where they took off from If it's a garage they can go right into that garage. They know where it came from and where it went And for some reason they don't want to comment And I think there'd be better off saying what it is our military knows and our our president knows And for some reason they want to keep people in suspense I can't imagine it's the enemy because it was the enemy that blasted out even if they were late that blasted Something strange is going on for some reason they don't want to tell the people and they should because the people are really I mean they happen to be over bedminster They're very close to bedminster I think maybe I was far from the law of course I've decided to cancel my trip Have you received an intelligence briefing on the drones? I don't want to comment on that Do you have any results? Yeah, so I mean it's weird and all these things Nope, they're not able to shoot them down. They're not shooting them down saying they don't have the authority to shoot them down I mean, that's literally coming from uh some of my secretary of my orcas saying that they don't have the authority Who doesn't have the authority? Uh, I guess the government. That's I mean why that's what he's saying man President-elect Trump has put out a post on this. I want to put it up on the screen right now He says Mystery drone sightings all over the country can this really be happening without our government's knowledge? I don't think so let the public know and now otherwise shoot them down your response Well, uh, we are aware of the drone sightings as I as I've said I think they're more than 8,000 drones flown every day in the United States with the respect of the ability to incapacitate those drones We are limited in our authorities. We have certain agencies within the Department of Homeland Security that can do that and outside our department But we need those authorities expanded as well Just weird. So where do you think it is? Well, so literally uh, today this morning this report comes out that says the US nuclear regulatory commission releases a report Confirming radioactive material was lost in transit I mean that the shipping container that it was on arrived damaged and emptied In New Jersey And now this report is dating back to December 2nd of this year So I don't know something you think it's it's us trying to find who stole that correct I mean, that's what at least one of the theories working theories are like apparently a my pd caught one of these fucking Massive drones and it belongs to this company called of an emoji or something like that which is like some shipping company But I mean to have like thousands of these fucking drones just going around flying and not saying to think about it It's weird. It's fucking weird man. Yeah, it's weird man. I don't know Um, what are your thoughts on it? Fuck. I don't know dude. I mean look it could be a number of things You know, there's a this thing called project blue beam. All right, and most people don't know what that is, but project blue beam is a Sci-op A planned siop that basically they plan on using allegedly holographs and fake news and fake a i Clips to simulate an alien invasion To lock down the country um And the other one is that it's to simulate the second coming of Jesus to get everybody in line right so And I'm not saying that's what this is, but I'm saying like It could be some weird shit. There's been a lot of weird shit the last five years So I don't know uh, but I honestly have no idea dude I've never seen a drone that big. I don't know what the fuck they look like brother massive. Yeah, and You know if they're not shooting them down it probably does say they're not dangerous But it also I think what you're saying makes sense because Why would they Not shoot them down and allow them to operate If they weren't looking for something or knew what was going on and possibly you know they something's missing This shouldn't be missing that they're in you know, they're they're urgent about finding And they don't want to tell people what's missing so that could be it too. So I don't know man I mean, it's just fucking weird. Am I mean I get in the stuff at a paddisk and for them to just say that it's no threat But then you got paddisk and earthwurst based shutting down their fucking airspace Like turning off all their fucking lights so they can fucking operate. Yeah, it's just weird Like I know that's definitely like I like that's always been my biggest concern is just the lack of transparency Yeah, you know what it's like and when you leave like you don't want to tail the people and scare them And to pan pan it But then by not telling them and makes it worse you leave us to our own devices Yeah, and then we think Michelle Obama has a dick. That's why there's no that's why there's no trust with the government and the media Because dude this idea of classification That the people that we pay to run our government are somehow in charge of what information We're allowed to know or not know Based on what you know what I'm saying like where does that end because when it first starts, you know I'm sure it starts like everything. Hey, this is national security. We can't have this out. So it's classified But now you know everything's classified like everything that has to do with anything with the government Comes out and classified and then when they released the shit they redact everything that's in it And they say oh, we released it and they didn't and they just say that they released it so that they can get away from people asking So when you start asking and you start doing the FOIA request they can say oh that's already been released But it's been released with a million every detail blacked out. You can't read it right so this idea of classification Is a big problem a much bigger problem than what I think the drones are Because dude, we can't trust our government. We can't trust the media We can't trust really anything anymore because of AI in this over classification of all this shit that they've classified to protect their own Assays they don't want to let people know what's going on because they don't want to let people know what they've been doing about it Which is usually figuring out a way to make money with it So you know, we if we're gonna have trust in the in the government We're gonna have trust in our country. We have to have a real declassification and I'm hoping That when cash petal gets in for real That we have that because dude, it's necessary for us to trust them. How are we gonna trust them ever With the amount of shit that they keep from us. It's like It's like we're little children except we're little children that make all this money that Pay them and then they decide what the little children can and can't do with their own money Like motherfucker, you're supposed to just go run the government you let us know what the fuck's going on We're paying you and then that way we can all make decisions about what the fuck needs to be happening Yeah, 100% man. I say this though if it is some some some project blue beam alien invasion shit They're working now because I get nobody freaking out. Yeah, but that's that's also the problem of no trust Because when a crisis does happen and it is real No one's gonna pay attention. This is the same thing is like when me too happen and everybody was talking about how they me too Me too me too me too. He did it. He did it. He did it and in a year dudes weren't even talking to girls anymore They wouldn't even take ask them out, right and then the women are like what what happened? Well, you fucking accused every dude you ever went on a date with of abuse, right? Okay, so like when when these you know when everything is racist and everything is sexual Whatever and everything is this then nothing is and that's the problem with no trust so Danger of it. Yes. We have to get back to a point where we we trust what are at least partially trust what the fuck is going on Yeah, I mean, it's just like with the I mean we've talked about this even on the COVID narrative man It's like you know, because I kept remember that you kept running that place like almost every new month There was this new variant and like what that like over time like people that I won't give a fuck no more Yeah, well, what happens when they release the real fucking thing well, we've talked about that you know I'm saying like it's so crazy and then like and then you know the craze this happened over the last week or two I think when World Economic Forum finally put out that shit about oh, yeah, COVID-19 was was actually a test of obedience shocking Yeah, right They're only saying that because they want to be they want to be exempt from the crimes against humanity that they fucking dead That's their cut final cover story So they lied they lied they lied they lied they lied people lost their livelihoods people lost money people lost their families people lost everything And there was an exercise so you're willing to ruin people's lives for a fucking compliance exercise That's a lie You guys thought that we were all gonna fall for it and you were gonna get what the fuck you wanted and now you didn't it didn't work So you had to come up with a cover story and the cover story was oh, it's a Conditioning exercise to make sure we's okay, so now we know who all the fucking Nazis are right We know who all the neighbors are who will call the fucking cops on you for beating your yard and breeding fucking air You see what I'm saying? Like bro those people should all all those people in the world economic form that organized this should be executed Yeah every single one of them Like that's just the danger of right now you have society in a place where okay if there's a really alien invasion We're fucked because nobody's gonna Bro these people are causing so much fucking problems in the world They do not deserve to have any influence over anything in the world at all no one elected them No one put them in charge They just started fucking with everybody because they have unlimited resources to do so those people are criminals They're criminals against humanity and they need to be held accountable Yeah Lunch up some of the guys jump it on this combo. Let us know what you guys think about these drones If you're in one of those areas hit us up man see let us know what you got send us some shit.

Yeah, no one fucking cares. No Uh, but I do we're mad. We're mad. You fucking always mad All right I don't want to turn turn our attention here real quick though to the prosecutor and Daniel Penny's case This lady beautiful Beautiful lady This is Daphna urine She was the prosecutor on Daniel Nielis case. She's the senior trial counsel with the Manhattan District Attorney's office and Yeah, she's lead prosecutor in the in the trial of Daniel Penny is it safe to say that This is the first time that a Jew let a penny get away How long you fuck who'd you steal that for?

That's good But yeah, so I mean, you know, but but we talk about like on the real shit though I mean because I mean dude this dude's life was fucking up ended for over a year and a half Right, um, and I mean I'll all know he's he seems cool. He seems fine. Yeah, I'm saying none seem to affect it You know, he spoke out publicly right after the the not guilty verdict This was like one of the first clips they had of him. You know, he did an interview on Fox Nation to check this out The former marine enduring years of vicious left wing attacks who vilified him as a racist But Penny has no regrets and here's why What didn't you cause you to want to get involved? I mean, I'm not a confrontational person. I don't really extend myself and I think this type of thing is very uncomfortable all this attention and line line is very uncomfortable and I would prefer without it. I didn't want any type of attention or praise Or and I still don't um The guilt I would have felt if someone did get hurt if if he did Do what he was threatening to do would never be able to live with myself And I'll I'll take a million quarter appearances and people calling me names and People hating me just to Keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed There's good dude man.

Yeah, and mobba and it's like that's the thing I think fox a lot of people up right because they look at vlogger She's a white person. No, she's not she's not well actually actually Most of them are and very few of them are actually somatic. Mm-hmm. Okay, so like full through and through yes, yeah, so Yeah, I mean the thing is dude like a lot of elite powerful Jewish people hate fucking white people. They're not the same. They don't seem to know But they're they'll conveniently pretend to be white Whenever it suits them and that's the problem that we have okay, and we're not talking about all Jewish people We're talking about there's an element of the Jewish population that fucks with people For whatever reason. Yeah, bro. I mean, it's real. I mean, I get in this situation It's becoming more and more known like if you go on Twitter I mean, I think it's I think it's pretty aggressive, but There's definitely points to be made yeah, and there's definitely yeah, there's definitely proof to a lot of the accusations that are made And it's coming mainstream you could get mad about it you could fucking Say whatever, but no one gives a fuck anymore Everything's coming to the light no one cares about the names no one gives a fuck if you call them anti-Semitic no No one cares And the fact of the matter is this woman who happens to be Jewish is showing her bias against white people she Advocated for a black man who did the same thing That Daniel Penny did with the tin and then tried to fucking prosecute him To the fullest extent. Yeah, but pushed only for tenio how the fuck does she even have a law license? It's crazy man in 2019 she gave a reduced sentence to a black man who murdered an Asian college professor As he was as he was withdrawing cash from an ATM she said that it was under the guise of quote Restorative justice and ended up giving them ten years for manslaughter after he was originally charged with murder She produced the crime I mean everything. Yeah, it's crazy. You know, but I mean it's cool You know depennings and Irish guy that went to a bar right after the not guilty verdict Um fitting You know, I'm saying it makes sense. Yeah, no, but and he's been I mean he's been seen with Trump at the games I mean he seems to be doing it. Yeah, and I think that I'll add all of this man because like that's the worst part about it You know whether it be you know, I see something dude's life ruined. Yeah, man Like you know, I'm saying like cuz like dude like I mean that's a that's a heavy fucking thing You know I'm saying because the the way that you know society works the media works like no this dude murdered this dude Yeah, you know, I'm saying like and he has to live with that for the rest of his life Yeah, so it's just good to see that he seems okay. Yeah, you know, I'm saying an unaffect I don't know I'm having talked to him, but just from what I've seen it seems that he's doing okay, man And that's good to see bro I'm just good to see man anything else on this no fuck off. Yeah, I'm I'm I'm over all the divisive shit I'm fucking over it. There's no room for it man. No no room for it And anybody that pushes it should be fucking called out. Yeah, well, he definitely got that so Yeah, man guys jumping on this conversation Let's know what you guys think down in the comments With that being said, let's get to our third and final headline. We got headline number three Again got to talk about it. It's an update man. Vendimenti sense. We we talked and chat it And I know people are interested to hear your thoughts on this Let's talk about the United Health Care CEO Brian Thompson. Yeah, all right. Luigi Mangione. That's a nice name Has a nice little ring to it. Yeah, little hot so zeta Person of interest in fatal shooting of United Health care. Obviously this this was December 9th Before it came out that they actually did end up charging him and find him And they're the push them through the legal system Um, but this was this whole situation was interesting man like I mean from shark to to to where we are now It's not finished by any means, but it's just all been weird All been weird everybody's seen the video of the actual assassination Dude walks up has a fucking nice little gun has a silencer on there a suppressor For all your gun freaks Um You know like I mean just use the dude like whole blood man. It's like it's wild. It's interesting runs off goes on this massive man hunt They can't fucking find him and then all of a sudden you know the got him and a fucking McDonald's like yeah Start to finish it was weird. Yeah, um, you know now as all of this stuff is coming out, you know, it's it's being reported Um, that you know, they're you know, it get no there's gonna be copycats and all of this stuff It's weird because we know I know what type of fucking coffee this dude wants to drink Right like I know it's too like I'm talking about Luigi here because this is how much attention and coverage this story has been getting Yeah, I know the type like his Tuesday morning fucking routine. Yeah, I know his family's background I know everything possible about this guy that you could possibly even nobody even asked for first of all Yeah, you know, I'm saying know about his back surgery You know about all of these things and you know, it's it's interesting and kind of relieving and I'm not the only person that's filling this Because it's been picking up some traction out there as well everybody's this headline from Daily Mail everyone's saying the same thing about Luigi mangeone and Trump shooter Thomas Crooks Why do we know so much about Luigi and we still know nothing about Thomas Crook no shit Nothing yeah, like what's that tell you What's it tell you well I tells me it if fucking it was it was all these fucking it was the cabal that wanted wanted to fucking kill him 100% bro That's what it tells me to come out within days. Yeah, we know everything about this And it's been what three four almost gonna four months now with Trump You know, I'm saying we still don't know fucking anything they burned his body within a fucking you know I'm saying like we know nothing. Yeah, but we know every I know what type of coffee he likes in the creamer He enjoys you know, I'm saying like for this healthcare dude, which like let me say this I'm not condoning the the murder of anybody unjustifiably Um, you know, but there are some you know a lot of people that have gripes with the medical system Yeah, you know like there's people they get fucking wrong with yeah, I'm sure it's shit all the Yeah, look what just happened with COVID dude look look at all these people that just lost their loved ones and fucking They're forced to take a vaccine now they're sick or they have these vaccine injuries Like and then these companies don't want to cover they don't give a fuck and dude, you know, so I mean I get that yeah You know, I'm not condoning it, but I do and like there's a legitimate gripe there. That's understandable. You know You know, there's a lot of heat there, but there was also some other shit going on with this guy Where Brian Thompson the the CEO who was killed You know he was in a massive investigation from the DOJ uh When he was assassinated for insider trading did you know that now yeah, bro Yeah, I mean, I'm not talking about a little bit of money either Um, apparently allegedly the DOJ was investigating the relationships between United Health's various big Business segments including optum the complaint set I'm as a result uh the company stock declined by 27 dollars per share or equivalent to 25 billion dollars All right United Health was aware of the DOJ investigation At least since October 20 of 2023 lost you said instead of disclosing this information to investors or to the public United Health insiders sold more than 120 million dollars of their personally held United Health shares Where Brian Thompson sold at least 15 million dollars, right? So the company did you know they get fucked up And then United Health Care again being dishonest to their fucking people lying to their investors Into the shareholders You know, they're losing 25 billion, but they were able to fucking scrape and you know dump some shit. Yeah before you know They knew the room was gonna catch fire right, you know, so I mean it's interesting man Like I said, we know a whole lot about this stuff and I like the biggest thing that that again We talk about transparency even with the drone shit, man. It's just you know, why do they they you I think here's an important thing If you look at the news you look at government and in this lens is that they're gonna show you What they want you to see yeah, you know, I think that's really what it comes down to yeah They're gonna make you pay attention They want you to pay attention to yeah, and the shit that's irrelevant, you know I'm saying like the type of coffee this dude eat drinks or what type of hash browns you fucking likes like Information that nobody asks for nobody gives a shit about that's what they want to fucking push in front of you You know, I'm saying, but any other time we need transparency on shit whether it be Thomas Crooks Or this situation that actually any of the school shitters or any of this we just had another one today. I saw that you know I'm saying like we just we literally just had another one a day and it's like how long you know I was gonna be months before we know anything about this dude You know what I'm saying because we never find out you know, so it's just like It's very frustrating man, and again like when you leave the public to their own devices man I guess dangerous. Yeah, it's dangerous man. Wait. What should take on this this health care shit, man I don't know man that was like a trained like fucking CIA assassin type dude. I mean I saw the video dude moves pretty pretty It was pretty cold and then to fucking escape like you did. Yeah, but what are they gonna do? Just funnel them through the justice system and then pull them out of jail like on the backside or what like I don't know man You're so like let's say he is one of these guys that does those things I Why they quote unquote catch this guy, right? You know, I'm saying why would they just not catch him? I mean, I mean how I look at it and all the at least the in my movie experience You only get caught if you want to get caught you know, I don't know yeah, I'm saying but it's weird, bro It's just weird. I mean like because then like okay, let's say he's not that now I'm you're you're having me assume that a 26 year old dude has the means uh the the knowledge and The opportunity to get that gun with that suppressor make that move and brought you know I mean it's fucking like 640 in the morning. Yeah, I'm saying like yeah You know I'm saying like there's people literally right there outside with them You know saying and then make that they're fucking escape changed paths. Yeah, it's fucking like bro 26 year old They're walking around with the type of knowledge. I mean have to pens. It depends on if they're trained I mean if they're just what I'm saying like but like taking that he's not that yeah What I don't know like I don't know man. I mean there's a lot of information available everywhere now I mean people train and they you know, there's a lot of people who've never been in the military that train And are probably better than some of these guys, you know what I mean? This is true man, so who knows But I definitely don't know I know that when he shot him He didn't seem like he was in a hurry or a panic or anything. No, bro. He worked through some fucking mouth function No, I think that was a single. I think that was a Sub-sonic Sub-sonic ammo that wouldn't Re-wrap the gun cycle and cycle I mean, but even still like to be in that situation and you fucking tap rat You like bro like that that's some training. Yeah, that takes some fucking training Like an average person would like like you see it off to the gun jambs. I just throw the gun and get out of there Yeah, I'm done. Yeah, like he was working through some problems Yeah, it was it was it's weird man. It's weird. It's weird. I don't know man. Oh, here We'll fucking follow it see what happens.
