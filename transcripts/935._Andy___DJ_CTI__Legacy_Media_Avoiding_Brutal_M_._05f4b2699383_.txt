And it was seven 11, dude. Yeah. It was like the, the original convenience store, at least in my generation. And bro, I can remember going in there, big bites, big grab Doritos, Slurpee, big gulp. Fuck. That's a lunch right there, buddy. That's fucking high cholesterol right there, buddy. I'm telling you right now, I would do that. I would still be doing that. Yeah. If they had more of them, which is probably good that they don't be fat again. Yeah. But yeah, dude, big bite, big grab before seven 11, bro, the Doritos were like this big. It was like those little snack packs that you get. Oh, that's a tease. Yeah, dude. And then seven 11 came out with them big grabs and changed the game. Yeah. Made everybody obese, but we were happy. Oh, we got extra Doritos. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Yeah, I'm down. I'm with you. You got to eat more than one Dorito at a time. Okay. So I'm not a big fan of the, I like this. What's your, you like, you probably like, so how the fuck can you judge my food? You probably like fucking nacho Doritos, bro. You probably like the cool ranch stuff. No, I don't. I like the OGS. Cool ranches for weirdos. Agreed. Yeah. Agreed. I'm more of a spicy nacho guy. Yeah. I figured you liked them hot fries. I do like hot fries. Yeah. Those are good.

Bro, if I had a bag of Doritos and you were at my house, you eat the fuck out of that. Yeah. Put the chat on. Do we love Doritos? Does everybody love Doritos? Honestly? Who the? See this? Cool ranch for white people. I'm a Doritos hoe. See that? There's not one person in there that says that. See? You're lying. Yeah. No, never had him. I have. I've had him, obviously. I don't like him. They're not my favorite. Awesome. Yeah. All right. DJ Lion. I agree. Lemon on Doritos. He's not lying. He's capping. I'm capping. No cap, man. No cap. All right. Yeah, but let's get into our show. Chat says you're lying. Well, I mean, listen, everybody's entitled to their own opinion. That's fine. But, you know, I got a little intro for you. I thought I just thought this was wholesome. Yeah. And it has to do with food. So when I write like when your neighbor finds out that you had a new baby and they deliver some homemade food and then just make fun of them for it, is that like that wholesome? Is that what you're talking about? Yep. Yeah. Nope. I wasn't even gonna put them on blast. That was backstage talk. And now it's out in the world now. No, it's not. A lot of your neighbors made shit. No one knows. It's true. Yeah. This is true. No one knows who made the bad shit. Alex, we were trying to figure out how the fuck do we throw this shit away? You didn't even try it? No. You didn't put you didn't try one bite? No. No. Nobody tried a bite? No. How do you know that wasn't the best shit you ever put in your mouth? It was in water, bro. Like there's no 20 bucks. 20 bucks. There's no possible chance. You know what I'm saying? There's no possible chance. No, not happening. 50 bucks? Maybe. Maybe. No, but I would like to do a shout out. We don't do this normally, guys. I promise you. It's not something where, you know, it's on two, but you give credit where it's due. There is a barbecue joint. I love barbecue. You like barbecue, right? There's a barbecue joint called Destination Smokehouse. Okay. I do love barbecue, bro. I love barbecue. I do too. I like it because you just get all the protein you need. Bro, it's all meat. And it's good. It's good meat. I mean, I know you love good meat, right? We both do. Okay. I'm not alone in this. I like the big bites. You know what I'm saying? No, man, but there's a place called Destination Smokehouse. It's a barbecue joint in California. Okay. And it's owned by a guy named Nick. He's there on the left. And then the guy to the right, his name is Walter. It's A&E DJ. Basically. Yeah. Basically. Yeah. Yeah. Just kicking ass. For sure. Yeah. Now in the country. That's right. It was just smoking meats. That's right. You know what I'm saying? Have a good time. We can do that. Actually, I'm totally cool with that. I would love it. Let's just do the podcast and smoke meat. And just go smoke some meat. Yeah. And then we'll smoke cigars all day and then people can come and visit us. I'm down. They can sit at the table and talk shit. That'd be a good life. You know, I'm not mad at it. Yeah, I'm not mad at it. But Walter, bro, he's the star of the show. A&E DJ smokehouse. A&E DJs meats. Meats. Smoked meats. Smoked meats. Because like, I mean, who wouldn't want our meat in their mouth? That's a fucking fact. That's the slogan. The slogan is, you know, you want our meat in your mouth. You know, you want our meat in your mouth. Bitch. And then we ask him, how is that meat in your mouth? How's that meat in your mouth? That's right. That's right. All right. What are these guys doing? No, man. But Walter, bro. So he's like, he's like the I don't know if you call him like the smoke master or what. He's a cook, but he's gone viral. Okay. In this clip I'm about to show you. And they've been using him, I guess, like do some promotional ads and stuff for the business. Yeah. So this, this video is I'm talking about fucking viral right now. Check this clip out. But look, this'll be bomb. I want to make sure y'all see the clarity on it. Look, I told you destination one in the nation that what we do down here, I'm I tried to show y'all something I couldn't even show. So I'm gonna try it this way. Oh, that's the stuff I live for. Bro, that looks great. Do you see what he did when the shit fell off the bone? No, hold on. Oh, dude. He was excited. One more time. One more time. But look, this'll be bomb. I want to make sure y'all see the clarity on it. Look, I told you destination. I get it. Is that the clip that went viral? Fucking Walter. Dude, Walter and I are fucking bros. That'd be like if we were at Top Golf, bro. And I'd be like, yeah, yeah. And I didn't hit the drive. Fuck. You gotta walk off. That's it. I told you motherfuckers. Fuck with me. It is what it is. Bro, the comments on this have been fucking hilarious. Dude, I get it. Somebody said we all collectively walked away at the same time. Bro, I knew it. Like as soon as the beat fell off, I'm over here like, I gotta go. I gotta go. Oh, so nigga, this shit got me emotional. Look, bro, that's like hitting a fucking grand slam, bro, in the World Series with two outs and the fucking bases loaded and your whole life is on the line and the fuck you hit the bottom stadium. And he's like, yeah, that's it. That's it. I fucking told you. I told you motherfuckers. Yeah. Huh? I told you. That's the best line, bro. It's great. It's great. He's a, I'll never, somebody said I'll never be vegan. Not with this carrying on in my face. Where you at? E 40 commented on it. Yeah, bro. I mean, it's fucking great. Now this again, Walter is fucking awesome. He's, he also coined his own word. Well, there's lots of that. Check this out. Check this out. The black diamonds, you know about the tender nipples. Tender nipples. Did he say tender nipples? Tender nipples. Yeah. That's right. What'd he say? Tender what? Tender nism. Tender nism. It's own. I like it. I'm down with it, bro. I'm down with it. Listen, if you smoke meat like that, you call whatever fucking you want. You know what I'm saying? Like that's some good quality meat there. Yeah. Looks good. This is California. This is surprising. I know, but like I want to go, but I still want to go to California. I was in Vegas this weekend. Yeah. How was that? It was great. Yeah. Yeah. You left me. I know. Well, you know, I know you had the, you and the black four, the four black women you live with. I figured WNBA. I was mad at you. So I left you. So, so no dude. Yeah, it was great. I went out and saw Alex and we didn't do shit. We fucking ate and worked out. It was great. And then ate again. That's always a good time. Bro, we worked, we worked out for fucking, bro, that motherfucker strong, dude. Is he? I didn't know he was that strong. Yeah. I mean, he looks, yo, I'm a strong motherfucker. Yeah. But he's like, he's like 50 pounds less than me. Right. You know what I'm saying? So I'm like, all right, fuck dude. He was going strong as fuck. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it was fun, dude. Just fucking didn't drink a beer. Talk shit. It was good seeing him. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. Next time. Just, just bro's doing bro shit. I would have loved to have been. Yeah, I know. Yeah. But yeah, another thing was I noticed like people were talking about Vegas tourism being down, dude. It was fucking bad. Was it? Yeah, dude. I stayed at Aria and when you walk down stairs, you know, 9 30 in the morning, bro, on Saturday and Sunday, it was fucking hopping. So like, yeah, like when's the last time you've been there? I mean, I know we went there. We went in like, but that was no, no, no, to like for a few days, it's been like four or five years since I spent time there before COVID. But I mean, we went to a Bavette's steakhouse. It was fucking great. We went to, we went to this little Persian food place. I never eat Persian food. It was fucking great. You ever eat Persian food? I was good. Baba canoes. Yeah. I sent a picture of it to honey. Yeah. I was, I sent a picture of it to honey and honey fucking knew the restaurant I was at. No shit from the picture of the food. Yeah. Yeah. That's big boys. It was impressive. Yeah. That's big boys. Yeah. That's all he eats is that shit. You know what I'm saying? He's a cultural hero. Yeah. So when are we going to Vegas? Yeah. Well, I mean, well, I'll talk to you after the show. We might have a, we might be going there more often. Okay. All right. That'd be great. But yeah, don't leave me next time. Yeah. Well, they did have a detail for me. That's nice. Yeah. I was stuck with Michael. He's pretty good too. Oh, oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's real good. Yeah. Shout out to my homie, Michael. Oh yeah. All right. He's going to come visit. Oh, is that right? Yeah, that's right. Fucking shoot him. I'm fucking sure. Why would that mean Michael was fucking. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. You docked. Huh? No, we didn't dock. Oh no. I thought that was a signal. No, no. Okay. But yeah, it was good. I got, you know, it was good. I think I can't wait for him to come visit it. No, but they were good, bro. It was all good. It was fun. Yeah. Sick, man. All right. Um, just give me a second to recollect my manhood and uh, yeah, no, let's uh, let's get into the show guys. We don't know if you're waiting on it. We got plenty of stuff to cover. Uh, remember as always, if you guys would like to see any of these articles, pictures, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find them all linked there for you. Uh, with that being said, let's buckle up. We got headline number one. Uh, I got to talk about it. North Carolina on the train. Oh fuck dude. Wild. Absolutely wild. But there might be some silver lining in this a little bit. Let's cover it. No, there's not can't come back to life. That's the fucking bottom line. That's true. I think we need to start really understanding that death is permanent. It's not a fucking movie. Bro. I think that honestly, and that's been getting to me, bro, like, and I know we've mentioned this, right? But just like the true lack of like care for just simple humanity, bro, it's like gone. It's gone. And like immediately people want to jump sides or pick a side. You know, I'm like, dude, it's disgusting. Look, it's disgusting. Let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. So for those of you guys who have not seen it, um, or have not heard about this, uh, North Carolina, um, this headline reads legacy media slammed for avoiding brutal murder of Ukrainian woman by career criminal or North Carolina train. Uh, so critics are calling out major news outlets for lack of coverage of the fatal stabbing of a 23 year old Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina by a career criminal with a lengthy history of violent offenses. The victim, Irania era, uh, Zyrutska fled Ukraine due to the ongoing war, but was brutally killed late at night during riding a light train in, uh, Charlotte surveillance footage released by transit officials, which has since gone viral shows the suspect, 34 year old to Carlos Brown Jr. Sitting behind Zyrutska, uh, before suddenly stabbing her in the neck multiple times. He then walked away. His blood dripped from the knife and his hands, um, Brown, who has been charged with first degree murder has a criminal record stretching back years that include violent crimes and mental health issues known to law enforcement. Many have questioned why he was free in the first place. Um, despite the shocking nature of the crime, the incident has seen little to no coverage on the websites of mainstream outlets, such as the Associated Press, CNN or the New York Times. Charlotte mayor V Lyle suggested some outlets avoided showing the footage out of respect for the victim's family, but many of these organizations have not reporting, uh, reported on the killing at all. Um, now Elon Musk even jumped in on this on Twitter. Um, this has been going kind of crazy, but he tweeted this out, uh, saying, uh, no one commits narrative crimes like New York Times. They are the best. Um, and it's basically a side by side of the New York Times search, um, on their website. And you search for example, Daniel Penny, there is over a hundred, um, articles and results of Daniel Penny, um, but literally zero for Iran, your Zyrutska. Um, and, and you can do this same thing with literally any, uh, legacy media outlets, CNN, AP, they won't touch it. Um, you compare that to coverage of George Floyd or coverage of Mike Brown or coverage of literally anything else. Um, but they won't cover it because it doesn't fit their narrative, you know, motives, motives, operandum, if you will. Um, now obviously trunk chimed in on this, uh, he condemns the lunatic and Charlotte stabbing saying, if we don't handle evil, we won't, we don't have a country. Um, he, he said this, uh, in a statement, he says, quote, we're all people of religion, but there are evil people, Trump said, and we have to confront that. I just give my love and hope to the family of the young woman who was stabbed this morning or late, uh, or last night in Charlotte by a madman. Um, now out of left field, I do think this is an interesting piece. Um, and we've criticized this guy a bunch in the past. Uh, Randy fine is in the conversation. Um, now Randy fine representative, Randy fine, he just came out, uh, with, uh, plans to introduce a bill to hold judges accountable for releasing violent criminals to reoffend following the horrific public stabbing, um, of, of this victim in this situation. So he tweeted this out, uh, saying, quote, I'm going to introduce legislation to hold judges accountable when violent repeat offenders, they release, commit new crimes. It's easy to release criminals when you're protected by an arm bailiff at all times. The rest of us aren't so lucky. Those 12 plus judges that released a Carlos Brown Jr. Should have their day in court too. Nah, bro. They should just have their fucking life in prison. And by the way, uh, I agree with Randy fine on this. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. This is how it should be. I still think he's a fat fucking piece of shit that literally does not have our country's interests in mind. He could have done this years ago, but you know, I, I not, you know, I, I call it how I see it. It's a good thing. Not a bad thing. Agreed. Some of the shit that he says otherwise is ridiculous, but is there more? Nope. What do you think? I mean, dude, it's the same thing, man. And like, I'll be real, like it's exhausting. It's exhausting, bro. And like, what part? What's exhausting? The same shit. Seeing the same shit done by same shit. What, what do you mean the same shit? Seeing the same shit, these violent crimes being done by the same violent criminals all over our fucking country, zero talk about it or, uh, you know, they even started a fucking go fund me, which has since been taken down. I saw that, but like, dude, it's exhausting, man. And it's like, I walk around every day. And I mean, I know this is a comedy show, but like, it does, it does suck, bro. Cause I walk around every single day. I'm a black man. I have, I'm no threat to anybody unless they're obviously a threat to me. You know what I'm saying? But like, this does not help. And then it especially doesn't help when you got people that are walking around that should not even be living like this, you know what I'm saying? Like this, this shouldn't should be handled a long time ago, a long fucking time ago. And you replace this woman with fucking anybody who replaced this with your kids, replace this with, with your family, with your wife, I mean, with you replace it with anybody. There are people in this society, people in this country that intentionally choose to not participate, whether that means by financially and working and paying into our system. Um, or they intentionally choose to just, you know, not obey and not follow any of our rules and laws that we've deemed as a society, like that we need to have to be a civil society. They don't want to participate. And so like for me, it's a very simple, very simple fix. You get all these fucking people out. I have zero remorse for any violent criminals, bro. Zero, zero. Yeah. Um, yeah. Fuck. That's tough, dude. No, if you watched a video, the guys like super mentally disturbed before the attack, he's like having some sort of like fucking episode. He just pulls his knife out. He's, he's not going to get first degree murder because some fucking shit bag lawyer is going to be like, Oh, well he decided this and, and the moment it was here, the moment it wasn't premeditated. Yeah. Um, I think I've heard a lot of takes on this and I've seen a lot of takes from people that I know and like, and then from people that I don't know and like, here's where I'm at. I am fucking sick of seeing innocent people murdered because there is an entire class of people that sympathizes with criminals over the victims. And these people are people that are elected to protect us as citizens. They get paid by our tax dollars and they continuously side and have empathy and tell sob stories in their brain as to why whatever this dude's, what's his name? The car. The car low fucking went through in his past or what opportunities he was denied or what he may have experienced and or not experienced. And that gives us a reason to give him 16 chances until he kills an innocent girl on the train for no fucking reason. Every single person that sympathizes with violent criminals is a fucking problem to this country. And this progressive liberal mindset that continuously sides with these violent offenders is a fucking poison to civilization. And any of the people who side with these people for any reason should be ostracized, shamed, and potentially prosecuted, especially if there's someone in power like a judge who has control and abandons their duties to put people like this away forever and protect us. That is the form and reason of our government. It's the main purpose of it to protect us. They do not protect us. They steal our money. They oppress our culture. They pretend like things aren't happening that are very clearly happening. And to be honest, dude, I'm sick of seeing white people victimized by black criminals with no accountability. And I don't fucking really give a fuck what people think about it. It's the fucking data. The data says we have a black violence problem in our country. And that's where that's reality. It's fucking we cannot address a black violence problem if we deny that it exists. And it is very clearly the same exact demographic that is doing this kind of crime, this senseless, pointless crime. And it needs to be addressed just like it needs to be addressed that there's no accountability when white people are the victims. Why the fuck is that? Why is it okay for people to ignore situations where a white girl who's literally on her phone, bro, look at her right here. She has no idea that her life is about to end. And it's going to end in fucking 0.2 milliseconds. She has no clue. I'm actually grateful that she has no clue to see it coming. Yeah. Okay. But the point of it is, is that we have issues in this country that people are afraid to talk about because they don't like being called names. And that's the other piece that bothers me too, dude, because I've seen the clip and it's like even after they're showing him walk around and shit, it was eerie to watch. Nobody was freaking out. Everybody was just like, there were people still just sitting there. But then I think about it, well, shit. Well, they just prosecuted Daniel Penny. Exactly. Okay. This is the point. And we said this with Daniel Penny when it happened. They want to prosecute men who are willing to stand up and contribute to keeping order in society so that you don't so that there's more disorder. And they are intentionally trying to create this white supremacy narrative by the way they're treating this situation. Okay. What they're intending to do here, and this is important because I'm fucking tired of seeing it, but I'm also smart enough to understand that it is being weaponized to create racism. And racism is not, Hey, I noticed that a higher percentage of these people are killing these people. And if we were honest about racism in this country, we would be honest about who it's against. The biggest racist shit that happens in this country is against white people. That's the truth. Does that make me believe that fucking, you know, that we shouldn't all be judging each other on the content of our character? No, it doesn't change my opinion. But if we enforce the laws the way that they're designed and we actually held criminals and evil people accountable, the race problem would take care of itself. It just so happens that more of a specific race commits more of these kinds of crimes. And then when we put more of these people in jail, everybody cries racism. Right? It's not racism. These are take away their color, take away their race. These motherfuckers are committing crime and they belong in jail and violent criminals belong in the fucking ground. Okay. That man took that girl's life and his life continues and hers doesn't and it's permanent. So now we've lost in this country and in this fucking world, a quality human being who is doing what they're supposed to do in society, who's trying to make it, who's trying to get by, who's trying to contribute, who's working at a pizzeria, which is where she's coming from. And we lost somebody like that, regardless of race, for someone who has created death and destruction and crime and disorder because the white liberal movement in this country, the white progressive movement, who is old enough and not exposed to this level of reality of evil, they feel guilty for how easy they've had it. And then they feel bad for little DiCarlo because he didn't have the same. It doesn't fucking matter. What's right is right. What's wrong is fucking wrong. And everybody knows it. And I personally am really fucking tired of being gaslit to believe that this isn't the way it is. Yeah. Like, dude, this is what's going on. We all see it. Everybody's a fucking coward that doesn't openly say it. That's the truth. And you shouldn't feel bad about calling it out because it's fucking statistical data. If you were running a company and you ignore the statistical data, the company's going to fucking fail. That doesn't mean that someone has a bias for pointing out the data. If you want to solve the problem, you got to say, well, this is the truth. And here's the truth. Fucking 6% of the population contributes to over 50% of the violent crime in this country. That's it. Okay. That's why it's happening. There's your problem. It's a problem. So how do we fix it? Well, we fucking put them in jail and then everybody cries and says there's a disproportionate number of black males in prison. Yeah, no shit. Because they commit more to fucking crime. Like, you know, so crazy, bro, because like here is another example, right? Like here locally, that's not fucking racism. No, it's not. It's not. If we're going to have a multicultural society and hold everybody to the same fucking standards, that has nothing to do with racism. No. In fact, I believe we're supposed to judge people as equals and judge people as the content of their character. What is the content of the character of that man? Right. And why has he gotten 15 motherfucking chances? Because I can promise you if that man were me, I wouldn't get those same chances. Okay. And on top of it, on top of all of that, people say, well, race doesn't matter in this situation. No, it actually does. It's a real thing because nobody's fucking marching for that girl. Nobody's talking about that, but they will flip the world over and upside down and burn cities down for a fucking criminal who probably deserve to be in jail anyway, who overdosed on fucking fentanyl and they give them a gold cast it. Right. Okay. So it does have to do a race. No, it does. There is mistreatment and not equal treatment among the races. It's funny that they want it to be about race when it's absolutely not about race. Yeah. But then when it is about race, they don't want to be about race. Well, if we want to eliminate the racial part of it, then we just hold everybody accountable to the law. Same standard. Then the race takes care of itself. I was thinking about this too. You know what bothers me too, bro? It's when they do talk about these scenarios or situations, how they try to skate the real reason. So for example, we got a couple of malls here in the area, but the Galleria, so there was a Nordstrom in the Galleria. So we have a Nordstrom Galleria, Nordstrom in West County. The Nordstrom in the Galleria mall just closed. Okay. Well, why did it close? And so I was reading this fucking, I forget who, it was local news channel, man. And there's articles like, oh, financial woes. But nobody knows why it's closed. No. So I commented on that. It's the niggas. That's why it's fucking closed. They're stealing all the shit. And as a business, you can't operate when you got tens of thousands of dollars every single fucking month that are going just completely out of the way. It's hundreds of thousands of dollars. You can't operate like that. I know. So they closed that one. Well, what does that mean for the other Nordstrom? That means they're going to start going there. Which means crime's going to start pushing out there. Right. Because no one wants to say, Hey, it's these little gangs of black teenagers. Stop fucking shit. Stop fucking. They can't say that. Like, you know, it's so crazy. So fucking, uh, what was this Friday? I think Friday, um, I had to go to Dick's, uh, sporting goods, right? Uh, Ryan had her first soccer game on Saturday. She fucking killed it by the way. And so I went to Dick's, had to get some shit for her. And so Alex is in the car, uh, with the baby, uh, in Addison, Ryan's at school. I ran into the Dicks. I'm inside, you know, doing my thing inside Dicks, whatever you do in there, looking for some shit. And, uh, Alex calls me, right. And so I'm like, what's up, babe? She's like, you didn't hear all the commotion. I'm like, no, the fuck? What's wrong? Like they just got robbed. I'm like, who just got robbed? It's like, Dicks just got fucking robbed. I'm like, cause like, bro, I didn't hear fuck. I didn't hear anything. Like, and so I'm like, well, what happened? Like, yeah, this dude fucking ran in, he parked in it, like right in the front, ran inside, grabbed a fucking like racks full of shit. This is at West County? No, no, South County. Okay. Great. Right. And, and fucking grabs a rack full of shit and fucking, you know, walks right back out and gets it. And she was recording it and you know, she had the license plate and shit. I'm like, babe, why didn't you fucking like, you know, say something, you know, I'm saying, I would have fucking beat his ass, bro. Like real talk. So I get to the checkout and there's a little cashier. I'm like, yo, like my wife said something happened up. Like what happened? She's like, yeah, you know, happens almost every day now, but we can't do anything. I said, so what do you mean you can't do? Like you can't say, Hey, help sir. Stop. You can't fucking scream. You can't do anything. She's like, no, we're not allowed to fuck. I'm like, you're going to silence yourself into fucking unemployment is what's going to happen because Dicks is going to close this location because they're losing too much fucking money. Now you're out of a job. Like that's what's going to happen. I'm like, and little have you known, like you would have said anything. I would have came in running. I would have beat his fucking ass, bro. Would have beat his fucking ass. This dude, I mean, it was easily over. It was well over a thousand dollars. It was all fucking high end shit, right? Just grab it. I'm like, bro, it's, it's, it's insane. Was he white? No, of course not. Of course not. Of course not. And like, and bro, this is the real conversation that I have with a bunch of my friends, man. It's like, because we all talk about it, bro. Black people, we talk about it. There's black people and there's niggas. There's a difference and we don't like them either. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I'm just being real. No, that's the, okay. That might be true. But there is a, there is a narrative of convenience around that narrative. Whenever someone, whenever something happens that they don't like, they will say racism instead of like, no, that guy deserved it. And like, bro, we have to start holding everybody equally accountable. Like we cannot fucking, we cannot say, oh, well, this person went through this and that's what you know. There's no justification for violent crime in this fucking country ever. It doesn't matter who commits it. Anybody who commits it should be literally fucking removed from society permanently. What kind of, we, we live like Dubai. You can't be a society. Listen, dude, justifying, listen, fuck all these violent criminals, throw them in the fucking wood chipper, remove them from society forever and be done with it. That's what needs to happen. Okay. We got these fucking Karens who say this shit like, Oh, I was reading this thing on fucking Colorado super max prison. Everybody's like, Oh, they're mistreating the people and the, they're mistreat. It's, it's not human. It's degrade. Yes. That's what the fuck it's for. They should be under a water torture drip for the rest of their fucking life until they die. What the fuck are we doing? These people are not contributing members of society. They commit violence at will. They have not been held accountable and that's emboldened them. So that's why they walk up to you and they say, what the fuck are you doing? Give me your shit. And you're like, Oh fuck, I better. Like, it's not because they're going to kick your ass. It's because they've, they know nothing's going to happen to them. And dude, until fucking people wake the fuck up and start standing up for themselves and demanding that these people be fucking dealt with like Trump saying, Oh, well, you know, he needs to be held. Then fucking put them in a wood chipper motherfucker. You won't have the shit tomorrow to be cured one fucking day. How many lives will that change? Take the fucking violent criminals. The last fucking 10 of them who have done shit like this, line them up on the white house lawn and throw them in a fucking wood chipper crime will solve itself in a motherfucking hour, but they won't do that because people will be upset. Fuck these people, man. I'm fucking over it. I'm with you, bro. That girl, that's bullshit. She is dead. She's gone. She's not coming back. There's never going to see her again. Her family's never going to see her again. She didn't have a chance, bro. She's out here in a fucking pizzeria, trying to make a life for herself. And we got some fucking fuck that just takes it. I'm fucking sick of it, dude. I'm sick of it. And we can say whatever reason we want. We can say, Oh, well, he came from here or he did this or it doesn't matter. Yeah. His hamster died when he was nine. It doesn't matter. And it always comes from people who have no experience dealing with a criminal element. They do not get it because their life has been so good and so fortunate and so blessed and so insulated from any real adversity that they have sympathy for the criminals over the people who actually get killed. That's insane. Take those people and go down and make them go live in the fucking neighborhoods where this shit happens for one month and they will change their entire fucking story. And by the way, Randy finds correct. That judge, the judges who let this motherfucker out should be in prison, dude. Absolutely, bro. That's how I got to give credit where it's due. I don't like them. I don't like them either. You get that push down, but I'm not a fucking, I just want the best. Yeah. Right. Right. I want shit to get fixed. I don't have to like everything someone says to agree with the decision they make. 100% man. And that's a decision that's long overdue. Bro. I'd fucking dude, put me in a room with this motherfucker. I will fucking tear him apart with my fucking hands. I promise you, dude. Give me a fucking Taco Bell sport. I'm serious because it'll fucking take 10 times longer. It'd be more painful. Yeah. Fuck me. Fucking piece of fucking shit. Killing some innocent fucking girl on the fuck. And by the way, where's the fucking marches and where's the outrage and where's like, why the fuck are you guys not mad? Why are you not fucking holding the line and say what the fuck needs to be said? The fact that you're fucking quiet is what's causing this. Oh, well, they won't let us say that. Yeah. Cause you're a bitch. Bro. We got, there are some drastic changes that needs to happen right now, man. Bro. Listen, America's a multicultural society. The people that come here have to live by a certain code of ethics or will not work. Them importing all these third world fucks, okay, who don't have the same code of ethics, who don't understand the law, us allowing people to just get away with whatever the fuck they want, that it will not, that will create, that will create a fall of civilization, which is their intention, which is why they allow the shit to go. And I think the important thing is this. You have to understand they are trying to create racial divide. Okay. And as pissed as I fucking am, that doesn't mean that I fucking am racist against black people. We can say the same thing. This group of people commits this. It's just like marketing. This group of people buys this much shit. Let's fucking sell to them. Okay. We have to acknowledge the real shit. This group of people right here, for whatever reason, commits way more violent crime than everybody else. That doesn't, so if that's the case, then yes, the prisons are going to be disproportionately those people. And that's what needs to happen. And if you did that and you held the law and it applied to everybody equally, which is the fucking point and what we're told, we wouldn't have racism because the whole reason that racism exists in this country right now is because one major contributor of the population kills another major section of the population with no accountability. And everybody knows it even if they don't say it. So what's that? What do you think the conversations are happening behind closed doors? And that's what creates it. Yeah, that's right. That's fucking right, bro. And I'm going to tell you this too. Like I said on the last show, I'm fucking tired of being told I'm a problem. I'm tired of being told that I'm responsible for whatever the fuck happened 300 years ago. Motherfucker, my ancestors were slaves. The fuck you talking about? It doesn't excuse this. And by the way, I will say this too. I love the amount of black influencers that are speaking up on this topic because dude, this solution for it to happen has to come from the black men in the fucking black community to where they're not going to tolerate these fucks anymore. And whatever that means, whatever that means. Well, that's the thing. That's why I'm saying earlier, bro. Most of the black men know who the black criminals are. And dude, if those black criminals disappear, no one fucking cares. So take that for what you will. No. And that's the piece that I was getting to, bro, is because it's going to create some real fucking hate out there, real racism. No, no, no, no. Like real. It's already created that. Yeah. I'm saying it'll be physical, not just online fucking murders. I'm aware. But we've emboldened one side and we've taught that side that the other side is just helpless little victims. When that other side owns all the fucking guns. Yeah. Right. And the reason that they're held back is from vigilante shit is because of Daniel Penny shit. Cause I'm going to tell you right now, dude, people are pissed. Yeah. Rightfully so. Yeah, I get it. I get it. Fuck dude. This pisses me off. Dude, it's a crazy. We had to address it. It's crazy story, man. Guys, you let us know down in the comments what you guys think. I'm checking on the chat real quick. Yeah. Don't be a coward. Bottle line. Listen, how many motherfuckers, how many people have to die before people start acknowledging the truth? How many more innocent people have to die before we say, Hey, we've got a problem here. This is a problem. You know, I'm, I'm also tired of being told that like, you know, white people haven't created anything and everything's like, shut the fuck up. Okay. I'm fucking over it. Yeah. Yeah, man. Guys, let us know down in the comments, man. What you guys think. Oh, with that being said, let's go crew some of these comments. Got to check them out. If everybody's held to the same standard, racism becomes a non-issue. That's the facts. It's not supposed to be. Yeah. How it's supposed to be. Let's check some of these comments out, man. This first one, we got a shop stuff. Zero four 16. He says, uh, if DJ's white name is an Earl Eustace or Randy, you're doing it wrong. Eustace. I never heard that one. You've heard that? No, me neither. I figured you like have a cousin named. Oh, you're going to make fun of white people name now. All right. Don't even get me started. I'll get fucking drug on the internet. How the fuck you guys come up with your fucking names? Jesus Christ, man. Y'all know what I'm talking about. I mean, the Carlos a fucking normal name. Yeah, that's easy. I'm talking about the fucking, no, shiru, vacuum. Nisha. What the fuck are we talking about? Remote control. Yeah. Remote control. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. I get it. Mercedes. Well, poor white girls named Mercedes too. No Lexus. They just work at this. They work. They work in a certain place. All right. I can see Earl. Yeah. Maybe Earl, big Earl, big Earl, big E, big E. Yeah, that's a good one. See, yeah, you're getting lowercase. You're like medium. There you go. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. This next one's from King Yang. Oh, five. Yeah, one for you. Black Andy would be Randy Floyd. White DJ Dustin John, Dustin John. That's so white. So white. I like it. Oh, man. You don't ever beat no black people named Dustin. No, I've never met a black person. I mean, I can't. Do you think there's any? No. I mean, I'm sure there's one, right? But it's probably short. That's right. That's right. That's real name. Yeah. Dustin Tan, Justin Tangelo or some shit. You know what I'm saying? I'm just calling about Dustin. Dustin Tangelo. That's right. That's right. That's right. Yeah. I like it. I like it. Randy Floyd. No, I don't know about that. I feel like we do better. Yeah, we could do better than that. That's a good effort. Oh, Dustin John's pretty good. Pretty good. Very good. Yeah. All right. Next one. We got Larray. Uh, uh, Larray, Kevini Hall. Uh, she says, um, that gives a whole new definition to the term creamed corn, which, which, what are we talking about here? That corn concert. Oh, yes. I forgot. Yeah. Oh my God, dude. Yeah. Oh, how'd you forget that? No, I just fucking don't think about dudes cranking their hogs, man. I saw something. It was one of the comments. Somebody said like, uh, like how corn got their name or something. Have you ever looked into that? No. Me, I was scared though. I'd be careful if you're going to surge it. Cause like, well, what is it? I don't know. I don't know. I didn't want to put it on my face. You know, I looked it up after sending the comments pretty bad. It's really gross. Fucking let's hear it. You want to share with the class? Okay, let's do it. That's why we got you here. Tell us the gross shit. Yeah. Fuck up your internet history. So the name came from a crude story about two men in a party where one had a corn kernel on his tongue after a crude sexual act. Oh, that is so he fucking, uh, he fucking rim job, rim job and it got a little piece of corn out of there. That's fucking disgusting. It's even worse than that. That's pretty gross. They did few things and then the one guy shit on the other guy and to put a corn kernel on the other guy's tongue. Was he passed out? I don't know. Wait, wait, hold on. These are the band members that did this shit? Anyway, unclear to be continued. Yeah, that's gross. That's nasty. All right. Last one. Um, maybe the last time you licked a butthole. Oh, that's sweet corn. Uh, last one is from, uh, Avery. Oh, five to eight girls. You shouldn't eat corn. Girls. What? It should be illegal. Oh, fuck man. All this and corn sucker. Paul's not even here. Yeah, that's right. I haven't seen it. All right. Yeah. Uh, last one for you though. Uh, this is, uh, from Avery or yeah. Uh, zero five to eight. Uh, Avery says, uh, haven't listened yet, but this is another podcast of them sucking Trump off. We haven't done it yet. I don't listen. These people, these are low IQ people. Like they can't, they don't listen to the show. They just make assumptions because you say something nice about someone one time or two times and then you criticize them for the other things. And then you're a fuck. This is a whole problem with the country, bro. So problem with the country. We can't even have our IQ and our social acuity is so fucking low generally that you cannot acknowledge good and bad and good and bad on both sides and say, like, I agree with what that person says. I disagree with this part of what they say because most people don't have the capacity to think. And clearly Avery here is one of them. You know, we just did it with Randy fine. This person here, probably this person Avery who using a fake account because they're a pussy. Yeah, you're a pussy, bro. You're a fucking pussy. I'm out here saying what the fuck I say with my full name and everything. You're out here on a fake ass account talking some shit while you're in your mom's basement jerking off on your fucking hot pocket. Listen to the corn. Yeah. Like, dude, fuck like look at my life and look at your life, bro. I'm beating you. That's it. So I don't. I don't even care. Like, this is a stupid motherfucker. This is the motherfucker that you fucking walk into 7-eleven and you're fucking trying to like, you know, get a a drink or whatever. And the guy walks in behind you and you can fucking smell him. And then not only can you smell him, you turn around and he's five foot three. He's five foot three wide. He's got a 12 pack of fucking keystone ice on Saturday morning at fucking 9 a.m. And he smells like cigarettes and his fucking shoes are rolled in because his knees are locked. This is a fucking this is what the fuck you deal with with people on the internet. That's who talk shit. Real people who have shit going on don't do that. They scroll on down with shit they don't agree with. And when shit agrees, they say, I like that when they don't agree, they just don't like it and they scroll on down. So any of you that have a fear of social media, just remember that the person who's saying things like this looks like that. And if that person were to tap you on the shoulder and be like, I don't think you should be, you'd be like, shut the fuck up, you fat little fucking piece of shit. And you'd walk the fuck out and you would go to your friends and you would say this fucking troll dude, try to tell me to shit on what and like that's how you handle it in real life. But on the internet, you're like, oh, I can't believe fucking dude, do you understand the internet is made up of the majority of that kind of person? You know, I'm saying you're not dealing with high IQ people in general. No. OK. And you're dealing with people who are mad at their life. They're mad. They suck. They mad. They're fucking. They can't get bitches. They fucking have no wife. They fucking these people are mad and they're only fans subscriptions went out, went up. Yeah. Like, dude, it's just these are just fucking losers. Yeah, that's it. So, yeah. And low IQ. And that's why they lose because they can't determine between someone even saying I can agree with that and don't agree with that and agree with that and don't agree with that. Like, that's how fucking stupid they are. They fucking literally cannot fucking grasp it. So, yeah, bitch. Guys, nice fucking anonymous account pussy. Yeah. Right. Guys, we appreciate you, though, for being real ass fans. Those who love us and hate us. Let's keep cruising, man. That's another thing. Like, dude, we're out here saying our opinions and our fucking thoughts out in the public in front of the fucking world publicly. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. If you're going to troll, troll publicly publicly, bro. You know what I'm saying? But like, dude, I think it's so funny. It's these fucking people. It's these people who are terrified of criticism, who leave the most criticism. You know what I'm saying? They won't even show their motherfucking face on their profile or they got a private profile. Like, if you leave a fucking troll comment and you have a private profile, you're a fucking pussy. I agree. Yeah. I watched this debate this morning. A fucking PBD did this debate with this girl on. Oh, that jubilee show. Yeah. She gets on there and dude, you know, she's like, you're the problem. You're fucking rich. You're that. And he's like, he's like, dude, I fucking started off at probably said like carwash or something making. And dude, I know PBD and that's true. Those are true stories. He's a fucking immigrant who came here and started with fucking nothing and became something. And this fucking girl is sitting there looking at him in the face saying, well, you, you, you did this or that. And I deserve like, you don't deserve shit. You don't deserve shit. You didn't. Where the fuck were you for the 22 years that people like him or myself or anybody else were working alone to build their dream? Where the fuck were you? You were nowhere. In fact, you were probably making fun of people like that. And now you expect those people to want to like give their shit to you. You're the problem, dude. Those people are the fucking problem. I'm over it, dude. Fuck your entitlement, man. If you want what the fuck people like that have, then pay the price and it's a big one and they ain't going to pay it. No, no, I have no intentions to, man. But yeah, let's, uh, let's keep rolling. What the hell I'm to check it out. Fucking start. I fucking made 58,000 fucking dollars. The first 11 years I was in business total 58,380 motherfucking dollars for 10 years total. How the fuck could someone say anything about what anything I do now? You know what I'm saying? Like, dude, the fuck out of here. I could have made more money working in McDonald's. Everybody I know pretty much was like, dude, you're an idiot. The fuck are you doing? When are you going to get serious? When are you going to, when are you going to grow up? When are you going to get a real job? Do you still have that little vitamin shop? Like everybody. And I kept going and I kept going and I kept going and I kept going. And now those same people are like, oh, you fucking got lucky. The fuck are you talking about, bro? The fuck out of here? Somebody said, I bet they asked for jobs now. They fucking do. But I'm just saying, like, I'm not going to hear your shit. No, like, who is it? No, for the years between 20 and 40, I fucking killed myself. And by the way, you know what I do now? You know what I did this weekend? I went to fucking Vegas. You know what I did? I worked. Fuck man. They don't get it, bro. They don't get it. And then they want the prize. And then they want to say, oh, well, that's not fair that you get this. Yeah, I know. It's not fair. I spent 20 years doing shit while you went around and fucking had a great time. That's not fair. You know what's interesting? People only call it a fucking sacrifice when you lose. Oh, geez. They only call it a fucking sacrifice when you lose. When you win, it's just part of the price you pay. That's right. I go back and say, fuck dude, I'll fucking do it 100 times over. That's right. Investments. Yes. 100%. Yeah, that's real, bro. Sacrifice is only a loser's stories. It's not real. If you quit or you lose or you give up, it's a sacrifice. If you win, it's a fucking legendary story. And that's the difference. And people who build legendary stories don't ever think it's ever going to be a sacrifice because they are all the fuck in on what they're trying to create. And these motherfuckers out here in the fantasy land think that they can get it without paying the price. And that's never going to happen. Fucking ever. It's never happened. It's never going to happen. And you certainly aren't going to be the first motherfucker in history to make it happen. So what are you doing bitching and crying and moaning about how unfair it is? Because it's not going to change your life, dude. What changed your life is saying, I have what I deserve because that's what I did. And that's the effort I put in. And those are the decisions I make. And today, because I want something different, I'm going to make different decisions from here on out. That's how you get it. And I'm tired of these fucking progressive idiots, morons, entitled losers saying they deserve anything from people like me. They don't. They don't deserve shit. You got what you deserve. That's the beauty of fucking what we're dealing with. You're living in what you deserve right now. Anyway, chat loves it. Chat. I said the chat loves it. Yeah, that's real fucking real shit. Yeah. All right, man. Headline two, shall we? Yeah. All right. Communism and Marxism. Let's talk about that. All right. Shit, dude. California professor indicted for assaulting federal agents during marijuana farm raid. This is an interesting little update. So you remember that marijuana grow facility? With all the kids? With all the kids. Yeah. One of the agitators of that protest, he got it finally invited and turns out he's a professor at California State University Channel Islands. Yeah. All right, chat. Let's take a guess on what this guy looks like. You want to guess? Yeah, he probably looks like the guy we saw walking down the street in California that we thought was a girl. Look, you're so funny. I'm undefeated. I'm undefeated. That's Avery, by the way. Okay. That's Avery on the comments. Huh? I said that's. Oh, yeah. Fuck it. Imagine being so ugly. You fucking have to turn your goddamn profile private or not even put your face in it. Good Lord. Fucking he I bet he knows a lot. Yeah, I bet he does too. That motherfucker could smell farts across country. He could smell what time it is. Yeah. So anyway. Yeah. So what do you do? I bet his hard drive is interesting. Well, somebody somebody just literally said that to check. Yeah. Yeah. Check. Check that guy's hard drive. I agree. I agree, bro. He looks he should not be saying around some kids. Yeah, I don't think so. I'm just saying. Would you let that kid or guy around your kids? No. Imagine letting that guy. I wouldn't let him around my dog. I'm being dead serious. Imagine letting that guy in your living room. No. At all. No chance. Bro. He looks like he smells like pickles. Huh? I know. There's no fucking chance. Yeah. Anyway. But it is interesting, though, how all these fucking people like, bro. I think it was it was Curtis Bowers, bro, who brought on just like this communist socialist bullshit. It's in the colleges. It's infected. This dude's a fucking professor. I just thought that was a professor. That's our best and brightest. Yeah. Best and brightest right there. Leading the nation. Leading the. Bro, if you're sending your kids to college for anything but like medical training, actually, I don't even know about I don't even want to get into it because it's a long conversation. But like, if you allow your children to grow up and be young adults and then go to a college where motherfuckers like this work, you are throwing all of the work, all of the lessons, all of the all of the time that you put in in parenting out the window. Yeah. Just so you know. No, it's real, bro. It's just it's it's crazy. I would never send my kids to a university fucking ever, ever. Not here in this country. Yeah. No, no, it's crazy. But the conversations and I got a solution for that that I'm going to release soon. Just so you know, one. A you baby. A you. But here's the thing, man. Is this conversation still been going, this immigration, legal, illegal aliens invasion, you know, for a while there, people kept trying to make this like a Hispanic thing, right? Like, oh, it's just, you know, they're getting all the Mexicans, right? But that recently has changed. And, you know, it's so funny now, because now we hate Asians is the conversation. Right wingers, bro, because there was a raid on a Hyundai. Well, you said that. How do you say that? Hyundai Hyundai Hyundai plant. OK, South Koreans feel betrayed by workforce detentions at Georgia Hyundai plant. Betrayed by who? Americans, right wingers, bro. What happened? So South Korea's foreign ministry departed for the U.S. on Monday to finalize steps for the return of several hundred South Korean workers detained in a massive immigration raid in Georgia, a spectacle that has caused confusion, shock and a sense of betrayal among many in the U.S. allied nation. So that was a raid on September 4th at a battery factory that was under construction at a Hyundai auto plant. It resulted in versus in Georgia. OK. Resulted in the detainment of four hundred and seventy five workers with more than three hundred of them belonging to South Korea. And they were all, you know, being put in shackles. And it's because a lot more all of them were here illegally. Yeah. So what's the problem? Yeah. Well, I mean, they're saying it's a problem. What? Why? No, I'm not being sarcastic. No, they were here illegally. Yeah. So why is it a problem? They're taking the jobs from Americans. Yeah. Period. Very simple. Yeah. Very simple. In a statement, quote, if U.S. authorities detain hundreds of Koreans in this matter, almost like a military operation, how can South Korean companies investing in the U.S. continue to invest properly in the future? Said Cho Jang-sheng, a lawmaker from the Liberal governing Democratic Party, another lawmaker, Kim Ji-hyeon, from the conservative opposition People Power Party, said the, quote, unacceptable raid dealt South Korea a severe blow that will be difficult to heal. What are you talking about? What do you mean? Because we took 400 people that shouldn't have been here and send them back. How is that a severe blow? How is time to heal? We're supposed to feel sorry for you. Please tell me how you're investing. Let's get the fuck out of our country. Yeah. I mean that, bro. How are you investing properly in our future when you're not even paying Americans to actually do the work? How are they investing? Because that's a lie. That's a lie. That's a lie. They tell, hey, we're going to move. We're going to come to the United States and we're going to manufacture in the U.S. so that Hondas can be manufactured in the U.S. They don't tell you we're going to send our own people to have the jobs. No, they're already here. That's the thing. I mean, dude, it's fucked up. It's fucked up. And I have zero zero. They're here illegally, illegally. Now, if you would like to come back, there is a legal process. Do it that way. This is not. I saw Geraldo arguing this. Some I forgot who was arguing. Oh, I think it was with was that Charlie Kirk that was arguing with them? I mean, it was just a stupid as fucking conversation. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, oh, you know, you're you're you're fucking against this and this. And it's like he goes, what crime have they committed? Yeah, that's what he said. Yeah. What crime have they committed? And he goes, they are here illegally. Do you understand what illegal means? What's the definite? He didn't say anything. He couldn't say anything, bro. He couldn't say like, it's so crazy. It should not even be that these people are not plugged into the social temperature of the country. They're trying to pander to this shit that was going on. They're still trying to live in the social narrative of PC of twenty two thousand seventeen. Yeah, right. Right. Two thousand eighteen. Yep. It's like, bro, we don't give a fuck no more. We're tired of this shit. The people who are illegally here get the fuck out of here. That's it. Where wherever you're from, if you're legal, you got nothing to worry about. You're good. It's crazy. But yeah, and you know, there's more talk now. We're targeting these people and these people. Well, are they here? I don't look, bro. I don't give a fuck where they're from. Are they here legally or illegally? They could be from fucking Russia. They could be from fucking Latin America. They could be from fucking Africa. Ukraine. They could be from Ukraine. It could be from whatever wherever they're from. If they're here illegally at this point in time with the problems that we have, they have to go home. They're going to go. Yeah, that's it. Got to go. It's not. That's not hard. Yeah, it's crazy. And so with all of this, there's more talks now. Chicago is spinning up again. This headline reads federal immigration raids planned for Chicago and other sanctuary cities in coming days after a weekend of warnings. So this just came out. Whispers of imminent immigration enforcement ricocheted across Chicago over the weekend as deportation efforts escalated in Boston and the nation's borders are about a much broader surge in the coming days. Quote, you can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country, Tom Holman said, told Jake Tapper from CNN to crying as, quote, problem areas. The next targets of the sweeping nationwide deportation agenda that helped propel Donald Trump to a second term. But Americans largely oppose. Which Americans largely oppose this? And then you notice how they don't say, you know, largely vast majority of Americans oppose this. It's just Americans largely oppose. OK, so how many Americans actually oppose this? Now, that means they passionately. That's what I'm saying. But like, it's a small amount. Well, I mean, look, dude, it's the same thing. There was a protest yesterday in D.C. Yeah. And a bunch of it was paid. It's all paid. It's optics. Shit, bro. Yeah, it's insane, man. Now, again, by the way, I don't really give a fuck. I don't give a fuck if you don't like it. I don't care if you protest. Protests all you want. Protests your little hearts out. Yeah. Walk up and down wherever the fuck you want to go. That's cool. You have the right to do that. We also got the right to remove people that are here illegally by the law. It's a law. Yeah, it's a law. But this conversation. You have to be a moron to like you ever have to be evil or a moron to defend criminality that comes from illegal migrants. Yeah, at all. Yeah. OK. And the evil people, they know why they want them here because they want them to fucking vote. Because they're trying to they try to import so many people when Biden was here that it would be impossible for conservative Americans who believe in American values to ever win another election ever again. That was the point. OK, they were trying to rig the system so that they would maintain power forever. That is tyrannical action. OK, they don't have any problem with that because these people believe that they are morally right in their actions and they will do anything to make whatever they want happen. That is why the progressive left and the communist movement has had so much steam in this country for so long because they are willing to do whatever it takes. And the American men and women who believe in American culture have an attitude of, well, as long as you don't bother me. OK, well, they're bothering you now. What are you going to do? You see what I'm saying? Live and let live. This is what live and let live produces. Creates. There is a standard to behold. We don't violate it. It is across all cultures. And if that's the case, then we won't have racism problems. It won't fucking happen. The reason that we have race problems is because we have people who are uninformed, who come from privileged communities, who have a bleeding heart for people who defend this shit. And these people are wrong. Well, here's the good news for you. So there was a press conference. You know what? If any single one of those people would have been, I don't know, stabbed in the fucking face by a fucking criminal, they'd probably feel differently. Oh, yeah. Ask me how I know. Well, here's the good news for you. So there was a press conference in Chicago. The mayor was speaking and got opened up to the public because this has always been my concern. Like, who are these Americans that you're talking about that are largely opposed is and what are there Americans that are for it? I'm sure there are. So there was a press conference. Let's check this clip out. This is you're about to witness a few Chicagoans go scorch earth on the mayor of Chicago. Let's check this out. Now, allegedly, inside sources tell me that you're going to use your $840 million in cash bonds to try and get reelected. Well, I'm here to tell you that that's not happening. I am demanding a forensic audit from Pam Bundy and Cash Mattel for you to come here or for you guys to come here and do a forensic audit on the mayor of Chicago. We have been calling for the attorney general and the leader of the FBI for months now. Please do not forget about us. Harboring illegal aliens in America who commit crimes is a violation of the Constitution. I hope Trump and his team are listening and take action as soon as possible. Thank you. Keep going. It's better. Thank you very much for your comments. You're not only the most incompetent mayor, you're the most progressive mayor, you're the most woke mayor in the city of Chicago. Where's the revenue going to go? Is it going to go to the deficit because of your math or is it going to go to the illegals that you love so much? So here's the thing. What's going to happen is this. You are going to go to prison before you get elected out of office. You was over there in Congress sweating yourself to death, didn't know how much that you gave to the illegal, $600 million that you put in their pockets at the time. You protect these legal morning. You protect the women of Chicago. You protect the legal more than a black in Chicago. You protect the illegal more than the children who men victimized and stuff of crime. Either your close friend with the devil or you're sleeping with a double. I don't know. I don't even talk to you. No, hold on. No respect for you. Hold on. I love, I love what those first two guys said, but they're, they're not understanding the reason that he is taking care of illegals. He's taking care of illegals because he fucking hates you. Yeah. Cause he knows you're not going to vote for him. That's right. And they're trying to replace you. They're trying. They don't care. They don't care how they hold power, bro. And it should be seen as anybody who votes for Democrats as the true colors of what they actually do. Yeah. Okay. So this man who's a black man in Chicago, the mayor has decided that the black community is not robust enough or active enough to elect him mayor again. So he has decided that he's going to allow all of the illegals to come to Chicago that he can. And then he's going to pander to them by giving them the money that should have went rightfully. So to the people that are speaking at this conference, 600 million. Yeah, that's bullshit. Think if you lived in a black community in fucking Chicago and your black mayor, who you voted for to help fix the black communities is giving all the money to fucking illegal migrants. That's insane shit. And people are pissed and they should be pissed. They should. And this is actually a really good time for all of Americans to unite around these things that are happening. And I think it's happening. It is. It is. And I really, it's really nice to see. Yeah. Yeah. I like this last piece to this, this last lady that goes, check this out. I don't even talk to you no more. I have no respect for you. You're raggedy. Your administration is raggedy. The Democratic Party is detrimental to America. And you by far have continued to let it just do whatever because you don't care, because you don't stole so much money. Right. And you don't went down to Congress and on line, a lot of the oath because you were just an idiot. You are a weak man. You are a traitor. Please bring in ice because we are under attack. You all invaded our communities in our city and in our state with illegal aliens. And I'm telling you right now, we're taking our city back. Everybody going, everybody going to feel safe. Everybody going to be prosperous. Not just one, everybody, the whole Chicago, Chicago is going to flip red until our almighty God. I'm going to cut her off. Well, she ain't wrong. None of those people are wrong. And it shows that the black communities are waking up, which is why they are importing these people and trying to protect them. So yeah, I love that. And it's a great time for people to unite. And that's why I said when we were covering this first story, that we need to not fall into the propaganda of being market, even though there is injustice is happening. We have to realize that they are being marketed to us in a way to create division against our fellow American, black, white, yellow, red, gay, straight, whatever. And we have to be smart enough as people to not fall into that no matter how mad some of this shit does make us because most people ain't like that. They're just not. No, that's real man. Guys, what'd you guys got on this chat? Let's get the chat up in here. Somebody said the only division that there should be is healthy and unhealthy. Listen, man, we need unity. Unity is the only thing that's going to fix this. And it's unity between the black Americans and the white Americans. That's what it is. We're the two biggest groups. You know, we would love to have the Latino community as well. But the reality is, is if they could get people to look past the color of their skin, these people wouldn't have any fucking power. And then we have to ask ourselves, how stupid are we to get bent out of shape because of the color of someone's skin? That's insane. That's low IQ shit. Americans are smarter than that. And we have to be bigger than that if we plan on beating the tyrants that are causing all the disruption, oppression in our country. So we're unique in a multicultural country. We're really the only one that has ever succeeded ever. And that comes from us seeing each other for who we are, not for what we look like on the outside. And that's a big thing. And it's really hard to unite when we see things like what we talked about in the first topic. It's really hard to unite those things, but we have to be smarter than that. We have to be smarter. We have to say, that's fucking horrible, but here's the truth of the situation. And we got to handle it. And that's that. And it shouldn't be a black or white thing. It shouldn't be a fucking race thing. It should just be a bad and a good thing. Evil people do evil shit, and we hold them accountable. And that's that. And if we held them accountable at something at a level that was fearful, that they were afraid of, that struck fear to the core of their being, it would actually save a lot of these people's lives, not the victims. It would save the aggressor's lives because those people would realize, fuck, I can't do that. And this is what we have in the Middle East. Fuck, I can't take that gold bracelet when everybody's left the market because that cut my fucking hand off. I won't be able to wear a bracelet. Guess what happens? Nothing happens. There's hundreds of videos on the internet of people leaving keys to like Bugatti's and Rolls Royces on the windshield of their fucking car overnight in the Middle East. And no one fucks with it. And you know why? Because there's real consequences. And we need real consequences here. And Trump talks a big motherfucking game. Where the fuck are these consequences, big guy? Because that's the only thing that's going to fix it. We need it, man. Guys, jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. With that being said, we have our third and final headline, headline number three. Your people, bro. We'll see. Woman quells internet hate after being misidentified as Philly's Karen. I'm a Red Sox fan. So this shit was wild, bro. Karen's got to go. Listen, lady, if you got the haircut and the glasses and you look like that, you're that. Yeah, that's right. Because they all look the same. All the carers look the same. Same fucking haircut. That's why it's called the hair. Karen cut. Yeah, that's right. Okay. You all got the same haircut. Stop asking for it. Are we going to play the video of her doing this? Oh, yeah. Please. I have a lot to say, bro. This is crazy. Yeah, it's probably gonna get me in trouble again. Okay. We got to keep Andy out of trouble. Yeah. But we got to talk about this, man. This is wild right now on the internet. The controversy over a Philadelphia Phillies fan who demanded that a father give her a home run ball during the team's game against the Miami Marlins continued to stir. Fans irate at the woman who marched over to the father who took the ball and gave it to his young son, tried to find out who she was. He created an internet rumor that pointed to a woman named Cheryl Richardson Wagner, but she has pushed back against the venomous online hate with the hilarious post on Facebook. Quote, Okay, everyone, I'm not the crazy Philly mom, but I sure would love to be as thin as she is and move as fast. And I'm a Red Sox fan. She wrote New Jersey School District because there was talks that this lady had got fired from a school district job. Those are all rumors. Internet. I don't even think I don't even think the main lady should get fired for anything. Like, you shouldn't take someone's job because of what they do to fucking baseball. Just shame her on the internet. That's it. That's all she needs. Like you start taking people's jobs. You're fucking just like them. Yeah. Yeah. Just just shame her. Okay. Just internet shame. That's all she needs. I agree with that. But here's a clip. So yeah, so there was a home run ball that went to the stands. Nobody initially caught it and went to the seats. It's like every game we've all ever been to. Everybody knows the rules. They hit the ball on the fucking stand. Never in the history of baseball has someone actually misunderstood that rule. Like you have to be a dumb motherfucker, like stupid as fuck or totally evil to under to think that because you were about to grab the ball, it was yours. Well, I almost got almost at it. I almost made a billion dollars, but I didn't. So it's mine. The fuck out of here. I almost bought a Bugatti one. Yeah. And any of those keys, big dog. You know, fuck man. So there's a couple of angles on this. So this is the, this is a very up close look of her going to the dad and talking and getting this ball back. Let's check this out. I took the ball. First of all, it wasn't in her hands. No, she completely lying. Okay. And this is how these people behave. I'm the victim. Did you see that? That's what happened to me. She's a liar. Oh yeah. And they've gotten away with lying for fucking decade. She belongs to a gaggle. Okay. Just keep going. I have a lot to say. Yeah. Well, so there was a second clip because obviously she got some shit for doing this. Okay. I want to point out. All right. I'll point it out after next week. I'm so fucking pissed about this, bro. It makes me so angry. Really? Yes. It's not funny. Yeah. Well, she got shamed. She got shamed, but she decided to do this while she was getting shamed. This is another look. Check this out. So now she's getting some shit from the other guy. She goes up to another guy. Yeah. You tell her. Oh, shit. Gets up in this guy's face. Okay. Look at her. Look how close she is to that motherfucker's face. Look at that. Who the fuck do you think you are? Who do you think you are? This? This? Everybody's giving me shit. She's getting booed. Flips the bird. There it is. Good job, Karen. All right. I don't have a problem with her flipping people off. I got three problems here. Number one, you didn't touch the motherfucking ball. No, you didn't. Okay. And this is what these people do. They create the gap between almost and it happened, and then they make, no, I swear to God, they create a gap between what almost happened and what could have happened, and then they tell the story as it did happen. And that is what these people do. These far left fucking crazy Karen people. Okay. And we, as people who don't want conflict and want to just go on with our day, have not confronted these people as a group. We have allowed them to shame and call names and bully people online and at the school meetings and all this shit. Okay. That's number one. Fuck these motherfuckers. Okay. You didn't touch that ball. And you should be super ashamed and embarrassed that you wanted it from a child. Okay. Secondly, to the dad. Listen, dude. Ain't no way. Hold on. Listen, dude. You just taught your kids to capitulate to weakness for convenience. Okay. You have no idea what you just taught your kids. You taught your kids to be bullied, to be picked on, to allow people to walk the fuck all over them for the rest of their motherfucking lives. And they will remember it forever because it was been such a big deal in front of everybody. Mm. Bro, that's such a terrible fucking. Yeah. Yeah. You failed, bro. I'm sorry. You failed. And not only did you fail your kids, you failed everybody because everybody's tired of this shit. You could have been famous. Okay. Oh yeah. No, he would have. Well, regardless, this is going to stir up. People aren't going to deal with this anymore. Okay. Thirdly, and this is the part that people are going to get uncomfortable about. What would happen to you as a man if you did that to another man? Oh, fuck. Yeah. What would happen? Oh, we're fighting. We're fighting. If another man got in my fucking face. We're fighting. Within one inch of my face, swinging their finger, I'm going to fucking destroy that person. And I don't care who the fuck it is. No matter. And for someone to act like this, we've made this point on the show before, the reason that she is comfortable doing that is because she has never faced any physical repercussions to doing that. Okay. And that is a big difference between men and women like this. That's the truth. And people get so pissed when you say that shit. That is not okay to get in someone's face like that. Who the fuck do you think you are getting in somebody's stranger's face one inch away from bro? Dude, I feel bad for her husband, bro. Bro, I'm just saying. She was sitting next to you. What are we doing allowing these people to, like the tails wagging the dog in society, bro. We're afraid of people who talk this mad shit because they've never had any repercussions. Bro, that woman should be shamed into oblivion for fucking the rest of her life. And anytime this happens to a man where this, you cannot give in. No. You cannot let these people win. These are the people who bully everyone in every scenario in all society who have created cancel culture and political correctness. And they figured out that they can scream and yell and throw tantrums and get their way and get their fucking way away. Bro, I cannot do it. I couldn't believe how she got in those dudes faces like that. It's crazy. What do you do? That only comes from a complete lack of repercussions in any way, shape or form. Like, dude, I don't know, man. Like, I just think that's insane. I think it's insane for any human being to get in someone's face like that and be confident in doing it that there's going to be no repercussions. Now, I mean, here is the gross. Some of the ladies are going to have to step in here, bro. Yeah. Yeah, for real, dude. Like some of you ladies, these are these people that act like that. Like, you know, I know there's a lot of men situations that need to happen, but I think people in general, men and women need to stand the fuck up and hold the fucking line against these people who just think they're going to bully everybody and not get shit happen to them. Yeah. Now, I mean, now there is a good piece of this story. Yeah, the kid got all this shit. Yeah. But that's not going to equate, bro. The lesson that was told on this, that was a did you see the interview with the fucking dad and the kid and the girl? No, the kid was disappointed. The kid was like, I didn't want to give it back. You know, like, I don't really understand. He said to his dad, like, I don't really understand why you gave it back. Like, oh, man. Yeah, bro. Like, and he's like, you know, this dude without any testosterone in his body, you could see it the way he reacted. Like you like, yeah, he oh, bro. Yeah. Like he, like, flinched. Yeah. It's like, dude, fuck you. Do the fuck are you doing in my face? Yeah. You could tell he only gets the kids on the weekends. Look, man, I'm telling you this. Well, I don't know. I don't know. But there's no way he'll never forget it. He'll never be able to fix it. It's sad. It's sad. Yeah, I do like, like I just shout out to the Phillies, though, for trying to correct your problem. Like I saw this clip of I guess she she works for the Phillies organization. She can't buy. Let's check this out. It's his fucking birthday. It was his birthday. This is birth. Your dad still gave the ball back. Fuck, man. He gave that ball back and his balls. Bro. And then he got to, like you say, you got to meet one of the Phillies players after we got a signed bat. That's great. What's his face? He's played for Cardinals. Oh, really? Yeah. Harrison Bader. Oh, sick. Yeah. Good dude, man. Yeah. Well, I mean, and of course she's now an official meme. Well, I mean, look, man. Somebody made this one. Yeah, that's mine, too. I mean, look, bro, this is more than just what it appears to be. It's the representation of that entire culture. Bullying the rest of the culture into their way. And dude, we can't have it. It's got to be done. Yeah, like I'm it's. Dude, that's all I got to say, man. I'm way more upset about this than than probably what I should be. But it's because of what it represents in culture. And I don't think that it's OK for any human being to get in anybody's face like that for any reason, unless, you know, you're ready to fucking fight. Mm hmm. Yeah, that's crazy, man. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Imagine you doing that, bro, to any man, any fucking man, any man. There's no way I'm getting in someone's face without expecting a physical confrontation. Yeah. I'm being prepared for it. Yes. Oh, no. It's crazy, man. And dude, people need to conduct themselves like real talk. A hundred years ago, what would happen? No, I'm serious. What would happen? What would have happened? Right. Yeah, man, guys, jump on this conversation. That's not OK. I think it's not OK. No, it's not. She was poking them dudes in the chest with her fucking finger, bro. No, I know. Well, you know what's going to happen as a man. You poke another man in the chest with your finger. I mean, that's that's saying we are fucking fighting. That's it. Let's go, buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Every time I ever poke somebody in the chest, I got punched. I remember every motherfucking time. Yeah, but guys, jump in on this conversation, man. Let's see the chats. Chat. What we got on this? Break that finger. Yeah. Yeah, she's been banned. Maybe we shouldn't go to the chat. I mean, look, man, the people are tired of these people. They're tired of these people. They're tired of these people. I'm fucking tired of it. Yeah, man. Yeah, guys, let's go down to the comments. What you guys think. With that being said, we have our final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up and down as far as we're going to stop these people. Bro, here's the craziest thing. And like, I know it might just be DJ's take, man, but I don't know. But I've never ran into one in the wild. I have. You know what I'm saying? I have. Yeah, I haven't. I tell them to shut the fuck up. Bro, I got a whole thing. You know how you got that thing? That Matt Blackface thing? Yeah. So like when COVID was going on, DJ was able to do things that I wasn't able to do. OK, this is the truth. We will walk into places and they would say shit to DJ.

Let me see. So you're making me laugh, man. Hold on. Let's see it. Matt Blackface. I'm trying. They're making me laugh, man. But to put a mask on. Let's try that. Sir, I need you to put a mask on.

Well, anyway, DJ, we this mad blackface. Yeah, that's what it is. So I got a whole thing, man. Like when these people do this shit. OK, I don't say shit. I just like I give them a look. Right. I see yours. OK, hold on. Sir, that is my ball. It's my ball. That's. Hold on. I got to be looking over here because it involves a head turn. That's what I'm saying, man. All right. So start, sir.

Just like that. And they fucking go away, bro. They fucking go away. I don't even have to raise my voice. I don't have to fucking yell. I just say, shut the fuck up. They fucking go away, bro. Like they don't know what to do because you're not yelling. You remember those like you wake up at like three in the morning, those infomercials on TV. Yeah. With all the songs. Yeah. You know, the songs. Yeah. Like for 1999, you can buy this ultimate collection. You mean back in the day. Yeah, right. Yeah. You just reminded me of that infomercial when that turned. Like I was here. Michael Bolton. I got the fucking wind blow through my hair. Tell me how am I supposed to live. Let's try it that way. Let's try it that way. Give me some music here. Tell me how am I supposed to live without you. For 1999. Shut the fuck up. You're not getting a raise, bro. Fuck, man. You can buy this entire collection. Bro. Shut the fuck up. Endless classics. It works, man. It does. Because people don't know what to do. Like they see you just stay calm and look right at them. Like you got to like look through them. No, you got to look through their soul for sure. I look at their oppression. That's what I like. Yeah. But like that guy didn't have that guy was a fucking easy target, bro. It's like a wounded duck. Too easy, bro. Yeah. Too easy, man. Let it go too easy, bro. All the dudes need to start taking tests. That's what it is. I know. That's what it is. Yeah. Decent amount. Yeah. More than recommended. Yes. Yeah, man. Guys, let's get to our final segment, man. We got thumbs up. Bro, if that guy was fit and in shape and had his shit together, she would not have even approached him. No. It wouldn't happen. Who took that ball? Yeah, that guy. I'm going to call the police. Yeah. Shame on that guy. That's what it would have been. Shame on that guy. He stole my ball. Yeah. That I never touched. Yeah, man. Thumbs up or dumb as fuck, guys. Got to bring it up. We can talk about it. We vote on it. It gets one of those two options. I think you'll like this one.

Oh, no. Listen, I would not let you incriminate yourself. If you have to know I got pictures. That's right. Yeah. That's our thumbs up or dumb as fuck. Hell on reeds. Speeding Phantom Ferrari driver finally nabbed after six years of evading check authorities. This is crazy. All right. Have you seen this? No. Heard it? No. Okay. He has a need for speed and a lawyer. Police have finally caught up with a mysterious speed demon who has been illegally tearing up check motorways in a Ferrari Formula One style car for nearly six years. No way.
