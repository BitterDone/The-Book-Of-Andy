Another fucking reality guys today we have Andy and DJ Prus the mother fucking into that. That's what we're gonna do. Cruise the internet. That's what CTI stands for. We put topics on the screen. We talk about what's happening in culture society in the world. We speculate on what we think is the truth and what we think is not true and then we talk about how we the people have to be a solution of these problems going on in the world. Other times if you're new we have shows within the show you're gonna hear Q and A F that's where you get to submit questions these questions are typically about entrepreneurship, business, success, winning. That's the backbone of this show. You can submit your questions to be answered live on those episodes a couple different ways the first way is guys you can email your questions into ask Andy at any Priscilla.com or you go in the comment section on the Q and A F episodes and drop your question right there in the comments and we'll choose some from there as well. Other times we have real talk real talk just five 20 minutes of me saying some stuff that I think needs to be heard and then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus where people come on the show who have completed 75 hard program who have transformed their lives by taking control of their mental toughness discipline grit fortitude perseverance and basically turning themselves into a fucking weapon that is capable of succeeding in life. They talk about how their life was before they talk about how their life is now and they talk about how you can do the same and if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard it is the world's most popular ever mental recalibration program. You can get that program for free at episode 208 on the audio feed only it's not on YouTube because we weren't on YouTube when that came out. Just started YouTube about a year ago. Now 75 hard is the initial phase of the live hard program it's not a challenge it's not a trend it's not a tick-tax bullshit whatever people think it is it's an actual program that is sustainable and live hard if you want to get the whole program for free it's on that same episode episode 208 there is a book available on my website Andy forsella.com that outlines the entire live hard program plus it has 10 chapters on mental toughness case studies on famous people that you'll recognize how they've used mental toughness to create the success that you know them for book is not necessary you

yeah yeah got it he's like four hundred feet tall that's fucked up yeah what that's fucked up hey man I'm giving you a compliment I'm giving you a compliment your tall your tall now but hey listen you know I think we we on a serious note on a serious note man we got it we got we got to we got to put some condolences out there what happened you didn't see finance here Lord Jacob Rothschild renowned for its art philanthropy dies at age 87 really yeah I thought we should take a moment of silence right moving on no hey listen you know I thought we just put this here yes a finance here and member of the Rothschild banking family Lord Jacob Rothschild has died at the age of 87 his family has announced the British pier stated his career in the family bank in M Rothschild and sons in 1963 before going on to take control of Rothschild investment trust and later co-founding the then J Rothschild assurance group now St. James Place with Sir Mark Weinberg in 1980 Lord Rothschild's family has estimated for it should have around 825 million according to last year's Sunday Times Rich List and gave away a reported $66 million to Jewish causes education and art which I think that 825 I think that's that that that that that that's personal money yeah that that that's like money on the books that's that that's the money exactly but an statement to the PA news agency or the family said quote our father Jacob was a towering presence in many people's lives a superbly accomplished finance here a champion of the arts and culture devoted public servant a passionate supporter of charitable causes in Israel and Jewish culture a keen environmentalist and a much loved friend father and grandfather he will be buried in accordance with Jewish custom and a small family ceremony and there will be a memorial at a later date to celebrate his life they added that Jacob Rothschild was an extraordinary person in his loss will be felt by many the family is committed to continue with the legacy and the foundation which he loved and endowed look yeah yeah I mean dude I'll be real I hope this starts a trend of all these all corrupt fuckers dying yeah I'm sick I mean fuck he's really like 200 I'm just sick all of them dude it's not had nothing to do with just this guy it's all of these guys all these guys who have accumulated all the money who have been creating all the pain and suffering in the world intentionally to create more money which they're not even going to be alive to spend they all need to go yeah I agree with you guys I didn't shed any tears about this shocking yeah guys so did you guys think did you see this let us know down in the comments what you guys thought about that very interesting stuff I spend his life fucking everybody yeah I know they put it on there like he's some sort of philanthropist and you know this great guy when this guy's been funding global a shit making life miserable for the average middle class person unbeknownst to them for literal decades you know so it's you know good I mean you talk about being born into some fucking wealth that this is a whole thing bro yeah but see that's where that and that's where that elitism comes from because they've been born that way right so they then they don't this guy never knew what it was like to pump your gas or go to the grocery store and not be able to pay his bills and they feel special their whole lives because they were born into it and they think that they the and this is not just him this is all of these people this is all of these politicians this is this is the top five thousand most powerful people on the planet okay regardless of political affiliation these people who have all the money these people have zero ability to relate to the average human and they look at us as some other class like just by default how could they ever see us as the same if they never experienced what we have experienced from our perspective that's actually impossible so when you look at how they look at us and make sense because they were born into a life of extreme wealth their entire life and they say there's us and then there's other people and those other people are we the people all right and these people have been making decisions and and make it things hard and they think they're you know smarter than everybody they think they can make better decisions than everybody and these are the people pushing the globalist agenda which has you know the people who are hurting right now with the economic backlash that's the happen because of it these are the kind of people that have been causing it it's not your it's not what the socialist say or what the Marxists say you know um then it's like the local entrepreneur you know what I mean or quote unquote the rich guy that's worth one billion dollars that's not who the fuck these people are talking about that's who that's who they think they're talking about but the real rich people are the people who have literal percentages sizeable percentages of the world's wealth and this family is one of them and there's a bunch of other people that have sizeable percentages of the world's wealth and those people have been wrecking the world for everybody else for a long time so good riddance yeah all right P. Madal yeah so let's get into it yeah interesting shit let's get got a few interesting headlines let's dive into it uh foreshadowing there's some shit changing into culture that's good to see we'll get to that a little bit later so uh but that being said guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to antifacilat.com you guys can find them linked there for you review that so you guys can see our sources and see where to get these uh these articles from so with that being said let's get to headline number one headline number one reads Trump appeals ruling and massive New York civil fraud case dude you know we haven't like touch this in a minute this shit is insane of course I mean it is insane it really is so so so what's more insane bro is that like when you see people commenting on it on the internet who don't like Trump the stuff that they say yeah like that's insane you know they're like this guy committed 91 felonies he deserves to be imprisoned yeah like dude what what the what the media has created intentionally is a very dangerous and false perception about what actually happened you know like when we have uh Timothy parliamentary come on who's very familiar with the case and he breaks it down to basically the idea that any of you could have been prosecuted for this and this if this holds any of you can be prosecuted for this and that mean yeah because people don't understand what they're actually prosecuting this dude for which is basically misrepresenting his wealth on a personal financial statement for a loan that he applied for got and then fully repaid all right so they gave him the loan now people don't a lot of people don't understand this because they've never been through the loan process other than maybe trying to buy a house right by car maybe yeah dude so they're they're this doesn't make sense to a lot of people but what what's actually happened in this case was this guy has to fill out a a pfs which a personal financial statement for an application of financing for whatever he was building his businesses is whatever I don't know what the loans were for it doesn't matter because it doesn't matter if it's for your house or for a car or for anything if this holds and you misrepresented your income by $50 they could put you in fucking jail or find you all this money so so what's happened here is he fills out the pfs the pfs gets approved and accepted by the bank the bank has legal controls inside of their bank that allows them to approve or disapprove the information that's applied by the client yeah they're on underriders yes and it's a whole process and it's and it's there's very strict financial regulations around this okay so the bank says yes this is acceptable the bank then gives him the loan he takes the loan builds his business pays the loan back and now x number of years later this comes out so for them to come up with a case like this they'd have you have to dig so deep and stretch so far it's it's it's almost incomprehensible how malicious this actually is yeah yeah I mean like this one say like so let's apply it to the normal average day person you go you go to you know to Jimbo's carlight right and you buy a car for a 10 grand right and you fill out your you know you fill out all the paperwork and you say oh I make you know $35,000 a year right you get approved for that loan five years later you pay that car off already cars paid off yes you own the car with interest yes you paid it off you did everything you were supposed to do perfectly never laid on a payment now Mr. Payment yeah never default it and then they come back say oh well you're you know you're at your wages were actually 34,900 that's right exactly that's exactly what's happening and so now we have your your fine is $15,000 yeah because there's more than the loan was even for yes and so dude these people don't say these people on the internet that hate Trump so bad like you don't know what you're saying when you say oh and then like the new thing is is they're like this is how these people argue they don't have points so they ask question they ask like obvious questions that people don't want to put the time into answering you know what I mean can you please explain to me the nature of exactly how this is not a legitimate legal case right like well you're not doing any of your own homework right you know what I mean and the true the true reality of why we are where we are in the world is because like 20 years ago 30 years ago when people came out and said I'm a trans man we just didn't want to argue with them we were just like dude I'm not fucking I'm not this is stupid I'm not gonna argue with you over the chromosomes of a man and a woman and what a man and a woman is right and because we're all like dude let's just push this is fucking ridiculous now it's grown and grown and grown and grown and grown and so this is where all of this malicious shit is coming from now it comes from our silence and our cowardice that we have exercised in the past for many many many years because we didn't want to confront the situation when it was in our face and that's what's causing this and that's what's causing this as well these sort of things have happened little by little by little by little the justice system has become more and more and more aggressive with the way that they prosecute United States citizens for things that aren't really crimes that by definition are things that they do every single day but we're not allowed to do all right so we we have to realize that unless we start confronting these situations and calling them out as they go along it's gonna get worse and worse and worse and worse for the average citizen including these people who go in on the comments and they're saying Trump deserves to be in jail 91 felony counts for 91 charges you guys don't even know what they charged them with you're not following the situation down in Georgia with Fanny Willis and this fake fucking lawsuit either like this is happening all over and most common sense people in the center and then over towards the right they're understanding the amount of bullshit this is but the the person who just is intent on hating Trump the person who's still getting vaccinated and all this shit right those people are now like grasping straws trying to defend their positions you motherfuckers are wrong you were wrong the whole time you were wrong when you told people they should lose their job to get the vaccine it's safe and effective you you were wrong about COVID you were wrong about Biden you were wrong about everything what time are you going to step back and examine your worldview and say fuck I got fucking plate because that's what happened you are the victim of a multi trillion dollar propaganda initiative the biggest that's ever been created in a history of humankind and you don't have the intelligence to understand what's actually happening and because you don't have the intelligence you lack the perspective to say fuck I'm the one that they were aiming that at I'm the exact person that they wanted to fool and here I am being their soldier out in the street doing all this work I'm a clown and bro a lot of you guys are clowns and we're starting to see who the fuck they are on the internet every single day these people who come into Trump's defense on all these cases when these cases I don't care if you don't like them that's fine just say hey I don't fucking like them he's a dickhead I don't care about that but to say that this is okay and that what's going on in Georgia and all this shit is okay is bullshit complete bullshit yeah even in the other situation like with that uh the sexual harassment lawsuit that was found that same judge was the same judge that oversaw the Epstein case and let them off and let them off yeah why but and what's your netting it's had to happen to get that in front of that same judge how did that happen yeah you know I'm saying so like I mean at the bare bones again like you remove emotions aside I don't care about the side of a little while you feel like you stand on you move all that away right is right wrong is fucking wrong that's right and there is very you can look at this unemotionally unbiased and say this is kind of okay this is fucked up yeah it's not kind of like it's fucked up yeah very very very if it were you you'd be shitting your pants right now yeah being like dude what do I do I didn't do anything wrong right the fact that this woman ran a political campaign as a g for New York and her only political campaign we're gonna get Trump what's the get Trump the entire time there is literally I mean fuck there there's like a 10 minute clip of the fucking racist too bro oh no she did you see that comment she said about to stale to white or whatever like she started this chant we gotta try to find it she started this chant saying he's he's too too white to stale and like calling him a cracker and all this shit like imagine if those tables were turned imagine if like the amount of reverse not reverse but just racism towards white people that's accepted has the fucking stop yeah yeah and you know but like she runs her whole campaign on them I'm yeah but this is there yeah you know like you you cannot tell me this is none of this is fucking motive she's a fucking piece of shit and she's fucking cross eyed sorry she she crossed I never noticed it I thought he was just paying real good attention everything really yeah bro I'm gonna fucking be crying down a shoulder sometimes so what's the name of your restaurant you're open oh yeah what is it you're the only guy ever I gave that talk to it I said drunks open the bar and the next thing out of your mouth is I'm open restaurant hey man listen you can't beat our meats man you know um yeah last little thing I want to cover on this did you see uh because you know Trump Trump is very well known uh you know he we wrote that uh that book the art of the deal yeah um he's very strategic right and I mean nobody can really like deny that right and it's also too it's like you never really know what the strategy is behind it his moves but you know there's something there um so did you see this headline Biden and Trump will visit the border on the same day so Biden had his uh plan this trip planned for the board and then Trump's doing it on the same day oh yeah why do you think that is so so how I see this is because one Trump knows he gets the cameras he gets the press and so Biden being there nobody's even gonna fucking cover that one and all the attention he's gonna have all the attention on him be able to fucking you know I think that's part of it yeah that's a big part of it I think another part of it is we're gonna see how they get treated by the actual border patrol we're gonna see how they get treated by people in person in the same location the same day this is no different than why Trump did all those speaking engagements leading up to 2020 election yeah you know those in his basement yeah Biden's in his basement or in a high school gym with circles drawn around chairs Trump's out having a hundred thousand people show up at his rally 30 days in a row like in a row you know how hard it is to go for 30 days in a row and do that that's hard dude but he did that not because of the votes he did that to show an optic and people didn't really understand what he was doing he was showing optics he was saying look how many he knew what the fuck they were gonna do yeah dude smart yeah this guy this guy in New York like legit that guy the judge yeah that judge should be in prison for the rest of his life yeah for real bro yeah there's no doubt and like did you know not a time to take all of his shit because they're fine you know they're fine I'm like over a hundred grand a day they're just not paid and they're like calculating up by I think by the time of appeals is it'll be like 454 million dollars and like let's eat she's already threatening to seize properties and see like well it's shit's insane yeah these people belong in fucking prison you know I think Trump one of Trump's only mistakes and one of his mistakes in this stuff is bro like I don't I feel like he just he shouldn't even be playing the game with this like I think they're like okay there was a point to show the you know the the mallison all of this stuff I think okay great we did that yeah but at what point do you still keep playing the game well I think he's doing that I thought about that too and the reason that I think he's doing that is because I think what he's doing is trying to maintain the integrity of the system I feel like there is none I know but it's much harder to create a brand new system than it is to fix a system that's broken and I feel like Trump is doing one of two things with participating in this one he is either exposing to how broke the system is to create the demand for a new system or he is trying to preserve the integrity of the system because dude real talk Trump could just be like hey these people are we need a revolution and there'd be one tomorrow you know what I mean and he hasn't done anything like that he's tried to protect his language he's been pretty reserved on his language in fact that's a criticism of mind to him but again he knows a lot more than I know so I could be wrong there but I feel the reason that he's trying to be diplomatic about all these things is he understands that the alternative is going to be a full blown fucking revolution and the turmoil of that's going to last like fucking years so yeah maybe I mean you know but it will also be super fun yeah I'd have a good time yeah guys jump in on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think with that being said let's uh I mean that that judge like the way he laughs and smiles and like poses for the camera and shit like like it's disgusting dude have you seen his workout pictures yeah this guy's a piece of shit these listen these people are pieces of fucking shit he looks like one of the old men that would be like but ass naked blonde low dry on their fucking balls he looks like he's already cut his dick off that's what he looks like to me he looks like a dickless old piece of shit that needs that needs to honestly go through the wood shipper that's what the fuck that guy needs and anybody who anybody who falsely prosecutes someone for any reason whether it's Trump or anybody else deserves that treatment that's the whole reason this country was fucking founded bro the people like that are the whole reason that this country exists and here they are and we were warned about him right guys jump in on the comments below let us know what you guys think with that being said let's keep this crews moving set over to the

section it got me all heated up guys just keep this cruise move we got to have that number two let's dive into it more ass kicking headlight number two reads election night live wire Trump looks for blowout against Haley in their home state of South Carolina this was brutal yeah well this was brutal and I love how the the left side is covering this it's it's actually pretty interesting this headline from political reads Trump scores easy knockout of Nikki Haley in South Carolina former president's win which was so decisive that the AP projected him the victor solely based on a voter survey came in the home state of his only major Republican right of Nikki Haley's there is the the ending poll in the any results uh Trump at 59.8% to Nikki's 39.5 this is what the map looked like I mean fuck man yeah why's the weapon okay so I was trying to think to myself man I'm right because like right now she's the only fucking person in right like it like everybody else has dropped out I'm like why the fuck is she still in and then it clicked zero options mentality Nikki Haley listens to she listens to the show she's operating in zero options mentality right now they ask if they could come on the show did she really I swear I swear I swear I swear hey I told you what yeah you should yeah fuck man this lady's fucking wild yeah I'm not doing it I actually been asked a few times yeah I have been on I'm fucking doing it we don't have women on the show here no man like I don't get it though like and she's still not dropping out oh man fuck oh I'm sorry I'm sorry um but yes she's still not dropping out man I don't like what the fuck is why is she not why should I quitting are you asking me yeah like what do you think like I mean I mean like I said we talk about it guys we know that like you know and this is a common practice I don't I'm not saying it's necessarily bad or fucked up they do it you know but a lot of these candidates they're able to make money off the campaign trail uh-huh you know all these donors could come in they're dropping you know millions of dollars millions dollars through coming through these CPACs and and packs and all of this stuff you know when the campaigns over they're able to get a cut of that right and so like part of me is wondering like okay she's just trying to drag this out as long as she possibly can and build up a little nest egg for herself right but like at this point like I mean this is like a brood like she is brutally getting her ass whooped in every single fucking race yeah she's horrible it's like like I can't like I mean is do you think it's something more sinister like what what what's the deal here um I have two theories that I think are both and I would say one of them I'm like 60% aren't like if I had to say okay there's a percent I would say one's like 60% and one's like 40% okay so my 60% theory I was talking to AJ anomaly I'm gonna show a dreamer yeah and I fucking love AJ like dude you know he ain't everybody's cup of tea because he fucking tells the truth and he says what he thinks no matter if you agree with it or not and I respect people like that I like that because like we'll have good conversations and we'll disagree on things but it's not like hateful it's just like yeah I see it like this I like people like that I think that's what America's about what we need so when I try to figure things out and I think he's a very smart guy and so we usually you know at nighttime wolf sends some voice messages back and forth when shit's a little confusing and we were talking about this the other night and we basically had two theories that we came up with one which is my 60% theory his two I gotta get impartial credit because we talked through this together um and actually this was his theory my theory was the other one before the present yeah my theory that I had would be now after hearing his was probably the 40% but he he was like look if you go to Biden's ads they're once they're solely focused on Trump okay so Biden's got full guns put focused on Trump and Trump's got his guns focused on Nikki right now and when you when you're trying to fight two battles and you only have so much money you know that gets to be a problem so the theory is they're trying to drain his money as much as possible because if we look at what's happening in these court cases and this all this ridiculous shit it's very clear they're trying to remove his financial capacity to run for president because most of these big billionaire billionaire multi billionaire donors are Democrats and there those people are supporting Nikki Haley which should be a red flag to everybody and I think it is I mean look at the results that are happening right so that's the one theory they're trying to drain his bank as for as long as possible to create a scenario where he has trouble competing at the level that he needs to for the presidency but with that being said I think Biden's embarrassed himself so much and they've done such a poor job I don't know that that's gonna matter at all yeah so but I think they think it's gonna matter you know because that's what they're doing and you see what Biden's doing now now he's trying to create he's trying to make changes in the in like he gave the forgave for gave student debt right and for your shit he took fucking debt he's taking debt that other people owe and putting it on the taxpayer's shoulders he's not forgiving anything he's saying okay you don't have to pay the debt but your neighbor does the person who was financially responsible the person who went out got a job handled a shit pays their taxes they're gonna pay your debt for you for all these loser fucks okay that fucking aren't contributing to the world that's that's fucking bullshit environmental disagree okay he's trying to do this to them and he's also trying to make changes now with his border policy and all this shit and and and so like that tells me that they're very unsophisticated and what and they might be right like because the average voter seems to be very malleable they seem to be able to like if the media says you know this is a bottle of you know fucking moon juice like fucking then it is right like you could call whatever whatever and they just go along with it you could hold up a duck and say it's a goat and they're gonna say that's a goat so these people believe whatever the media is saying but that's becoming less and less and less and less every single day in my opinion so from their position I think they still believe that the media actually has the power that it once had which I don't think that it does I think that's a bad play on their part and I think they're using the draining of the finances to create a strategic advantage with the media that was what we talked about now the other thing would be is and this is this is very dark and bad but the other thing would be that they understand what's gonna happen they understand what the plan is because if you remember in 2020 there were all those CEOs that resigned at once remember that from the fortune 500 yeah and then remember also you had all these people on the news and these government personalities and these media anchors very confidently and smuggly saying there's no way Trump's getting in again he's not doing it I don't know how to I don't know what to tell you but it's not happening like they knew what the fuck was coming with COVID and so they're doing that again now with her okay they're they're sounding very smug they're sounding very it gives me the feeling that they know that there's something coming down the pipe and they want her to be in a position to take up the role if something were to happen to Trump and something were to happen to Trump could be they have another major disruptive issue plan which I believe they do you guys all know that I don't think I'm wrong on that you know COVID didn't really get cranking until the middle of March in 2020 and here we are not even into March yet and the the year has already been chaos so I believe they got they know what's coming they know there's something major coming and they know somehow it's going to affect Trump's status and they need someone to be standing there to take the role if possible and who better than somebody who is basically a Democrat that's running under a Republican label that's what the fuck she is and so it could be that event it could be you know and it could be even darker than that they could know that they're going to try to fucking kill this motherfucker you know what I'm saying and they need someone to stand in there because dude if you think that that's off the table for these people you're fucking we're way wrong you're what they've already done it to Kennedy all right Tucker reported on that on Fox news about the CIA being responsible for the assassination of John F Kennedy and literally like a week later they fucking fired them okay so you see some shit about he's they tried to assassinate yeah and rush stopped it I saw that I know I fucking saw that that's crazy coming out of where though yeah that's coming out of here I know I'm saying like the word like it was sent coming out of Ukraine the guys that was sent in came from Ukraine well he's on the death list of Ukraine bro there he's on a kill order yeah crazy yeah crazy so that's just so yeah but if it coming from Ukraine I mean it's coming from here exactly all right so those are the two strategies that I think are at play right now and I don't think I'm wrong I think it could be either one of those but that's what I think when you say why is she staying in that's why I think I think it's one of those two things she's either in on the bigger plan to disrupt and maintain the power base for these people I mean if you look at who's giving her money it's those people or you know the other situation where this is a more a less sinister plan that is just aimed to drain this dude financially make it hard for him to win well which is very really like it's very real because I and here's the thing because like I know a few of those those guys on this team and you know we we talked to a few of them I know the numbers doing private security you know last in 2020 when Trump was running he spent an average of like two and a half million dollars per week on those rallies on the travel just we have pure logistics yeah people don't yeah people don't know it's not free it's just not free yeah and so like two and a half million and that was just in 2024 well and think about an inflation it's probably more like four well think about this too Trump's getting most of his donations from the average American person right and they have intentionally sunk the economy to a place where people don't have any wiggle room either so that also plays out means even more yes that also plays into the idea that they're trying to choke them out financially so here's a half a billion dollar fucking lawsuit yeah but you know I I think it's 60 40 yeah you know and I'm saying that I actually don't even think it's 60 40 I think it's 50 50 yeah because I do think they're gonna do something big and I think they already know what it is and I think Nikki Haley knows what it is yeah maybe we should get on the show make a switch man I don't want nothing to do with those people you know what I'm saying I don't want nothing to do with these people these people are fucking scum like she's a warm-mongering fucking grifting she's a bad team the fucking yes in the wind bro yeah and she stands there and changes her name and pretends that she and then and then when it suits her now it's there's racism like she's a fucking chameleon bro and she says she's look I'm of the opinion that none of these people are the solution that's my opinion I'm also of the opinion because I am I don't know somewhat intelligent that when presented with a number of options that are shitty we should pick the best one and then try to work up from there okay that's how a smart person thinks about things you get option A that sucks option B that's sucks too but it's a little bit better than option A I'm gonna go with option B all right and then I'm gonna try to get to a place where there's more options than that which are a little less sucky now I got option A1 and option B1 and they're both better than B but they both still suck they're not ideal I'm still gonna pick the best one this is how successful people navigate life they don't fucking say I'm not gonna vote because it's not what I want or I'm gonna storm out of the store because they don't have what I want like a lot of people in America right now are literally just low IQ people when it comes to their ability to navigate decision making processes and it's not their fault because they haven't been taught these things growing up they've been taught things like you know fake gender shit and like all the social initiatives instead of thinking or instead of being taught how to actually critically think their way through situations and it's not so it's it's intentional yeah and it sucks because people have a hard time understanding that but when I when I think of the solution to this country I don't think the solution lies in a 70 plus year old male I think the solution isn't like a 50 something year old male who's built real shit who's actually still young enough to lead who has credibility who is a patriotic American who still remembers what America's supposed to be like and we need to get all of these old people out of our system that's not going to happen in 2024 but that should be the goal for 2028 and beyond the goal should be to get all of these old corrupt people who have spent their entire lives pillaging our livelihoods out of the system and then fix the system so that the people behind us don't have to have that same problem that's what I think the solution is but right now that's not the options we're presented with yeah the option we're presented with it currently today is Joe Biden or Donald Trump and that's it and and we're seeing the culture shift because we're seeing ice cube and Snoop Dogg and Michael rap a poor these people who fucking by the way they love Donald Trump before he was president then he became president they all got brainwashed and now they're saying wait a minute I was wrong and I respect those guys for doing that I think Michael rap poor says some annoying shit so do I okay I think Snoop Dogg and ice cube were very I think they care about black people a lot and I think whenever they care about black people they're gonna tend to lean towards that side of whatever the story is and if you go to those guys who care about black people and you say look at this shit it's fucking racist and you only show a little bit of it of course they're gonna be like well that's fucked up and so I think what's happened here is a lot of people because their own situation has become so much worse under this Joe Biden and this progressive shit and I think this is especially true with black culture I think people are waking up and they're taking a bigger look at the big picture you know what I'm saying they're saying wait a minute what really happened in Charlottesville did you hear Michael rap poor tell that fucking shit yeah I think it was on wasn't on PBD I think so yeah yeah it was on fucking bet David's podcast where he went on and said yeah man I looked at the whole story and I was wrong you know what bro that's American shit and like I don't have to agree with him on everything else in fact I don't agree with him on much but that's what Americans should do that's what real men do real men look at the situation at the whole thing and if they were wrong they say yeah I was wrong and a lot of people are doing that right now because the pain that they are feeling in their own lives is forcing them to take a bigger look because they can't stomach voting from to get more of what they're getting right now yeah that's a fact man that's a fact yeah guys jump it on this conversation down in comments I think I think that fucking I think that dude I think by the time November comes around dude this is gonna like I think all of black America's gonna be on Trump dude oh yeah yeah oh yeah because cultures but that's why they're trying to like broke cultures picking it up and the ones that don't the dude and the ones that don't pick it up are getting fucking destroyed people are awake dude no that's real shit man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline headline number three now this is where I foreshadowed earlier cultures changing and we're seeing some good shit happen so I would love to get you to take on this third and final headline headline number three reads you have C fan knocked out in massive brawl I saw this city event I saw this was great fucking amazing now I'm not like let's be we're not talking about actually one guy knocked out two people okay so let's give him some credit yeah I mean listen but but I think there's a a deeper principle here so let's dive into this so this is a Fox News article reading you have C fight night in Mexico city produced more than just knockouts inside the octagon on Saturday night video captured a massive brawl in the stands where one UFC fan was knocked out cold during the fight with fellow spectators it's unknown what started the fight probably over some surveyes but everyone in arena CDMX was locked in as several fans started throwing punches one of the fighters in the stands you get a whole bunch of dudes give them a whole bunch of beers and I think they're not watch people punch each other fuck your fight yeah they're gonna fight this is one of the fighters in the stands had his guard down as the fight seems to be winding down but as a pwn it tossed a left hook that landed square on his cheek sending him flying to the ground hey keep your head it's never been in the fight now you better listen there ain't no end on the fuck you keep your head in the swivel bro until they're 50 yards away and then you're still looking to see if they got guns like I'm about to get shot the fan eventually stood up again but was wobbling as a fight he got rocked you saw this right I got we got the right here's a clip it's kind of black shirt right here sit down bitch wasn't haha bro you know what the best part is though check this out look what's happening right now look what's happening right now it's over it's done everybody saying see that everybody saying all right we're all good you guys good we're good it's over that's fucking man shit in my opinion dude yeah that's what we're missing in the world because these young pussies they'll go get a gun or get a knife and go fuck with you bro you got your ass be it is what it is bro it happens it's done yeah it's done that dude got rocked out fucking rock if you watched that video that that saying guy in black sure rocked to do right before that both of them out yeah sign that motherfucker Dana yeah shit says during the fight there's no sign of security trying to step in and stop the brawl you have see president Dana white commented on that aspect of the situation here's his response this quote the crazy thing about that fight is when that fight broke out it felt like it kept going forever white said after the event quote I ran over there and I was watching it nobody stopped it I was waiting for security to come in I just let them go until it was over it's one of the craziest things I've ever seen the article continues saying white doesn't feel it's a bad look on his brand that the fight went into its conclusion quote I don't think it's a bad look for the UFC it happened and that was the end of it I think that everybody else saw that shit nobody else wanted to try that again no security the fight just went on until the fight was over I've never seen any shit like that in my life crazy and for the event itself Mexicans Brandon Moreno and yeah you're right regress were a part of the co main event that white put together right regress wasn't able to win its match against Brian Otega but who made him submit in the third round or you guys had previously won against Otega via technical knockout but Otega got his revenge in this time around yeah I mean listen it needs to happen let it let it fucking have I thought it was great let it happen I thought the best part was is that when it was over it was over yeah like there was no more there was no issue I know when jail nobody got arrested like fuck dude and I guarantee you both that was a camera watching the fuck and Tim minutes after that there would have been fucking beers I guarantee it guarantee I guarantee it I guarantee those guys all end up drinking beers together 100% man it's nice be makes me hopeful for the for the culture dude that's what I'm saying like I feel like we need to see this and like I saw a few articles trying to like you know talk shit on they always tried to do that the day in white they always though right but it's just like this is so important for society to not only see but understand okay yeah there's like it needs to happen there's no consequences here if you don't if you don't like what somebody says do something about it if you can't do nothing about it shut the fuck up yeah that's just how it needs to be it bro it's all these woke little pussies that cause this problem in the world anyway it's all these fucking people who who cannot fucking take any kind of physicality at all at all who are like you know this is why you get people with litter cameras sticking it in people's faces and shit you know but it's always the same people dude it's always the same little fucking soy boy weak like you know the wrong sperm won the race you know type dudes for real bro that it's like they look like they're barely able to be born like they're sickly looking you know they're probably all vegan protein deficient huh yeah like they're just fucking pussies bro and you don't see that's who causes the shit in society like oh what are you gonna do punch me in the face yes yeah yeah that's what would do bro according to foxes I'm a punch you in the cheek yeah yeah yeah no shit yeah it's gonna fucking hurt hey I like that no you're what I like what they did no I thought it was great I thought I listen I love to see more of it man like if you can't you know if you can't defend like bro that's a fun of me bro you start punching people in the face that come up and fucking uh you know shove a camera in your face like these guys all like to do they'll stop doing it that's real shit let's people putting cameras in faces yeah right night you're right they take their phone delete the shit walk the fuck

I've got my ass beat real bad and I've been knocked out I've got I've got my ass beat a lot that's why I'm not afraid to get a beat that's why I also know I ain't that tough you know I'm saying like

necessary you know fuck everybody needs to learn that you gotta learn where the line is have some respect it's important yeah it is it is fucking important guys tell us what you guys think on this topic let us know down in the comments do you approve of this fisticuffs for everyone huh 2028 this huh that's my fisticuffs what's that what's that that's a that's a saying that another ghost busters no man that's just a saying they probably don't say it in the black neighborhoods and I never say shoot people yeah yeah yeah but out here in the white areas we say fisticuffs yeah we just say get the

the lost arc fucking what's that one the one where they fight the Nazis the last crusade bro these are great movies and they shot them with cameras like dude how do you feel as a video like you like those movies the movies they actually shoot versus the new shit yeah I'm a big fan of like the practical stuff yeah it's it looks way different when you watch it to yeah I've never been a fan of the CGI stuff yeah I'll watch it like here and there for like popcorn like you know just whatever yeah I prefer the yeah the good real movies you like the POV style that's right yeah all right let's move on hello Keith man hello hello you guys let's get your final segment as always we have thumbs up with dumbest fuck this where we bring a headline in we talk about it to get one of those two options hey when are we doing this fight between you and Syed this boxing match what are we doing this funny you say that because I got some India shit here all right cool let's go let's go talk shit about them yeah I thumbs up a dumbest fucking head I reach private lunar lander sends back first picks from its moon landing somebody else's on moon so a privately built spacecraft on the moon that's still the funniest moment ever oh it's great I got the video hold on you got the video I brought about of our clips on the funniest moment ever of real a f is right here with 7 to 11 like this shit in it let people see it before we even get into this shit put them on the bike you gotta verify this because you're our official contact to India okay all right I might not be well informed but I will do my best that's okay you know more than us all right so let's show them the video have you seen this yes okay you've seen it is there real you can see it on the screen there's something module I'm not sure I'm not sure the image that's being getting circulated everywhere on social media that's definitely AI generated yeah for sure 100% so here's my second question what's the first business you think they'll open up say it definitely is 7 11 yes yes all right miss a privately built spacecraft on the moon is being back new photos from the lunar surface showing the vehicles much celebrated to sit in the moments immediately after touchdown when it tipped over on its side the Odysseus lander built by Houston based intuitive machines landed on the moon on February 22nd making history as the first commercial craft to reach the lunar surface and the first US spacecraft on the moon in more than 50 years the following day intuitive machines that Odysseus have pitched over when it touched down near a crater called Malapart A close to the moon south pole companies company officials said the 14 foot tall lander was operational but that some of the spacecraft antennas were pointing at the ground limiting its ability to communicate with flight controllers back on earth and an update Monday intuitive machines said it continues to be in contact with the spacecraft adding the flight controllers quote intend to collect data into the lander solar panels and no longer exposed to light companies officials said that based on the positions of the earth in the moon they expect to be able to communicate with Odysseus until Tuesday morning the lander was initially expected to spend about a week collecting data on the moon before lunar nights set in and the probes lose power so here's the picture that they sent back come the fuck off bro listen this is what this is what they say is such bullshit okay point being that's why like do listen they're fucking like why what what would what would be the points of continuing to do the shit like this because they're trying my opinion they're trying to convince people that they have already done this mm-hmm go back to this do you really believe that India sent in America sending these fucking they look like they're made out of aluminum foil like we got a bunch of Reynolds foil and crumpled it up into you know what I'm saying yeah I'm gonna stay went through space just as much as you know all the space weather space weather and navigated the space weather with its space sails captain jack sparrow piloted the craft onto the lunar surface yeah it's just like a reminder me of India's landing on the moon yeah they're stopping got a space slurpy on the way yeah yeah I'm gonna watch this clip what descent which is going to be the vertical descent phase or the local navigation phase jeeha we ask you this fine breaking waste stop who's shooting now jeeha we're fine breaking waste who's shooting now those guys just closed their 1000 fucking sails bro who's shooting who's shooting the pictures I don't believe any of these fucking liars why they lie because they want us I don't know now listen this is my theory they don't want us to discover the parliament listen that's what it is real shit though like they're listen there's either something really really fucking bad on the moon or there's fucking nothing or it's made up it's like one of the other you know I'm saying or we're living in a simulation if hold on if we go back to my childhood and assume that they have the technology that they had now the entire time how hard would it be for them to effectively create the reality that they created to appear as if it's changing evolved into what it is now do you even understand what I'm saying I don't think I'm high enough hold on I feel like I hold on yeah I was born in 44 fucking years ago okay they have the same technology 44 years ago that I have now that that we have now and they were able to create this simulation this entire time to make it feel like I was actually growing up in the real world very similar to what they do in the matrix listen man I don't know I'm gonna tell you this real shit everything I've ever focused on my thoughts and my whole entire life has happened in reality like it's almost bizarre it's almost like like dude you've seen it now I've seen it happen in person I have seen like what you think I just have some special skill that no one has I think we all have it yeah they just don't tell us that we have it and like dude we I don't know there's stuff we don't know I'm just gonna say that when you become present here's what I do know here's what I do know these motherfuckers they go shit to the fucking moon I know that so you become president you can be classing all I don't I mean dude I don't I don't I don't know man I just don't I think we are so far off base with what we actually know and what we're at and what we're told by these people and if you think about the way they behave the last few years they do everything they can to control us in every single way possible and how long do we how how do we know they haven't been doing this the whole time how do we know they haven't been doing this for a hundred years or 200 years how do we know yeah we don't I mean it's just weird shit to think about we don't know you know what I'm saying scared to think about I don't know man so what's this good this is bullshit I don't believe this for a fucking second I don't believe this for a second go back to the india thing play the clip all right stop it right there there's not a single person listening to the show they can look at that and say that looks real that doesn't even look as good as a fucking regular video game that is on the that is available right even even the picture of like the live feed from the camera and hold up what do they do did they send another pod satellite or camera satellite or something to shoot that image or I don't know if that it's obvious it's like CGI shit is it yeah but I mean they're they're portraying it as real shit I mean because like even this is apparently the picture or is that a sea is that a CGI simulation that they're portraying reality with I think that's what they're trying to do yeah I think that's what the trying but like they're not passing that office real no but like that passing that office real that's not real either that's not real either yeah I don't know man and they look they look pretty fucking happy doing it well they hit their quota does that not look like a fucking call center am I what is that racist is it not true does that look like call center to you does anybody in here disagree that looks like call center does anybody on the internet disagree that looks like that's a fucking call center name calling space man calling through about your NASA warranty no bro that's a call center like brother pack pack pack pack all right and those PCs are like from fucking like 2000 bro who fucking now you're in getting a space on that shit anyway it does look pretty old bro look at the screen look at the mouse Joe what wires on his keyboard from that's a 97 that does look like a 97 keyboard the my the mouse does too when was the last time you saw a wired mouse bro look this is what a mouse look this is like 224 mouse right here that's mice that's 224 mice this is what that's my this you can get to space on this one that's yeah that's right like there's no you get in this space on this my fuck probably nothing else to the fucking moon fucking you pay like 10 grand for that thing you know that yeah that's nice that's not a mouse that fucking thing how much was that thing for real was that was that was that over a hundred thousand dollars that's like good deal it's not bad well then if that's a hundred those are free well they make it shit themselves bro oh man all right well that's dumb as fuck yeah that I agree yeah oh god I suppose anyone that believes that we went to the moon and if you make your mad I'll give a shit fight bro do you reason yeah we flew a fuck bro and the other side of the moon landing makes way more sense which is does meaning that we were in a cold war for the morale of a nation yeah and we were in a race with the Soviet Union and whoever got there first was going to be seeing globally as the leader of technology right it makes way more sense that these guys said fuck I don't think we can let's just fucking fake it and did it we did it yeah that made other people were actually trying though yeah I think I think they were but I think I think it's an impossible thing to do and if you actually look into it there's there's like an asteroid belt that is you have to navigate through all kinds of different shit dude it's very it's not just go there so from what I've seen and look man you know I know people every time I say a people are like bro you're insane but doesn't it make sense doesn't it make sense that we're in a war for positioning global positioning of dominance and technology and authority and super power status for us to say fuck it we're gonna go out on the fucking back lot and we're gonna film some shit and tell every motherfucker it's the moon landing what I mean why the fuck would they not do that look what they did during COVID look at the amount of data they lied about during COVID look at all the deaths that they said were from COVID when in reality they were just PCR tests that were cycled up to the point where they showed a positive I mean vaccines got rolled out dude this is what I'm saying like these people are willing to lie for anything and so I think it's a lie that's my opinion all right well guys Andy yeah don't be a hoe shut the shop
