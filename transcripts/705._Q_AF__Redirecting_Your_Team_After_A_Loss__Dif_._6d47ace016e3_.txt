Now through the week we're going to have different formats of the show. Their shows within the show. Okay, tomorrow you're going to hear CTI that stands for cruise the Internet. Cruise the Internet is where we put topics on the screen. We speculate on what's true and what's not true. We try to figure out what's really going on and then we talk about what we the people have to do to solve these problems going on in the world. Other times we're going to have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes. I mean, giving you some real talk and then we have 75 hard verses.

You get them for free at episode 208 on the audio feed. Now there is a book called the book on mental toughness available on my website. Andy for sell a calm. It will go through the entire live hard program plus 10 extra chapters on mental toughness why it's important how you can apply it and how you can use it to build the life of your dreams. There's also some case studies in there of some very famous people they talk about how they use mental toughness to get where they're going.

Like we would put the internet up there and we just start talking about it. All right. Yeah. I'm down with that. Yeah, we just start doing that. The fuck are you talking about? Where do you think I actually do my work? I do before I come here. Before we start playing out of new. Yeah, before it started playing out.

Let's make people better, man. That's what we're here for. Hope you guys are having a great start to your Mondays. I had a great weekend though. Yeah, weekends fire. Yeah. Guys, Andy question number one. Hey, Andy, how do you redirect your teams after a loss? My team for the most part have been grinding and working towards our goal for this grant for the last six months and just plainly it didn't get it. I've been scratching my head trying to figure out where we went wrong, but man, I think for all of us were just kind of mentally drained right now. What have you found to be the best way to redirect and recover to move forward for the teams? Well, look, this is going to happen over and over and over again. There's going to be a number of times through your business career where you're going to work very hard towards something. You're going to have your team put in a lot of effort into things and it just doesn't work out. That's called entrepreneurship and business. There's a normal thing. And it does suck the wind out of your sales, right? When you have all this investment and all this time and all this energy and all this money invested into a project and the kind of fizzles and doesn't work out the way you want it to. It can be completely demoralizing for everybody, but it's up to the leader of the team to come in and remind them that this is the way it goes sometimes. Okay, just like sports, just like any other competitive endeavor. We're going to have situations where we put all of our practice time, all of our effort. We're going to train hard. We're going to eat right. We're going to do everything that we can. And we're still going to lose the game sometimes and that's the reality. So the best thing that you can do is to walk in and say, Hey, guys, I know that we've put a lot of effort in. I appreciate. I'm very proud of the effort that you put in. Nobody here was an anchor in the boat. Everybody here was doing what they could do. It just didn't work out. What do we learn through this process? And then I start writing on the board. I say, I let them have an open forum. What do you think we learn? One person raised our hand. We learned this, right? I write that on the board. That's a good thing. What else did we learn? We learned how to do this? Okay, that's a good thing. We learned how to do this. Okay, that's a good thing. Now we learned all these new things as a group as a team. Let's figure out how we can apply a moving forward because let's not forget guys that we have this bigger mission that we're working on. And even though this didn't work out, we still have this to do. So let's put this behind us. Let's chalk it up to a learning lesson. We all learned. We all got better. And now let's move forward on this and automatically shift their their wallowing or their, you know, feeling bad or their negative feelings towards the situation into a new mission as quickly as possible. Because if you let them wallowing it or soak in it, it makes it worse. It festers. It starts to get infected. And then you develop things like, you know, cancerous people in the organization who are like, man, you know, we did all that shit and it didn't work out. Well, fuck, dude, that's how the business works. That's part of the deal. So the main thing you got to do here is you have to acknowledge them for the hard work they put in. You have to take inventory of the lessons that we learned. And then we have to pivot into a new mission immediately. Okay. So once we say, hey, that was yesterday, the loss is over. This is what it is. We're going to move forward here. And interestingly enough, the same formula applies when you have a big win. All right. When you have a big win, you're going to go in there and you can say, all right, guys, good job. We won. What do we learn? We learn this. We learn this. We learn this. We learn this. We learn this. We learn this. Okay. Now realize we can't ride that win. We can't sit here and say, oh, we did this one time. That's just part of the bigger mission. All right. We have this big mission to do. So from today on, we're going to focus here. So the process of addressing a loss or addressing a win is structurally the same. Right. Acknowledge the work, take inventory of the lessons, redirect into the mission and move forward from there. Does that make sense? Very perfect. Yeah. When you talk about specifically on the lost side of things, right, acknowledging the hard work, you know, like in this case, because it sounds like two things can be true at once. Right. Like, yes, you guys worked their ass off. But still another, the other team was just better, right? Or whatever they do. There's lots of things that can happen. Man, I mean, look, sometimes it's not even better. Sometimes in business, it's, you know, you're working on a grant and the other guy at the company is uncles on the grant board. Right. There's things like this. So there are, there are things that are out of our control relationship wise and business that sometimes, you know, we can work very hard to be the best option and still lose. And that's not very often. But it could happen. And what I'm saying in the reason I'm bringing this up is there are things out of our control that could dictate what I'm saying. We can look at the state that could dictate whether we win or lose. But we have to control a week at control the best of our abilities and present the best possible outcome that we are in control of. Yeah. So, so with that on the, the, the acknowledging the hard work in a loss environment. What does that look like specifically? Like, I mean, is this a restored or the fucking pizza party? Are we doing a dinner night? No. We're, but we don't, we also don't really do that when we win. It's a 24 hour rule. Okay. There's a 24 hour rule. You have a 24 hours to feel bad about a loss. You have 24 hours to feel good about a win. After that, we're moving forward. All right. So, you know, no, there's no formal pizza party. It's, it's very simple. Like, hey guys, I really appreciate everything that you've done. We worked really hard. I know, you know, you might want to point out a few key people that led that part of the world. That led that part of the deal. This guy did this. You got to this. You guys did everything you could. I know you did everything you could. Sometimes things don't work out. And that's the way it is. And then you move into what do we learn? And then you move into what we're going to do next. And it's the same thing when you win. The process is identical, dude. The problem that most people run into here is that when they lose, they soak. And then when they win, they overcelebrate. Okay. And both are equally as harmful. Because what happens is when you soak, you start to believe that you can't do it. And things are really bad. And things get way, you know, things are made way worse in our minds. And we become ineffective. All right. When we win, we think we're better than we are. And we ride that win so long that we also become ineffective. So either way, if you give too much time or too much attention to the win or the loss, you lose the ability to stay effective. Does that make sense? That's perfect. Okay. So we want to we want to acknowledge the effort, take inventory of the lessons, pivot into the new mission and make sure that the loss or the win is only talked about or celebrated for 24 hours. That is the formula for addressing and getting people pivoted back on the path. Because dude, this question is is very, very, very close. Like if you just substitute the word big win and for big loss, it's the same structure of how to handle it. Because if you let your fucking team ride on a win for six months during that six months, you're going to get your ass beat. Because there's business to be handled tomorrow. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's real shit, man. I love it. Guys, any question number two? Andy, I've been finding it so easy to just be like, I'm kicking ass. I'm so busy. What's the difference between being busy and being productive? Is busy, even a word that you use? Is that a word that should be used? The word that amateurs use. Amateurs take pride in bragging to everybody about how busy they are. Hey, man, what's going on? Oh, fuck. Dude, I'm so busy. I'm so busy. Okay, like what else is going on? Fuck, I don't I'm just so tired. By the way, people who do that and the answer like that, keep those fucking people away from you. Okay. People are cancer, they're negative, they're in their feelings, they're fucking look at for sympathy. Here's the reality. We're all fucking busy. Every one of us is busy, but only a select few of us is actually effective with the business that we concern ourselves with. All right. So it doesn't matter how busy you are. That is not a badge of honor. There's no badge of honor. There's no award. There's no championship trophy for who the fuck the busiest is. That's just what weak people say, unproductive people say to deflect from their lack of results. Okay. Now, if you ask someone who is actually producing results, how things are going, they're going to answer like this. It's great, dude. We got this going. We got this going. We got this going. They don't talk about the time that was put into it. They talk about that. They talk about the actual results that are being produced or the seeds that are growing that are soon to be harvested. All right. So it's two different mentalities. Losers fucking concern themselves with being busy. Winners concerned themselves with being effective. That is it. So remember that when you're dealing with high level people, like if I walk up to someone, I said, hey, Steve, how's it going? Fuck so fucking busy. How much time you got your brother, I fucking running myself to the boat, fucking exhausted. I'm going to be like, fuck, I'm never talking to that guy again. You know what I'm saying? Like ever like I'm not doing shit. I'm not doing business with them. I'm not fucking hanging out with them. I'm not doing shit. If I go talk to, you know, Bob and I say, Bob, how's it going? What's going on? Oh, bro, it's going great, dude. We got this going. We got this going. We got this going. We're kicking ass. This, this, this. These are moving well. He doesn't concern himself with how much effort it takes. He concerns himself with what result is being produced. Okay. And that is the difference between winners and losers. Winners fucking look at the results being produced. Losers concern themselves with how much time they were spending. They're spinning their wheels. They're, they are being ineffective. They think that there's some sort of an award for talking about how busy they are and how tired they are and how exhausted they are. When in reality, it's a good thing. In reality, it's a completely different language to what winners speak. Winners speak in terms of effectiveness, losers speak in terms of busy. So remember that the next time you start to rant about how busy you've been. No one fucking cares. The world doesn't care how busy you are. The world doesn't care how much work you had to do. If you have to do that much work and you have to hear that busy, it means you're fucking not very skilled because highly skilled people will produce results with less effort. That's the point. So if you, if you find yourself in a situation and you're not going to do it, you're not going to be having a situation and by the way, when you're just starting out in business and you don't know shit, you're going to be busy because you have low skill. But as you move and your skill gets acquired and you gain more and more and more skill, the time invested to produce the result is less, less, less, less, less. Like for example, 20 years ago, someone called me and said, hey, we got this problem. I will fucking sit there all day being like, fuck, I don't know what to do. I just fucking do this. I don't know. And I, you know, sit there and think about it all day and busy myself to death about trying to solve this problem. Now I've been doing it for 25 fucking years. The same problem is they call me up. Hey, we got this problem. All right. Do this. This. This. Go back to what the fuck I was doing, right? That's the power of having experience. That's the power of becoming skilled. And that's who you want to be. You don't want to be the busy guy who accomplishes nothing. You want to be the effective guy that can be effective in the shortest amount of time possible. And then if you want to and you want to apply all that energy, think how much more productive work you could get done if you were busy and effective at the same time on the backside with a lot of skill. And that's where the true killers live. The true killers stay busy and effective and put in maximum energy. You could be very successful though. Just being high skilled and not putting in that much energy as well. So it just depends, man, on how far you want to take it. Like for me, I invest all my energy and I'm highly skilled because I want to fucking dominate. That's what I want to do. So, but not everybody wants to win at that level. People, you know, people have different levels that they're comfortable or where they want to go. And I can respect that but choose for you. That's what's required. Yeah, that's what that's what I, that's what I want to do. I'm built for that. Yeah. But the thing is is like, dude, bragging about busy and talking about how busy you are, you're just indicating to everybody else that you're a fucking amateur. That's the truth. Okay, nobody cares. The world doesn't care. The world is ruled by results. The world is not ruled by effort is ruled by results. So if you can't produce the results, it means you lack skill. If you have to put in a bunch of effort to get something done, it means you lack skill. The more skill you gain, the less energy it takes to execute, which produces the result. So it's like a sliding scale, dude, when you first start, takes tons of effort because you don't have skill. Later on, 10 years down the road, you have more skill, it takes less effort because you already know the answers. You see what I'm saying? Absolutely. So that's how you want to do. And then if you want to get to the to the elite, you have high skill and high effort. Yeah, I love it. Let me actually this because I feel like this also leads into a topic of just just very simple self talk, you know, and the language that you use on a daily basis, right? What have you seen? I guess, you know, in your 25 years of words that you used to use back then or self talk conversations, you should have back then that have changed outside of just this busy versus being productive conversation. What like how do winners talk? How should they be talking versus how I think the biggest difference between people who win and people who lose is that winners expect to win. Winners are not surprised when they win. Like when I win, I don't like celebrate overly celebrate because I fucking expected that to be the outcome. Yeah, all right. Amateurs, they, when they win, they're surprised and then they over celebrate. And like I said, when they over celebrate, they become ineffective because they're taking their eye off the game for way too long, right? Oh, I fucking won the I won the week this week. And then they talk about that one week for the next six weeks and the next six weeks, the guy who expected to win is still going just as hard. So it's an expectation. That's the difference between winners and losers that I think in terms of not so much their self talk, but just their attitude. Like when I set out to do a project, I expect to win. I don't expect to anything else that I expect to be the absolute best. I expect to win. It's a legitimate in my heart expectation. And anything that's anything less than that is a loss. And so people, you know, a lot of people like why don't you celebrate more once you take it, because dude, that's that's the result that I expected. You know, there's people who love to win and then there's people who hate to lose. People who love to win are usually people who don't expect to win. And it feels good for them. People who hate to lose usually expect to win all the time. And then when they lose the fucking and furious. I'm a hate to lose person. Yeah, because I expect to win. And I think that's the biggest mentality difference between average or less than average and elite performers is the expectation of what they're going to produce. Yeah. But would you also say to it's also the understanding of how a win is actually made. You understand that process of the inputs going into that right. That's why there's no surprise. Right. I know I know it's fucking too because I did one plus one. I mean, yeah, that's part of it, man. But but the other part of it is is the attitude of I'm willing to do whatever the fuck is required to produce that outcome. Right. A lot of people aren't wired that way. Like if I say I'm going to do X, like if I say I'm going to build the next fucking Nike, which is what the fuck I'm doing. If I say that, which I say it all the time, I don't think people understand what I'm willing to do to do that. Like I'm willing to do fucking whatever I have to do. If I have to go back to living on a fucking piss staying mattress for 10 years to get there, that's what the fuck I'll do. I'll do whatever's required. Doesn't matter. And I know that if I do whatever's required, that will be the outcome. But most people can't do that. Most people aren't willing to to to set their feet on the fucking line and say, bro, worth doing this no matter what there is no fucking options. This is going to happen. That's not how most people think. That's how I think that's how other big winners think. People who don't win and who don't win big, they say shit like this. Well, that would be really cool. That would be awesome. That would be awesome. And when I say shit, I'd be like, bro, this is going to be fucking awesome. Not it might be awesome. Like this is going to be awesome. You see what I'm saying? It's slight differences in how people talk. And as you get more experienced. You know, with entrepreneurship and business and just winning in general, you can really easily pick up on someone's mentality by the way they talk about things. You know, people will say shit like, oh man, that would be so cool if we were able to do this. And I know that guy's never going to do that. Right. But other people, you know, you know, I know that he's not because I do look. This is the most competitive game on the planet, dude. If you're not willing to fucking do whatever it takes, you cannot win at the highest level. You can't really win at any level. And so when people say shit like, man, I'd be really cool if we were able to do that. That's not a very confident statement. A confident statement is, bro, we're going to fucking do that. And not only we're going to do that, we're going to do that no matter what the fuck happens. And if we have to do this, if I'm going to sell my house, if I'm going to sell my fucking cars, if I'm going to go live in the fucking woods and a fucking tent, that is fucking happening. And that's how I look at things. And that's how all winners look at things. And it's a very, it's a zero option mentality. Once you decide where the fuck you're going, you are going to get there no matter what. And that is a big huge difference between people who win all the time and people who never win. It's just the expectation of what the outcome will be because they understand that they will do fucking anything to get it. And that's, I think that's a fundamental difference. Every win or I know every fucking one of them, they don't, they don't pick a target and then say, man, I wonder if we can get there. They pick a target. And then they start thinking, okay, well, how can I get there? All right, I got to do this, this, this, this. And then they go around the powerless play. Okay, they break it down into daily wins. Go listen to the episode, episode 16 will give you the whole, the whole playbook for free. They break it down. They take the big goal. They break it down into actionable steps to a daily basis. They execute those steps and they understand that they execute those steps every single fucking day. Eventually you get there. If you go out to dig a hole in the fucking ground and you say the hole is got to be 20 feet by 40 feet and you got a fucking. A shovel, a little bit of shovel, okay, a kid's shovel and you go out there and you start shoveling. It doesn't really matter how much you got done the first day or the second day as long as you kept moving because eventually the fucking hole is going to get duck. All right, and that's the same thing and goals, it's the same thing in business. You show up every day, you chip away at it, you don't quit and you keep going and it produces the result. And, and dude, that's been my experience. Everything I've ever said I'm going to do has happened because I'm willing to do fucking anything to do it. And, and I think that's the attitudes missing amongst most people. Most people just have the attitude of, you know, this would be cool if I could do this. And that's just not good enough. It's not, it's not firm enough. It takes more than that. Yeah, that's real shit. And I love it. I love it. Guys, Andy question number three. Andy, what's your outlook on the golden rule? Give respect to get it. I feel like in a perfect world, it sounds great, but I don't feel like that works in the real world. I would love to get your take on this. Is it true you have to give respect to get it or is it demanded? Is it is it something else? I think, I think it depends on where you are in life. I think if your whole entire fucking life speaks for itself, you automatically usually get respect. Like if you produce results at an undeniable level and everybody in the world knows it and you walk in a room, they respect you. Okay, the problem comes when all you motherfuckers who haven't done a motherfucking thing think that people owe you respect. They don't owe you shit. And what have you done to actually earn that respect? What is your track record? Where are you receipts? Well, oh, you were born? Oh, you're equal to everybody. So you deserve that respect. That's bullshit. Respect is earned through results. Respect is earned through commitment through effort through doing what you say you're going to do and displaying that through everything in your life. And then people will respect you. We have a whole generation of people who believe they deserve respect for breathing the fucking error. And that's the problem. And if you guys would stop worrying about how much people respect you or don't respect you and started just worrying about what results you're actually producing, you'd get the fucking respect you're looking for. But nobody's going to give you respect. Nobody owes you respect. And you need to get over your own fucking ego and realize that there's no reason to respect you if you've not actually done anything outside of basic human respect. Hey, how you doing? Nice to see you. You know, normal human kindness. I'm talking about in the business world. I'm talking about an entrepreneurship. A lot of these young kids. They believe that they should get this respect because they fucking went and filed an LLC and they're starting a business, bro, you haven't done shit. And everybody who's done shit knows you haven't done shit. They don't owe you shit. They don't owe you fucking anything. They don't owe you a fucking phone call, a fucking text, a fucking email back. Because you're not deserving of that. You haven't put in the work. You haven't even shown that you produced any results. And I do. I see this every once in a while, dude. One of these kids will email me or get my email. They'll email me. They'll email me three or four times. And then they'll email and I won't answer or it'll be DMs, right? They'll DM me three or four times talking about, you know, oh, I fucking bro, I would love to pick your brain over a cup of coffee. Mother fucker, you think I'm going to give away my knowledge over to you for a cup of coffee? I got 25 years of fucking knowledge and you want to sit with me over a cup of fucking coffee? That's so fucking disrespectful to say to someone. Stop saying that. But in my DMs and my emails, you know, hey, I'd love to connect. Hey, I'd love to connect. Hey, I think I could do this. Hey, I think I could do that. And I don't ever answer because I'm like, who the fuck are you? Okay, if you were, if you were able to do things, you say I know your fucking name. That's the reality. I mean, DM and you. Yeah. And dude, these kids think that like you owe them something. And then what eventually happens is they write some shit. You're now who I thought you were. You're fucking, you don't even send me an email back. Yeah, mother fucker, because that's the way it works. You haven't earned my email back. Go out and be produced some undeniable results become the best in the fucking world at what you do like I am at what I do. Okay. And then I'll fucking email you back. If I can recognize your name when it comes in and recognize your name in my DM, you want to do business with me, then we can talk. But until then shut the fuck up and go fucking earn your fucking respect that you think everybody owes you because you don't fucking deserve it. You haven't earned it. Yeah, that's real shit. That's my take, bro. Yeah. I just feel like, you know, there's a lot of, you know, I've been saying a lot more emails like this. There's a lot of just misconceptions, man. And I think it kind of just lends to the, you know, the work we do on the CTI side, right? But keeping this show clean. It's like, there's just a lot of misalignment with just how the world really works. Like it doesn't, you know, I'm saying like, and people will get out in the real world, man, and it really fucks them up. Well, that's because they've been raised in the idealistic atmosphere for 20 years. They've been told that just because you're alive, you're special. They've been told that just because you show up and compete, you get a trophy. They've been, no shit, they're entitled. They believe that because they're in business that you owe them your time and you do not. And unless you can display some exceptional value, which you probably can't because nobody will listen to you, you're not going to get anywhere with those people. You know, like, bro, you have to build your book. You have to build your list of results. You have to be able to tell them exactly what the fuck you've done. Exactly. Hey, I did this. I did this. I did this. I did this. I did this. I did this. I get fucking ripped that off for anybody right now. Bro, I got a business work 10 figures, got a business work nine figures, I got three business work eight figures, I got fucking two number one podcasts, two fucking categories. I created the world's biggest mental toughest program ever. You see what I'm saying? Like, if you've actually done shit, you could fucking, you know what the fuck you've done. It's impressive. And if I were to fuck like, bro, if I wanted to do business with someone, it really doesn't matter who the fuck it is. If I sent them an email and they see my name in there, they're right me back. Yeah, that's the, that's where you get respect. You get respect when you fucking earn the respect. And so yes, the answer to the question is if you're, if you haven't produced undeniable results, you have to give the respect first and you have to give it for a long time before you're ever reciprocated. I love it. That's the answer, bro. I love it. People don't like it. People don't like it because they don't, they want to be respected for doing nothing. They want to be celebrated for producing shit. They want to be told they're special. They want to be told their, you know, a delicate little snowflake. And they're the only one ever. And motherfucker dude, you don't really understand how many fucking emails from people like you, people like me get on a daily basis. Just like that. Yeah. And then they're like, well, you don't respect me. No shit. The fuck have you done? I mean, yeah, you're right. I don't because you have a fucking earned it. Do I respect you as a human being? Sure. If you were starving, I give you a fucking sandwich. I take, you know, that's not what I'm talking about here. I'm not talking about elitism as a human. I'm talking about in the hierarchy of business. A lot of you young bucks, bro. You don't have a scorecard show anybody. And the scorecard you do show someone usually is bullshit. And then once we figure out as bullshit, I get on the phone with everybody else. I know I say, I don't talk to that fucking guy. He's full of shit. You can self-destruct your brand behind the scenes without even knowing it just by being a dumb fucking emails. You think when you email me 17 times and then tell me off in the email that I don't fucking screenshot it and send it to everybody I know. I say, look at this fucking idiot. Don't work with that guy. You know what I'm saying? You show your two characters. Yeah, but everybody does that. Like you know how you like you know how many texts I get from like my friends and business locally and, you know, over the over the globe. Guys, you know influencers, fucking big big CEOs who are like, yeah, this fucking it. It's a scammer. This fucking idiot's this. Here's what happened here. And you get black balled out of the circle without even knowing it. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. A lot of you guys need to know your place and fucking operate there and be very respectful to the people ahead of you because the people ahead of you can make or break you. You know what I mean? That's real shit. Yeah, bro. Don't be pouting because you get the fucking attention you wanted from some big dog that you're trying to business with. That's you have to give the respect, bro. They don't owe you shit yet. You have to earn it. So yeah, you have to earn the respect. And by the way, if you are the big dog, you've also got to earn the respect. The man the respect. I don't come in here and demand respect. Actually, I think everybody would say it's the opposite. I'm in here taking out the fucking trash. I took out the fucking trash an hour ago. I'm in here picking up shit off the floor, straighten and shit up, helping these guys with the shit. There's not a person in here that could say, Oh, he demands respect. No motherfucker. I earn the respect every single fucking day with what I do. So it goes both ways. I love that. Is that not true? My lion absolutely true. I haven't seen a different than 4 1 1 2. That's what I'm saying. But dude, I understand that. I have to earn it from these people on a daily basis. If I don't come in here for the next 60 days, and I'm on my Instagram fucking on the beach. Guess what's going to happen? My respect level. It's going to go down. I expect a lot from our team, but I also give a lot to the same mission that they have, which, which there's mutual respect there. You see what I'm saying? I'm not saying that's not the thing that you just, Oh, I can be, you know, I can earn it this day. It is going to last fucking forever. No, that's the other thing. It's like a shower. Yeah. Just because you had it yesterday. I don't mean you have it today. It's real. It's true. It's the same thing with discipline, dude. If you don't fucking brush up your discipline today, just because you had it yesterday, it's going to a road. It's a perishable skill and respect is a perishable attribute as well. So you have to give it consistently. It goes both ways, but the reason I went off on that tangent is because it's a big problem with the younger people. Like you guys fucking think anybody owes you shit. Nobody owes you shit. You're done. Anything the fuck have you done? Fuck you. I love it, man. I love it. We want to do a little extra sauce. Yeah. Yeah, little extra spicy. Yeah. All right. Oh, extra extra pepper on the chicken today. Let's not go that far. You know, I like my chicken on season. I don't want to spice. I don't want to spice. Well, fuck you don't want to go like spicy shit. No, I don't like hot shit. Bro, you are the biggest. No, there's a difference. Spicy and hot are two the biggest pussy when it comes to spicy shit. So I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. There's a difference between something that means spicy. No, you're talking about. That's a different thing. Hot and spicy. Okay. I see what you're saying. But I don't like hot shit. I do spicy. Well, chicken curry. That's you know, I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. All spice in there. You know, old baby. I like my chicken boiled with no spice. I think it has something to do with my skin. Oh, no. You feel too, Joe? You guys were over here boiling our chicken and hot dogs. All right. Guys, any question up to four question number four Andy. I'm 17 years old. And I have my first job interview in two weeks for retail store in the mall. Can you give me some tips that would help me lock this down? I'm nervous. And I don't really know what to expect. What you got? Tell the truth. Go in there. All right. I'm giving you the playbook. It's very simple. Shake the man's hand or the woman's hand firmly. Don't crush it. They don't be one of these tours that tries to crush the hand. Nice firm handshake. Look up in the eye. Say, thank you very much for having me. Thank you very much for giving me the interview. I very much so appreciate it. When they start to ask you questions, you tell the truth. Don't lie about your skill set. If you don't have the skill set, say, look, I don't know anything about that. But I will, I will do anything you say to learn. And and and and present yourself as someone who's multiple present yourself as someone who is humble, who is willing to learn, who is willing to help, who is willing to do anything. Take out the trash, wash the sink, whatever the fuck. Whatever has to be done. I'll do. So I can learn how to be good at this. And if you have that attitude when you go in there. Because an interview, I've some, I've interviewed, you know, thousands of people and most people come in and they start bragging about all this shit that they know and how much they can help the company and fucking bro, it's, I can build a rocket ship. Yeah. It's dude. Bro, we just sell us some stuff. Bro, and you know, it's a lie too. It's not like you don't know it's a lie. Like that's the thing. Like this person that's interviewed you has probably interviewed fucking hundreds of people. So when you go in there and you start lying about what you can and can't do. And you start saying corny ass shit, you know, like they're going to know. So like my biggest piece of advice, man, is be respectful to the last question. Be eager to learn, be humble to admit that you don't know, but you'll do whatever it takes to learn. And then if you give you, you know, any assignments to learn, learn those and then try to be as prepared as you can before you go in there. You know, if they, if they sell clothing or electronics or whatever it is in this retail environment, try to learn as much as you can before you go in. But don't be certain about what you know. So, you know, when they say, well, what do you know, let's just say it's an electronics place, right? What do you know about iPhones? Well, I know this and this and this and this and this. But I, that's just stuff I picked up on my own. I don't know like normal training. Yeah. Yeah. These are just things that I read on the website and just be honest. You know, dress nice. Don't dress like a slob. You know, dress appropriately. Nice. You know what I mean? Sometimes like it, you know, if you're going into like a gym and you wear a suit as an interview, it doesn't really fit. Like you want to dress appropriate so you don't come off as a little weird. But I think the biggest thing is, man, you know, for a young kid is just say, hey, this is my first job. I'm here to learn. I'm here to get better. I want to I want to learn things and just be humble enough to admit that you don't know exactly what you're doing. I think that'll go a long way. Yeah. What was your, what was like your first like you're on a payroll job? I mean, I know you started business in 19, but I mean, I'm sure there was something in there. What was your first? Not really. I always play sports. Gotcha. Yeah. So I didn't have like a job job. Yeah. I did. In the jobs I did have. They were things I did like side hustle. Yeah. It's like mowing grass or going door to door or things like bra, my entrepreneur through and through. Like I, I am not a, I'm not hireable. Yeah. Could you imagine me fucking working for someone? Yeah. Yeah. I'm unemployable. So I had to employ myself. It's a fucking truth. It's 100% the truth. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. So like, yeah. Half of the things my way, man, and you know, in an employment situation, that's not ideal. Yeah. You know, people are like, they fucking frown upon that. So, you know, but, but, you know, but you know what an employee looks for that's the point. Cause I've been doing that part along. Yeah. Yeah. You know, so I like people who are honest, who, who tell the truth, who have a good attitude and are positive, who are respectful. And I think they're decent people. Who come prepared, who say, hey, I know this, but you know, that's just, you know, don't be too certain. Like you're an expert. Just say, hey, this is what I think I know. And I think that's a really good place to start. Quick follow up on that. Because I remember, you know, I had a bunch of like, I've worked for like all over the place. I've had, you know, experience in different places and different employers. I remember one time I was told that I didn't hire you because of your resume. I don't hire the resume. I hire the person. Yeah. Is that is that a, yeah, that's a good, yes. That's a good way to look at the process for people. Yes. I think you're much more likely to get hired. If you are an honest, good person versus someone who knows all the shit that, that rubs you the wrong way. I, I don't want to hire, I tell you who I don't want to hire. I don't want to hire someone to think say, no, everything. I don't want to hire someone that that comes in and presents themselves as overly, you know, knowledgeable about what we do because what I know is what I already know as an employer is they don't know shit about how we do things. I'm going to have to break them of all these fucking habits. Yeah. Okay. So I would much rather have someone who's a good person who's open to learn than someone who thinks they're super experienced and they're going to come in and do all this shit. When I know for a fact, they don't do it to my standard, right? Yeah. Well, they got deal with for the next six months. Well, at this place, this is how that's right. That's right. And dude, I want to let that shit come here. That shit doesn't even come here. I love it. Yeah. I love it, man. Well, guys, Andy, that was four. Yeah, guys, let's have a good week. Let's go kick some ass. See you guys tomorrow.
