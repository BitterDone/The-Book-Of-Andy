That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna cruise the internet. We have a very special guest on today's CTI a good friend of mine Miss miss miss miss is now I did miss is now miss is now when I met you was miss Now, why is it yeah, it's for you. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, that's on tempo now. I'm an old lady. That's right But this is Gina Bon tempo. How are you? I'm great. I'm happy to be here. Yeah, I'm excited to have you as well Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you for having me. So good time. Yeah, no shit We should be doing more stuff together. You're only like four hours away. It's not far. Especially the flight. It's only just like an hour Yeah, yeah, everything good with you everything's good, you know, summer's been great Yeah, it was just telling you before we started filming my daughter's turning two in October So it's a fun age, you know, just doing a lot of mom stuff. So it's good now That's awesome if you guys are unfamiliar with Gina Gina has What I think is some of the best content on social media and has had that for a very long time Especially around what's going on in the world women's health and fitness Give them a little background of you know sort of how you got to be here Yeah, I'll give the abbreviated version because there's there's kind of a lot I mean, so when I when I went to college and graduate school that's sort of when I got sucked into the the nonsense of You know the progressive left and I left now you went you went where'd you go? I went to Emory for undergrad and I went to Harvard for graduate school Okay, people I was like oh well you want to know I believe but I'm not kidding when I say some of the dumbest people I've ever met were at Harvard like truly like people that cannot function in day-to-day life And then after that, you know, I sort of like went on this wandering phase where I was this Intersectional feminist and I shaped half my head and I had blue hair. I did have blue hair Yeah, so you're a full blunt. I was full blonde. I like moved to Peru. I was like I hate capitalism Yeah And then I just sort of had I think like a lot of women did I had to sort of Awakening a turnaround moment in 2016 which I think was a really big year for a lot of people A lot of people woke up during that time a lot of people and I think that you know largely we have to thank Trump for that That's one of the great things that he did was he really pulled back the veil and I think the very first Thing that made me kind of turn around and think was that I watched one of Trump's speeches unedited and I was like Okay, we're being lied to I was like there's something going on here and at the time I was working as an editor and women's digital media And this was of course all leftist media publications that were like super feminists and And I was writing all this content about like fat acceptance and body positivity And so I had a really big turnaround in 2016 and I left my job in media like 2017 2018 And I sort of I stayed offline and I was kind of quiet for a year I was like let me just regroup here and I was just consuming a lot of content reading a lot and kind of bringing myself back to common sense You know, which you talk about a lot and in 2019 reprogramming yeah because I mean I don't think people understand when you're in these liberal arts programs It really is like an indoctrination camp I mean one of the first classes I took at Harvard was called race ethics in the US prison system And people were in class like crying over black people These poor black people, you know, and that's the kind of stuff that I knew somebody who went by they them in 2011 So I was introduced to this stuff really early on that's like the final boss That person has groted to the final boss. They're still here You have to beat them. Yeah No, it's just one So you was nuts back then. This was over a decade ago And so when I left women's digital media, I was like, you know, I was feeling I just couldn't in good conscious keep writing this content run. I knew I was seeing like editorial directors severely censored edit women's content so that they would like withhold important information when it came to women's health And so I left and kind of came back to the internet in 2019 Um, and I randomly reached out to Candace Owens and I was like I'd like to be on your show I know you don't know me, but you know, I was at the time I was a trainer in San Francisco I was like let's talk about body positivity because I know you hate it just as much as I do And she took a wild chance on me. She said yes, I was on her show in 2019 I went to work for her in 2020 Worked for her for a couple of years Really fun times worked really hard with her and then was it a lot of good stuff together Yeah, we you know, I was her first full-time hire and it was a really special time with Candace because She really is larger than life like, you know people what you see is what you get and she really is like She's kind of like you in the sense that when she walks in a room like you're just drawn to her She's so magnetic and she so charismatic So those years were really fun, but then I had my daughter and I always thought that I was gonna You know still work and travel with Candace and stuff and I just kind of looked at her I was like I can't I can't do it. So, you know, I quit to stay home with my daughter and you know I do some work from home now, but that's how I got to where I am now. That's the abbreviated version. Yeah, so You know, I think It's an incredible story. I think you know DJ is now it's time for your story about how you used to be one of these blue hair people Yeah This we talk about how I made DJ shave his head. We don't know about why You know the next episode Yeah, you did used to be on the left a little bit in you See no other way I'd define it like do that. I felt like I've always had More right leaning values. I just didn't know what to call Right like I mean, so you know growing up in a super blue deep blue environment You know, we're just told that we're a Democrat, right? Like and you don't question it like you say we you mean black people Yeah, black people I mean that's like that's what you're told like I even remember like in middle school They would do these like mock elections, right? So like when the primaries and the general elections were coming up they would run simulations in school Right, like they would set up a classroom with voter booths and all of that and it's like, you know, if you had any questions Like I'll just just put Democrat down choose anyone along with the beat like I remember that vividly and so like you know You just didn't question it, but um It wasn't until uh 2016 2015 actually for me, but that's when I got a chance to meet uh Ed Grayton's You know and and so I'm in you know the police academy and this guy comes in and he's awesome You know, he's awesome and and Eric Grayton's comes in. He was running for governor at the time and You know, that's the first time I actually got had any type of Opening to anybody outside of the Democrat party Right and this guy comes in and he's hot and he looks good. He's young and he's fit It's hot. Yeah, no, I mean, but like a good looking dude Yeah, right comes in like everything that because the thing is like when you think when I thought of a Republican back I thought like a not hot one. I thought of like no, I thought of like um Uh, like this guy like I thought of that, you know, I'm saying back then. Yeah, he's definitely not hot Eric Grayton's comes in and he's talking about you know, he's a Navy seal and you know all of this stuff And I see there's you know, he's a Republican. You excited. I did a little bit of yeah I did But uh, no, man He's like he's talking all these things all of these values like I said that I've always had I'm like, but is something's not making sense like you agree like we agree on the same things But why is yours you you should be a Democrat and that's how I thought and it was around that same time And I was just opened up and like okay, well, I have these values the Democrats don't have these values They don't align with what I believe why do I keep voting for for them? Right like it's a wasted vote like I should be voting with people why I align with then You know 2016 and make the same switch Well, I'm glad you did. Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah I'm on the right side now. Yeah. All right, so uh, you know how the show works right? Yeah, just throw up headlines on the screen Then we just have uh discourse about it. No, well, I got some good. We got listen. We got a lot of interesting shit You wait. I haven't been paying attention man. I've been busy See you always say that, but then you always know exactly what oh, yeah, but yeah, that's true Somehow I find a way to sneak it in right usually because people send me this stuff right right, you know Right now that's real man. Well, let's get into it. Oh, I feel like a lot happened the last couple of days a lot has been Happened a lot has been happening. We got some distractions dude. Yeah. That's what it seems like yeah a lot of distraction So we're gonna try to keep giving these people clarity. Yeah, and um Yeah, so guys we do have this thing we call the fee if this is your first time listening Please share the show if you get value out of the show To make sure laugh and make sure think it to make you uh, you know See things from a different perspective if you think it's interesting if you think it's information needs to be heard Don't just like the show don't just leave us a comment. I almost get the message out there. That's what's gonna make a difference So uh don't be a hoe sure the show let's get into it uh It happened again What it happened again, man, you're all here in headline. Oh, am I you're making you're making way you get famous? Oh, these are different lists All right, we gotta talk about it. So You know, you're you're not a new comment to being in scrutiny by the media. No, um, but here we are again This is not even a month I think last time was about a month ago. I think we're I know I think it's becoming more frequent It is yeah, but it's cool because like it it helps build me up. Yeah, well what was the last month you were in headlines for last month What was it it was uh it was 75 hard it was definitely was still 75 hard, but what was the take on it? There was just oh, it was dangerous dangerous danger. Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, I saw that It's been being lumped into this you know Anti-exercise alt-right fitness as fascists. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah So I thought let's just talk about it for a little bit here So we have this uh new york new york post comes out with this article Um, and the headline reads I tried the 75 hard challenge and was hospitalized for water ports Water is racist Like Come on man like so let's dive into this let's dive into this I didn't have to read very much more to know that You can't get water poisoning from a gallon of water Especially when you're exercising twice a day Okay, is she even drink a whole gallon though? Didn't she didn't even drink a whole gallon as she says she got water poison What do you mean the whole gallon well let's dive let's dive into them because we got a couple of things here So the article reads this is a new york post article reading She went too hard Michelle far burn began the 75 hard challenge nearly two weeks ago Uh, she followed the rigid guidelines which includes following a strict diet with no alcohol or cheat meals participating in two workouts per day and consuming a gallon of water daily for 75 days But it landed her in the hospital quote I think I have water poison fairburn uh said in a tick-tock on Tuesday quote. I don't feel good at all Uh quote. I don't want to fail 75 hard she continued Uh, and then says quote. I don't want to go back to day one. I can push myself through the workouts I can I'll just do the slow workouts Um, so after a trip to the doctor the realtor Uh was sent to the hospital due to a severe sodium deficiency after chugging a gallon of water every day for 12 days While an extra few cups of water doesn't seem like much fairburn is convinced her symptoms occurred after gulping down the better half of a gallon Too quickly potentially causing the water poisoning But here's the thing but at the hospital her blood work appeared normal leaving clinicians scratching their heads quote, I don't know. I don't know what it was she said But they said not to drink that much water So 75 hard article continues which is a mast Uh 1.8 billion views on tick-tock was created by entrepreneur and influencer Andy for salad. Hey, that's you Uh to test Makes for you an influencer. I don't know why that's funny. Oh YouTuber and you two supplement cell supplement cellar uh yes, so I graduate yeah To me do this is a big big step up. Okay. Uh, it's not the test mental toughness. It's to build mental toughness clarify this right now. I've been saying for years it is not a fucking Challenge you tick-tock mother fuckers have decided to call it a challenge because you don't even understand what the program is about There's a whole book about it. You should go get it and read it There's also a podcast about it that explains why it's not a challenge instead. It is a program It's actually a year-long program and 75 hard is just part of the year-long program Which is called live hard and this program has been used to change millions of people's lives for the better You may proceed. Yeah, well, I mean yeah, so the article continues says uh marketed as quote ironman for your brain Not a fitness program Forsella they fucked your name up there. That's interesting how they spell it right in one sentence and the wrong in the next sentence Top notch journalism right there super top But forsella swears His free skill here for scuba guy that's the other guy. That's a different guy. That was a pee bro. Those aren't my pants I'm a program Forsella swears his free regimen quote can change your life starting from the inside um Now like it's not just New York Post, right? You got insider They they jumped in on this the tiktok her was hospitalized during the viral 75 hard challenge that calls for drinking gallon of water day Okay, that's a factual headline apparently. That's the decent um People's magazine mom hospitalized after drinking a gallon of water a day for 75 hard fitness challenge Even health news.com chimed in 75 hard challenge since tiktok her to hospital. Hmm now again Let's go to let's let's see what Michelle Fairburn actually is saying So I think that that's important um and she's been making a few uh Twitter posts, but I got a couple here. Let's just watch these real quick um I think I have water poisoning and it is so real I don't feel good at all. I knew I didn't feel good when I was going to bed last night And then I woke up like several times in the night to pee and then I woke up today and like my muscles are just so weak I can't eat I've been on the toilet like TMI, but I've been on the toilet all morning. I'm so nauseous like uh, I'm just not so good, but An important lesson to always listen to your body. I'm doing 75 hard so I'm drinking like an excessive amount of water And I think I'm on day 12 stop right there A gallon of water is not excessive for someone that's training two times a day There's nothing there's no there's not a single bit of science that exists anywhere in the fucking planet It says a gallon of water is excessive Keep going. Yeah Let's continue though. So weak I can't eat I've been on the toilet like TMI, but I've been on the toilet all morning. I'm so nauseous like uh, I'm just not so good, but An important lesson to always listen to your body. I'm doing 75 hard so I'm drinking like an excessive amount of water And I think I'm on day 12 today. So I'm drinking like a gallon of water every day, right? I don't know what to do I don't know what to do if anyone else is doing 75 hard you've done 75 hard What do you do in this in this situation? Because I listened to his podcast and he basically said like obviously Listen to your body use common sense, right? Do I just not drink the gallon of water today? I mean I already have water poisoning This is all I'm eating today I can't eat like I can't stomach food so I'm just eating bread with like vegan margarine because it's high in sodium so I'm trying to like put sodium back in my body I've pumped myself full of like every vitamin you can possibly imagine Oh, I am ill. I am weak. Hold on so Is this before she went to the doctor? This is before she went to the doctor. She's pumping in tons of sodium to her out of her own Mal she's saying correct. Okay, let's keep going I don't know what to do. I don't want to fail 75 hard. I don't want to go back to day one I can push myself through the workouts. I can I'll just do slow workouts, but like the water is terrifying me. I cannot drink another gallon of water today When I'm saying this I know people are going to come for me and be like, yeah, I was doing bad But like I've challenged myself to do this and like I don't want to fail myself. So anyways People that have done 75 hard or know 75 hard. What do you do in this scenario? Let me know in the comments Okay, so that was pretty that was pre doctor pre hospital right now. Let's check in with the post doctor post hospital If I look rough, it's because I am I just left the doctor And now I have to go to the hospital So if you're ever thinking about doing a challenge that requires a crap ton of water Remember this video. I have severe sodium deficiency Okay, so in the previous video before she went to the doctor She's pumping herself full of sodium Then she goes to the doctor and the doctor says you have a extreme sodium deficiency with no testum Yeah, I would like to see what test was done for that. Yeah, no Well, how do we know that for the doctor said Well, we don't know that he didn't give her a test. No, she she said it. Oh shut it. No, she I haven't seen all the stuff. I'm just like watching this as I go Which actually can be fatal. So now I'm going to the hospital And they're gonna check everything and then apparently they can raise my sodium gradually Um, and I'm still gonna do the 75 hard challenge I'm not gonna give up but he says I have to drink less than a half a liter of water a day I cannot believe This is actually happening so A liter of water half the liter of what less than half the liter of water is 15 ounces today So so your doctor is recommending you go work out And drink 15 ounces of water per day Try that for a fucking like a week and tell me how that fucking treats you Yeah, oh shit guy you think you're in trouble now Also, she can't be that I mean, I don't know anyone who's about to go to the hospital and they're like filming tiktoks Well, let's just keep going like Let's keep going. We'll we'll break this down. Is it that bad? I mean, she has the wherewithal to plot the phone and film a tiktok. I cannot believe this is happening Yeah, it's also not good when you're severely a hypochondriac and do you think you're dying every single day And then you get told something like this. So anyways We're heading to the hospital and I'll fill you guys in when I get there. Okay Bye She's loving this She's enjoying it Well, so So yeah, so she goes to the hospital Okay, well, I mean Isn't this the culture? Exactly Yeah, I mean, this is where honestly this is where a lot of people and I mean you can't deny it Mostly most of them are women they find so much validation from getting on social media and complaining about this and that I just feel so sick and it's like You you must live a life of so much luxury That this is what you're getting on to complain about like your whole life is ruined. You have to go to the hospital I mean, it's just well, it's nonsense. Let's There's a lot to this. Yeah, there's a lot because like listen Face value on that that just seems like it's it right but the thing is though, dude I'm not gonna sit here and judge someone feeling sick or not sick Look bro, people get sick the program's hard. It's not called 75 fucking soft. It's not called 75 easy It's not for fucking weak people. It's not a diet challenge It's not something this should be done by anybody who isn't fucking serious about getting Significantly mentally more dialed in that's what the fucking point is okay And because TikTok has went made it a challenge you have all these people out there Who really honestly are so far away from even trying there the people who need the program the most But they're so far away mentally from being able to understand and comprehend what the point of the program is That they see it as a challenge and then you know We end up with this like water down bullshit, right? Which is the same thing that happens to anything in society You know, let's let's round off the corners and make it palatable for me But I don't like the way this is you know, so I'm gonna change this part of the program People don't understand that that Exact mentality is the reason that they struggle in life anyway because you don't get to change all the things you don't like about Anything in life you have to fucking deal with them and you have to push through them and There's a it's whatever like I the worst best thing ever happened was that it became a fucking challenge When it was meant to be a program because you had to deal with stuff like this I mean, but I think there's something a little bit more sinister here though because we do talk about all the time right like You know really have handy your voice We are speaking against some pretty high-level people yeah every day, right? And so I think it's kind of funny that when you look at these articles you look at you know, Lindsay Dodgson right you go to a profile. She's got pronouns in a bio She doesn't look like the epitome of fucking health Surely not you go to you know, you go look at Vanessa etanine right That he definitely doesn't agree with anything that we say on the show now, you know, look at her bio She got pronoun in her bio right or you know, you go to estnacolane you go pull her bio up She lives on the south side of Chicago where she is the deputy chief editor for health news her interest our sexual health women's health and the LGBTQ voice You know and then like I mean even furthermore just to wrap this whole so what you're saying is What you're trying to point out is is that all of these people publishing these articles Wouldn't be fans of our show. No No Yeah, by the way, you're all welcome to come on in debate anytime But love it. Yeah me too. Love it But the thing is you know, and even like the articles that they try to sort because here's the thing what most people don't most people will look at the headline And then that's it they don't really go in depth They don't really and that's why like what I hate about this stuff the most is how damaging the media can be trying to spin narratives and use it to Influence or manipulate people's opinions right because most people are not going to go past this headline Right, but and even if you do and you go into the articles and they'll oh, they cited they got sources cited like the headline He's got up. It says 75 hard challenge sends tick tocker to the hospital right like and we're talking about people changing their fucking line Mm-hmm, you know, and so if the establishment wouldn't want you to change their lives It makes sense that they probably be putting out headlines like this well, dude of course This is this is what we talk about on the show every day. Okay, let's let's break down the facts here. Okay, but Personal bias what I think All that shit aside here's the facts A gallon of water There's no fucking science to say that it can cause that all right secondly She talks in her videos About thinking she has water poisoning going to the doctor The doctor not being able to tell what's going on her going to the hospital and then the hospital running tests and finding Zero wrong with malony zero wrong with her those are the facts Okay, we could say whatever she whatever we want in my my personal opinion People like this are the people that need the program But you have to be ready to do the program and it's not a challenge. It's not fun It's very fucking hard and if you do it right it'll change your life And certain people aren't ready and they shouldn't do it and drinking half a gallon of water Trying to chug it is you know, is that going to be uncomfortable? Yes, that's going to be uncomfortable That's going to make your stomach hurt. That's going to make you feel sick Okay, that's why you shouldn't do it and you should actually exercise discipline to have the water spread out across the day Part of the program talk about a lot actually um, so anyway All that stuff aside the facts of the matter are What I just said and the media the real story here is not what she thinks Are her and you know, dude the program's hard between the days of 10 and 20 It's the hardest your sore is fuck your tired. I talk about this in the book I talk about it on the podcast too It's extremely difficult in that phase of the program. So a lot of people they they they get sore They get tired. They fucking fall off something happens This is a big weeding out of people being able to complete the program anybody's completely the program will tell you that I tell you that So The real story here is not her it's not you know, we could say people can say whatever they want. Oh, it's Dramatic or it's this or it's that right whatever. She's a hyper-con direct. She knows she's got Issues with that she admits it. I give her credit for admitting it. Okay. That's that's cool But here's the thing the media is now taking this story And making it into something that it isn't and the reason they're doing that is not just to attack me personally I know you know, we do have a strong voice We get a lot of a lot of views. It's I think we're changing a lot of people's opinions Um, and we're targets you get targeted in a bunch of different ways too. That's fine as well But the main reason that they're trying to attack this is the same reason that we talk about on this show every single day Which is they're working to create a compliant dependent Society that requires all of their goods and services that they are heavily invested in and Strong healthy mentally competent fit independently financially wealthy type person does not consume their product spectrum Okay, they want people unhealthy and fat because they know that those fat unhealthy people will consume their food products They know that those food products which are they're heavily invested in will actually make those people sick Which makes them require their medications? Okay, they they they propagate this crazy shit in the world as hard as they can because they know that it will create mental illness Mental illness requires dependency for most people on medication. That's the first place they turn you know So we have to really understand the purpose and this is the bigger story It's not about me. It's not about 75 hard. It's not about this woman and I'm sure she probably I don't you know I don't know if she likes this kind of attention or not because I know that a lot of people who've completed 75 hard They fucking get pissed off about this shit because it's changed their lives So I'm sure she's getting negative attention as well, which you know that's That's not what this is supposed to be about But the media and the way like Do you not think like I and you worked in media you might have some input here Do you think all these authors are in like a chat group because it's interesting that like they all come out with the same shit on the same day at the same time You're the same pronouns right and And they're all saying these same things, you know 75 hard is dangerous drinking a gallon of water a day will send you to the hospital and if you did you there's a there was a I was looking at one of the articles and one of the small print on the article actually said um So like when you share the article on the internet and I'm reading it It says it has a picture of this woman and it says I tried the 75 hard challenge and was hospitalized for water poisoning the fatal condition was a result of drinking too much water Amid an exercise street meant to last 10 consecutive weeks. Well, there's no proof of that There's no proof of that that that even happened, okay? Because she went to the doctor because she didn't feel good Her doctor told her go to hospital the hospital said we can't find nothing wrong The next day she's saying I feel fine. I'm normal. So She wasn't hospitalized. She went to the hospital. That's a different thing Hospitalized is like you're in the hospital admitted to the hospital. Yes So they're now taking this shit and they're twisting it into this damaging headline Which you know, I think probably is intended to damage us. It doesn't damage me because we do the shit for free I don't give a fuck um But the main thing that it attacks is the common sense Understanding that we should be healthy fit mentally capable individuals and so we have a propaganda machine that's being run by people Who understand what I just said about creating a dependent citizenship Who are looking to villainize health and fitness and Independence in any way because it goes against the system and the matrix that they've created So That's what I see that's that's the facts of what I see in the scenario Yeah, it's it's an intentional agenda and I can tell you from personal experience too It comes down from the editorial directors like they will they'll essentially tell a lot of these editors and writers what to write like There was a I had an experience where a writer that I worked with she was writing about PCOS and she put in the article that obesity can severely worsen PCOS symptoms and They went behind her back and they took it out and they published it so they they intentionally want to withhold important information when it comes to health Did you see this is probably a couple months ago CBS They shared a headline that said So research shows that you don't need 10,000 steps a day all you need is between five to 8,000 steps a day So and they shared this study and if you actually read the study It says if you increase your step range from five to 8,000 steps a day to 10,000 You you have a much better chance for to live a longer life like and the study you would directly went against with the headline said But every other news outlet picked up on it and it's like these are the kinds of stories that they want to share Those are the headlines they want people to read because there's a very intentional agenda to keep people obese Compliant because you also can't deny that obesity it lowers your cognitive function And so it makes you much more susceptible to brainwashing It makes you much easier to control you're gonna go along with anything they tell you A mega consumer of all the things that they're invested in especially when it comes to the drugs I mean, and now this whole craze with ozempic It's like this is the wonder weight loss drug. I'm like is it though? I mean, okay Somebody might lose 20 pounds, but they come off of it and they lost all their muscle from it They didn't really lose that much body fat And then they just gained the weight back But it keeps them in the system of big pharma and then a conventional medical system which are in bed with each other So it's like I mean you will you see things like this and you have to see it from the perspective of this is a big puzzle piece of this larger puzzle That includes the body positivity and fat acceptance movement The conventional medical system big pharma they want you to be very sick and not in control of your body in your life Yep, this is why I tell you guys personal excellence is ultimate rebellion it pisses him off Piss off that you become fit it makes a man agree that you become educated it makes a man agree when you become wealthy This is why all of these things are villainized. This is why they make you feel like it you know They put 400 pound people on the cover of health magazines and say this is healthy when every single fucking human being Out there knows that it's unhealthy everybody knows this is not about feelings by the way, okay You could be happy at 400 pounds maybe I guess I was 350. I was almost there and I could tell you this I wasn't happy at all and when I said I was happy. I was fucking lying That's just me now. Maybe some people are happy. I don't know But I know this it ain't fucking healthy and you're gonna live a shorter life and that's fucking science and speaking of science I have an article here that's published on PubMed from October of 2003 It talks about fatal water intoxication and fatal water intoxication, which is what they mentioned in their sub headline, okay? The The lowest amount for water and taxication that can be found in the scientific community is an elderly woman who estimated to drink two gallons of water Very small woman who was not exercising at all. That's two gallons Okay, that's the that is the lowest standard. I asked Lane Norton Who's a PhD and deals with all of this kind of shit all day long He's probably one of the world's leading experts on this and then I asked Dr. Gabrielle Lion who is His probably female counterpart, okay? She's probably the the the most knowledgeable female doctor about any of the shit that we're talking about I asked him both because I'm friends with them both say how much water does it take to cause water intoxication and The answer between both of them was four to five gallons Okay, and his exact quote which he even said he said quote me on this He said feel free to quote me on this. I find it extremely unlikely consuming a gallon of water could cause water poisoning To the same amount that I find it Extremely unlikely, but not impossible that Saturn has a teacup on his rings Okay, so there's my citations. I love it. Yeah, I do too. He tells the truth Okay, unlike these fucking people and I'm not talking about the woman I believe the woman probably drank too much water. She made herself sick That's that the program isn't really built for people like that and that's that if I were her I leave it to fuck alone That's it But the reality is these people weaponize these headlines to make you believe that drinking water will kill you That being healthy is dangerous and you have to start asking yourself why that is why is that why are they putting 400 pound people on the cover of health magazines? Why are they saying that that things that we've been taught and by science are whole entire lives that are unhealthy are healthy Why are they doing this the answer is this they want you to be a fat uneducated broke Supplicate compliant little peasant citizen So that you will consume all of their food all of their medication all of their data all of their streaming And you will make them tons of money and you will be a nice little peasant and follow all the rules and be easy to control And that's it and this is just that. This is examples of this Over and over and over again and any of these people that wrote these articles You're all welcome to come on the show you can come on together You all come and sit on a room together and think you can fucking handle me. You don't want that fucking smoke I can promise you that But you're welcome to come on open invite. Yeah, we'll settle down All right, well guys, that's a little intro. I'm just keep talking about me dude It just makes me fucking dude what they don't understand is that people understand this is bullshit And so what happens is you guys do this and it just builds me to fuck up. So I love it. Keep coming dude Keep it coming And I want to say this too. I never like to see someone not feel good or feel sick But listen, this is a hard fucking program You're gonna be sore. You're gonna be tired. It's gonna be brutal Your feet are gonna hurt real fucking bad It's gonna be hard to drink a gallon of water when you haven't been used to drinking it But when you're training twice a day, it's actually a necessity Okay, if you go drink 15 ounces of water like your doctor told you to drink If that's really what he told you and you try to train to you're gonna end up in the hospital for dehydration Okay, so Let's fucking have some common sense here. This is bullshit people know it's bullshit and the media They're I'm not saying that what she said. I'm sure she felt bad, okay But what I am saying is what they're making it into is total bullshit and like dude, you know I hope they keep doing it because it just builds the program Every time they run stories like this the fucking amount of people that start doing it is go goes way to fuck up So more people change your lives, but like it's aggravating because it's like bro Are we we we have to be smarter at citizens? We have to understand that we're being manipulated We have to understand that we're being groomed for a cause and This is just an example. This is like a perfect example now take this example and then think of it and every other media article that you read about fucking anything like think up because you guys a lot of you guys know the 75 hard program All right, you know live hard because you fucking live it There's there's literally hundreds of thousands of people listening this episode right now that fucking understand what I'm talking about Now think of the misinformation that's being twisted in this scenario and now apply that to every single news article that you read And then think about what you're reading Just think about it. It's a good example of that Yeah, I mean at this point any health advice these outlets put out just do the opposite of it. Yeah, just do the complete opposite All right, well guys, let's get on this cruise remember oh shit Literally yeah, I'm sure Remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com You can find them there Um more feel on youtube you can drop down in the description below and find those articles link there as well So with that being said our first headline of the show hell on number one And on number one reads watch Mitch McConnell freezes at podium as escorted away by colleagues This was brutal real this real this was brutal to see It was brutal fucking water intoxication Chugged again. I'm worried when up there makes it he must be on 75 hard. Yeah, I don't I missed that yeah So uh this is a bright bar article I'm reading Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell out of Kentucky inexplicably froze up during a Senate GOP leadership press conference Wednesday afternoon prompting his colleagues to pull him aside from a podium at the capital without finishing his remarks here is the video You Okay Mitch Is he else you want to say or should I go back to you? Do you want to say anything else to the press? Okay Okay, now no real quick all right I gotta get this in here. I know that face I know that face. I mean that kids band. I've seen that face a thousand times You've seen that face you know what face that is that's the face a kid makes from the shit in their pants That's the saying fucking face all right, but like listen for real. That's why I couldn't watch it I And it made it even worse because the news comes up he's like are you finished like Okay, all jokes aside, bro. All right McConnell Who is at 81 years of age is the longest serving party leader in the history of United States Senate? All right Um, and here's the thing so so they take him away. They escort him back I don't know if they gave him like a little boost of adrenal chrome or what Um, but he comes back out All right, he came back out came back out and then talk shit on Biden So uh, this is day-to-wire headline read McConnell freezes up during press conference trolls Biden after returning Here's you shit your pants more than me. My eyes is a little shit. Yeah You didn't Oh my god, it's the fucking war of the nursing homes over this bro bro I used to I had to do social service in a fucking nursing home So where I went to school in high school you had to do social service project. It was like a community service Yes, okay, but you had it was for school and that because I was like a fucking degenerate. Yeah Now I wasn't degenerate, but I didn't get caught being one So I was I just want to clarify. I heard about yeah, that's right Now But dude the old people in a nursing home fucking go at it. Oh, man They don't give any fucks. They all hate each other. They all talk shit like it It was actually fun because like you got to know all the feuds like I was genuinely don't fuck with my brother I had this dude his name was John And he used to be a magician in the like the 30s and he fucking I go in his room He showed me all these magic tricks. He'd be like, yeah, I don't show anybody here cuz I fucking hate And that bro and then he begged me to bring him a 12 pack of fucking beer Or remember I'm like fucking 15 16 years old fucking go by well, I stole it. I gave it to him That's real shit. I stole it out of a dude's garage and then you had to do community service Well, I figured if I was do a community service I might as well help this dude gets the fucking beers. Hey I'm a team player. Hey, I'm gonna help you make one of these beers disappear So now you know That's why I was that I shouldn't do a community service anyway. I did it. Yeah, but yeah So this motherfucker so they take him away. They bring him back and he starts trying to troll Biden Let's like another clip here's a clip for you guys pose for about 30 seconds during a news conference. Here's what he just told reporters The president called check on me. I told him I got sandbag. Oh nice. How are you feeling now sir? How are you feeling now? I'm fine. Have you seen a doctor or are you going to see any idea what happened? Huh any idea what happened? I'm fine. That's dehydrated Gotta watch those sandbags So Bro these motherfuckers are so old. We don't even know that we don't even get their jokes. Do you know what his nickname is? cocaine Mitch okay, yeah, I actually don't know why but every every conservative podcast I mean, I don't even know if it's just conservative as they call him cocaine Mitch. I don't know why either I don't know why I always wonder why but I think it's just a funny look at his face. That's cocaine Bro looks like the turtle off of finding Nemo That's the fuck it looks like Does he not Totally that's actually my favorite movie. Yeah. Well, that's my favorite character in the movie I hate Mitch McConnell for fucking out of 50 dude In studio I fucking love that movie favorite movie. All right, but for what like What do we got what do we got on this? Well, people some people were saying that Well, I read two things number one. They say it looks like a A TIA transient a scary Mini-stroke. Yeah, but then there were a lot of people that said that they have family members with epilepsy And they recognize that and they say it looks like a mini seizure So there's a third option still I mean that's a fourth option too I mean, it could just shut his face. Well, there's more options too Like we could be living in the actual matrix and we were witnessing a glitch Which the more that this shit starts to happen the more I'm starting to think like holy shit We're in a fucking actual simulation like they legitimately just went on in the Senate yesterday or congress and had a hearing that admitted under oath that they have alien bodies In you got it. Oh, I got it. I got it. But nobody gives a fuck. No, what I got my side. Oh cool. Whatever. We fucking knew it. I'll give a shit Like people are so overly Um Stimulated that they don't care we're desensitized. Yes. Yeah, they're like fucking. I don't think yeah We found non-human remains and everyone's like okay. Yeah, cool I'm sure you but then there's another option There's there's this other option called like we shouldn't have senile fox running our fucking government We make people retire at 65 and we let people run the country the most important positions To every single person that inhabits this country we let them be 80 At 90 years old What the fuck are we doing and by the way? Do you really believe that this guy actually got voted in You're fucking insane. There's dude you could run against him dude any one of us could run against him And beat him if we were standing next to him the guy cannot function He cannot speak These people are so bought in and so connected and so fucking like in the Swamp like the shit the Trump talks about like the corruption's been going on for 350 60 years and and we let these people the what we're doing is we're letting these people the Mitch McConnell's the Nancy Pelosi's the Joe Biden's and you know what in all fairness the Donald Trump's We're letting all the old people call and by the way out of all those people Donald Trump is the only one that you could say Well, he actually has business acumen and skill set which is what's required to run and be the president of the United States So I just leave that there but to be to make a fair argument We shouldn't be having our oldest weakest citizens running our fucking country They should not be the face of the country They shouldn't be making decisions about the country because every decision this motherfucker makes Not a single one of them is about the betterment of the country for any of us It's about obliging to deals that have been made over the last 60 fucking years And none of those deals benefit anything for us And that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with we're dealing with a government and a government system that is so corrupt and so deeply corrupt that these people are able to stay in power for how long has he been in there 50 years? I mean 40 years 40 years, bro. That's as long as I've been alive You know, I'm saying like we need the young healthy competent educated intelligent best of the best running the country not our senior citizens that belong with my homie John drink a 12 pack of beer at the fucking old folks home 81 is old I don't think some people realize how old 81 is well think about your grandparents or your grandma or people that you knew were that old like you had to help them around like yeah It's it's it's dude. It's older than old. It's ancient Crupper 30 years 40 years this month fuckers been doing this Since almost before I was fucking born That's insane dude. That's crazy Like it's time for us to realize that our young leadership needs to step in to the power And this and I can appreciate someone who's 60s, okay, and still with it Because to get Smart enough to know what to do you have to have that life experience. So I'm not saying 35 year old guys That's not what I'm saying, but I'm saying not 80 year old people either. We have to dude Do you guys really think that people keep voting for the sky? You know what I think this is my opinion I think the elections are corrupt on both sides and the uniparty uses this tool to fix the elections for the people on the left and the people on the right Who will go along with the deals that have been made and the deals that have been made are not in our interests Yeah, I don't trust any voting systems at this point. No, no way next year I don't even want to what's gonna happen. It's a total joke people think people think oh there's no way that the Democrats are gonna win the elect no They're gonna win of course. Yeah, they're going to win because The elections are fucking fraud. Yeah Yeah, and then at the same time the Democrats run the campaign like I voted all the celebrities. Yeah, I voted They like to make people think like they're making a huge difference with their vote I'm like you're not doing anything now. I will say it is it's important for everybody to still vote Because if you don't vote Then there's no evidence of them cheating So it's important that everybody vote for the best person that they believe So that way the evidence will be there that they cheated if you don't vote Which is I think their goals to demoralize people and not voting then they actually win legitimately And there's no complaint or gripe right, but this is this is indicative of communist um insurgencies Then it happened in other countries, you know We see El Salvador getting fixed right now and everybody's crying about how the president male Salvador is this ruthless Anti-democracy dictator. I don't know. He took the crime rate from basically like a whole lot to a whole little All right, uh the people who are actually living in that country are a lot happier And it's interesting because El Salvador at one point in time was a country who went through the process that we're going through now where over the course of time their elections became The people lost faith in the elections the socialists in the communist maintain power They destroyed the fucking country and somehow this dude got himself in. I don't know how he did it but You know then I also think like they are scared of the vote So like I think the thing is is that they can only fudge a certain percentage because they're very terrified of Donald Trump Being the candidate because and you know they keep saying well Trump can't win Trump can't win Well if you can't win why the fucking try and so hard to get him not to run right You know what I'm saying? I think they're also trying to lower the voting age too They've been talking about that because they know if they lower it to 16. They're gonna get more Yeah more votes for the also they're trying to know while these migrants to vote right? Oh, yeah Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's why they like the borders open. Yeah Yeah, crazy shit. Yeah, I mean I listen I I don't know if this was a stroke. I don't I don't know if this was uh I'm not sure the dude shouldn't be there. It's a relevant. That's the thing And it's like this would this would never happen if he was not there And at the end of the day whatever the reason was it does not make our country look fucking strong Oh, dude in all these fucking secret service people and all these other senators that are elected in all these People who claim to be for the people like if you're not calling this shit out Like you're part of the fucking problem. You're a traitor to the fucking America. Be real talk I mean look at him a lot of these people deserve to be fucking Caesar dude You know, we have our most this is a whole nother topic. We have our most patriotic Americans are Our special spec ops people who bleed red white and blue Protecting some of the fucking tyrants causing some of this bullshit all over the world And you guys don't think that like maybe Uh, it's a good idea to like do something I'm just saying like you guys what you guys just gonna stand by and for the country that you serve and the country that you Blood for in the country that you believe in apparently and just say now this this guy's paying me Like what the fuck go back and study history, dude You know who caused the fucking turnovers in power? It was the fucking guards Because they did what they knew was right And and right to go right to article about that new work post That's some real fucking news mother fuckers Guys jumping on YouTube. Let us know. It's funny. These fucking idiots think they're gonna shut me up Don't you gonna shut me up with some fucking articles about 75th arc the fuck out of here, bro I ain't shutting up.

I'm gonna go on record right now There's some massive World-changing bad things that are going to happen between now and that election no doubt No, people are gonna have now they're just temperature-proving people are gonna have to get real smart dude Real smart to not fall for real shit, man But yeah, so let's get into the headline so headline reads farmer Air Force intelligence officer testifies Quote on quote non-human pilots recovered from crashed craft Uh, so a witness is a bribal article guys reading A witness testifies the congress quote on quote non-human material was collected from crashed craft in a stunning moment during a house oversight committee hearing Wednesday on unidentified anomalous phenomenon or uap When asked by representative Nancy mace out of South Carolina if the pilots of a crashed craft were recovered the witness David grush a farmer Air Force intelligence officer who studied uap's responded quote As I've stated publicly biologics came with some of these recoveries When representative mace asked if those biologics were quote on quote human or non-human grush responded Non-human here's the video of the exchange for our viewers on youtube intelligence extra terrestrials It's something I can't discuss in public setting Um Okay, I can't ask when you think this occurred Um, if you believe we have crashed craft uh stated earlier. Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft As I've stated publicly already in my news nation interview a biologics came with some of these recoveries. Yeah um Were they i guess human or non-human biologics Non-human and that was the assessment of people which acknowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program In was this Documentary evidence is video photos i witness like how would that be determined The specific documentation I would have to talk to you in a skiff about that yeah um Okay, so and you may or may not be able to answer my last question and maybe we get into a skiff at the next hearing that we have Who in the government either What agency sub agency what contractors who should be called into the next hearing about uap's either in a public setting or even in a private setting And you probably can't name names, but what agencies and organizations contractors etc Do we need to call in to get these questions answered whether it's about funding what programs are happening and what's out there I can give you a specific cooperative and hostile witness list of specific individuals That were in those and and how soon can we get that list I'm happy to provide that to you after the hearing super thank you and i yield back I get so tired of the way they answer questions like bro We pay all we pay more than half our money to fucking taxes bro Get up there and tell us what the fuck is going on Yeah The way he said non-human. He's like not human Like it was totally normal. I just think this like his face was like well, you know Yeah, non-human Yeah, like dude Like when are we gonna when are we gonna get told the truth about what's happening in our own country in our own world Yeah, you know like this this whole red tape of confidentiality top secret classified bullshit It's fucking bullshit. Let us have it. It's it's them deciding What we as Americans can and cannot know how about you just tell us the truth and then people will do or say or think Whatever the fuck they want that's what a free society does like we're we're being We're like The the allegory in the cave right like we're in the cave and they're showing us the show That we think is reality when in reality that real shows outside of the cave And this has been going on for decades Yeah, man, it's Trady so so so just background on grush article continued reading reading it says grush served as an intelligence officer for 14 years both in the us air force at the rank of major And as a civilian at the national geospatial intelligence agency from 2021 to 2023 at the equivalent rank of colonel He also was his agencies co lead in uap and trans medium object analysis As well as reporting to the uap task force and eventually the all domain anomaly resolution office He testified that he became a whistleblower after quote concerning reports of the United States government Was operating with secrecy above congressional oversight with regards to uap's and as I came out of video comes out of San Diego of a UFO being spotted Here's the video Dude what is that? It's gone oh, it's in the club I'm like a lot that would freak me out of crazy Flare maybe no there Yeah Oh This is from a different angle oh, this is the same one the same one different angle Now I got a lot of man that freaked me out a little bit is that recent. Yeah, that's so freaky. Yeah Now We've talked many times on the show that again like there's gonna be distractions because this is a war on information Right, this is a war on attention. This is a war on propaganda and so there's gonna be distractions But I thought one thing that was interesting That also was coming out now Um is this headline that's how I read America's biggest electrical grid operator p.j.m With 65 million customers Warned at network could suffer capacity problems during this week's heatwave So with everything going on You're still got a third and final top it to cover but we'll see that in a minute But you got these u a p's being talked about UFOs non-human organics And now they're talking about threats to our power grid this week Yeah, so What do you think? Well, I mean one thing that I feel like they're trying to distract us from is Hunter Biden's plea deal or something like that like I mean the thing about UFOs is that I was going back and forth I was like at first. I thought it was just a total hoax But I just don't know why they would go Because the thing about the American populations that we can be distracted by anything Let's look at the plane lady that motherfucker is not real like the entire internet was distracted by her for weeks So if they really want I never understood I just saw the memes. I never saw what she was You know the full video. Did you hear about that? I'm a good fool video. What is she doing? It's kind of creepy so she demanded she got off the plane I think they had boredad they were about to take off they were about to taxi down the runway and The first video everyone saw is she was walking to the front and she turned around and she looked visibly Distressed yes, it didn't look like she was faking it and she says I'm telling you right now That that motherfucker that motherfucker is not real and you can stay on this plane and go down with this plane if you want to But I fucking getting off now and she went off as like this huge meme and she made because she on them like a reptile I just saw the memes. Yeah, and so there was like a lot of stuff where People were saying that she was accusing him of being like a lizard man that whole conspiracy theory But then there was an investigative journalist who Who got her hands on the incident report from the police because I think that was in Dallas or Miami, so I'm like that, but they got the incident report and um Like apparently she was in some sort of argument with the person next to her about her air pods going missing and then she according to the police and the um Stewardesses what's the the flight attendance that she was she looked visibly upset like something really scared her And then she says this this aircraft is not safe. It's not safe And she left and they actually got I think they took everyone off the flight and Did like a whole re-screening of the of the aircraft So but all that to say is that the American population can get distracted by just about anything Like all they have to do is elevate like one social media video that went kind of viral and we're glued to it for weeks so my whole thing is like Why would they go through this much trouble for something that's totally fake But then my next question is the timing of it like why now and I didn't know about know that about the the power grid But I have heard a lot actually recently in the last few months that our power grid is extremely fragile Like it doesn't take much it doesn't take much like telling us I actually but this is something that not not that I'm hearing from like mainstream sources like some people They're like look you have to understand that the power grid is super super fragile like somebody if with one person knew what to do they could shut down the power and like Three states like that and so I don't know the the timing of this hearing is is definitely questionable it makes me Skeptical about what else they're trying to distract us from but I do think that the whole UFO thing I'm starting to believe that it is real there's something definitely real going on That's what that's pretty much how I'm feeling about it. It makes me feel better than I feel the way I'm feeling Hearing you say that because I feel like you're one of my favorite critical thinkers um I believe that you would be very ignorant to think that life on other planets wouldn't exist, okay, and When we understand the vastness of the universe assuming we're not in a simulation um Just by math it would make sense that these other civilizations would exist There's plenty of evidence that seem to indicate that They exist Uh, and it seems that there's been a lot of lying about the fact that these things exist however What a convenient time for this to all come to the forefront and While I do believe that all of these things are real. I actually do believe this I also believe that there's a possibility that they could be sensationalizing this uh, not just with the testimonies but also with the actual footage To get people out in the world seeing it and talking about it You know, they have the power to telegram and project images into the sky that everybody can see That backs up what they're saying in the media and what they're doing on Capitol Hill and so I don't know that's what's going on, but it feels like there's a there's a coordinated effort to Unveil this particular bit of information Right now for a specific reason and it isn't because all the sudden Alien life form is a threat or UFOs or a threat or a new thing It's because it's convenient because they don't want us looking over here and so You know, I think it's important to truly think about what the potential options could be whether they sound crazy or not, you know um To me this it like off my gut and how it feels it feels like they're manufacturing this right now because of what's going on You know, they've tried to Get the climate going and most people are starting to see that the climate shit is bullshit Okay, the agenda want the agenda films agenda and agenda to on amazon have woken a lot of people up You haven't watched those I'd watch those um people understand that that The environmental issues are a cover for a lot of the control the total air totalitarianism and communism I couldn't help you. I know You got a couple good ones on that last one. No, I was surprised. I feel good about it You're getting better, all right, but my point is people are starting to see and not react right like They've how many more times they try to recreate a George Floyd situation over the last three years You know the racetrack bunch of different times right they've tried to stir the race And beat the racetrack and the racetrack just isn't beaten the same way as it used to and so then the environment stuff Oh, we're we're in a fucking heatwave alert motherfucker. This is summer It we're it we're we're in the we're at the fucking hell's doorstep of summer. It's called July by this call fucking This is called every year since we've been born so you can't fool people that right because you can go back and look at the historical data of The actual temperatures versus the temperatures better now who wasn't this hot with our ancestors mother fuckers You don't even know Bro, did you see that tweet that fucking Oh, no, oh, oh, yeah, I didn't see that. It's all that way you're hot out here. You blame a Republican You see that She literally said is it hot out there turn around and blame a Republican. Yeah, I'm gonna blame a mega Republican. Yeah, yeah, yeah Okay, so summer's here you could thank us Fuck dude like and then you have um and by the way, I'm not even a mega Republican, but I'll I'll join them over you bitch for fucking sure but Then you know, so all of these things that are intended to stir everybody up or not working and and it's because of what we talked about earlier right people are Decentitized by the over stimulation the over outrage culture Like dude, you can only stay emotionally like stirred up for so long until you're just like no fucking care You know, this is like people who and that is part of the demoralization process Okay, this is like what happens to POW prisoners, right? They they fight they fight they fight they fight they fight they fight and eventually one day they wake up and they're like I'm done fighting And then they end up loving the people that that that they deal with on a daily basis because that's all the fuck they got Okay, so That's us as a that's us as a people right now and we're so over the stuff You and I were talking about it before the show started how we're just over the the outrage culture from both sides. Yeah Um That you know, they drop this alien shit and people are like yeah, well fucking invite them in the party bro We don't give a shit Yeah, and so You know these people were running out of tools and so I wouldn't put it against them to start manufacturing real crisis And that really damages things just because dude, that's the that's the dangerous part of this and if you think like if you And I'm gonna be the one to say this and if you think I'm wrong, you'll see If you think that these people are gonna give up their fucking power at this point in time after the crimes They just committed against humanity after what they just did during COVID where they closed schools They injected people with a product that is legitimately fucking hurting people and killing people when they They transferred all this wealth. They talk openly about a depopulation agenda Blop blop blop we could go down the line. We've done it for years and years here If you think they're gonna give up power at this point in time when the pendulum is swinging back and they could be potentially held accountable You're you're fucking insane. They're not going to give it up. It's not gonna be voted out There's going it's going to have to come from a total cultural rejection of everything that they do and like you guys like to jump on and say it's violence Not yet. It isn't it's a it's a cultural rejection. It's it's non-compliance It's saying no when I fucking jumping when you say jump fuck you That's what it is as a whole people that's it because if no one obeys there is no power They have no power and so we must remove their power by being non-compliant to the things that they want us to react to And and that's only going to get harder to do because the things they're going to start doing I believe are going to be incredibly damaging um So we'll see how it goes I I I'm to the point today and I might feel differently tomorrow Where I have very little hope that people are smart enough to understand what I'm talking about and actually do it in real life Which means a lot of people are probably going to end up getting killed so I think the chances of violence are going up at a very high rate Uh, you know, I like what if I think of it like a curve right like I think over this course of time The the potential of violence curve is like slightly increasing and I think now it's like Because people are getting to the point where they're not willing to tolerate this shit and and dude Here's something to think about Okay, for all of you guys that and I see you And I hear you guys that criticize me for not being hard enough What if their plan is to create some sort of revolution? Okay, cuz like if you have to think like they would think All right now they're in position of power right now they control the military assets They control ever they control the police force they have the power right now Now if I had the power right now and I understood that my house was crumbling I would be looking for ways to maintain the power By any means possible and if you think like them Wouldn't it be the quickest easiest way for them to stay in power is to create some sort of Revolutionary action with the quote unquote matter Republicans versus the LGBTQ The the black Americans The migrants all the protected class against the matter Republicans and they create this revolution now We've already seen them starting to rewrite history like when they when they did that candlelight vigil on January 6th anniversary in The 2022 right they made it that was for the history books, bro They they did this overly dramatic overly cinematic production on all the media channels on its one year anniversary of the insurrection and if you're them Wouldn't it make sense to get these people riled up and violent to the point where you could crush them with their own military and the police that you have And then just say you know what We're gonna change the rules. We're gonna stay in power because clearly this is a big threat And clearly this is a big problem and we're gonna And then all the sudden just make it a communist socialist country like and say this is what we're gonna do from now on Wouldn't that be the easiest way for them to do it That would be the quickest easiest way for them to do it was to be in sight violence And this is why violence cannot be the answer cultural revolution is the answer rejection of their narratives rejection of the Moral standard that they present as moral which we all know is backwards like if we rejected that and they had no power and we rejected at mass All of us whenever we see it we raise our voice and said no We're not doing that what power would they actually have They wouldn't have any yeah, I think you we also have to think about creating a counter culture too Because that non-compliance is really important But when you're rejecting the culture that they're serving us We also have to come up with a solution. This is why I've been a little bit It can be really frustrating and tiring to hear people on the right They just sit and complain and complain they do the same outrage culture Yes, yeah, like look at this look at this crazy video of the you know this trans person or whatever did it up Pride month Yeah, buy my t-shirt buy my mug and it's like okay, I there's nothing wrong I understand that we have to point out the absurdities of the left I under I understand that and we definitely have to point out The evils of the trans agenda trans-genderism particularly targeting children But at some point we have to start building something of our own and I think that is where The right loses a lot because they're so busy pointing fingers and Winging and complaining and and sign up for my show or whatever pay pay the subscription so I can keep making content That's just the same regurgitated stuff like we have to also create something that is going to be a counter cultural force Because simply rejecting and complaining and waving our fingers in the air It's it's just not enough correct And so that's why I think we have to also really really create something that's going to be counter culture That's going to be powerful that's going to inspire people that's going to Motivate people to get up and have some sort of self-reliance and independence. It's personal excellence Yeah, it is the ultimate rebellion like when people think that that's some sort of Catchphrase. I just made up no. I'm just telling you Factually what the solution is the rebellion they don't want to happen is the peaceful personal excellence rebellion of culture Where culture no longer says yes, I'm going to accept that 400 pounds is healthy Yes, I'm going to accept that scrolling on my phone for 10 hours a day is healthy Yes, I'm going to accept your medications. Yes, I'm going to accept your fake food The counter culture to that is what they are afraid of because that's where you hit them in their pocketbooks You remove us as a customer of their system and when you remove the money you remove the power And so this is why I talk so much about you know It's not just some motivational guru shit. This is an actual plan if they want you fat Become fit if they want you uneducated become educated if they want you not to think If they want you to hate people don't hate people love people if they want you to fucking you know You know rely on their pharmaceuticals do the best to become someone that doesn't I'm not saying that all medicine is bad But most of the shit they market is bad. You know everything. It's like you said earlier on the show everything they say We should be the opposite of that. Yeah, that's the counter culture and Both in reality and definition Yeah, especially when they talk about family too because the left is so anti-family But one thing about family and community and village that I think the right gets wrong Is there hyper focus on the nuclear family? So the nuclear family the model of mom, dad and kids in a white picket fence. This is a very it's actually a very Recent development and in human history because for pretty much all of human history family was Extended family Community you had a village and it's a very new phenomenon just really in the early 1900s where in the mid 1900s, you know Obviously because of the industrial revolution they used the nuclear family as a marketing tool as kind of like kind of like a Sci-op to to have people separate from their families To move into the city so the men could get certain types of jobs And so what does that do it separates the mother the father and the children away from their strong family unit And so I think one thing that we also have to really think about is if we want strong families We can't we can't encourage people to just isolate themselves with mom, dad, and children like we really have to encourage people to build bigger families and if it's not your blood like I know that because of you know This modern era that we're in it's really hard for a lot of people to live near their blood family But we have to build these villages and these communities of people that are gonna support each other I think it will also be much easier for wives and mothers to enjoy motherhood Like something that kind of it just kind of irritates me when I hear a lot of people on the right They complain about moms, you know, not or women not wanting to be moms or wives. I'm like Yes, I think more women should be should be wives and mothers not every single woman on the planet is meant for it But I think more women should get married and have families But you have to understand that Ancient families had a huge support system for women huge I mean like think about like postpartum like Alex postpartum right Like today's age It's the husband who's like running around and trying to like serve her while she's a healing from birth Not that there's anything wrong with that But back in the day it was an entire village of women The aunts the yes the sisters the cousins even friends and so now like I actually kind of understand Why so many women don't want to be wives or mothers because it is it can be very very isolating They don't have any help they don't have any help and so the husband is out eight to ten hours a day And he's sort of doing the things that men have always done He gets to interact with other men and he's working and he's got his own community and he's interacting with people But a lot of times, you know in this like common suburban life the mom is stuck at home For however long during the day and it can be very isolating So I think when we talk about pushing back and creating this counter culture We have to think more critically about what family means family is not always It's not always just mom, dad and kids like you know It's it's about creating this village that's really going to support each other whether that means blood family and maybe people who aren't Blood related to you, but you can build this strong community that's really gonna last we have that going on here Absolutely, yeah, I'm very blessed like you know as hard as business is as hard as is to do what we're trying to do Um as much as I get tired of it and like dude I don't have to do this like I could easily be out of this and never have to work again The reason I don't is because of what you're talking about because I know when I come here I'm surrounded by people who who have the same Core value system that I have I know I can count on them. I know I can rely on them I know if I said hey dude. I need help moving this or we've got a problem here or this row It's a it's a text message and there's 50 people saying dude. I'll help and that's not just because I'm me like that That goes to everybody out in this community and it's one of the things I'm proudest of is being a part of this community Because of the things that you say and I think that's a great point that I have never actually made on the show Which I appreciate you bring them because it is part of it. That's a big part of major part. Yeah Big part of it, you know, and the men, you know The one thing you said that that I was kind of gonna laugh at was you know The men going out and working real hard like we got a problem with that too You know saying like are they are they sitting there with the fucking headset on playing call a duty. That's true, right? So like You know, there's the women feminism has done a number on fucking productive men. Yeah, it has yeah Because it's also said that women are interchangeable with men and you know, emasculated them. Yeah, that's not true Yeah, we have unique roles that are necessities for successful civilization, you know, and That's reality, you know welcome to it. Yep Yeah, it's let's let's go and bring this this this cruise on onto within we got a third and final headline headline number three Had number three rates Hunter Biden plea deal shows feds agree to not charge past times But changed course and court So first son hunter Biden is a new york post article First son hunter Biden was set to receive sweeping immunity protection under the terms of a plea deal negotiated with federal prosecutors Only for the justice department to backtrack under questioning from a Delaware judge during it Wednesday hearing So special United States attorney Leo wise and hunter lawyer Christopher Clark these two Duds These guys are defending bro Hunter Biden look just look I mean it's just oozing that that should be like the stain of their whole entire careers oozing water toxic city So so these two guys Both signed a probation only agreement to allow the 53 year old first son to plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors And enter a diversion program for a felony charge of possessing a firearm all addicted to crack cocaine according to a copy of the document obtained by The memo stated that prosecutors would also not seek to charge hunter Biden for any federal crimes attached to his case Which included millions of dollars and missed tax payments between 2016 and 2019 The deal only left open the possibility of quote prosecution for any future condo by the president's son ensuring that possible violations of foreign lobbying laws and money laundering would forever be uncharted Under its terms hunter would serve two years on probation for the tax crime He would also have to seek active employment remain sober submit to drug tests be fingerprinted by the FBI and not commit other crimes His record would also be expunge 30 days after his probation period ends But in Wilman's in federal court Wies diverged from the plan and told us district judge Mary Mary Ellen Norrica that the unprecedented agreement did not preclude prosecutors from the ongoing investigation into the first son's alleged crimes prompting gas From those in the room when judge Norrica asked whether those crimes could include violations of the foreign agents registration act or fairer wise Responded yes quote as far as I'm concerned the plea did the plea agreement is no And void defense attorney Chris Clark said in response the agreement have made no mention of the fairer violations Norrica repeatedly Express de skepticism about the scope of the agreement accusing both sides of wanting her to quote rubber stamp And improperly broad deal and asked wise at one point Quote have you ever seen a diversion agreement that is so broad that it encompasses crimes in another case Quote know your honor wise omitted when Norrica asked if he to think of any precedent And not just that guys during the uh the court hearing hunter Biden admits in court that he made 664 thousand dollars From cfEC china energy contradicting Joe Biden's claims Hunter Biden's lawyer Chris Clark admitted in court Wednesday the president's son received 664 thousand dollars from C.E.F.C. China energy company in 2017 Contradicting president Joe Biden's claim hunter Biden never received money from a Chinese entity um And not just that did you guys see the second amount that he received Uh, so during calendar year 2017 Biden earned substantial income Including just under one million dollars from a company he formed with the CEO of a Chinese business conglomerate Um, but 666 thousand 666 dollars from his domestic business interest I just thought that was a very weird figure that is weird super interesting um But the crazy thing is all that money that he that he earned quote over the next six months and six months Okay, Biden would spend almost the entirety of his balance on personal expenses Including large cash withdrawals Transfer to his personal account travel and entertainment prosecutor said while noting he quote continued to earn handsome As attorneys and prosecutors both acknowledged that his descent into drug addiction after the death of his brother form a Delaware attorney general Bo Biden contributed to the mist tax payments um What do we got on this? I mean I got a chance to read through the conditions of release Um, where he has to submit to supervision and report for supervision to the district of california Um, he has to actively seek employment Um, he can't use drugs he can't use alcohol Um, can't carry firearms obviously um, it's drug tests urine samples There's a lot there and and I think the judges noticed that they're basically trying to pull a fast one You think So so so if I'm interpreting this correctly They tried to Come in with this creative plea deal with the prosecutors and the defense team colluded on these two cucks and agreed to Okay, one of those is defense one of those prosecutors. Yep. Okay. Now remember what I say all the time What do I say these guys do their buddies? Hold on What do I say they do? I say they go out on the golf course or they go to dinner or they go smoke cigars They go drink whiskey and they decide how this shit's gonna go they work together Okay, thinking that Republicans are Democrats or that Uh, council for two different sides of a case even down to cases where you have to go to court The prosecutors and defense attorneys are friends They make Up how the case is going to go before the case ever goes, okay? And then they figure out how to make it go as long as it can theatrically so they can get paid Right So that's what we have going on here Then we have a judge that is saying no Is that right? Yeah, yeah, that's exactly well, you know Yes, she should yes, she should and and you know what happens to judges that stand up against these people You see what I'm saying my girl paddle board and I think it's important for her to be very careful And I think it's important for the police wherever she lives to be To do your fucking jobs Because this woman's doing something that is a actual Representation of how our country how our country's supposed to operate Yeah, I mean they're gonna white tax penalties clean for four years from this dude They're gonna they're gonna not investigate him for any other crimes any other crimes, okay? No matter what they are Like dude, like do you think that any of you guys would get that sort of a deal? I know I wouldn't I definitely wouldn't yeah, you definitely wouldn't that's right Is this racist? All right, I would get the worst deal, bro. Let's be real. It's the most uncool to be white right? Okay I Can't imagine if Don Jr Just did one a fraction of this bro. This Don Jr will be they'd execute Yeah, I'll be putting a day to run how to fucking kill him. Yes, they would yes, because they would realize okay That was our time to get Don Jr So he doesn't sprout into the Donald Trump, right? Like dude, it's Well, look man It's good that she's standing up. Yeah, that's a good thing But other thing people have been calling out too is like how you know plenty of times you know the White House they're They're Narrative is that they are completely separate from the first sons political Or legal issues and woes right but they can stay completely out of it however This motherfucker's getting tax payers fucking security secret service to drive him to and from these court hearings Right like and I'm not I'm not talking about just a few vehicles like like I mean We're talking about a full fucking motorcade That he's getting the taxpayers are yeah, he's not like he's paying for it. No, he's not paying for we pay for that Yeah, we pay for that and so I've been seeing like that It's aggravating that any of our money goes to any of these people for any fucking reason Like these people are such fucking low-life shit bags all of them And they're taking more than half of our our total earning and doing whatever the fuck they want with it Like it's disgusting like look at the Like We're gonna face the Joe Biden and Hunter Biden makes that smug like crooked smile shit that they do Like they look like plastic people They don't even look like a fucking real and like these people get to spend our money however the fuck they want to on their own shit And then and then when they do bad shit they They get off like dude look A time of reckoning real reckoning is coming It really is and it's necessary and I don't know how it's gonna play out But here's what I do know Is that if we don't have a culture built and we can start on that right now When you replace these people with somebody else, it'll just be the same thing It'll be the same thing with different different people And so that's why it's so important to go back to what we were talking about just a minute ago You know the building of a productive moral But still free Culture in America, you know because one thing about the conservatives and I get a lot of heat You know that like a lot of people attack me because I don't have kids You're such a great American why don't you have kids? Well guess what mother fucker. I can't fucking have them What about that? Okay, what about the hundreds of kids that I actually fucking have to raise inside my companies? Like do you think do you really think that I want to go home and raise fucking five more of my own? Fuck no, you have no idea what I deal with on a daily basis It's not for everybody But like you said I think most people it is for and when we have a situation Where these people are criticizing People like me for not having children like you guys are going too far like you're not gonna get your own like I saw this clip from the podcast. I did where I was talking about united We stand divided we fall last week and I read the comments and half of them were like yeah, dude totally and the other half were like Well, like the other half was split in half So there was like two other quarters and there was a quarter We're like oh fuck this is bullshit through like the far left people But then there was this quarter from the conservatives who was like You know saying all of these things like like dude. I saw one guy say I bet this guy's triple-vaxed I'm triple-vaxed I'm the reason that none of y'all had to fucking take the shit. Okay, so I'm one of the reasons that the The idea of freedom is misunderstood by both sides like to live in a free society You're going to have to work with people especially here in America who have different religious beliefs Who have different cultural background who have different levels of melanin in their skin who May like to have sex with people that are different than the people that you like to have sex with like There's this demand on both sides that you must conform otherwise you're not part of it And that grouping or that group thing or that group culture Like it's no different What's happening on the right right now is no different than what happened on the left for the last 10 years It's all enough of yeah, it's all or nothing and I eat that ends up eating your own and doesn't provide any productive outcome for anybody And so like we have to like get smarter to the point where We have to understand that if we're gonna have freedom and be left alone We got to leave other people alone too. You know what I mean unless they're doing things that Are below the accepted moral standard of society which I think needs to be correct. Yeah Yeah, I really bothers me when I see people on the right who criticize others for not getting married really enough Yeah, for not having kids or even not having enough kids. I mean, I've seen Moms criticize for not having enough kids. It's just traditional wife movement Oh, even get me started on that because the stupid thing about this new I call it the fetishization of tradwife It's like it's become a fetish of sorts because you can't fully understand it's theater It's theater. It's it's going in a flower print. Yeah for TikTok conservative dress Talking about how they grow their own vegetables and they take care of their man Yeah, and they don't drink alcohol and they read the Bible every single day. Well, guess what that's cool, bro That's fine do that But not everybody's gonna do that and just because they don't do that doesn't mean that they don't have a place in this country Yeah, and doesn't mean that they're not conservative enough for you Yes, the crazy thing about this tradwife thing is if we're gonna look at tradition If you want to if you if you really really want to take an honest look at the traditional wife You cannot look at the traditional wife outside of the context of the traditional family And this is what I was talking about earlier. It's like the traditional family was never isolated And if you look at the traditional husband and father He was not you know going out in public or online and saying all these nasty things about women and calling them Hose blah blah blah like that is not how the traditional man was So if you really want a traditional wife and woman you have to look at the context of trad family and trad husband But we're so hyper focused on this fetishization of the tradwife That now you have people on the right who were saying that women are not traditional enough because they have a job Because they because they went to college or like you need to raise girls to to not go to school and just get married at 20 And I'm like look, I have a daughter like my dream for her is that she has a family one day Of course, I want her to be a wife and a mother one day But if she wants to have an education and if she has a dream to To I don't know be have whatever job that she wants to have like I'm not going to tell her to not do that. I think it's so weird that we've gotten to the point where Now the right is criticizing people for not being conservative enough not being trad enough And it's like it it pushes people away and it just creates more division And it's the same thing. It's this group thing where you have to conform to everything that we do You have to look exactly the same and you have to make the same life choices as we do at the same age And it's it's not helpful and it really it actually sets us back What do we really try to do here? Are we trying to conform? You're creating division Amongst the people who need to be united. Yes, I think I think I think different I think that's a good thing because look what it look with that exact same thought process did to the left The daily native a shit ton of people that went over to the right if we do it to the right That's great because now we're going to see a true sense of the people in the middle That true 85 90% of people of American citizens who all think the same things outside of that extreme. Yeah We're going to be truly united because now what we're going to start You guys shut the fuck up over there. You guys shut the fuck up over here. It's hard to pal it any of it Yeah, for me because like I don't fit into either of these categories like I don't fit with Democrats And I certainly don't fit with Republicans, you know, I'm too fucking conservative for For liberals and I'm too liberal for conservatives And it's called an American hold on And I don't and I don't agree with the libertarians strategy because they don't have good strategic thought They have good concept of thought But when you go to apply what they think it doesn't make sense and they refuse to have those conversations They just say you're a dumbass or you're a bootlicker or whatever. So I get attacked from these fucking guys and it's like guys You're never going to have it all your way Like it's never going to be all your way bro Not every single person that you drive down the street is going to be your kind of person Not every single person You know, I mean think about how unrealistic That perspective is you know, like that's fine if you're a tradwife and you want to hang out with other tradwives Cool, but villainizing everybody else who isn't in your club That's not productive now. That just creates more of what we already have Which is what we're trying to get away from and that was my take with the podcast I did united we stand divided we fought. I think it was last week or the week before Um Where you know, it's like do we have to remember we have to we do have to do I think you made a good point I mean we do have to find that 85% of middle people that Like understand what's actually going on Are willing to look at reality for what's going on because there's still a lot of people that want to refuse to look at the reality of the situation You know, they don't want their side to be criticized. They're people are infallible Okay, we have to look at the reality And here it is The reality is is if we don't come together We're going to lose fucking everything and it's going to be a huge loss for you your family their future And everything that you've loved about America that's going to go away And what's going to be replaced by is this Uh, this communist socialist ridiculous backwards This topy and shit that we all have decided that we don't like Okay, so we can either unite and accept people for their differences and say hey, we don't want to live in this crazy shit Where we're stirred up constantly or about around our differences when our differences should be promoted as strengths um We're going to get to the side, you know, do we do we want you know a civil peaceful Prosporous country where people have real opportunity to do better Or do we want tyrants who are literally shitting their pants on television Taxing us at a rate that is financially oppressive Sending all of our resources to other places and the reason they're doing that is so that they can make money um Basically taking advantage of the worker bees of this country, which is us And keeping us where we are so like you know, those are our choices and that that's reality And you guys can argue over nuance and you know, you can and here's the real here's why people do this Because their identity is now on this phone. It's not in their real world So if they can say abrasive things or do things for drama attention clicks or their tribalist community Then we end up with a situation where you know people are doing things selfishly on their phones instead of actually producing Uh, some sort of resolution that works for everybody and that's what I'm saying I'm for an actual free America That People can stand up and be who they are without being harassed we can live a life where we're not constantly stirred against each other or financially oppressed by the uh, invasive and over-appressive tax code that we have uh, we can have a much smaller government We can have the money spent wisely we could have Hard accountability for things like violent crime, which is the worst You know, that's the biggest disruptor in in anybody's community right now um, and and have a common sense free America dude that's that's better than it's ever been And I think we have an opportunity at this point to create that But these people are doing everything they can to make sure that doesn't happen Yeah, and then taking a stand to and putting Putting very clearly of what our objective morality is right that's a huge issue too is that our Society has become so a moral, you know, we like we were talking about before we started filming like So porn for example, like I I didn't think I would ever get here But I've been here for a while now. I think porn should be a hundred percent illegal And people are like oh, you can't legislate morality Oh really then why aren't you why isn't it legal to kill and steal and rape like that's the of course we legislate morality And we have to remember that the founding fathers they wanted to create a moral society It wasn't they didn't want to just create a society where it was a free for all and you can Just do a bunch of drugs long as not hurting anybody else you can just watch porn all day No, they wanted to create a virtuous society And if we want to do that we have to be really clear about what is objectively right and what is objectively wrong Well, we all inherently know those things and we know those things and it is it's it is really the state I mean, you know, I don't want an overinflated government either But it is also up to the state to promote the good and to promote moral values And we need to see more of that too Yeah, I don't disagree with any of that. Yeah, I think a big problem You know, I also think though like we have to say yes, can you legislate morals? Absolutely, but that just because something's legislated doesn't mean mean it's moral That's something to consider as well right like because what they're trying to do like for example With some of these age of consent laws that started over in Europe that are now finding their way here where they're saying that A minor can consent to have sexual relations with an adult and we're not talking about a 16 year old and 18 year old We're talking about a fucking 10 year old That's what they're talking adult that's correct and just because they make a law that says that Culture does not have to accept that as moral because I will never accept that I will never accept that shit and none of this pito shit. It's going around should be accepted at all 0% like this this renaming maps dude listen these people legitimately Either belong in jail and if I was doing it my way they would I would remove them from the fucking planet I would put them in a fucking woodchipper because that's a that's a culture That praise on innocence and destroys lives for the selfish once of adults It The more I the more I think about the more angry I get roasts now These people should not have a place in society. No. Yeah, you've lost your chance to function in the civilized society Yes, when you when you participate in that kind of university And the fact that it's being normalized or attempted to be normalized right now And I know the sound of freedom gets criticism right a lot of people are saying oh, it's great a lot of people saying That's not how it really is and there's a lot of talk around it But it's a net good because it has brought everybody to the forefront to understand There's a fucking massive market for this pito shit and We're the top country. Yes. Yeah, listen dude. It's time to fucking do something about it It is time to do something about it And this shit can never be accepted when we talk about what a moral standard is there's fucking zero room for that And and and I don't care what happens to me for saying that or what people think I don't care. No fucking care. That's fucking wrong y'all know it's wrong And it's disgusting to me that it has been normalized to the point where people People think it's a debatable topic It is not a debate. It's kind of like no, it's not a debatable topic Like this is these these are fucking children these kids Will never have a chance to live a normal life They don't even have a childhood anymore Okay, these kids are taught about sex when they're in kindergarten in first grade in preschool and before There's child books out like infant like books about pronouns the shit bro I even know what a fucking pronoun was until I was like fucking 25 like we don't fucking know the shit Okay, actually if you said what's a pronoun? I probably couldn't even tell you what it is But I'm gonna tell you this Kids shouldn't be taught anything about sex Until they start to go through puberty and they start to get curious about what the fuck is going on And then you talk about it and this this whole This this whole movement of sexualizing children Has created a scenario where these kids don't even get to have a fucking childhood. That's criminal Dude, they don't even get to be normal fucking kids And then and then the and then you throw the imposition of the race argument on these kids, right? Like you're telling these little four-year-old and five-year-old kids that you know if you're black you're born in America You don't have a fucking chance because the system is racist and they're told you're white little buddy over here at preschool Who you hang out with every day is actually your enemy because he's racist and he can't even fucking help it But if you cut your penis off, you'll be okay. You're normal That's totally normal and natural to cut off your dick like this is where we are a society And so what we're the resetting of moral standard in culture is 100% necessary But we can't have trad wife over here telling us that everybody that's doing a good job isn't doing a fucking good job Like we're all in the same team, bro Let's eliminate the fucking cancer is shit that we have going on and then go live some peaceful fucking productive lives Like that's my idea of America You know Guys jumping on this conversation these you let us know what you guys think hashtag deal with no hashtag should be wood shipper That's what a fucking should be My fuckers belonging it and I'm not just talking about the pitos I'm talking about these tyrants that have been in fucking power for 50 fucking years that refused to stand by and allow our country to actually become what it should be on our watch in our time Yeah Power is never given it's always taken by them I Guys at this time for our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up for dumbest fuck This is where we bring a headline up we talk about it And then we get one of those two options so with that being said our thumbs up with dumbest fuck headline reads Mustard skittles are suddenly a thing and the internet wants to know So do I now listen wait listen isn't that the same girl who wrote the fucking that is yeah, it is All right Is it she's on the show twice today talking about dumb shit both times Well, let's give her a fair shake all right, maybe she's just bad in a low average today I want to start by saying the only fucking rainbow I'm tasting our skittles.
