I'm always Ready always ready ready always that's right. Mm-hmm. Well, I first call we got today This is a gentleman by the name of Nick Nick Lopez. Let's give him a call I Next speaking. Hey Nick. What's up, dude? This DJ What's up? What's going on, man Nick? What's up, dude? It's Andy Well, Andy. What's up, man? What a black thing? I was just sweet hello guys So what do you got for us today brother? Yeah, yeah, um ultimately. Thank you for you know choosing me and you know taking the time to answer my question Today, um, I'm gonna approach the idea of winning and my question from there is What are your thoughts about giving yourself the permission to win and letting go of the idea of winning and focusing on the execution and process? So ultimately this came from a book called the mind gym and One of the things in there that said was the probability of getting what the outcome or the outcome you want increases when you let go of the need to get it and I'm coming from a baseball player right when a pitcher struggling. What do you tell him? Just play catch with the catcher. Don't try to aim your curveball. Don't try to aim your foreseen fastball Put it down You know the middle of the plate but throw it hard throw it within tension and you'll get the strike So I'm just wondering how do you do that in the business motto because the idea of winning and the idea to be great is How you know you kind of build a great business and how you become better every day? And I'm just kind of wondering what you thought of like letting go of the idea of really trying to win and just going with the procedures Going with the process. Yeah, look. I think there's first of all I think that's a really good question, dude And before I get into it I just want to say thanks for supporting the show and and you know You're thankful to have us we're equally as thankful for all of you guys. So Thank you, man. Yeah, so look There's multiple ways that people look at it and everybody has a different opinion But here's the reality, dude, and this is this is what you asked me for my opinion. I'm gonna give you my opinion I think that people over complicate the idea of winning Especially when it comes to business because it's such unfamiliar territory for most people Most people who come from winning, you know, they've experienced a little bit of winning and sports or they've experienced a little bit of winning in school But they may not have the proximity to witness how to win in business and that seems a little bit magical to people when they haven't actually Touched it or seen it or been around it, but what I can tell you bro is that whatever Method we decide it's gonna come down to the same thing, okay? It's gonna come down to breaking the big goal into little bitty goals into daily Critical tasks that we execute over the course of time and While some people may say let go of you know the idea of the big picture I don't necessarily buy into that. I think it's important to keep the big picture in mind to highly desire the win And then to break the actions down into daily critical tasks and then understand that and This is the hard part for people bro People have a hard time Understanding that you have to have faith in the actual process and what I mean by that is this When you start out at you know trying to win in business and you don't have much experience when we break down the Overall mission into critical tasks It's sometimes is hard for us to believe that those critical tasks are going to compound and Produce the end result that we're after and so in the beginning we have to have a little bit of faith and make sure that we keep executing over and over and over again at a daily level and As that happens and as you do that Enough you will start to see little glimmers and little sparkles of the outcome that you desire All right, and what that does is that reinforces the belief that you were on the right track Which gives you even more faith to continue to execute and then you execute some more a little bit more a little bit more and then you have another glimmer or sparkle of outcome and Basically, dude, that's how the process works and once you do enough of the work on The daily basis The it will become very obvious to you that the outcome is likely to happen now where You know, we may differ here with whoever wrote that book and myself During that time I am highly focused on what the outcome is that I want It's what it's what gets me out of bed But I also understand that me just being focused on that outcome Doesn't create it unless I'm breaking it down into to actionable critical tasks that I execute on a daily basis so you know You could say this a couple different ways. I mean you could use this same process the way that that person's describing it and saying hey Don't worry about Don't worry about the end result worry about the daily actions and and that's accurate. That's just not that's not how I personally do it I personally love to think and dream and focus on What I'm building and what I'm creating and how it's gonna look how it's gonna feel I'm obsessed with it. I love that part of it But I could totally understand where some people need to set the outcome Break the plan down to focus all of their intentions on the daily tasks and sort of let go of the pressure of needing to create that big thing Especially in the beginning, right? Like when you're starting out on day one, bro And you're you're 10 years away from where you want to be It can be highly demoralizing day in and day out if you're that focused on it if you don't have the trust and the belief and the faith That your actions are gonna pan out. So I don't think there's a wrong way to do that as long as you're breaking it down into critical task and Executing on a daily basis because dude That's the only way that anybody wins the only way that anything's been created that's worth mentioning whether it be a Championship sports team whether it be an amazing business whether it be an amazing life whether it be climbing Mount Everest It doesn't matter anything that is worth mentioning that is a high achievers type goal, which is what you're after is going to take You know the day in day out execution and the focus on the on the actions, you know Nick Sabin talks about this a lot, dude And those of you don't know Nick Sabin. He's probably one of the best coaches if not the best football coach ever and Agreed. Yeah, he talks he talks and but oh Yeah, we gotta respect the game though, you know You know, thank you too right, but hey But dude, he has a saying man. He says we're not gonna practice Until we get it right. We're gonna practice until we can't get it wrong, all right And that's the purpose of the day in day out focus. He understands that if we snap the ball correctly and we Positions are we do the drop correctly and we throw the ball correctly and we take the handoff correctly and we tie our shoes Correctly, all right and the routes run correctly that the outcome of the game is almost an automatic so Focusing on the highest quality execution of the day in day out process will produce What you're after regardless if you focus on it every single day or not? I like to focus on it But I can understand how someone who's just starting might be overwhelmed that way Yeah, yes, certainly and I Kind of have just a little bit of a thought you said like you know getting those little glimmers and glimpses of The winning But let's be honest right you say it all the time. I haven't done shit. I'm 27 I'm taking over business in five years, but for right now. I just haven't done shit and I'm okay with winning But the idea is I always go to that next goal post and I think like Should I take maybe a little bit more of a glimpse and just go like hey, you know that procedure led to this win Remember trust the process or You know you're kind of you always say like hey any higher cheaters gonna go what's the next thing like yep? That's a win. Let's go. What's the next what you know and keep going there? What's your thoughts there? Well, I mean look bro. First of all, I'm gonna tell you this You know, I know you say you're okay with winning, but you better be fucking super hungry for it because there's a lot of people out there that will Kill their whole fucking family to have it so unless you have a sadditude about creating that win You know, I just want to reinforce to you that there is some super Killers out there that want to win real fucking bad. So you got to take it real serious, bro Because whether you realize it or not you are competing with those guys even if you can't see him But to answer your question Yeah, dude, I think you know, I Just think it's real important, bro. Honestly just to stop overthinking it get down to executing and then always Understand that if you get complacent with that win, all right What happens to a lot of people is they get that first win or that second win and then they start to think that they're winning or that they are a winner And then they attach their identity to they are a winner except they stop doing the things that allow them to get the next win All right, and we see this in people every day How many people do we know that talk about their high school MVP trophy that they won 15 years ago nobody gives a fuck Okay, and here's the thing Life is long, bro. It's short, but it's also long, all right and in career and in business It's long and if we want to continue to produce the best outcomes We have to continue to raise the bar as we go Especially when we are in our 20s 30s and 40s all right, so Dude, you know if I were you right now you say you're gonna take over a business in five years I would spend every waking moment Pretending as if you're already running the business so that you can learn the lessons that you need to learn before you're in that situation So that's what I would do, bro Yeah, no, I appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah, and you know little caveat on the okay with winning I don't I I come at it with the confidence of my ability and potential That's the win and I get offended when someone else thinks they're gonna be these right That's the nature in me good Good, bro. I'm right there with you. That's what I said the okay Where it's like I know how to kind of celebrate there, but I want to go to the next time I just make sure bro. It's my duty to Of course, of course. No, thank you. I appreciate everything that you guys do. I mean honestly I've never heard anything for 38 minutes to 45 minutes that humps me up and is exactly what's going on in my head and Just thank you for sharing it to everybody and you know, we're out here not being hoes and we're sharing the show All right Nick hey bro, let's go out and do something big, all right? Yes, sir. All right. See you brother. Thank you Yeah, sweet man. I was I was thinking about it. It's like you know on the one hand you want to execute right But like I feel like is that not also when people can get caught in that like you know I'm in doing the mundane because they forget what the fuck they're doing it for Yeah, look dude Like I said, you know certain people gets I'm not one of those people. Yeah, okay I do not get overwhelmed by the size of the project But that's because I have the history of achieving big things already if you're 20 years old and you've never built anything The idea of building You know a company that like I've built is is well not even I built we've built Is it overwhelming? Yeah for sure and so dude to get to that, you know There's a saying man the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. It's the only way to eat an elephant That's the thing. So you know once we remove the confusion and we remove the mystery and the magic and the excuses that everybody else got lucky and this and that and this It comes down to the same shit Execute every single day at the highest level that you're possibly capable of Do that again tomorrow do that again the next day and that's where the mastering of the mundane happens and you're hitting on something that's very important because What can happen is people start off with good intentions of Winning the day at a high level and then they sort of like get in the routine and they start to Stop pressing forward and they start to kind of just but dude if you operate on the power list the right way that it's supposed to be operated on It actually eliminates that because after 21 days of Successfully executing any of the five critical tasks you remove that task. It's considered a habit now Now if you miss a day or two then it can go back on but the point is Is that if you remove things that become habit and you constantly replace it with new things You're constantly pushing the bar to be better and better and better You see what I'm saying? So we we just can't get in the same We can't think that executing the same routine day in and day out Is is the same as executing with the proper intent with the proper critical actions that are gonna get us where we want to go All right, it's those are those are different things one of them is coasting one of them is highly Intentful Execution day in and day out and they look very similar so it's very important for people to understand the difference I love it, man. I love it. We got question number two. This is a write-in Andy Question number two Andy Afternoon guys, good morning. I'm only guys are doing all right First and foremost, I am not a hoe I do share the show my question today is How can I still work and manage being focused day after day when I get distracted by the things that give me a dopamine hit Which are not alcohol or smoking weed. I don't do either But by not allowing things to take up space in my mind like a tenant who doesn't pay rent One of those big distractions for me is women I'm 20 years old and in the pursuit of winning and achieving success at the highest level I understand the potential and time I can lose here Currently I felt 75 hard because I forgot one of the critical tasks, which is a gallon of water every day Just one arm consistent and focused enough a hot girl pops out of nowhere And I appreciate what you guys do one of the reasons I love the show is that it has that masculine intensity So how do we stay focused and avoid distractions? Well, you sort of answer your question First of all, let me tell you something dude. There's three things that you're gonna fucking ruin your life Okay, one of them is drugs the next one is alcohol You know what the third one is it's women all right. That's real shit Okay, because as young men we don't learn the discipline around Women okay, we women and man grew up completely different dynamic a woman grows up telling every every man No, okay, a man Fucking chases everything they can getting told no it's two different size of the coin and because of that Men have a harder time learning how to be Discipline when it comes to women what I mean by that is you're a young man you're 20 years old You you know you you want to go out and you know do all the stuff that we want to do as men And you start to get these options presented you and it's very hard to say no when you've been chasing it for so long even if that Woman isn't even you know for sure isn't the right woman and here's how you get fucked up in it bro You end up getting a pregnant or you end up having you know You end up taking what you can get and thinking that because you know She's the only girl that'll you know fuck you that you're gonna marry her some shit and like dude this is this is bad Okay, I'm not saying you can't date. I'm not saying you shouldn't date But what I am saying is you have to understand a very real reality about the value of a man And the value of a man and right or wrong in today's society is going to be Later in life than it is for a woman. That's just reality. Okay, it's biological reality It's cultural reality too I'm not saying that women can't be valuable when they're older because they are that's how what I'm saying So don't fucking come at me no bullshit But what I am saying is is that at a man at 20 years old You are not in a position to attract the best partner that you're going to be able to attract anyway. It's not gonna happen. Okay So what you need to focus on and what you need to understand is that you have a discipline problem All right when you say I failed 75 hard because I couldn't drink a gallon of water Well, you sure as fucking gonna be able to tell women know when they come and show you their boobies All right, so you need to understand dude That's a discipline that men have to have to learn and some men never learn it because guess what? It's a very hard discipline to fucking learn so We had Jason Wilson on a number of years ago is one of my favorite people ever he talked about this He talked about men developing the discipline around women so that they can stay focused to their own goals and What I would encourage you to do is to start Looking at this situation as a Issue of your own personal discipline because once we start to look at things from a adversarial perspective meaning This beer in front of me has no fucking power over me or this Woman in my DMs has no power over me now. We're starting to understand what true power is for ourselves. So Start looking at it as you're not going to allow women or alcohol or drugs to Pull you off of what your plan is for yourself and if that means passing on dating opportunities That's what it means and to be completely honest Passing on dating opportunities actually makes you more desirable to women all right So and I know you young bucks haven't figured this shit out yet, but here's my bottom line This is where I'm gonna tell you if I was if I was talking to you and you were me at 20 years old I'd say hey Give it all you got for the next 12 13 years and you're gonna attract someone who actually values you Who is actually going to help you is actually going to help you build who's not gonna just take from you and That person is gonna be of higher level because you're at a low level right now And once you rise to the higher level by taking care of yourself and making sure that you're good Make sure that you have a good career making sure that all these things the the the Quality of the mate that you're going to attract is going to be much higher all right So to get you have to be and that's what we got to understand and for men it takes time to become that all right I feel bad man. I think and you've talked about like how many times You know just in that That era, you know that like how many years you wasted. Oh, yeah with the wrong person Yeah, and this isn't like specific to just make a woman do it sometimes It's it's necessary to go through these kinds of relationships because they teach you what you don't want All right, and that's fine But you got to avoid making big mistakes like getting a pregnant shit like that Okay, and that's just some real talk dude. Yeah, you know like Just reality. That's a culture thing. It's both ways to man as it goes both ways. That's that's so real man Yeah, it's crazy. It does go both ways, you know You know if if you're a woman that wants to have A high quality man and have a family and all this shit you probably shouldn't have a bunch of kids when you're 20 years old I mean and dude I know that's gonna hurt some feelings, but I'm just being honest Reality, okay, and I'm not saying that they can't have that I'm not all I'm saying is that it's harder So I'm saying for sure for sure Love it. Well guys, let's get to our next question This question is going to be coming from Gus Gus guys has a question for you Andy. Let's give Gus a call The weather for before. Hello. Hey guys, what's up? This is What's up, man? What's going on brother? I got Andy here with you What's up guys? Oh, not much. How are you? I am good. I'm in the middle of fucking shopping at home people, bro Call me. Yes, what can we help you with brother? Oh Come on, I've got I believe my question was Fear 49 years old this year I know you talked about the main time before in the radio show People had on jump and you kind of don't talk really good about us, but For many years, it's just You want to get going and The car stalls on you When you get going again and it stalls again and it's a cycle that keeps on happening and at my point of life I want to be an example for For my kids and and I'm sure others are I'm sure my age and show them that it still can't be done. Yeah You know, so I have my son here next to me, man. Well listen listen, dude First of all You know, it's never too late to change, okay, and you can't attach What you're going to do from here on out to what you have done To where you are, all right, and also you also have to be grateful For all the things that you've done in the past and the mistakes you made because they brought you to this place where you realize I want to change and I want to be better. So it's important for you not to beat yourself up as if you wasted You know 49 years of your life, bro. You still have another with technology. You know the things that are happening now You only got to make it about five more years. We're all gonna be living forever anyway. So So listen brother. Look That's a normal That's how most people live their lives, okay? Most people get hot and then they get cold and then they get hot and then they get cold and the best way to avoid that Is by one Getting very very clear on what your purpose is and you just said what was the biggest purpose That I think anybody could have was just being a great example for your son, all right We have an obligation as you know because we talk about it on the show all the time of setting the right example for the next generation Now I don't have any kids, but I know there's a lot of kids that listen to me and there's a lot of you guys dads that listen to me That are picking this up and laying it down. So it's super important, bro To have that big purpose which you already have and then dude you got to remember You already know how you are like you have to accept your nature My nature my nature personally is that I am super lazy all right So I have to force myself to do the things that need to be done When I don't feel like doing it and that's what we talk about when we talk about disciplines. So When you start to feel these these downward Let me ask you this this this will probably help you What What do you think causes the beginning of the downward cycles that you have where the car stalls? What you just said right now about forcing yourself because like you said is about not not necessarily being lazy Hold on, I work hard as fuck yeah, no hold on what I'm asking is In the past when you've been At your point where it starts to go from having good momentum to having bad momentum What is the feeling that you have at that peak of your performance where things are going good that starts to make it go down Fear of loss What do you mean? Yeah, you're in a momentum and you I don't want to I'm in a momentum and I want to lose it And my mind I go back to the old ways Okay, I can stop constantly okay, so there's two things that cause this generally One is comfort people feel like oh, I'm doing good. I got it under control And then they they take their their focus off of what they're trying to do and they naturally slide back into where they go And then the other one is what you said they start to Realize that they're doing good and then they start to think oh shit. I'm doing good It's only a matter of time before it gets bad again And you have to realize dude that you are in control of this This is not magical momentum that you catch the reason that The the reason that you still think it's magical is because you have failed to push through when you start to go downward All right, so what I want you to do is I want you to One go out and start creating the good momentum that you already know how to create and then two when you start to feel yourself Get comfortable or you start to say I'm doing good or you start to say oh shit. I'm doing good It's only a matter of time before things bro That's where you need to double down on your focus. Okay, you need to use that thought as a as a trigger for you to To focus harder as if you understand that it's about to go down and you're going to try and stop it And once you work through one or two of these down cycles dude You're going to gain so much confidence in your ability to execute that you're probably going to eliminate these things all together. So Dude I know this is hard for you right now because it's something that you're learning But brother, I'm telling you dude once you go through this once or twice You're going to be like why the fuck did I ever let myself fall off the track, you know, so Uh, just learn to identify when you start to come down and then double down on forcing yourself through those those low times until It gets better again. All right, so in 75 hard program There's there's like there's this phase like day 50 all right where it starts to get really monotonous and really hard And the whole point of that phase is for people to identify that man This is boring man this sucks man and then to do it anyway and to push through and force the momentum to come back So what they're doing is they they're creating massive momentum They're feeling it start to dip because it's monotonous or they're doing good or they're telling themselves Oh shit, I made it this far. I'm going to crash And then they continue to force through and then it teaches them that fuck dude. This is all in my control. So That's how you need to think of it bro, and I promise you dude This is not something that you can't fix. It's very very simple to fix You just have to identify when you're starting to slide and then you have to make sure that you push through Uh, intentionally and consciously when that starts to happen and once you do that bro You're gonna you're gonna get the confidence you need to understand how one how to identify that and two how to bridge those times moving forward Right on just talking to you right now As a big step already bro. Hey bro You just gotta go on do it dude. I promise you this is not that complicated. It's just It's difficult for you because you've been spending your whole life going up and down and up and down and up and down And you've told yourself that this is how you are And while it might be how you've been you are now making a Conscious decision to not be that anymore, which means you are no longer that does that make sense No, that's yeah right now if you make up your mind you're no longer that guy now you're a new guy All right, and the new guy is gonna make sure the new Gus is gonna make sure that When the things get slow, I'm gonna double the fuck down and make sure I push through because I have a big purpose I have my son watching me. I don't want him to grow up watching me go hot cold hot cold I want him to show what it looks like I want to show him what it looks like to push through and and bridge these gaps when times are tough And to be honest with you dude that's probably the most important lesson that you're ever gonna be able to teach him Yeah, so you got it bro. I appreciate it brother. Yeah brother. Well, I appreciate you. I appreciate the call and I appreciate the support Thank you, man. You're doing bro. I appreciate it. All right take care Gus. I'm going you too I think I think that's one of the it sounds like it's an awareness thing that people it is But once they once they get the awareness bro see most people do this unconsciously And they and they feel they can't understand why they're ever making any progress The fact that Gus has figured it out even though he's 49 That's still way ahead of most people and once you have the awareness and you start to kind of wake up to What it is you've been doing it becomes easier to fix how the fuck do you fix a problem that you're not aware of Like if you're telling yourself hey, this is just the way I am I'm built this way. I go up and down I go up and down. I have trouble finishing things That's an identity that you're creating okay, and so you have to break that identity by realizing that While that might have been who you were when you were not aware of Who you actually are Once you're aware it becomes easy to fix So now you're a new person with a new perspective and new awareness 100% let me actually do that anyway. What's harder? Is it harder to like to get momentum going or is it harder to keep it going? I think they're both equally hard, but I think I think what's Harder for most people that are not used to go down that path is When you have good momentum and you're executing and you're doing all the things right and it starts to get harder again I think people have a hard time with that because they perceive that is like external Circumstances when in reality, bro. It's internal circumstances. It's you and Your experiences telling you a message in your brain that quite honestly just isn't true You see what I'm saying like dude, once you have the awareness of The issue it be like dude you can't solve a problem that you're not aware of Yeah, you know, and it's frustrating like Gus is probably thinking like fuck dude. I'm 49 years old Why the fuck am I still like this? Well, dude? You're still like that. You're not first of all you're not still like that I bet you didn't ask yourself that fucking five years ago or 10 years ago or 20 years ago You probably just thought because of whatever reason who your parents were or what your life circumstances are you know Who your friends are what you've been told the information you consume You Have probably learned that that's the way most people are and you just think that you have to be that way too And that's the way it is and that's just not true We have we have the a bit we are in control of most of the shit that is going to determine our outcomes Okay, what we eat what we drink the Information we consume how we move who we surround ourselves with those five things Will will give you 80% of what you want in your life because you it'll show you that you're in control of all the things Yeah, that's real man. All right, well, we got our fourth and final question For today. This is another caller We got Johnny Super It's nice. That's a cool name Johnny super S.U.P.A. S.U.P.P.A Johnny super slice nukka supper Johnny super fly snooker You don't even know what that is. No idea. Yeah, what is that everybody? Everybody who's intelligent knows You know who that is Jimmy super fly snooker I know Joe knows You do too, bro. He's W.W.F. Old school. Check Google him up Did you know yeah Oh, you know now. Yeah, all right. You see him Let me see Never seen that guy damn like Johnny super fly snooker. Okay. What's up bring him on there. Let's check him out. I guarantee he won't know I guarantee he's heard it before you think so we'll see Oh 14% hello, hey Johnny. What's up, dude? This is DJ Yeah, so heck out of here, bro. I'm not talking to DJ Johnson. Am I? Yeah, we're talking to Johnny super fly snooker. That's what I heard And you get the hell out of here, bro. I've been listening to you since 2015 if you're on the phone We mean it's in right now. I'm not AI. This is real nice real bro. No AI What's up I'm doing good man. The listen. I don't know how much time I got with you But I tell you right now like you're a big inspiration to what I do Thank you, Bob in 20 2015. I left my old career in the corporate business that take on Being an entrepreneur, I guess like I was a solo entrepreneur working for someone, but now I'm running my own company And I'm and I've been jogging to your stuff every morning for the last seven years That's what's so well. I appreciate that man. That's that's why we do this here Yeah I feel great. I feel great. I can't believe I'm actually on the phone with you holy shit Well, what do we have? You know the biggest question I have is so I'm building a team. I own a mortgage brokerage And I'm building a team and as I'm scaling I'm trying to fit people into the position that I was good at right So if I was underwriting or if I was doing sales or direct whatever it was I'm filling those positions, but I feel the position and then you know they get headhunted or they get they get poached by somebody else The because they take my talent away Now is that something I've done wrong because they're paying the more money or they see a better opportunity elsewhere and then it It messes me up because there's no chapter on that and I can't read it in the book So my question is like how do I How do I maintain the culture in the office with with all my agents? So they're not in distraught like oh my god We just lost to keep player and like now how are you guys gonna help me grow my business? Okay, or do I just or do I just suck it up and go back to that position until I find somebody like like you know Like everybody says higher slow fire fast like what do I do? Well, look first of all, you know, you're right there is no book on how to Keep people from moving on and if you are someone who actually cares about their employees And co-workers, you know, that's a hard thing man like that's something that you never really get used to you know You pour into them you do everything you can to create the opportunities and then you know Sometimes some of these people leave and then you feel like a failure you feel like it's your fault So the first thing is dude you got to realize that part of this is just the way it goes, okay? Not everybody's gonna come and stay at your company forever the way that you would want them to And your goal as an operator should be To help them develop as much as possible So that if they are to go somewhere else they can look back and say Dude working for Johnny was the best thing I ever did I learned more than I ever could there And I'm very thankful for being there And if you just approach your people with that mentality you will prevent losing probably 30% of those people just from that selflessness Of the leader actually pouring into people without the expectation of you know leverage back on them of trying to keep them to stay so If you're not doing that and I'm sure you probably are um Make sure you double down on the idea in your brain like hey look And this is this is in our brains really dude because We get caught up as an operator between you know Hey, I want to pour into these people, but hey, I you know, I don't want them to leave So I don't know what to do and I struggle with that for a long time So the way that I was able to reconcile this was to accept the reality that people are gonna leave And to understand that that's okay And my goal is to make sure that if they leave they look back and they say damn dude I'm really glad that I worked for Andy Because I learned a lot and it equipped me in the future And then that produces an advocate on the outside for what up you know for for me or for you Johnny To where those people are saying dude. That's that's a really good dude. That's the best thing I ever did And that's valuable in itself but on top of that The you know, there's a pay thing right like is your pay Where it should be you know, but even bigger than pay um, it's culture okay How are you connecting with the team to the point where They do not want to leave and this could come down to a few different issues, okay the first one is you know What is the future going to be for them staying with you? Okay, and so you have to make sure That you're not getting complacent in your business and you are constantly growing or at least you have a goal that's big enough For these people to see their dreams and their goals to come to fruition within your vision all right um So if you're not painting that big vision for them and you're not serious about going after it You know There's going to be people that come in and they're going to say well, you know, I want bigger I want more and they're going to go wherever that is so this is like the The frustrating part of a lot of a lot of operators lives Which is they're doing very well. They feel good. They've worked really hard to get where they are But they have trouble maintaining it because they're not continuing to push down the road and because they're not continuing to push down the road They have a hard time keeping people that are highly motivated highly driven to stay with them So you have to you know, this is another thing you need to ask yourself Am I painting the big picture? What does that picture look like? Do my top performers have a vision within that picture to where they can gain everything that they're looking to gain in their life? in that vision So you know sit down spend some time with that and if you need to expand that vision do it And then make sure that you're communicating that all the time it should become a common Core element of your communication when you talk to your team about why it's important to perform at a high level Okay, this is where we're going This is what we're doing. This is where you want to be and that's going to be dictated by what you do today That's the the talk track in a five-second you know summary um and then in the last thing uh is You know how are you personally connecting with them? You know are you spending the time to get to know them? Are you spending time at all outside of work? Are you Doing anything to actually bond with these people so that it's more like a family than it is like a job and By putting all these things together that we're talking about you know a big vision Fair, you know good pay because let's be real dude the best talent's gonna cost the most that's the truth Yeah, you know, and then how are you doing with with your personal interactions and connections with the team and that's harder to do the bigger you get but it's still important and um By doing those three things and and and then getting aligned with an overall mission of what the company's about You know, you're gonna get a lot more stickiness from the people that you bring in Um, but dude, I got to tell you bro like it's never gonna be a hundred percent and I want it to be a hundred percent I know you do too one of the biggest things I've struggled with as an entrepreneur is when I've poured into people I've done everything I can for people. I've tried to help them progress and they just don't progress or they leave and It makes me feel like I failed as a leader and um, yeah, that's that's the worst part is that part right there Is how I feel after yeah, bro. It's it sucks because if you were on you were an unethical leader And you just didn't give a fuck you wouldn't care you'd be like all right bring the next guy in but You know This is just the hard part of being an ethical entrepreneur and actually caring about other people is that when they leave It's gonna hurt But I found you know that the way to minimize that hurt is to accept that that's a reality And then to know that I poured into them as much as I could and gave them the opportunities that I had available With the skills that I had available To help them be the best that they can and dude. I got to be real with you That probably started for me about you know six seven years ago And you know since then the people who have left I've made for the most part. I'd say it in way upper 90% 98 99% of people I've remained really close with really good friends with have tremendous relationships with and uh It's been a lot easier for me to deal with that part. You know what I'm saying Just taking it outside of work Yeah, yeah for sure Yeah, oh Geez um we lose you No, no, I'm just lost for words You know so apart apart any feels like I am giving that and I'm pushing the culture and trying to bring people to the next level like You know, I'm not I'm not coming down in my in the level of what I give I'm actually trying to step up and give the more because I put so much pressure on myself. Yes well, listen Go ahead. Yeah, no, I'm just saying like I listen to what you guys say It's like I can't run at 60 degrees because they're at 60 degrees like I got to run at 90 that's it and get up to come up to my level That's it and bro All so remember dude when you run at that pace not everybody wants to run at that pace some people No, they don't that's the hardest that's the hardest part though. I know I don't do with you. What do you do with them? What do you do? Unfortunately, they have to learn on their own dude because what happens is You know There's only a certain percentage of people that really want to run hard towards a cause And if you're a business operator that has big goals big mission and opportunity we would naturally think like well who the fuck wouldn't want to do this We got fuck we got the most opportunity that any company could ever have I know but why do I focus on the ones that are like I don't like why am I focusing on them so much and not the guys at 90 and the guys at 90 are saying You'll spend more time with me. Yeah, well spend more time with me I'm like I know I got it. I want to help these guys at 60. Well, why do I do that? Why why is that like that? Well, you got to understand human psychology Okay, if you spent more time with the 90s. Do you know what those guys at the 60s would do? They'd become 90s. No, so they could get your attention So your guys are actually right so shift so make that shift then yeah, absolutely bro Get reward the people who do the shit you want Help the people that are on the lower level and and guide them and say hey if you want this you got to get to this level and They you'll you'll be surprised but your employees are giving you a very Important indicator which is you know Hey, man, uh, we're out here doing exactly what you say and you're not giving us anytime But you're giving these guys time and they're just dragging us down. So Dude, it's just like on the internet, right like a lot of these personalities You know, they all they talk about is the people that hate them and they never give any credit to the people that actually love them And then the people who actually love them get disenfranchised because they don't get any love from the the people they're supporting So if you really want those 60s to go to 90s the best possible way is to treat the 90s the way that the 60s actually just want to be treated And then showing them that they will get that treatment when they get to the 90 I mean look That that's just the reality of the game and our nature Because we give a shit is to look at people who are the 60 level and say bro This guy's got all the potential. He's got all the tools. He's got all the ability. He could do this And and then us like going and trying to get that out of them, but do it a lot of times that you know You can't force someone to Progress when they're not ready to progress and sometimes dude unfortunately They have to wash out of your system a place that actually cares and then go out there in the real world and figure out that no one actually gives a Fuck about them and then they start to appreciate what they had with you and you know that that's happened a number of times in business for me Where I've had people who were frustrated who went through a hard spot Who thought that this wasn't for them they went out in the real world and realized holy shit Nobody cares about me out here. Yeah, and then they they come back and do when they come back They're different people they become top performers. So It's a big heart thing. It is but dude you where they have a big heart than not You're gonna win more by having that big heart that that he has and that that I have Then you know behind quote but behind closed doors that big heart hurts. I know bro No one's around. I know brother, but listen you gotta understand You're not gonna bat a thousand dude. You know what I'm saying like fucking you know 300 in the fucking major leagues. You're gonna be in the hall of And you're making and you're making the hall of them. I know I know so just remember that bro It's not you that's the nature of the game do the best you can do it with the right intent When those people leave just understand that's a part of their life. Don't take it personally and then you know honestly You know you're gonna be fine dude. It's just it's just the game man And it's it's a hard thing and you're right. There is no book for that You know and it's you know what really sucks about it bro is that people assume that you know Business owners or entrepreneurs get some sort of joy out of firing people or some shit. It's like No, dude, it's the most dude the first time I had to fire someone I fucking cried I cried for like three hours afterwards because I felt so bad about it So yeah, I'm with you dude. I know about you. Yeah, bro. I'm with you dude But listen don't change that Just change a little bit of your techniques remember what I said get focused on that culture and that purpose and You're gonna create some more stick stickiness the the longer you do it the better you get out of two So keep that in mind you know what I'm saying you're still you know, you're still pretty young in the process So yeah, we fast forward another 10 years dude. You're gonna be teaching other people how to build cultures in their company so You're that's the goal. Yeah, my opinion here is that you're doing everything right and you're just struggling with something That is the reality of what we have to struggle with this business owners Which is losing people that we see potential in that we care about and And dude unfortunately us just not something we could control all the time We can do all these things we talked about and make it better But you're still gonna have that and it's dude you can't let it each up It happens to me every day it happens every day and I do everything I fucking can bro and it still sucks so You know while you're an inspiration man. I appreciate you a lot. Well brother. I appreciate you and thanks for supporting us This is supporting the show and everything There I won't stop. Yeah, dude don't and we what we can't it's our duty Um, but go out there bro, you know dig in and just kind of When these things happen just understand man like it's it's just part of the game Okay, all right Yes, sir. I wow. What can I do for you just go out? Now go out and win remember bro. We have all these young people looking up to us We have all this cultures fucked up You know go out and be the best you can and teach these other people that work for you Build the best culture that you can so that they can take it home and you know It's gonna be entrepreneurs that fix fix the culture in this country. So um, you're already doing You're already doing it like when you say what can I do you're already doing it? So just go do more of that and and keep doing it All right, oh my goodness I think I see your full of shit Oh my goodness. I don't care. I know my heart knows that you just man. Thank you guys. Thank you. DJ. Thank you Andy Um, I look forward to hearing you guys more, man. All right. Thanks Johnny take care, bro Take care guys. Thank you. Bye Yeah, man, that's that's a hard part dude. It is I was I was thinking about it too. It's like, you know It's like no matter even how good you are there's always going to be another company that's doing something better That's gonna be more desirable for yeah, I mean it's part of it. I mean listen dude Hall of Fame players play for different teams all the time. You know what I'm saying and You know I really empathize with him because I've never been someone who I mean less someone does something immoral or unethical like stealing or whatever that's different That's different. But like when people just make a decision that they want to move on It's hard not to take that personal because you take it as they don't believe in you You know what I'm saying? Yeah And Don't believe in themselves and you believe in them more than yeah, look there's lots of reasons But at the end of the day, man all we can do is all we can do And if you're doing all you can do you can't go home and feel bad about it You got to wish them the best and when when they call and they say hey, you know answer the phone You know, I'm saying and be there for him and dude is just right. It's so simple Dude, it's just like really just being about it being a good dude. Yeah, you know what I mean? That's real well guys Andy That was for how long I just run a Monday, man. Yeah guys.
