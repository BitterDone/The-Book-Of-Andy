What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realist say goodbye to the lives, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome the motherfucking reality guys today. We have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking internet. That's what we're going to do. That is what CTI stands for stands for crews the internet we're going to put topics on the screen we're going to speculate on what is true and what is not true and then we're going to talk about how we the people are going to solve some of these problems going on in the world. I'm just going to get right into it bro. We're going to get right into it. We got one of the homies here Devon Johnson sales AI the arch enemy. This is a good buddy of mine. If you guys don't know he owns an AI company sales AI number four 38 on Inc's 5000 list. So you guys are killing it. You're a young man. Hold you 28 28 years old. Paving the way with AI bro. It's pretty cool. Yeah. Running a real company. Yeah exactly. Not rug pulls on meme coins. Yeah. Yeah. No shit. Not a coaching courses on how to suck balls. So it's discounted right now. Everybody stealing your course. Yeah. That's how you are you innovated that field. You know this and ball sucking. But pay me. Yeah. But anyway we got some things we were going to talk about today about we you know we talk consistently about AI and the impact that it's going to have and we're going to get to that for sure. But you know we're going to keep it real with CTI and before we get into that man like just so people kind of know what you do and how you got here and everything given you know a 90 second rundown of who you are and what you do and yeah. So from Indianapolis Indiana grew up in a suburb called New Palestine Indiana 30 minutes east of downtown grew up my mom worked three jobs keeping me in a good school dad was in car straight for 12 years got out found out quickly he was a street pharmacist that's how he broke it down to me. So street pharmacist. Yeah. That's a new legal right there. So um that's why people call it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So who my dad I know what it called. Yeah. Yeah. He's just got. He was a street elusionist. Yeah. Like they were playing almost. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a new pharmacist. Yeah. So mom and dad never married got to see two different sides of the aisle. You know hardworking mom to barely put food on the table and and my dad that had money come so fast he didn't know what to do with the ultimate was his demise. Um you know overdosed and got caught up in the crazy. So growing up I knew I wanted the the money the lifestyle didn't know how so I got into entrepreneurship. I started by flipping sneakers. So I resold Nike's Jordans Yeezy's. I got my start on a scooter and I would do Craigslist deals back in the day. So Craigslist was like Facebook marketplace for um the back it before Craigslist store round. It is but it's scary. It's just like close encounters. Like hey I saw you at the grocery store. Bro it's scary. Yeah. What it is now I've went on there just just curious what it is nowadays but uh yeah just hustled my way up to get my first car and then I was doing sneaker trade shows and in the NAFTA high school graduated um and got into digital marketing because sneakers it was my first adversity. So everything used to release in stores that was exclusive but then it went to apps only. So Nike would release their shoes on their app etc etc every brain and goat and stuff like that. Yeah. Goat is actually a reseller platform. So those are authorized resellers or guys like me or you that have exclusive shoes that want to sell but they verify them to make sure you're buying real uh shoes. But um yeah once that happened it was very hard to get inventory and everyone knows in business no inventory no sales right. So that was my first real adversity. I got into digital marketing. I had three failed businesses and then my first success was a company called Connected. It was a LinkedIn recruiting automation platform for corporations ranging from small to enterprise. We grew that business to a couple hundred employees had a sale of in October of 2023 and we took some of the framework that we originally were building into Connected and wrapped it into what we call sales AI now. We were in the early days of AI with the previous product so it wasn't new to us but we knew you know basic business philosophy right for me is when there's a gold mine manufacturer shovels. So I like to build tech platforms that people can easily use the best of the best and so we put everything we had into creating the easiest platform to actually make money with artificial intelligence. So sales AI is AI agents to take inbound phone calls work leads and set qualified appointments for your sales but also handle inbound customer support ticket filings orders refunds etc etc. Cool. So that's awesome bro and you know you guys Devin's been here before we're friends yeah you know your family guy man of faith yeah man of faith married two kids between work kids and Miss Leah's hobbies in church that's all I do very boring guy it's very routine so well most successful people are yeah yeah how how old were you when you when you started the sneaker game 15 15 years old man yeah yeah it's 15 so there was a life event that kickstarted it yeah but I was trying to respect the 90 seconds so the life we got plenty of time yeah so the life event that happened to kickstart selling sneaker wasn't like I woke up was like I'm motivated to go make money so my sister was diagnosed with register blastoma brain cancer and when that happened my dad was an individual that ran from problems versus facing them so there's another key lesson I learned young and left my mom high and dry for every year my mom had to move into the hospital take care of my sister so my sister was in Riley Children's Hospital for over a year my mom lived at the Riley home which is like apartments inside the hospital for kids that have to have long-term care and she would come home make sure I didn't miss events or whatever but I basically lived between grandparents and on my own for a year and a half and I was like I got to figure out how to help my mom in this situation financially so my dad would always buy me shoes so any birthday suck up gift I missed the game which was every game I had a long story short I had a lot of shoes that I knew had some value so I sold my Jordans they were all retro's anyone listening probably knows like the bread 11 I had to like pair those all the cool grace to concord so I got fresh shoes in school like you know yeah I sold all those I had about two thousand dollars to work with and then my first resell pair was LeBron all-star pack I got my hands on that back in the day this is one of the first shoes someone got killed over in public so fun fact yeah so that's how what kick started it then I got addicted to it right yeah I got addicted to making money hustling it was really cool being 15 and your friends are like oh my mom wouldn't give me 20 bucks to go to the mall and I pull out you know five thousand dollars like I was addicted to that yeah I did build a very bad ego in high school and I quickly got that knock down going into real business and post high school but yeah I got addicted to making money and being able to stand on my own that's awesome dude I'm going man yeah I love it dude I love it now we're gonna talk more about AI what it's gonna do to the world how we're gonna coexist with it as we get into the show but you know the show you listen to the show we're gonna go through current events we're gonna talk some shit

guys can find them all link there I was up being said let's get into our first segment headline number one Jake Tapper is entering the show today uh CNN's Jake Tapper co-authors new book about coverup of ex-president Biden's decline despite previously waving off age of concerns do you see this no yeah so Jake Tapper you know CNN guy he is now a co-author of a new book that is detailing the length to which the Biden administration and its allies engaged in a coverup of Joe Biden's cognitive decline even though he was like one of the main proponents of covering up Biden's decline it's like it's like asking like oh Jay to help you find the killer you know I'm saying it's like well oh Jay did write a book he called you wrote a book called if I did it yeah like he you know what I'm saying like yeah I was like what do you do it like what do you what do you do it and like do they got them more like I mean I have a little video here this is like a little collage of uh Jake Jake Tapper's position let's check this out how do you think it makes little kids with stutters feel when they see you make a comment like that is very clearly a cognitive decline okay that's what I'm referring to it makes me uncomfortable you have you are no out you have I can't show this so amazing it's so amazing to me that that and then try and figure out and answer a cognitive decline in Biden embraces his stutter talking about it while Trump mocks it exaggerates it the littles it he's sharp physically I mean uh mentally yeah I think the question is physically right right right and the guy who's his chief opponent is only three or four years younger than I mean you have questioned President Biden's age mental fitness ability to lead of those supporting Biden you said quote shame on all of you pretending everything is okay you're leading us and him into a disaster do you worry that you damaged him at all I don't doubt that that you got hugs and and and handshakes behind closed doors today and it may be even publicly some of them because they like you personally but I've heard a lot of really nasty stuff about you from your democratic colleagues I mean just like what is he thinking exercise in narcissism I mean false claims to the Wall Street Journal about President Biden's mental fitness and acuity he's 81 and his memory you know it doesn't seem great it's not horrible but I don't understand the average quote behind closed doors Biden's shows signs of slipping unquote the Wall Street Journal is owned by news core which is Ron Byr the Murdoch's beyond the headline there is some critical nuance here the article is mostly based on observations of Republicans with former speaker Kevin McCarthy the only one going on the record they do note in the article that most of the criticism comes from Republicans have you heard any concerns from anyone who is met with President Biden about yeah so he does that and then now he has a book out original sin President Biden's decline it's cover up in his disastrous choice to run again well I mean what better guy to write a book about it than the guy who actually covered it up you know what I'm saying like what do you think I mean it's fucking it's stupid but I mean not even just that like here's a conversation about his having like all of the stuff like what what else was covered up from the Biden's you know like it just came out just just today I believe well yes today actually that there's a Texas nonprofit with one of Biden transition team members who's on it and he runs it yeah they reaped in millions of dollars like hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020 they recorded $8.3 million in investments and 2023 that number was up to 520 million yeah you know where that money came from us now but you know where it was hidden it was hidden in that all that money they sent to Ukraine guaranteed dude dude well I get what's even crazier is it like it's like remember when I said that over and over and over and over that they were trying to milk the money out before that they knew they were getting out so trying to take as much out the big dump yeah right before the USAID comes out and says yeah we're funding half the world media and we're funding all these NGOs and all these charities you know we give sorrows $260 million for his you know open society foundation he turns and uses that for prosecutors and fucking bro yeah it's crazy we've been we've been we've been we've had our own tax dollars weaponized against us it's fucking insane bro well like the other piece of it too let me see where is it at the other piece of like so since March of 2024 HHS has paid $18 million per month to this facility and pay and and Pico's Texas and there's nobody there yeah like nobody's even nobody's there answers please yeah no one never get them yeah everybody's guilty bro yes it's it's it's not just Democrats it's there's Republicans too it's this conversation nobody's ready for dude that's what I'm saying and these guy this is the system dude they come in they all know the secret handshakes and the backdoor deals and how it works and this is why we have so many people that go into government and never come out and why the government currently attracts the kind of people that it does you know we don't have a bunch of patriots up there guys like we don't have the best and brightest we don't have the people who are building culture and society serving in our government for the most part we might have a couple people but I mean what what two two percent of them yeah I mean very very yeah so I mean like you know you know crookery attracts crooks you know I'm saying and crime attracts criminals and and these people are fucking snakes and we all know it but you know nothing's being done about it and I don't I'm losing faith that anything's gonna be done about it yeah like where would you start though you know there's so much that's been done to this point it's like like everyone at some point is probably dip their hand in the cookie jar you know it'd be like the whole government would have to first you know I'd be what it takes yeah you know I know that's that sounds crazy but you know this this is what fuels revolution dude when you have a small amount of people that oppress a large amount of people eventually the large amount of people figure out that they're the large amount of people and revolutions happen and these people I believe are playing with fire I I believe that a revolution in this country is on the horizon if the current administration doesn't drastically clean things up which you know I'm hopeful for I said I would give 90 days to see what happens there's things happening that are decent but you know I want to see some arrest dude I want to see some people held accountable I want to I want to be able to trust that we're going to prosecute criminals not just you know the citizen criminals but the government criminals too yeah and uh you know there's an unfair double standard going on in this country and it's not between uh you know different races it's between social classes and you know I know you guys you know you might say well you're in that cl- no I'm not in that class I'm not a political I'm not in the political ruling class I'm an entrepreneur you're an entrepreneur right trust me if we were in the political ruling class shit would be a lot easier to be in business you know what I mean um but these people can't create so they steal our shit yeah and that's what we're dealing with man and it's not Democrats only I think it's heavily Democrat but I think there's a lot of Republicans that understand what's going on that aren't willing to do anything about it because dude it's like you know it's like we say on the show man attorneys all run together dude like when you get in a lawsuit most people have never been in a lawsuit so they don't know what it's actually like how it works yeah like like people around I'm gonna sue that person for this and this and this and it's like dude here's what's gonna happen you know these stories that you read about or someone gets 50 million out that's like the point zero zero zero zero zero one percent of lawsuits and most lawsuits what happens is you hire an attorney that attorney files a case the other person's attorney knows you're attorney they get on the phone and they say and they do a strategy talk they say hey DJ I got a guy I got I got Devon over here he wants to sue your client he's pretty fucking pissed yeah um you know I think he's got a pretty good case but I think we should make him walk through all the process and you guys should wait to settle because dude will both get paid you know those conversations happen oh yeah and people don't believe that why do you think these motherfuckers play golf together why do you think they go to dinner together why are they having a cop to the system exactly and we ain't in it and bro the the biggest group of unethical attorneys lives in Washington DC so if you guys think that these people don't know what's actually been going on on both sides they fucking no neighbors now there's some people that have come in in the last few years that maybe have come in because they actually care I know a couple I could speak to to a couple personally but I mean it's the it's it's it's the exception of the rule yeah you know yeah man this is it's while I just thought that was interesting man so Jake Tapper's doing that's the case and these guys are all together like how how do you ever get rid of it how do you get it out that does my point yeah is like they're all they publicly take one position behind closed doors it's mutual it it's bro I've heard that from people who were up there or people who have been up there like in office that aren't anymore straight to my face tell me they're like bro it's all acting I mean have you seen house of cards no I have it's actually yeah that how it is bro oh go watch it well dude he one of my buddies who was an elect a pretty high up elected official he's no longer in elected government I mean he's like dude we'll we'll sit in a room and we'll walk out and they'll say fuck you fuck you fuck you and I'll say we'll fuck them and we plan on doing that yeah it's like it's like fucking wrestling yeah yeah but they both the deal was made in the back door where they both get they both get something yeah and that's that's okay man that's that's the problem everybody's in on the take I can't fucking call them out because then that's gonna expose me right on the take bro and that's the other part of it they get they get everybody's hands dirty so that there's evidence against everybody and the person who blows the whistle gets hit the hardest and everybody else denies it yeah yeah I mean guys I don't yeah I mean OG uh oh oh Jay Tapper you know how they get them too right through the through the blackmail shit oh yeah but you know how they get them right me they send hot girls to get them oh yeah yeah that's how they get all these dudes they send them like these super hot uh like females thing yeah well I mean dude they're they're fucking they're spies yeah and they send them and these fucking spies have sex with these dudes and then they got them and that's that's how they get them yeah man

Bro, did I ever tell you the time when I got lost in North St. Louis and my fucking race? At the Walgreens? Yes. So dude, I was with my fucking tattoo artist. So my tattoo artist is a guy named Eric Marcinizen. He's the best in the world. He does black and gray only. He's, it's hard to get into him. So he comes to town and we're fucking tattooing up at the four seasons. And that's how he likes to do it. He likes to get like a hotel room and like we fucking chill for like two days or a room service, you know, smoke a little bit. Have fun. So he fucking ran out of latex gloves. So we had to go get latex gloves. And for those of you that don't know where the four seasons in St. Louis, it is right on the border of the area that you do not fucking. Yeah, okay. Like you do not go to. Beautiful hotel. So I'm in the, I'm driving and I'm, you know, I don't know where the Walgreens is around there. And he fucking, you know, he's not from here. And he's like, and so I let him like tell, like, all right, we go here, we go here. I'm like, where's the closest Walgreens to take five minutes? That was a mistake. We shouldn't went to the furthest Walgreens. So we end up like in this, like you know how on the North right there. I don't know exactly where you were. It's all section eight, right? Like in it's like, it's like section eight, like you see in the movies. I'll tell you this, the Walgreens is on the street name Dr. Martin Luther King, which for those that don't know, you don't go there. Any street in America named Dr. Martin Luther King. Don't go there. Yeah, Indies is also rough. So, bro, this is when the race like first came out. And I had a two tone, cause that's two tone race were the shit when they first came out. I had the fucking silver top and the black sides. It was fucking pimping. So we're cruising up through the, and I'm looking around and I'm like, fuck this ain't good. And I'm thinking it in my head. I'm like, this ain't fucking good. I didn't say anything to him. And he looks at me, he goes, you know where we are? I'm like, I'm like, no. So we find this Walgreens and we pull up, bro. And like within 30 seconds, my car is surrounded by fucking 25 year old dudes that look like they're from the movie Friday. Yep. I haven't seen, there's no white people. No, no, no. Everybody's black. They're wearing, you know, like white beaters and long ass shorts and shit and like, the bows. I'm like, some pelly pell. Yeah, I don't even know. I don't know what the fuck, but it wasn't, it looked scary. All right. So there was a lot of, yeah, a lot of domestic terrorist so I, you know, I always roll with my, with my piece in my cup holder, you know, so it was in there. And dude comes up, knocks on the window and I'm like, fuck, I'm like, I'm legit, probably gonna get shot and have to shoot some people. Like he's in Walgreens, I'm in some Walgreens. I roll the window down and he's like, hey man. He's like, is this the new rath? And I'm like, yeah, he's like, can I check it out? And I'm like, yeah, he's like, I just wanna take some pictures. And I'm like, all right, cool. And they took some pictures. They fucking dab me up and they fucking went on. And it was like, and it was cool. Yeah, all right. Yeah, but I was, I mean, I was definitely scared. It shows you, it shows you. Never judge a book about it's coming. It shows you, dude. They pound that fucking racist shit in your head. Like you should be scared everybody. But I was scared. I won't, but they were cool and they were nice. They was missing a car. Two days ago, I was down in Miami and I was in a 488. And there's these kids at a stoplight selling candy. And I rolled my window down. I gave them a, I was like, come here. I'll support the hustle, you know, young entrepreneur. I love that. And I gave them a hundred dollar bill. Yeah. Dude, they got so excited. Yeah. They threw the candy and ran off. Yeah. I was like, where's my candy, bro? Ha ha ha ha ha. So here's the candy. Bro, they took off. Like it was like I gave them 10 million dollars. Yeah, bro. Bro, you remember that time we did that? I remember we did that. We had a, we had a girl driving a, or selling lemonade. And we fucking went and bought some lemonade. It was good lemonade too. Yeah, we were driving a lot for our, yeah. It was fucking awesome. Yeah, yeah. We killed one of those lemonade stands, bro. I had one of my neighborhood like we first moved in. And I tried to do the same thing, but it tastes like shit. You had your own lemonade stand. Like like some more kids doing a lemonade stand. I'm like, oh, you probably set one up across. Yeah. DJ set up his cool eights, they had across the street. We'll see who owns this block. Yeah, right. Right. Well, we call it street scientists, street pharmacists. Yeah, street pharmacists. That's what it is, man. DJ's over there.

Yeah, man, guys, this is gonna add line number two. Got some more updates of some things going on in the Trump administration. Some cool things. You guys are both car guys. So this is, it's actually an interesting topic here. Now who screwed? EU Fury as Trump 25% tariffs hit European stock market and panicking officials were in the block. Will react as firmly as possible after Donald said block was set up to screw the United States. So a new tariff just went out to all European auto sales. And there's mass effects going on. European auto sales shares failed today after Donald Trump and developed a plan to slap a 25% tariff on cars and other goods from the European Union last night. And brands like Stellantis, Ferrari, Audi, they're all getting like anxious and all of their stocks are starting to see some issues here. But this was the first piece that came out. You call it the European block. He said that it was basically built to screw the United States. I don't know how much that's gonna affect the car market and how that works, but anything on that? I got all the cars I want. Hey, I'm still working on it. Yeah. Okay. I don't need any more cars. I'm still building. Yeah. I mean, look, here's the good news. All the best cars have already been made. All the shit they're making now is this hybrid fucking bullshit. They sound like vacuums. Yeah, bro, it's terrible. Like all my cars are like from 2000 to like, I mean, I got a couple new ones, but like all the good ones are from like 2000 to 2018. 18 was the last gig year. Yeah, it was the last. And last you consider the SVJ was... SVJ is an awesome car. Yeah, but you know, 25%... They'll probably just pass it along. So I mean, they really do that. I mean, I got about seven cars from Ferrari on order that are all going to get fucking canceled because I mean, I'm already paying a premium, you know, to, you know, like it is what it is. I pay 25% more. Yeah, they haven't happened. They're going to have to lower their price. That's a shit ton. That's a shit ton, man. I don't know. It just depends on how much of the market we consume of those cars. Well, the market on cars is already really down. Yeah. There's a few outliers, but... It's getting hammered for sure. It's smoked. I mean, I wasn't losing money on cars for a minute. And I've taken some Ls of the last two years. Yeah, you got to make sure, bro, you're like, you're buying the low production number shit. Yeah, dude, I switched my, I switched my... Let me help you with your, with your collection. Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll guide you the right way. Yeah, I got out of the, you know, the Huracans. Yeah, you know what? I got out of those. Yeah. My, most recent purchases have been more... I'm just gonna go up and value. Dude, or at least hold. At least hold. Yeah, at least. You know, like, dude, that's, you know, if you get the right car at the right price, it'll hold your money, you get to, you get to drive it. Yeah. So, you know, I mean, it's just strategy, dude, you know, it's just supply demand. Low production number equals sustained, you know, value for the most part. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Man, so I mean, we'll see what happens. Yeah, I don't know what's gonna happen. I mean, I'm gonna be interested in man, that's a, that's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. Yeah, I mean, look, dude, do we really, I mean, I would venture to guess that the United States represents a very significant portion of the consumption of new automobiles from all the manufacturers that you listed. Mm-hmm. So, we'll have to see what happens because there is a, come a point of unaffordability for most people. I mean, a family go buy a new SUV. Or an Audi, right? $120,000. $110,000. $100,000. That's like table stakes. If you wanna go get a new Tahoe, you're out the door after taxes everything, you're about 100 grand. That's insane. That's insane. That is insane. I remember when brand new Tahoe's were like 45, 50 grand. Yeah, I mean, you know, my, like decked out. Yeah, it just goes up and up every single year. I mean, the escalade V is 180 fucking grand. Yeah, it's insane. That's crazy, man. That's crazy. I mean, new work. You see them, you see them around. Like quite a few of them. Yeah. And it makes me wonder. It's like, okay. You know, Cara made me wonder where the fuck the money came from, the C8 Corvette. It's a hundred plus $1,000 car. There's a lot of them. And there's where I live in Indiana. Yeah. I see 30 a day. Yeah. I mean, I'm not a lot of them too. My dad's got one. What the fuck is we? Have you driven one? Yeah. They're fun to drive. I've driven the base one LZ and 3LZ and then also Z06. I haven't driven the Z06. My dad has the Z51 package. And I mean, to me, to him, it's great. He's 80. You know what I'm saying? To me, it's good. It's balanced. I like driving it, but it's, it feels slow. It, well, I mean, I also drive ridiculously fast shit. Yeah. And it just, you know what you can get for similar price. Yeah. Like the decision between a middle aged Ferrari or a Corvette, like giving the Ferrari all day. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Versus especially if you can get a V12 Ferrari. Yeah. You're fucking awesome. Yeah. Yeah. It must be a lot of USAID workers where you live at. Huh? Okay. That's what it is. Not, but other stuff that I've been going on to for the first time, you now have, you know, a legal migrant that have been trying to come to this country. They're now paying smugglers for boat rides back home. So yeah, they're, they're, they're turning around. Yeah. I saw that. So I mean, that's, that's okay. Yeah. I mean, they were saying Mexico was saying yesterday that the migrant flow is actually reverse reversing. And they have big caravans going the opposite way now. Yeah. If you cut off the tip of the NGOs that are funding those travel plans, so you know, those migrants even get here. Well, dude, that's a problem too though. Because remember, those NGOs were giving them food and water and all this shit to walk all the way up here. They're not going to be able to do that on the way back. So we're going to have, you know, these people are going to get sick and die on the way there. Maybe a real humanitarian crisis for real. Yeah. Yeah. That they created by doing something illegal. Mm-hmm. I should have never been done. Yeah. Right. Right. So that, I mean, that's going on. That's interesting. Some of the doge stuff real quick because this is also interesting. So remember those emails that doge made all the federal employees respond to like with the five bullet points of things you've done. Um, Elon got one. This is one of the emails that was replied back. So this was the act. This is an actual government employee. I read it. Yeah. Yeah. Can I read it? Responding to the email. Hi. I wanted to email what I did last week in detail. Please let me know if you need some more information. Number one, I sucked the biggest dick. Seriously, it was 12.3 inches. I measured. Number two, I got fucked by said dick. That's sex of my life. And we'll be going back for more. Number three, eight of man's ass. But he said he wasn't gay. So it's fine. This is a man writing this about man. Yeah. Yeah. You wanted to read it. I was going to read it for you. Okay. Well, I'm already in. That's already going on. Number, number, that's four. No, he's even have five. Well, it's funny. You say that because Elon also hold on. You read the fourth one. The fourth one said, decide to fuck myself with your bullshit and came. And then it's science to seriously go fuck yourself. But there's only four things. Well, that's what Elon said too. He said five items. That's only four. You know what? I mean, you can't even mad at you. Yeah. I mean, look, dude, he asked for five things. If you had give five things, maybe you keep your job. Maybe. I mean, that sounds like a lot of work. You know, 12.3 inches. Big ass hog, bro. You all right. Yeah. Shit. I'm just saying. I was like a fucking job. Yeah, I said big ass hand. I said big ass hand. All right. He's so strong. Yeah. I can't wait for. Never mind. I'm not going to say it. We can't you wait for nothing. Because if I say it, people will do it. And then it'll be all over the internet. I'm not saying shit anyway. Learn how to count dumb ass. Yeah. But I mean, yeah. You know, he counted all the inches on that dick, didn't he? I measured. Yeah. But I mean, it's still a bit of downfall. You got tears, tissues, and chocolates outside USAIDs, Feds, are given 15 minutes to clear out their desk. So I shit that people have been getting fired. That's still been on the rise. I think they're projected to have these mass layoffs completed. I believe that the date is like March 14th. I want to show you one of the videos that has been circulating, going viral, check this out. I really felt that we were providing support and care to humanity around the world because it's the right thing to do. And that made me feel proud no matter who was president. And now I don't know what to do. And I have cried every day. I think that that's normal. I have a 15 month old at home and I'm looking at him and thinking, well, what's this country that we're now living in? We're doing work for the American public. We're here for safety. And we're patriots. We love our country. That's why we're taking these jobs that don't pay us in the private sector. I'm an accountant. I do get a private sector job tomorrow, but I care about this country and I want to be here. Oh, stop. Stop that. I'm an accountant. I can go to the private sector tomorrow, but I'm crying every day about how I don't have a job anymore because I love my country. You love your country so much. You're willing to steal everybody's tax dollars and put them towards your own political agendas. You love your country. You're so okay. She loves her country. Like that woman cry like, you know, it's hard to have empathy for people like this. When, when, okay, yes, I understand you have bills to pay and you have family to take care of. But when you take half of people's money that they work for and put it into programs that support propaganda of your side and you somehow thinks that you're justified to get paid off of that money, that's not patriotic at all. What about all the people, the millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of people that struggle to feed their families because they're overtaxed? Right. They can't work anymore hours. They can't make anymore money and you take half of it anyway. Like, bro, that's the crime here. That's the oppression and it doesn't matter if you guys think your patriots are thinking you're doing good. You're not doing good and that's the reality. You're not doing good at all. You're doing very evil shit. And whether you knew it or not, I don't know. But we can't expect to subsidize your income because you picked the wrong team to be on, dude. Yeah. I mean, think of all the people, like bro, you come from regular people. Yeah. I come from regular people. Like think of all the people you know that struggle to pay their bills and like, you know, I swear, mom, work three jobs. That's what I'm saying. And do she wouldn't have had to work three if they hadn't taken half of fucking money in tax? Yeah. You know, maybe she would have had to work two, but it certainly would have been easier than it was. Yeah. And what things cost now versus what the pay scale is? It's insanity. I mean, bro, take your kids to Disney World. Yeah. Yeah. Enough said. Yeah. I bought pretzels, a hot dog, and chips and a drink. It was like $80. Yeah. Like, I just, I turned my mind on like, how do normal families afford? They don't. I know it's working up on a credit card, right? But I was just like, this is fucking insanity. Yeah. And dude, it, you know, a lot of people when I say these things, they're like, well, I don't have fuck to you care because, bro, I know what that's like. You know, like, I might not have to feel that now, but I know what that's like before. It's wrong. Still question everything. Yeah. Why? Like, what's going on? Yeah. Well, what's going on is they're taking half our money. They're spending it on things to propagate us and to believe in things that aren't even true. I've seen they sent $20 million to put Sesame Street in Iraq. Yeah. I was like, what's going on? What's going on? But you know how many times Sesame Street air in Iraq? By none. Zero. Yeah. And that's what these things are. That's why I like that picture you showed where there's nobody there. There's just empty golf carts and equipment. They have empty golf carts and empty classrooms so that they can fucking show that, you know, these things have been purchased and the rest of the money they never just checked up on. It goes in their pocket. You know, dude, it's straight up fleecing in theft of the American people and the punishment should be very harsh. And I'm afraid it's not going to be unless the people make the punishment. They're having a declare at man. Yeah. Have to demand it. But other stuff going on, Tulsi Gabbard, she inches the show today. Tulsi Gabbard says NSA employees tied to explicit chat rooms to be terminated security clearances revoked. Did you hear about that shit, bro? Not in detail a little bit. So so you know, Tulsi Gabbard, she's the director of national intelligence. There were employees that worked for the NSA. There's this like, you know, it's a chat room for like interagency communication. All right. And you know, there's threads inside of these chat rooms and one of these threads was literally just filled with LGBTQ, you know, identifying employees of these intelligence agencies. Talking about their sexual activities, their sexual preferences, 12 inch cocks. And I just got a big one. Disgusting stuff. And this chat room supposed to be used to communicate our nation's intelligence and secrets across to each other effectively. Wild. It's insane. But yeah. And so she, so let me ask you a question. Yeah. You guys tell me what you think. Have you ever seen the Snowden documentaries? Okay. And in the Snowden documentaries, the reason people hate Snowden and they call him a traitor is because he exposed how the United States was using the Patriot Act to monitor its own citizens. Right. Okay. So the reason the government and the media says that Snowden is a traitor, they try to paint it like he was giving secrets to these guys. No, he wasn't. He was giving the people the intel that our government used the Patriot Act to legitimately log into our computers and watch us and listen to us and record us. Okay. When you guys see someone get committed of a crime and there's all these audio recordings. Doesn't that ever raise a red flag? Do you like, where do these audio recordings come from? Right. Well, they come from the NSA, getting into your shit and recording what you say and all you guys that have Alexa or these electronic devices in your home, you're not understanding or you're even your phone. Like if you ever want to have a confidential conversation, you have to put your phone five rooms away because they record that shit. Every conversation, every text, every email, everything you've ever said or done on a digital device is recorded and kept all of it. Okay. And he exposed that. Most people still don't know that that's the truth. Yeah. It's still going on today. Yes. This is how they blackmail people. This is what they get people to be quiet. You know, they go and they show them their fucking dick picks or whatever they've been doing and they're like, dude, you better shut the fuck up or this is what's going to happen. And that's this is what they do. So so knowing all that that that is that is what Snowden was exposing. Do you think that these employees at the NSA who were having private chats about gay sex or sex or whatever big dicks, big titties, whatever whatever they were talking about. I don't know. Do you do you think that those people would abuse their power to spy on regular Americans when they're, you know, on their computers and phones and their pictures and all that shit 100% 100%. No doubt there's we have no privacy. You guys think that we're private or have privacy. You're insane. There's no privacy. They got every single thing you ever said ever did and that's what they that's how they control power. That's how they control other powerful people and then things like the Epstein thing, right? So we're talking about that. Oh, for sure. But dude, I mean, yeah, those people should be terminated. Well, and the craziest thing happened, right? Because like you have, so you have this thing going on with the NSA. This comes out. It's being handled. They just gabby to handle it and those again, those people are being terminated. There are security cleanses that are being revoked. Cool. But then we got switch switch over to the CIA and FBI. Let's watch this, this clip from from Jesse Waters. But Intel doesn't like being told what to do when they saw Musk with the chainsaw dozing for an aid. They started leaking to CNN. If you doge us, there will be consequences. From the CIA's seventh floor, home to top leadership, some officers are also quietly discussing how mass firings and the buyouts already offered to staff risk creating a group of disgruntled former employees who might be motivated to take what they know to a foreign intelligence service. The CIA is telling CNN that if their funding gets cut, they're going to sell state secrets to Russia. How the hell hired these Benedict Arnold's? The CIA supposed to be filled with patriots, not sellouts. And the FBI is up to no good too. Michael Schellenberger is reporting a source inside the FBI says the bureau is destroying evidence. Now, we know what their accomplishments were last week. Dear Elon, I wipe the servers cleaner than crooked. So the same employees say that's a threat. Same type of people. Hold on. That's a threat. It's them threatening. You guys understand, right? That's a threat. Like that saying, man, if this continues to happen, it would be terrible if the secrets got out to a foreign intelligence. You know what that's called, right? Blackmail. What's treason? Well, treason. Yeah. So go ahead. Go ahead. You just get hung. You know what I'm saying? No, go ahead. Do it. Yeah. Do it. Now, again, we see these things. These are great ways. They have anyway. Right. The fucking secrets you motherfuckers have. You got all the all the naked pictures on all the citizens. So you can blackmail them. You got my 12 inch cockpicks. Yeah. Like dude, that, you know, please don't release it. Well, I mean, they don't publish fiction. Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, they're with Trump. Yeah, that's true. It might be interesting. Yeah. I just want to help aliens are real. Okay. Can they publish that? I'm simple. Okay. I think they're definitely real. But we got bigger things though. Like, I mean, like these are all great things. I want what I want to know. And this is why I'm on demon demon time today. What I would like to know is where the fuck is the Epstein list? We'll never see it. Where is it at? Epstein client list release could be imminent after blackburn pushes transparency. Let them get jailed. You got to learn a hobby. She came on to another interview. She says that absolutely expects criminal charges after Epstein files dropped today after meeting with cash for telling Pambondi. But you know, the time right now is 420, a central standard time. Thursday. It was promised to be this. 420. Yeah. No Epstein list. Nothing. Now what we do know, I mean, we know some things. This is not new news, right? Like, there was a mass release. This is, you know, one thing that's going around social media right now is that, you know, vault.fbi.gov. That was from 2017. That should have been public since 2017. Nothing on that website has been updated since, you know, here's an article from 2020, right? Like, we know some of the things, right? We know some of the names that have been mentioned in court documents. We have some of the flight logs, right? Like, but again, this is not new stuff. This is stuff we've known. And even that, like, there's still names on there that are redacted that were left out of the court filings, right? This is, this is all stuff from go back. So they got Bill Clinton on there, okay? Not, not redacted, but then they got a redacted name. Right. So is that redacted name one of the victims? Potentially. Yeah. Potentially. I mean, like, they got Bill Clinton on there, why the fuck would they redact someone else? Yeah, I'm not sure. That's big as it gets. So that could be one of the victims. Potentially, man. And that is what they said. They did say the reason it's taking so long is because they have to go through hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages to make sure that the victims aren't public, you know, which they didn't have time to do that for last five years. Well, the other thing they're saying too now is like, apparently the FBI, like, there's some treasonous shit going on and they're deleting some stuff. They're holding back. I saw this letter circulating that Pam Bondy sent to Cashmattell demanding that everything gets to her office by tomorrow morning. But it's just like, I mean, again, like, how do you, how are you putting these things on and then you're still getting railroaded and derailed off the, you know what I'm saying? You, day one was many days ago, many days ago. And like at this point in the game, bro, they're risking some heavy stuff, right? Public trust is, I mean, what they're risking is the entire movement of people that voted for this administration turning against them, getting completely inflated. That's what they're risking. Okay. We know that these people are high on the hog because they just won the election and they're all getting in. But I believe that they are highly underestimating and misjudging where people are with the transparency that we expect. And I will not support this administration. If they do continue to keep secrets from the American public after all the things that we've been lied to and had forced down our throats and the injustices and the crimes against humanity that have happened over the last four or five years. Now with that being said, I am willing to give them 90 days, as I've said the whole time because a lot of my friends, when Trump got elected, they're like, dude, it's better than Biden, but this motherfucker's still going to be the same thing. And they have no faith. I'm not that person. I, I understand and you understand that when you're building a business or running an organization, things do take time to process. And this is, this is a big company. It's the biggest quote unquote company in the world. There's lots of layers to it. There's lots of shit to dig through. And you know, it takes time. It does. But look, man, if they don't fuck, if they like today, they gave the, these influencers, you got this? No, we just talking about it. You know, they gave all these influencers, this binder with apparently phase one of the, we don't need phases, bro. And you know what else we don't need? We don't need a bunch of influencers that just kiss ass and go along with everything Trump says to get the information first, okay? I mean, like, disseminated of truth. Nobody should be agreeing with anything, with everything anyone says. That's not healthy. It creates a situation where corruption happens and powers are abused. And what's happening and what's materializing is that situation, which was the exact situation on the left. When we watched Jake Tapper deny that Biden was cognitively impaired, we, that's the same thing that's happening over here now, where people are willing to just support because they're so drawn into the mega movement. And by the way, look, dude, I don't, I want to say this, I'm not turning against Donald Trump. I'm just stating that they need to understand very clearly that people expect very much different outcomes than what we've been experiencing. Yeah, not just the last four years, but the last 30 years. And to give these people, and by the way, not a single one of these motherfuckers that got this binder has gone as hard as we have gone. I've done anything. Okay. We were saying the shit way before it was okay to say when there was actual risk to saying it. And then later people come out and say, and those are the motherfuckers. Okay. And I like some of these people. I don't dislike them. But let's be fucking real. You need to be giving the information to people who are going to be honest about the information that are given to them because that's what's going to restore the trust in society. Okay. Yes, nobody trusts mainstream media. But you also gave the information to people that never criticize the administration as well, which isn't any better than giving it than the left giving it to KGP or CNN. So like if we want trust restored, we have to give it to people who are openly, I don't know, I don't want to say critical, but at least like critical thinkers who will call things the way they see it. And by them giving it to only people that support, it makes me think that they're trying to hide shit. You know, I don't know. I don't know. Like it doesn't make me feel good. I think that's bullshit. And by the way, I know a lot of influencers who have done a lot of the heavy lifting before any of those people did it, before any of them did it. You know, when there was risk to saying it, risk of losing gems. Yeah. Jobs. Yeah. A lot of the arrows have already been fucking taken. And these people sweep in behind them and, you know, it's really, really fucking annoying. What do you think, dude? You don't think it's going to come out? No, I don't. I think there would be too much repercussions. I think there's too many key people that was involved. Yeah. That's why I think it's personally taking so long. Yeah, I don't disagree with you, dude. And you know, the administration does promise transparency. I mean, it was one of their core mortars of getting back into the office. But this particular topic, I think, is going to, the can's going to go and go and go. Yeah. And it almost makes me think like, what are they distracting us from? Dude, well, you know, it made me think of something. Because that's all people are talking about right now. So what else is going on? What's happening? Right. And like it made me think. And like, you know, I've been watching this, this develop. We haven't really talked about it on the show. I don't believe it. We've covered it at all. I've been like, keep my eye on it. And we got to go to Germany, right? Because I don't know if you guys understand what just happened in Germany. But it's, it's kind of fucked, right? So you have German, you have the AFD party, right? Which is equivalent to the rights, you know, America's right conservative side. The others do make all these fucking promises on the campaign trail, bro, right? All these fucking promises, truth, transparency, bring German culture to those borders, close portations, deportation, handle the migrant issues, right? All of these things, he gets elected and then goes on the stage and is very first meeting and say he's not doing any of that shit. You got to remember what we talked about earlier. They have these conversations behind closed doors on both sides of the aisle, right? And so it's, it's a game of controlling media and controlling a narrative, you know? Yeah. And I think the more people see it, it's very, it's very frustrating to watch. I do think our biggest hope in this equation is Elon, by the way, I think he is down the like down the middle. He just wants what's right? You see, I don't see it that way. Yeah. Yeah. I see it. I see Elon with a lot to gain personally. I like Elon. I like Trump. But it makes me like when we talk about, you know, what he has to gain, it's a lot. And it is. Yeah. And so, you know, directly or indirectly, yeah, gaining a lot from it. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, he's all about Neuralink. He's all about transhumanism. He's all about AI and robotics. And, you know, we'll talk about that on the next topic, but like those are things that really concern me about him. Yeah. That's my world, though. I know. Yeah. You can understand. I do have a little bit of favoritism. Yeah. Yeah. But you also got to remember, he walked away from chat GPT because it was getting, do you know about that? He's one of the original founders of chat GPT and they were going too far with it. And he sued the other primary shareholders. And they did resolve it. But he was like, guys, this is going too far, too fast. We, we, we, we, so you believe he has a moral standard about it? I, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, there's, there's some things that I do know that I can't just say or and openly talk about. I, he has a very strong moral standard. Yeah. Yeah. But that's, that's one that's public that people can reference is when he had a lot to gain, right? Chat GPT was one of the fastest growing companies ever, right? And it was the fastest growing platform ever to, to hit a million active daily users. So and so forth. And he was like, no, this ain't right. Fuck you guys. And will they resolve it? Yeah. And look, I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying I'm not sure yet. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. There's still some, some putting that got to be put. No, look, I, I, I lean into the, the Trump administration and, and I'm Republican. Yeah. No problem representing that. Yeah. There does have to be equal transparency. You know, like, well, the trust has been eroded. It's so hard, bro. We have to have, get the restore it. It's extra transparency. Yeah. Yeah. You have to restore it by going over and beyond. Mm-hmm. And, you know, so they've got their work cut out. Yeah. I agree, dude. They got their work cut out. But I, I do believe Trump and, and Elon and the, and the core team at the end of the day, they do really want that. And they're going to work. They do have powers fighting against them, right? Yeah. Everyone thinks that when the presence in the office, they have all to say. Yeah. And, and, and reality. And, and reality. There's a lot of roadblocks. Yeah. There's a lot of roadblocks. And, guys, for people listening, I'm not an expert on anything, government. I just want to, you know, say that. Well, it would be no different if you took over a company. I think it, yeah. You took over a company that had a bad culture. Okay. And they know that you stand for these things. And that's just not the way we do things here. Okay. You're going to have your work cut out for you cleaning that out. You have to identify all the little culture cancers. You have to cut them out. You know, and that is what they're doing. That's a process. Well, like, dude, I don't like the way they're going about this. I really don't. It makes me trust them less. That's all I'm saying. Yeah. People deserve to know the truth. If, if we were being, if all of the people that are influential in our media and Hollywood are being leveraged to promote certain propaganda or do certain things or put certain messages out to us, we deserve to know those things. And we already know that USAID has been doing this. Soros has been doing this. He's getting in big trouble right now because he bought all those radio stations so that he could propaganda to do what he's doing. Yeah. And my thing is like, if they are, and if they are being leveraged, cool. Yeah, we deserve to know that. Well, that's why we have to look into a few. If you remember, Mark Zuckerberg released a letter stating that he was throttling traffic during the last elections. He admitted, he came clean on everything and posted it himself. You think he came clean on everything or do you think he came clean on what he thought he had to? I'm not friends with Mark. I don't know. But that is like, those are the things that I remember and just gives me hope. Yeah. That there are, you know, Mark is arguably one of the most influential people in the world for sure. And he stepped out on a limb exposing himself. And so that gives me hope that we'll see the way I look at that. We can go in the right direction. Yeah, I look, man, but I look at that differently. I look at that like, okay, when they were in office, the Biden administration, which are communist, he did what he could to play ball with them. And the real test would be what would happen if those progressive people got back in power. Would he, would he stand up to them now or would he just go back the way he was? He's on his new swagger. I think he would stand up. I mean, I hear you say how I look at it too. Like, I think, you know, because you mentioned a word there, hope, what is, what is hope meant to do? Hope is meant to influence change, in my opinion. Let's see, I look at hope. I think hope is meant to stall people from action to pacify. Yeah. Right. And so it's like, you know, what better way you got the American people now there's two different kinds of hope. You're right. Their hope can inspire actually for sure. Yeah. But it can also inspire complacency when people look around. And our, our citizenship is conditioned to wait for someone else. Yeah. That's how, and that's my thing. It's like, I, so you got all these American, like millions of us pissed. What better way to, to calm them down? I put out a fucking letter. Yeah, no problem. Yeah. Whatever. No, I get it. And, and I love both, like, I love all these opinions, you know, but I, I look at everything from an optimistic, optimistic lens. For sure. Most entrepreneurs do. Yeah. But there's a lot of mental training that went into that, you know, if I did not do all of that self work in discipline, I would see hope differently myself. If I, if I couldn't compartmentalize, it makes sense. For sure, dude. I mean, look, it depends on your perspective. That's right. Yeah. And where you are, but I could tell you this, I, I know for sure that the American people are in a place of, when, when they feel hope as a whole, right now, culture, it's, it's, it's, it's to paralyze. Something's going to happen. Something's going to happen. Trust the plan. It's all going to work out. Future popcorn. Right. Those, that's where people are right now. So, and that's a dangerous place. It is, man, because we, we, we forfeit our actions as citizens on to other people's backs. That may not exist. We don't know. I mean, look, dude, I, I like Trump. I do too. I fucking like his family. I like what he says. I think he's fucking hilarious. I think he's badass. I mean, bro, he's 80 years old. He works harder. Anybody I know. Yeah. You know, but I don't like the way this is being handled. It's just, I don't like it. It makes me doubt. It makes me have concerns. And that doesn't make me comfortable. And I don't like the way that they only recognize influencers that fucking only, yeah, I read with everything they say. I grew to that. It's got to be both sides for, for change to, to have. For sure. Right. Well, that's what real truth and honesty looks like, man. Yeah. You know, but like, I mean, now to you, you know, you guys are also brought up this about distractions. And, you know, because like that's always been my stance. Right. Like, okay, like the big games here, cool, but what's happening over here? Right. Like, you know, got the big smoke screen. What's happening behind that? And, you know, it is interesting and because you've also mentioned many of times, bro, like, you know, they have, you know, the deep state. I don't, I don't like here's the fallacy that I think too many people get into. Like the Trumps in office and everything's going to be just fine. Like you said, he has plenty of people that are fighting against him. We know we have deep state. And I'm of the belief that I think the deep state still has a lot of control on a lot of things. And, you know, we talked about red button pushes. I don't know. But this is something interesting. LAX is on the red alert right now because some foreign travelers was brought in the deadly disease somehow. And it infected an unknown number of American citizens. Well, I believe it was on your show air. You believe that the COVID 2.0 is going to hit. Oh, yeah. Well, it's funny. You say that because that also comes out that the Wuhan Bat Lab linked to COVID pandemic is carrying out an ominous new virus experience. And they just created a COVID 2.0. Yeah. Well, look, I was talking to Sean Ryan about this yesterday on the phone. These people who are in control are very dangerous when they are at the risk of being exposed for how much influence and how much control they have. And right now that's happening. And there could be a number of things happening here. It could be there's people implicated so they're trying to slow roll the fucking list out. It could be that Trump administration has intel that if this happens, then this will happen. Meaning because like let's be real, bro, everybody knows what the fucking Epstein shit was. Okay. Like Epstein was a Mossad operation for collecting intelligence, which means it comes from Israel, which means it fuels the fire of it being what people are trying to do. People like to say now the Jews. Okay. But the reality is it is the government of Israel, a lot of which are not even symmetric Jews. Okay. So it's a corrupt government who is responsible for an operation and it does not go to the rest of the world of Jews. Period. All right. But the problem with it is is they could know that. Meaning Trump could know that. If this were to come out, it could fuel that fire because dude, people are already talking about it. It's out in the open, dude. You look all over TikTok. You look all over Instagram. You look all over Twitter. Everybody's talking about the Jews. Okay. What happens if this comes out and it confirms that Israel was behind an operation that was raping children for intel? What does that do to the cultural place of the world that creates a mass hysteria against a certain group of people when in reality in my opinion, it shouldn't be focused on a certain race of people or religion of people. It should be focused on the actual people who fucking are responsible for it. Yeah. Okay. The individuals with names and addresses, okay, who also manipulate those people. So when we talk about it could be this too, it could be they are aware of a plan to release COVID 2.0. If this information comes out and implicates Mossad and some sort of child sex trafficking shit. So dude, this is chess and as much as it pisses me off that the shit's not just coming out, there's probably some strategic reasons that have to do with the safety of human beings. Yeah. That is being manipulated for a reason. And I think that's what we all need to really stop and take a breath about because how do you think that these people, if they knew that the whole world was going to come down on them, do we not think that they have plans to handle that? I mean bro, they have, they have a, Israel has a, they have that fucking Hannibal directive where the fucking, they launch a nuclear weapon to destroy, like if they are threatened, they can nuke the whole world. So like there's, there's all kinds of shit that could be happening here that we don't know because the reality of the situation is, is that a lot of our own government is, is manipulated by Mossad and blackmailed by Mossad and everybody fucking knows that already. So I hesitate to lump any race of people into a category. I don't think that because a black person does things, does something that that makes all black people bad. I don't think that because a Christian does something bad, that makes all Christians bad. I don't believe that when some Jewish people at the top of the government do something bad, that that equates to all Jewish people. I know it doesn't. And I think we as human beings need to have more reasonable conversations. And it's hard to do with all the big voices out there screaming that it's an actual race as opposed to, you know, individual people that are evil. And so, you know, that's how I feel about it. Like, but the truth of the matter is, the real reason it's not coming out is because it's going to implicate our biggest ally and one of the most disgusting intel collecting operations. And it's probably going to implicate our own intelligence services as well. So, you know, let's be real. That's why it's not coming out because the shit is so disgusting that the average person is going to be like, what the fuck is going on? It would create, my belief is, it simply will create more mistrust and counter-react the efforts that they're doing to try to put trust into the American people. Yeah, I mean, dude, look. We deserve to know either way. That's my opinion. And the people who are responsible for things like that deserve death. That's my opinion too. You know, and you know, there's a reason that the propaganda for the last seven, eight years has been very heavy towards, well, you know, it's been faced, right? It's been heavy towards LGBTQIA plus. But then it was hijacked by trans people and then they started normalizing pedophilia by calling them maps, you know, minor-attractive persons. And if we look at the propaganda that's been put out and who's been putting it out, okay? Which is, you know, people like Soros putting out this progressive propaganda. And we look at all the messaging who's been putting it out. It stands to reason in my mind that they're trying to normalize something that they're all complicit in before it actually comes out. Meaning, they can get the population. Meaning we're going to get the population to agree that people who are attracted to minors can't help it. And, you know, like they're doing in Europe now where they're getting little kids, they're arguing for little kids to have consent, to have sexual relations with an adult. That is fact, okay, that's happening in many countries in Europe. Child could set laws. They, a child can consent who they want to have sex with no matter if that person is 40 years old, okay, or whatever. It doesn't matter. Why would they do that? Well, the reason that I think they would do that is because it's fucking insane. Yeah. And the reason that I think they would do that is because they're so fucking into that shit and they know it's coming out that they don't want to be burned at the end. They don't want to be burned at the stake when it comes out, but they're, they're, their efforts to normalize that have failed. So where does that leave us now? And I think that's a very delicate situation to unravel when you have a government, maybe two governments. And then an organization like the World Economic Forum is made up of the most powerful people in the world. I'll guilt the of the shit. I mean, it's, you know, like it's dangerous release it, bro. Yeah, I look, that's where I'm at, too, because I've been in talking about this for so long, release it. But I do, I, that's the only, those are the reasons that I can think of why it's being done the way it's done. I don't agree with the way it's done. Right. But that's my breakdown of what could be why. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments, which you guys think that's being said. Let's get to our final headline. We got to headline number three. Hey, I, yeah. So let's have some conversations about it. I got some interest and stuff here. So this first headline is Goku, a Chinese open source model challenges open AI in the US. Have you seen this? Are you familiar with the Goku? Not super familiar with Goku, aware of it, but no more about deep seek. Okay. So, so China just came out with this new, it's from bite dance. They launched what's called Goku, which is an advanced AI model for image and video generation. Right. Okay. Now I'm going to show you guys some clips here. All right. I'm going to show you two clips. And I want you to tell me which one is AI and which one's not. Okay. Here's clip one. If you listen to an audio, you got to come over to YouTube. And that's clip two, which one's AI? Goku, J.A.B. Not only can you get a voice, but you can also get a voice. Second one. I thought the second one too. Okay. I'm going to joke on both of you because it's both. Well, the second one will look more AI. Yeah. No, these are both AI generated videos. All of these. I mean, that one looks way more AI. This is AI. This is AI. This is also AI. It's going to put influencers out of business. Bro. For sure. Bro. Yeah. Influ- Yeah. Influ- Listen. Influ- Listen. Influ- Listen. Influ- Listen. Influ- Listen. Influ- Listen. Influ- Listen. Influ- Listen. Influ- Listen. Influ- Influ- Don't want to work. A lot of them don't want to work. They don't want to do shit, right? They don't want to do things, right? They want to fucking a lot of them want to just get paid for existing. And that's kind of- These people- This is going to kill their business. Yeah. Yeah. I'm partners with an Instagram page called the AI Surfer. And if you watch all that content, it's all AI video, every piece of it. And we get thousands and thousands of new followers every day, hundreds and hundreds of DMs every single day. And every single video is generated by AI. So how long does it take them to generate a video like that? Five to 15 minutes depending on the depth of we want to go with it. And this is as simple as like, okay, like here's a bottle of water. You know, take a picture of this, prompt the AI, I need to add around it. It depends. So here's the truth about AI. It yes, it's advancing fast as the fastest technology that's ever been created. But it also still requires a really intelligent human to use it. That's that's the brutal truth, right? You know, sales AI, chat, GBT, all these platforms that you can reference. If you put shit in, you get shit out. It's still driven by the human. So I like to say AI is great, but the human takes it across the finish line. Yeah, for now. Yeah, but even Jin AI that's starting to come out, right? Videos that that's different, right? But we're talking day to day society. It's still going to require a workforce that knows how to intelligently work it, right? It's going to have an impact on labor work. It's going to have an impact on call centers and desk jobs and content and all of those that people already talk about. But it's also going to create the opportunity to upscale and upscale lower-late wage employees to earn more to be more intelligent, right? It's just like the way I talk about it is I didn't live in these days, only any of us did, but like farming when the tractor came out. Oh, you don't need a gas powered machine. We just plow our fields. Well, the guys that never bought the tractor are out of business, right? Yeah, I mean, I don't think there's any doubt about that. Yeah. It's just what are the implications of that technology on business culture and humanity as a whole. And I think that's where people are fit. You know, let me, so I'm older than you guys. All right, I remember when the internet came about. All right, I remember very clearly. At first, it was very simple shit. It was you could get online and kind of talk to your buddies. You could look up naked chicks. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like I was cool. Yeah, it was just very simple. You could send letters to your friends. You could get on AOL messenger and go back and forth. It was cool. Then e-com started to show up on, you know, on the internet. Amazon was one of the first companies that really came around. For 10, 15 years, all these companies that came on the internet, they had, they did not have to collect sales tax. All right, so because they didn't have to collect sales tax, they had a 10, an 8 to 12% margin advantage over brick and mortar, mom and pop retail locations, whether that be a grocery store, bookstore, fucking supplements store, anything. Yeah. Anything sold, they had a 10% price advantage, which means they could sell for 10% less than all of the companies out here that employed the majority of humanity. All right. And that created a situation where people would go on Amazon and they would buy things for less. So the argument used to be, I go on Amazon because it's cheaper, cheaper than everybody. And it was because they had an unfair tax advantage. It took many, many years over a decade for that to be put on to these companies. But by that time, the behavior had been modeled and cultivated for people to shop there. And when that started to happen, now they leaned into convenience. So now the consumer has been trained to buy for convenience over price. How many people will pay extra to get the shit today or tomorrow than they, you know, than a week from now? Almost everybody. Okay. So that all spawned off of an unfair advantage that ended up creating obsolete businesses that employ human beings. And I watched it happen. I've seen it happen. You know, I've watched it happen. And so now this is the biggest thing that's come along since then. And it's probably I think it's much bigger. And now we have a situation where we have technology that can do the job, not just of one human, but many humans inside an organization. So yeah, that makes sense. Like I could run my company much cheaper based upon implementing AI. But that means that people in my community aren't going to have jobs and aren't going to have income. So if everybody's doing it, hold on. If everybody's doing it, we just have a separation of classes. We have people getting more and higher pay positions and then we have people less. So my concern with AI, I mean, is where are we going to be? Because like dude, like you said, it's so fast. Where are we going to be in five years? Well, I mean, dude, Tesla's already got fucking humanoid robots. Yep. What happens when they're autonomous on AI and can like you just say, hey, robot, go build me a fucking house and three robots that have the superhuman strength that you bought for 20 grand a piece, go out and build you a house. And now you have a construction company of, you know, because like that's the biggest thing. Like all the labor guys, the guys who do houses and construction or trade skills land a pipe. Yeah, they'll always, they'll always, that's going to change too. You're going to change. But dude, they'll always say, well, they can't do my job or an artist like a woodcrafter will be like, can't do my fucker. You don't think that that fucking robot can make better looking shit than you. Like and they could do it without rest, without complaining, without pay after the sunk cost. There's no union. So dude, what I'm saying here and like, look, we can argue the ethics of it night and day. But here's the reality. It's fucking here and it's happening. Yes. So how, how do you see that playing out? Because I agree with you, dude. Like, look, if we're competing against other, like just take my company first form here. If we're competing against other companies, like let's say Nike and fucking Nike does AI and their margins go to the moon. And your margins are fucking little because of like, you're going to get put out of business and those people aren't going to have jobs anyway. You're right. So like it's, it's, it's hard as an entrepreneur that cares about their people to really understand how to properly leverage and utilize it without putting yourself out of business. You know what I mean? It's just a heart. It's, it's, I don't, it's risk and reward, right? Like it's, I mean, what do you think, dude? Yeah. Because you're a morally great, you're a great dude. Yeah. Like you care about people. I do. I'm honestly most proud of raising a family, building a team and employing people within my community. But I'm also a proponent of, I do save companies with a lot of money. I do hit Cogs hard on a P&L. Yeah. And Max, you know, maximizing that, right? So I really try to ride the middle line and not take a defensive stance of, I want to replace humans and or, you know, keep humans. I ride the line of adapt or die. Yeah. And well, that's, that's reality. And, and so I just try to stick to reality with it. I get these hard questions all the time, especially, you gotta remember, my business can work 24, 7, 365 days in your business. So let's say you have a hundred people on this floor doing customer support. I can replace that with one software. Yeah. And handle 48,000 calls a minute. Yeah. And never miss a beat. No, every single product, take the customer complaints, do the refund, fill in the tickets. All, no, you showed it to me. Yeah. Last time you were here, it would be called it. Yeah. Yeah. And so, you know, yes, I'm, I'm feeding the beast of, it could make that negative impact. But I, I tried to take the stance that lean into it now because here, here's the reality of, you're an early adoption face. You're not in your buying cycle and you're not nowhere near the peak. So this would be like getting on the internet in 2001. Yeah. Or it'd be like if first form was only an e-com business in 2001, right? Mm-hmm. You'd have a huge advantage nowadays, right? If you went all in on that, right? So that's what I try to encourage people is lean into it, become masters in these sub-topics, because AI's going to hit every industry. So if you're in construction, how can you embrace it now and become a, a force to be reckoned with by embracing it and leading change throughout the industries? Yeah. Right? What do you think the relationship will be between humans and AI? Because like, I mean, I have this other, other article that came up too. This just came out that AI chat bots posing as therapists could have dangerous and violent consequences. So now they're training AI chat bots to like be actual therapists to real humans now, right? Like, I mean, so like, what do you see? Do you see the relationship as like a beneficial one? Right? Because like, I mean, we've talked, I mean, like, there's plenty of therapists out there that do great work and are helpful. Cool. But there's also a lot that also take advantage of, you know, problems that could be easily solved by this. It's called life. Motherfucker. It's hard, right? Right. You know, so it's like, I mean, what, how do you look at the relationship of humans and AI? Outside of even just the business space, right? Like, how do you look at it? Yeah, I look at it that it's going to take time for the average consumer to gain trust and even become aware of, of realities. You know, there's certain Fortune 500 companies that I already work with that you're already interacting with on an everyday basis and you have no idea. But we encourage those companies to be upfront about this usage. And most of them do in some way, shape or form. Simply, the phone rings in answers and says, hey, this is an AI assistant with X company, right? But, you know, it's like a loaded firearm. You can save the day or you can cause havoc. And so people that have good intentions and that are in the field of AI will make the world a better place and people that have ill intentions will make the word of a worst place. I kind of leave it. Again, I take that middle, that middle lane with it. And I think humans, they thrive off of convenience, right? Well, AI is going to make things a lot more convenient. I was just in Miami earlier this week. And there's AI bots delivering food, right? You get your food in 10 minutes versus 30. What are you doing? You're going to use that robot, right? So humans are going to adjust. Well, I mean, dude, that's, I mean, look, dude, there's not a person with a brain in business that doesn't understand that Amazon's a bad thing for business. It's bad. It's not good. It's bad. It's bad for your, it's bad for your local, your local community. Amazon's not out there, responding to all teams and fucking shit like that. It's capitalism, which I can respect. But I also respect the boundaries of capitalism, meaning I think there's ethical capitalism and I think there's unethical capitalism. And I think, you know, when we start talking about convenience and, you know, like, okay, what? Like, when you start tying this all together about where this is going, it sort of makes sense as to why they want to depopulate the planet. Because they don't fucking need a workforce anymore. They don't need UberEats. Yeah, I mean, you're in deep here. Andy. I know. Yeah, but like, promoting, well, no, but what do you do? What do you do with all the people who aren't going to have a job? I mean, do they go on universal basic income? Like what? Because that's the opposite. Well, there, there, there's early outlines of that. A form has been created to help offset the impact of artificial intelligence into day-to-day jobs. That is a real thing that is in place. Okay. So you're saying they're trying to make some guidelines about it? Yeah, they're also trying to make, I do some advisory work on, you know, the governmental use of AI and whatnot. And they are working day in and day out right now on how to set the guardrails. Well, that's hard to do, bro, because what China doesn't say any? Correct. It's like GDPR, then the United States doesn't have anything, right? It's like Canada has castle. Again, we don't have anything, right? It's going to create unity worldwide to create that standard. But right now where it's the reality of it is, it's state by state. And fun fact, do you want to guess what state has the most advanced AI policies? Any guesses? Mm-hmm. It's Indiana. Indiana is the most advanced AI government in the United States. And what do you mean by like as far as like regulation wise? Proposed regulate, again, all of it's in proposal. Yeah. Right. Because it's the way they're going about it right now is from the big governments. They're trying to take it through TCPA, which that was created 20 something years ago when it was trying to stop spam robots and whatnot. It's not even, they're trying to lump it into cell phone calls when it's totally different. So they're messing up there. That's why it keeps getting up and down, up and up. And they keep saying, hey, now here's this regulation than taking it down. They just took it down again on trying to put TCPA regulations on AI generated use for business. Sorry, it's gone in already. But no, what I mean by that from state of Indiana has been implementing AI for like six, seven years now, they're in their government building. There's three floors that's AI of how to use data faster and make better decisions. I mean, their their intentions and how they're going about it is awesome. It's how do we make the convenience of the everyday worker better? Yeah. So they're going about it great. But yeah, they're the most advanced in the United States. So what do you think, because I have an opinion on this, but what do you think? Like let's just talk about the influencer thing for a minute, right? Because influencers have created a situation where people who otherwise don't have, it's made content creation a career, all right? Correct. And a lot of people make a lot of money doing it. Clearly, and Gary Vee talks about this too. He's like, dude, influencer, you fucking done. Like you're done. And I can tell you why they're done. They're done because managing influencers and egos that go with influencers is nearly impossible. That's insane. They don't want to post the right way. They want to do things their way that are ineffective and then you have to pay them. And it's just become this fucking huge cluster. So now there are good influencers that do really good things and they try hard. How do you feel people like that, or even just people who want to have a career? Because look, man, part of being fulfilled and part of being happy as a human is, you know, happy is not skipping through the field of daisies, doing nothing. Like we are built as human beings to contribute, to create, to become. And that's what creates a lot of fulfillment for a lot of people. And, you know, I spoke about this long before. Trump did, but Trump got on stage and said, oh, you know, why depression's such a big deal because people are fucking lazy and they don't have enough shit to do. They don't work hard enough. It's really hard to be depressed when you're working really hard. It's really hard to be depressed when you're creating and contributing and focused on becoming. And he's correct there. So if we make a world that's more convenient, what's that going to do to the mental health status of humanity as a whole? That's a concern of mine. But speaking on, and by the way, this is no way me denying that this is going to happen. It's fucking happening. Sorry, the shit's out of the box already. So if you're a person, right, and you're like in a company, and you know that your job is vulnerable to being replaced by AI, what do you think? How can people defend themselves around those things? Well, right now, and again, going back to buying cycles is you're still in the very infancies of it. And so people that latch on and realize, AI's not going anywhere, have a huge advantage within large corporations because most large corporations have antiquated leadership styles and very slow to adopt. There's companies still moving to the cloud and still implementing CRM. So I mean, it's been right with 20 something years of that technology, right? And seeing in our government, the store used typewriters, bro. Bro, the government still fucking stores paper files in mines. Yeah, it's insanity. So if you're in that, okay, this is happening. I'm going to be, I'm going to lean into it. You actually have a path to make huge impact within that corporation and create such a layer of protection for yourself because you'll be a source of truth. You know, a lot of leadership and a lot of big companies are older. Yeah. And they can barely even get on their iPhone and open up Facebook, let alone understand the capabilities of implementing AI into a 10,000 person organization. For sure. Right? Yeah. So the young generation that's in the workforce now needs to learn technology needs to learn the technology and figure out it because they will replace, you know, you don't run a company when you're a hundred. So that leadership's going to cycle. And those young leaders are going to step up to the plate with proactive agendas to be able to keep the organization going. So I think it personally, I think it's one of the greatest opportunity zones the world has ever seen. Yeah, for some people for sure. No doubt. But you go to lazy, but you get your lazy people. It just shows up. They're going to get crushed either way. They're going to get crushed either way. That's the reality. So they're getting crushed now because the same thing. It's just it's different. What do you do? But yeah. So so on the influencer standpoint, how I see, I think influencers that that are very authentic and have the ability to create an actual connection with people will be fine. They'll be fine. They will they will you will be the anomaly and make it will make you more valuable. But bro, that just isn't the culture and influencers anymore. No, it was in 2016. It was in 2018. But now it's everybody's fucking Tom Cruise, bro, and everybody's a celebrity. And you know, I'm not posting it like that. Well, that's the way that converts. Well, that's not in that's not in my brand dynamic. Well, then fuck off. Yeah. You know, like and dude, those people are all going to get replaced with these people because you can't tell the fucking difference. No, bro, there's AI pages right now of only fans, chicks that fucking have that are making fucking millions of fucking dollars, bro. And it's a fucking cart. It's a fake. It's not even a real person. Yeah, wild. Again, we have a page that does almost 400,000 followers. We started with zero, just like everyone else, right? Yeah. And we did that any year. Yeah. And all those videos is AI. Yeah. It's insane. It's crazy. Yeah. That's wild, man. This stuff was dude. You know what I like dude, you know what really scares me man is when these fucking things, like isn't it possible for AI to become like its own prompting source, meaning like right now you're saying it can it already happens. Okay. So so it so it doesn't really matter the intelligence of the human because eventually they're going to be prompting themselves. So a is the first computer program that one plus one doesn't equal to it could be one plus one equals a black hole, right? So if anyone, what do you mean by that? People don't understand how prompting this gets this and no one has exactly figured it out. You also got to understand AI has been in big business since the 90s. Just no one could afford it. Like unless you were Microsoft or Google, you couldn't afford to have a data center that burns $3 million a month in hydrogen and everything to run these things, right? But now the open source models like chat GPT, they were the front runner have brought it to the average person, right? It's it's like the cell phone evolution, right? A cell phone used to be $50,000 and weighed 200 pounds, right? It came in a bag. Yeah, I've seen pictures. I didn't see those days, but I did. Yeah. Yeah. One is the car. Yeah. But now ever if you don't have a cell phone, like what are you doing? Right? You know, so we're going through that that that evolution and but yeah, people think AI was like this new thing and it's been around. It is new for people. Yeah, it's been around a long time though. What do you think of like Terminator? So I'll be serious, bro. Like here's what fucking scares me. Here's what scares me. You've seen fucking Terminator. What's that movie? Will Smith? I am robot. Okay, what fucking dude? We see this shit like, all right, man, that robot's pretty cool. What happens when it starts thinking for itself? And what happens when you say something? I was doing that. What happens when the AI wants to fuck you chick, right? And then all of a sudden it beats your ass and it lasts long in two minutes. You want to say I'm saying like that's dangerous, bro. You want to watch a really awesome TV series. Watch Cassandra or Cassandra on Netflix. It's literally that. Oh, really? Yeah. Is it scary? Like that? Is that the mom sick from cancer? And like the she hires like the AI? Who's isn't that what's the name? What's your name? No, this is a different one. Yeah. What's it about? So this family advice is it was like one of the first smart homes that was like building the 70s or whatever. Like Jarvis or something? Yeah, there's like computer monitors that can it's like Alexa on a TV screen. Okay. It's like this lady in her name's Cassandra. That's the that's the computer. Yeah, it's the computer. And the whole basement is the computer program. Like, just imagine a data center in the basement running this thing, right? And they families like, oh, it's probably, you know, so old applied doesn't work. Kid goes to the basement turns it on and this thing just pops up. Well, then they find the actual robot as well. So it starts off, robots like cut the grass and cooking like all these amazing benefits, right? But then it becomes obsessed with its past. And wants to become the mother of the kids and be not necessarily in a relationship with the husband. No, wants to run the household and there's all these series of events to get the mom to be deemed to crazy and she gets put into a mental ward. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. So yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Like, dude, like, what happened? That's the robot. Yeah, what happens when like when when when when you know, the police are like are all fucking AI robots? Well, you know, I could speak more. That's scary for me. I said, I bought it. I bought a G G1 robot. The Tesla one? No, it looked up a G1 robot. G1 robot. Yeah. It gets here in two months. Bro, you bought this thing? I did. Yeah. How much was it? I bought like everything max out like 65,000. Oh, really? But we bought it for trade shows. Yeah. What's it do? Whatever you wanted to. Yeah. So, yep, that's it. G1 humanoid. Yeah. You bought this thing. I did. Yeah. You're going to have it in your house? No, no, no. We bought it for trade shows. So, we we have a big release coming out with HubSpot. And so we got a G1 humanoid for our trade show booth for HubSpot inbound event this year. And this bro, Timon, the motherfucker's doing a karate kick. Oh, so when you buy it kick your ass, man. So when you buy it, they actually show you a video of it doing everything you see here. Yeah. Bro, look at that. Well, look at that one right there. It's kicking that d's ass. Yeah. Um, you know, so you you prompt it. You prompt it. Look, they're fighting. It's already happening, man. All right. Now, where is the picture of him fucking his wife? Like, where is that? No, no functional, uh, no people. Sure. I mean, he's to my knowledge. Uh, but yeah. So, you know, I could speak to how life's going to look here in a few months. If you were bringing me back home, I'll bring it. I'll bring it and you can fuck with it. Bro, what if you what if you get home and I think kicks your ass? So you want to you want to know a real like you got a free? No, I'm not. It has a kill switch. So you got get to a first dog. It's on your phone. It's on your phone. But uh, anyways, so you want to hear like a real issue we're dealing with in the company. So we got this thing, right? We can't find insurance to cover it for the show. There's probably not done exist yet. Let's see, see, like it's going to this stuff's going to create new industries is what I'm leading to. Yeah, right. You're going to have to have insurance on these fuckers just in case it goes rogue. Yeah, you know, yeah. Um, also, you know, these humanoids, uh, their batteries are only good for two hours. So if it goes rogue, you know, I'm a tired. I'm out. Yeah. I'm tired out of max. Robo or so fucked is too. We're all fucked. And so the hands, um, it, it can sense like it's picking this up. Yeah, versus like shaking your hand. Oh, so it's not going to be like, yeah, it's totally wants to. So it can like, it can like, like, detect like physical, like a human skin. Yeah. Bro, you guys covered this in I robot, dude. It's like, hey, you can't do this to people. And then that sunny, he starts doing it. Yeah. Yeah. So we, we are doing it to, I gotta see this thing, uh, program it. We're going to program it. You program it. I'm surprised that thing is only 65 grand. Yeah. I mean, it's out of China. Yeah. No shit. So, um, we're going to program it to give demos of sales AI. So that's what we're doing with it. And I am not at trade shows. I am going to see how to get it to do that. Now they got fat ones there. That blue wonder. So I wasn't, I wasn't on that's DJ. That's DJ. Bro, special edition. I ain't got way to no more fast food lines. Oh, right. Yeah. I'm okay. Bro, listen, I think it's a pass for me. I mean, that's cool. You know, I'm, I think I'm cool on it, man. I'm, I'm very concerned. I mean, like, any else, I'm going to ship one to your house. I'm very, listen, man, I've seen this, I've seen the movies. I've seen too many movies. Yeah, bro. And I've also run too many companies to understand like what, like what it's going to do, potentially, but like, you know, I mean, dude, it businesses adapter, die. And that's it. I mean, like, you know, consumers could control the adoption of these things. Still we fit. But they won't. Yeah. They won't do it. There's too much convenience. They won't do it. Right? I mean, like, dude, like, you know how many motherfuckers say they hate Nike and still wear Nike? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, you know how many people say they know that Amazon's not good for their local economy, but they still use it. They have a package every day. That's what I'm saying. Like, dude, people don't, they don't do that. They'll boycott a fucking company for doing something stupid, but like they won't look at it. They don't, I don't know. People don't look at it like that. They don't look at it as a preservation of their own utility. No. Yeah. Well, guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments. What you guys think. I mean, the argument for this is like, like the argument that I've heard for this is, you know, people are going to have so much more time to live their life, right? Um, I had to live your life when you broke. Well, yeah, I mean, like, it's true. Yeah. There's, it's not as simple as that as what I'm saying. No. And like, dude, what are we going to like people? Okay, like, look, let's just take 75 hard, for example. Like, when you grab someone who's never heard of 75 hard and you're like, hey, look, dude, you're going to do all this extra shit, but it's going to make you feel powerful. It's going to make you feel fulfilled. It's going to give you confidence. It's going to give you belief in yourself. That comes from the work that comes from the creation. That comes from the contribution to others and self. And if we take that away from society, there's going to be people that don't, they like, I don't know. I think, dude, I don't know. I honestly, like, it is very, I'm very good with vision. I think that's my biggest trait. It's just hard for me to see where this is going to go. You know what I mean? Yeah, I mean, long term. Yeah. Like, I really, like, it makes me nervous. Like, dude, like, because like how the military is already fucking using this, I guarantee it. Yeah. They're already making these humanoid robots and shit. Oh, well, I mean, that's been, they've had dogs for years now in service. Yeah. So, you know, my, the vision that I carry with it is it will make some negative impact, but ultimately we'll create a whole new realm of business opportunity and capitalism. Because think about industries that still suck. Law sucks, banking sucks. All these industries that haven't created convenience are now for the taking because of artificial intelligence, which creates all these submarkets and niches to serve. I could certainly see where it could clean up a lot of corruption because it could be black and white, but I could also see, I mean, we've seen this in biases in chat GPT and in these other prompt AI services. Like, so it's, you know, some of them been programmed with with biases, you know, so it's like, I don't know, dude, like, I really know. That's why I wanted you to come on and talk about it because I don't think anybody knows. I mean, I think, I think you think you know, but like real talk, we don't know. No, no, no. I told you earlier in the show, I don't claim to be an AI expert. Yeah, well, you are. You are an AI expert, but we still, we just don't know how it's going to evolve. Yeah, I'm a good idea. There's too many, too many paths, but like the reality of making strong business decisions with AI is you don't just go all in with one. So how we approach that sales AI is a platform that services the customer, but I am not married to a single large language model, which that's how these things get created, right? We use the best of the best for the situation. So if you have a use case for sales, there's a specific large language model that is best for that. If you're using your for customer support, there's a best use case for that, right? What's a large language model for people that don't know? It is a composed stack of computers and data centers that process data and anything and everything on the internet faster than a human can blink. And so that's what creates, that's why when you talk to AI, it's not one plus one equals two. If you ask to add you to a question, I'll create all these scenarios because it knows everything. It's linked to everything has ever been put on the internet. And that's why well, that's another thing like some of the information that it comes out with is not true. Like, for example, none of the information on me about my company's income, my income, my address, my age, none of that shit's correct. Right. None of it's correct. Intentionally, and I don't report, none of my companies have reporting to the public. Yeah. None of them, this is all, so it's all estimates. But when you type in, it comes up with numbers and shit, it just makes them up. So like, there's that too. Yeah. Right. Like, how do we know what the information was the accuracy? Correct. And like, speaking to our company, you do not, we isolate your use case and your business for you. We don't take your data and then make XYZ customer better because we're using your data. We actually isolate that, right. When you're using our product, it is just you and you do have, I want AI to assist here, but these are the facts and you do not deviate. And it will not deviate from the facts. Right. And so there are controls. So it depends on who's programming it. Yeah. Again, if you have good intentions to make the world a better place, you can make the world a better place. And if you have ill intentions, you can do to some major disruption. Yeah. Well, listen, dude. Listen, guys, I know Devon. He's a great fucking dude. And that's why I wanted to bring him on to talk about these things because obviously I have been very anti because dude, I love people. I do too. I love, but I mean, like, I've employed people for 26 years, bro. My most proud that I am of anything is when these guys build a career and go out and get a house and a car and build a famed like I do, I'm cool. I'm good. You know, I'm saying, that's where I get my satisfaction. And it breaks my heart to think that that could change. And, you know, it's something that I'm very concerned with. So, well, it's, and but dude, what I, what I, what I want to get to though is I appreciate that you come on and are open and honest about it and help us bring some clarity to the ins and outs. And I would definitely love to keep the conversation going, having you come on as this develops over time. Yeah. Yeah. The reality is perception controls a lot of things. And so if you perceive that it is going to do harm, ultimately you will approach everything with a tough mindset, right? It's going to be really hard to break through that. So if you perceive that there can be mutual benefits in building companies and so on and so forth, you will find a massively beneficial way to leverage AI. Yeah. I don't disagree with that. I just, I like to evaluate everything. Right. Yeah. We're guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. We got one final segment for you guys as always. We have thumbs up with dumb as fuck. That's where we're going to headline in. We talk about it to get one of those two options. So with that being said, our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads, Colombian police catch a man smuggling packets of cocaine under two pay. I say a for effort. I actually already saw this. You saw it. Yeah. So we go to Bogota, California. It's not bogota. What is that? That's bogota. Where is it? I don't see a H. Bogota. Okay. Say it the way you want. We'll see what the internet does with it. Yeah. I'm always trying to help you out. Guadi Columbia. Guida Bogudi. Yeah. It's made up, man. It looks like Bogota. It does look like Bogota. Yeah. Yeah. Colombian police apprehend a 40-year-old man. It's Bogota. Just so you know, Bogota. I'm 100% certain. Okay. All right. Like you could say Bogota. Okay. I appreciate it. Yeah. Say Bogota. All right. By one get one. By one get one. Yeah. All right. Columbia police apprehended a 40-year-old man attempting to smuggle several bags of cocaine concealed beneath a meticulously attached to pay. Police are the suspect was detained. What's that one? Cartagena. Cartagena. Cartagena. Where's the H? That's what the fuck it is, man. I'm just telling you. I know this dude. I've met this guy. That's who? Cartagena. Okay. So name. Airport on Monday as he prepared the board of flights to Amsterdam. What's his first name? Huh? What was his first name? Tyrone. Kyle. Kyle. Yeah. But yeah, they call him. And so I see was going from Columbia to Amsterdam. And allegedly there to party. Let's check this clip out. Bra. Little off the top. This guy's just sitting there knowing he's totally fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bro. At this point he knows he fucked up. That's right. Dude, 100%. How do you get caught with that? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Because that dude, that's actually pretty good. You know, he went to the barber and it's like, hey, leave the sides, shave the top. All right. How you got busted? They X-rated. This is why we don't like technology, Devon. That's why we can't fucking take cocaine to Amsterdam for a good time anymore. We need the booger sugar. Dude, that was good. That was a forever though. He like put it in perfect little circles too. It's so much effort went into this attempt. You know, you know, his butt is like, he'll be here Monday. Yeah. Where's Kyle? Party start man. Where's Kyle? Where's Kyle? Carly Gina from Bogota. I always loved to meet the barber that had to give this haircut because you know that barber's like, what the fuck is happening? Bro, it looks, I mean, it looks pretty good. It did look good. How do you get caught? Did they say the X-ray caught him? Yeah, the X-ray caught him. You know how like, you know how in the dude, you know how like you go to the airport? They got the fucking, they got where you could just walk through the metal detector and more to X-ray. Yeah. That's how they got it still, right? Yeah. I haven't been an airport a minute. But the like, he's probably thinking, I'm going to go through the metal detector and then probably like, they probably like put some hurt, they're like pointed and made him through here. He's like, fuck. He forgot his TSA pre-check number. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking got him. Bro, I smuggled some fucking weed pills into Mexico one time. I did. I did. You fuckers didn't catch me either. I thought they were going to, bro, we fucking, we fucking went to Mexico and I had some metal. I don't know if I, is that illegal? Is that illegal for just to talk about it now? Yes. Is it? Well, fuck it. I went, I allegedly went to Mexico one time. I didn't do it. But if I did it, this is how I would have done. Okay. There we go. Yeah. So if I would have done this, I had some metals in my bag and I forgot that like, because it's illegal here and I forgot that it's not legal there. We're came from. So I get off the plane and right as I get off the plane, bro, there's dogs and shit and I'm like, oh fuck. And I totally forgot that it was like, because everywhere I go, I take my fucking weed pills and I totally forgot. And I'm like, fuck, I got like real nervous, dude. Like you know how like, you know how like, would you get that into the inside nervous? Yeah. You're asshole got time. Yes. But like you can't, but you're like shaken, but you don't know if anybody notices. Yeah. I'm like, fuck, dude. Fucking hands. I'm going to fucking Mexico, jail. So so dude in Mexico, like you guys who've been to Mexico, you know, like most of the places in Mexico, they got a cut, the customs is different. Yeah. Like you go in and you touch the fucking button and it even gives you a red light that and then they search your bag or a green light and they let you go. So like I'm fucking waiting in line. I'm like, fuck, fuck. I'm like sweating a little bit. And like, like, dude, I'm not even telling you know, I'm not even saying nothing. I fucking go up there. I hit the green light turns green. Fucking weed. So dude, I had like a whole, I had a whole like a whole container, which dude, I was there for like a week. You don't eat a whole container in a week, but I didn't want to bring them back. So I like, so I'd fucking ate a whole container in a week. But yeah, that's my, you guys didn't catch me. The ledger story there in my story. It's fictional. It's just a little lumpy like whoever put it on him. Yeah. Yeah. I say a for effort, bro. I mean, it's definitely creative. I've never heard of that before. No. I mean, you were saying to pay. I was like, what the fuck is the to pay? I got to be honest. Oh, you didn't. I didn't know what the man to pay was. Yeah. I thought you ever noticed that like, like, do you do Joe? You're about my age. Remember, like when we were kids are like in school and there was all the teachers and they had they were bald around the crown of their head, but they had hair over here. How come we don't see nobody with that haircut anymore? I know, but like you never see that anymore. What happened to that? Turkey. Turkey people started going to Turkey. People started going to Turkey. Half my teachers growing up. They had bald head and hair around the outside. That was everybody does like DJ does and they just shave it now. Yeah. It's a good look. You didn't think it was a good look. I was nervous for a minute there. You got a picture of your old look? Yeah. Well, we're going to put it. Find a picture of DJ's old look, put it up here and show post production. See, that's how you used to look. Yeah. Who convinced you to change it? What was that guys? Andy Cancelagai. Randy Cancelagai. Kyle. What was that name? Kyle Cartagena. Cartagena from Florida. Go to some Bogota. Yeah, man. What were we giving them? I'm giving them an A for effort. A for effort. I'm giving them an F. I don't know if he got fucked. Like how bad he got. Let me see. Let's in there. Yeah, but it's in grand. About 15 grand worth of coke. I got three years. Yeah. Oh, shit. Yeah. He's all right. I'm sure he's right. I mean, that ain't worth three years of your fucking life. No. No. No. Well, violent offenders fucking kill people get out three years. That's real. That's real. What's real? A for effort, man. Anyway, better luck next time. Yeah. Don't do drugs. I'm sure it won't be as last guys. Andy Devon. That's all I got. Yeah. Devon, uh, uh, throw, throw people your website and your Instagram so they can know where to follow you. Yeah, website sales AI dot com all one word. And then Instagram is Devon Allen Johnson all one word as well. So as the EV I in. Yeah, spell it out for them. DV I N A L L E N Johnson, J O H in S O N DJ too. Yeah. A beyond Johnson, Devon Johnson. You got 12 over there. What's that? What's that? Besides you get. Yeah. Right. We white boys got that 12 around. That's right. You don't say. That's right. Yeah. You don't know nothing about that. It's about the motion of the ocean, bro. All right. All right. Devon, thanks for coming on, bro. All right. Thanks for having me. Appreciate your expertise. Looking forward to learning more and more about this with you next time I'll bring the robot. Okay. Cool. We'll get my chair. Yeah. Yeah. Keep the first podcast that we had. Uh, AI robot on it. Yeah. Program will be racist. I want to see how this conversation goes. I'll, I'll bring my computer and I'll program it in between segments for you just give me a, what you want. All right. I'm down with it. Let's do it. All right, guys. That's the show. Don't be a whole show.
