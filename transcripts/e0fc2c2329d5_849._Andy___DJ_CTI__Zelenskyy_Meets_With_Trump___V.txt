What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realest second bout of the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society. Welcome mother fucking reality guys. Today we have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking and that's what we're gonna do. That's what CTI stands for stands for crews the internet. I didn't know if you guys could figure that out but what we do here is we put topics on the screen we speculate and what's true and what's not true and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems that all these knuckleheads create. Let's just get right into it. We don't run ads on the show. So we ask that you don't be a hoe and you share the show. There you go. Yep. You looking good man. Damn yeah. I saw you trying to start work out and I know what the fuck you're up to you. What am I up to? Trying to fucking catch up and beat me. I can't let you. I can't let you. I got I can't. Boy you look good man. Shit. You looking I don't know if it might just be the sweater. I don't think it's the sweater though. Oh it's my face. Fuck man. Like hey. Yeah. We look good too bro. Thank you man. Yeah. We went to we had a big event this weekend. Dude that was a big historic event. Big gym turns 80 years old. Yeah yesterday. Shit. We went to dinner on Saturday for a good time. It was good. That was a good time man. It's always nice. It's always nice. He was he was kind of surprised. You know he's been around man. It's hard to it's hard to get him. He's been around that many blocks. Yeah. Talk to him. I mean he fought in the Civil War. He's saying he's saying the thing too. That's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. They're about 80 years. Fuck man. That's a long time. Yeah. Still moving though. Yeah. We ought to get him on the show maybe. I mean if you interview of his 80 years. Yeah. If you guys are ready for a six hour podcast. Oh my God. That is no. That's the truth. It's going to be an all day affair. What else going on? We're fucking good though man. Everything is good man. You know everything is good. We got a lot of talk about. I bet. Yeah. Let's do some cruising. Before we get to our headlines. You know always try to throw a little little special sauce in there for you. We just landed on the moon. Who did we did. We mean you know like America. Oh. Yeah. Lunar lander. Firefly blue glow. Blue ghost. Lunar lander touches down on the moon. This is first time. Uh ever. I was going to say you know I would believe this when chicks can have. You can't look back at them at the fucking old footage. You cannot look back at the old footage. Everybody. Yeah. And be like oh yeah that's totally real. Like. You just can't. If you do. I. I got you know some ocean property in Arizona bro. Like you you. You just can't tell me that's real. I'm sorry. Listen I believe this when chicks can have dicks. You know what I'm saying? Well apparently they can. Well one's more true than the other though. Yeah. Did you see that study I said you about oh yeah I do. Yes bro. The I said DJ study today and they said that they ran some studies on. People who actually transition. So one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they transition they have a suicide a likelihood suicide rate of I think like 48% right. And so doing the studies are saves their lives. Yes that's the justification for these people right now there's been a study that's come out. Is it safe? Yeah. A recent study published in oxfruits. Yeah. We know oxford they don't know what they're doing. They trust science there. Yeah. Oxfruits journal of sexual medicine sampling 107,000 people found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender dysphoric individuals rather than reducing. So it goes from 48 to 96. I ain't going mad. So. He's just counting man. Yeah. I would have never guessed. I would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis that eventually you're going to regret it. You're going to have some problems. I would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts eventually you're going to regret it. I would have never have guessed if you sowed your vagina shut and put a piece of skin from your leg as a penis that I would regret that. I mean who would have known? Who would have known? I mean I'm shocked. But I would be fucked up if I cut my penis off. First of all it's a lot of cutting. But second of all not according to Alex a dinner the other bullshit. No bullshit. Yeah. What did I miss? What did she say? What did she say? I don't know. She said something. I can't say it. I'll call her ass right now. Yeah. It's a no. I mean, but it makes sense. Bro, you can't just do that shit man. And here's the thing. It's common sense bro. It is. But here's the thing. This is a relatively new thing in our society. And the problem is that they were able to spout all of these justifications. There wasn't enough time for these types of studies to even come through. You got to follow that shit out. You know what I'm saying? It takes some time to get a good base of evidence there. And yeah. So I mean it makes sense. But yeah. So I mean, chicks with dicks is more possible than going to the moon though. Yeah. Yeah. The funniest thing about this though real quick is so you know buzz Aldrin. I don't know. He was still alive. Is he? And they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time. Reports, letter, gravity and it is stable. Come on. That's fake too. Oh, she mentioned here. It looks better than any of you. It looks like landed. Bro, you can do it. Okay. It's like shit. So that's what it really looks like. It looks like it's like a real thing. It looks like a real thing. It looks like a real thing. It looks like a real thing. It looks like a real thing. It looks like a real thing. It looks like shit. So that's what it really looks like. Here's a picture they supply. This is supposed to be who took the picture. Oh, yeah. Anyway, we all know the government's liars and we all know NASA's liars and we all know it's a massive long, money laundering scheme just like all the other shit. How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA and then filter back through different spifts and perks and donations and funding? Yeah, I was wondering if they do any real crazy shit. They fuck with any aliens or something and you know what I'm saying? That maybe is the front. It's a front for something. I'm a firm believer that the... I just said where it was a front for. It's a front for these people to get rich, bro. Yeah, but I think originally the whole reason we even did that was to funnel the money and recover up the fucking coal war and shit. The beat the Russians. Well, that was the... The original motivation. Yeah. But we didn't... Nobody went. That's right. Nobody fucking went, bro. They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War. That... I mean, that's what that was the basis of it. Race to the moon. Yeah. We'll beat you. I'll hear it every time. You might as well stop. Yeah, man. It is what it is, man. But guys, hope you're ready for a show. Remember, if you wanted to see any of these pitches, articles, links, videos, go to AndyFaceL.com. You want to make people real mad? What? You tell him that the earth isn't flat. Oh, fuck. Now, how are you listening? That flat earthers are fucking passionate about. No, listen. I mean, there's an argument. No, there's not. There's an argument, bro. We've been up in planes. What does it look like? You've seen what I've seen. I'm just saying, bro, 40,000 people. You want to stick to earth's flat? Joe does. Joe Young does. I know Joe Young does. Yeah, bro. I shelfers. You think I think I shelf could be true. No, I just for it's for it's for it's true than the earth's flat. I think I that's no. Yeah. No, I shelf theory is not about flat earth. It's about no, I'm not saying it is. I'm saying if that is true though, then it would have to be no, there's still going to be some curvature. It's like a fishbowl because you know, it's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head. Like you, if you just drew a little circle on your hat, you wore one of them little hats, you know, those little tiny ones on your head, which the pony ones are the, no, the little ones, you know, those little round hats. A condom and you would be talking like what kind of kind of hat on my head. You know, all right. Anyway. Yeah, man. Listen, go to Andy dot com. Yeah, go to Andy for sale of that. I wonder what it takes you to Andy dot com. Is that a real thing? Let's get into our headlines, man. We got some interesting stuff. Let's start with first, first series of headlines, head on number one. I wanted to get into this and this may be some foreshadowing going on. I don't know, but I saw it and I immediately felt that this is not good. So JD Vance went to a ski trip or tried to go to a ski trip. And this was supposed to be like, you know, like usually they don't announce the vacation shit until like, you know, he's already there or they're gone, right? Like that's a typical security thing, right? I mean, hell, we don't really post where we are when we're there. We know it's it after on the fucking play right home. You know what I'm saying? Like that's a typical thing, right? And so JD Vance was supposed to be taking his family to this ski resort in Vermont. Before even got there, don't know if you guys saw this. There was some some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there. All right. Now I mean DJ, what's the big deal here? Well, if you got, I mean, first of all, people don't understand the level of logistics that has to go into organizing even even a couple of hundred people together at the same time to get them into a specific location ahead of time. This spells there is a fucking leak on his detail that needs to be removed. There's no way there's no way. That's not like how would they know that information ahead of time to even organize 500 fucking people? Yeah, there's somebody there's somebody in logistics leaking. Leaking that shit out, bro. And like I said, it wasn't like it wasn't a couple, bro. It was a shit ton of them. Yeah. Vance is a trader. Go ski in Russia. Vance equals Putin's pawn equals trader. So dude, these people. Think that Putin is the problem. All the while people are being arrested for making social media posts all through Europe. Okay, we have migrant gangs attacking women and raping women and stabbing people and killing them who aren't European. Okay, we have people being arrested for praying in their homes already. Okay, and these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already happening. Going on around them. Yeah, right. Like what are we? What are you guys fighting for? You know, these people have been drinking this Kool-Aid. They're whole lives from the media and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything. All right. And dude, did you see that? That comment I got from I told I read I showed you that comment I got from one of the people who follows me about the Ukraine shit. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, Ukraine's a sovereign nation and, you know, we as the most powerful country in the world have a responsibility to stick up for countries that can't defend themselves. Well, let me stop you right there, homie. No, we don't. We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans. And the truth of the matter is is America first means America first. It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good. Okay. On top of that, we are now getting drug into an actual war because of our involvement with NATO. They're sending troops in. They would rather blow up the entire world than to have the truth about the entire fucking system that oppresses citizens globally to come out. And how they do it. Yeah, right. Right. But they're supposed to be, you know, the people of peace and love intolerance. Here we are. It's insane. We're three on the doorstep. Yeah. For what reason? For what reason? Exactly. What reason? The only reason that these people all want this war. I'm not talking about these morons. Yeah. I'm talking about the people who are actually making the city like this shit on paper. Yes. Who are sending other people's children to die. The only reason they want to do that is because they don't want the truth to come out about how all these nations collaborate to oppress the citizens of humanity. Yep. Yep. 100% man. I saw this and I got just foreshadowing, bro. This is some dangerous shit. And they definitely need to lock that shit in. You know what I'm saying? Because we've seen what happens when you have leaks in your security team. Twice now with Donald Trump. I mean, fuck JD Vance, obviously being in a incumbent potential running candidate for 2028. I mean, bro, like, I mean, be a good way to get them out beforehand. They got somebody fucking in this team. I'm telling you 100%. They need to fuck off. There's no doubt. They need to watch it. They're, listen. This administration is still full with rats. It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens. You know, it's still full of this. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so what kicked off all of this, this, you know, Putin nonsense. We got to go back a couple of days to this, this, this, this meeting that happened with Trump Vance ends the linsky of Ukraine. Now I will say this like, I mean, because we got plenty of criticism to give out here today on Trump. And the Trump administration, look what these people call him, dude. Protester held sign labeling Vance a traitor and Nazi scum. Yeah. You know, the fuckers don't even know anything about Nazi. No, you don't know it. And, and, and you keep calling people Nazis, which is just emboldening people to come out with polarizing viewpoints. The same thing they did with racism, dude. Exactly. And now people are like, well, you know what? Black people do still shit. Yeah. I mean, bro, that's not what I made it. You know what? It's almost good that they do this because they devalue their defense mechanism. Well, they're offense mechanism, right? Shut the fuck up or you're a Nazi. Shut the fuck up or you're a racist. And that shit ain't working anymore. No one cares. No. And it just exposed how radical they are. Yes. And what the truth that they actually is trying to push behind them. Well, unfortunately, also it brings, it brings to the surface the element that they claim to want to suppress. You know, when you call everybody racist for 20 fucking years, eventually they're like, yeah, you know what? I am because I'm tired of getting called this and this and this from you fuckers fuck you. Yeah, simply fuck you, right? Yeah. Like, dude, and what happens is you end up radical, they end up radicalizing people. It works the opposite of what they want. They end up radicalizing people that would otherwise just be normal. No people know. And dude, that's a fucking bad thing. That's not good for society. Like I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that, you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either. Like I don't care someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this. And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks about their own race. And you know, being a white guy that was raised in the United States of America, I've been told that I was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life. So I never made my race my identity. I never, I never said, yeah, I'm fucking proud to be white. That was never a thing. I was always looking at everybody else just like MLK says, dude, the content of their character, who they are. You know, and I think most people are like that. And I think we're getting to a point where, you know, everybody's coming back to that. And these people who are calling all the names are going to be ostracized. I know nobody's listening to this shit. Oh, we fucking know to you. Bro, you don't even know what you don't even know anything about the history of fucking Nazi movement. You don't know anything of the history of World War one or World War two or how the Federal Reserve was formed. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Period. That's just it. No, it's stupid. They don't know. And they, they use these fucking terms, dude. I'm going to tell you what, man. Uh, I get called every name in the book now. I don't care. No, I think I mean, I like smile. I wear them as badges of honor. Yeah. Well, dude, why do you think Kanye's got a fucking swastika t-shirt? Cause he's basically saying, well, fuck you, you know, and you guys could get mad about that. All you want, but he's forcing you to pay attention. And then when you look at the symbol and the history of a swastika, you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years. And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune and prosperity through human history. And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that. Now, by the way, why do you think he used that? Do you think he used that to represent evil in his mind? That's what he was writing for. Yeah, he was in his mind. He was fighting for what that symbol actually meant. And then since then that symbol has been, you know, you can't fucking use it or you're a Nazi. Well, bro, if you go to Eastern cultures, it's everywhere. It's on the buildings. It's, it's, I mean, it's still, is that not true? Say it. Yeah. Yeah. So like, you know, people like my point in all of this saying this is like these motherfuckers don't even know that. And it's like, and dude, let's pay attention. Who are, let's, who are these people? Who are they? What race are they? Oh, they're all white. Oh, they're all white. And what gender are they? No, all women. And what age are they? I mean, they're brunch or age for. Yeah. And, and what are they wearing? Oh, they're wearing North Face and they're wearing fucking the goop. 400 dollar jackets. Right. Well, I guarantee you a lot of them probably. Well, these motherfuckers, listen to you. They got laid off from USAID. Yeah. I know for sure. Listen, that group, this group of people is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues. Because they are so privileged, they don't have any worries. They fucking live in upper middle class areas and they drink champagne on Sundays. And then they want to be seen virtuous by caring because they don't have any other meaning in their life. And by the way, if you want to see virtuous, a care stand up for the fucking right thing. The thing you go, actually go to Ukraine, go fight and fucking Ukraine. I don't want to hear it, dude. I don't give a fuck. You know what? I'm America first. Period. I don't give a fuck of it. Ukraine. If it's Israel or anybody else here first, then there. And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else. Doesn't matter who it is. And by the way, if a country can't defend itself, well, then maybe they should fucking work on that. Makes this to me, man. But guys, let's slow this down. Let's let's let's talk about how we even got to, you know, having you know why the United States funds all these countries. Do you know why? Because we have to know. That's not why. The United States adopted a strategy a long time ago. They golden had gold and handcuffed these these countries. Okay. So they either say, hey, we'll give you this aid, but you can't make this and this and this and this as part of the agreement. Right? Can't make these weapons. Can't do this thing. Or they give them the money knowing that the United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation in the prosperity. Yeah. Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source. It's no different than a rich kid. Okay. You got a little rich kid who's dad and mom keep giving them money, keep giving them money, keep giving them money, keep giving them money, keep giving them money. Keep giving them money. Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality? Now take that concept and apply to a country. Okay. If you keep foring, a cutting, what I'm saying here is that we do this to handicap the other countries intentionally. And it needs to fucking stop. Yeah, bro. Take them off the tee, bro. Make them learn how to get the food. The fools get stronger. Get conquered. I don't give a fuck. I don't care. I'm American, bro. I care about us first. Do I care about people in Europe? Yeah, I got friends in Europe. Do I care about people in Australia? Yeah, I do. Do I care about them more than us? No, sorry. I don't. I care about us. Yeah. 100%, bro. Yeah, let's slow this down. Let's see where this all started because we got to go back a couple of days to a meeting that that Trump Vance and Zelensky had at the White House. And this was the first time we got to really see any type of negotiations, I guess, with the press corps being there, which I believe was part of Trump's play. I mean, obviously, because apparently word on the street is that this is exactly how Zelensky was behind cameras. And then Trump made the cameras available and everybody got to see his true colors. So let's check this clip out. I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. Yes, but he if you don't know, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for bringing it into this complex. Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have? I have been to... Come once. I've actually watched and seen the stories. And I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military? They have problems. And do you think that it's disrespectful? I've announced to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country. A lot of questions. Let's start from the beginning. Sure. First of all, during the war, everybody has problems. Even you, but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. Well, brother, that was a threat. Hold on. Stop it. That was a fucking thing. 100% that was a fucking threat. 100%. Fuck this little motherfucker. Throw him in the fucking woodchipper right there and the war ends. Nobody in Ukraine wants this war, bro. This motherfucker wants the war because him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money. Get paid. Get paid, bro. That was a fucking diet. You bro, you're sitting in the Oval Office. What I love about this though is I love how Trump is immediately. No, I love how Trump's sitting. He's letting him talk. Yeah. Let's him talk. Let's him talk. The guy gets one inch out of line and he said, oh, hold on. And then let's play a fucking hammer. Is it, bro? Tell us what we're going to feel. I'm not telling you. Because you're in no position to dictate that. Remember, you're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. You're going to feel very good. We're going to feel very good and very strong. You're going to feel influenced. You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he's happy to be right. From the very beginning of the war, not in a good position. I was. You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards right now. You don't have to see this. You're playing a secret. You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III. And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country. It's back to you. Far more than a lot of people said they should have. Have you said thank you once? A lot of times. No, it's our day. You said thank you. You went to Pennsylvania in campaign for the opposition in October. Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country. And your life. Look dude, he's dead anyway. They're going to kill this guy. Listen. Not only that either side is going to do it. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, he's getting killed. This guy's fucking done. They can't let that dude walk nor were like knowing what he knows bro. No, not only that. No, he stole. Dude, he knows we're all the money. He knows exactly what. Yeah, dude, I'm saying they can't let that do walk. Yeah, see, you know, we call it how we see it. A lot of people here on the internet, you know, like a lot of people were upset. I saw this like, you know, I'm so embarrassed to be an American. I'm so dislistened. Dude, you've never done anything that fucking matters. Okay, real talk. You've never had a fight for anything. You've never had a negotiate for anything. This is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men. Okay. When people step out of line, you step on their fucking face. And that's what Trump does. He's very respectful until that man gets disrespectful. He just threatened our country, bro. Dude, and we got people in this. When are we going to feel? Brother. We don't help. What? Brother. First of all, we got people in this country that fucking are on his side. Like bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off. Go over there. Go live in Europe. Go live in Ukraine. They'll take you. And then they'll take you to the front lines like they're taking people with down syndrome to the front fucking lines. Bro. I saw that clip. All you motherfuckers talking all this shit. You don't know what you're talking about, dude. You have no idea. You haven't been paying attention. You're sucked into your own life. You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit. And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing. You know what? You weren't embarrassed when our country was run by a literal vegetable. You weren't embarrassed when they stole all your money and closed your businesses and fucked with you. You weren't embarrassed when our whole country is a laughing stock of the entire world. Because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons running our country. Trans, titties on the front lines. Bro, we got trans generals and you know we got kids. We're promoting kids cutting off their dick and everybody else in the world is like, the fuck is going on in the US? You weren't embarrassed about that shit. But you're embarrassed about this man and this other man who have finally said, no, you're not going to fucking do this shit here. Okay. I actually thought in my opinion that was the coolest badass ass gangster ass shit that I've ever seen from either one of those guys. For sure, bro. So if you don't like it and that's embarrassing to you, then maybe you should fucking move. Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here. And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls. Okay, I call it how I see it. If he does good, he does good. If he does bad, he does bad. That's great. That's not good. That's great. That's great. Okay. This motherfucker stealing your money. You guys are out here working and that's the problem. A lot of these people that are on, they're not working. They're not working. Right. So they don't get, they don't see that tax be taken out of their check and then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy. Four different mansions and fucking a yacht and and two boot gotties. He's got two books. Yeah. Damn. Are you cool though? I mean, as you see the bad body is true. It's fair. I'm just saying dude, like that's not that's not okay. No, it's cool for me to have to. But you know, but I didn't you know, I instill your fucking tax dollars do it. Exactly. You know, like dude, fuck this guy. Yeah. Well, so this is what started the whole chain of events, right? So you got his mother fucker. I can't stand it. And I can't stand people standing up for it. So it's stupid shit. But after he left the, the, the oval office, he decided to go back to Europe and he did a little. Did you already said today about the, about our, our troops? You got that clip? I can put it in. Bro, this guy gets on television today. You don't have to get it in there. But you, you guys can look it up. This guy gets on TV today. Today is Monday. Okay. You're hearing this on Tuesday. And he fucking says the United States is going to have to send his sons and daughters to fight in Ukraine. And they will die. That's what he said is almost verbatim exact quote. Dude, if we send a single soldier over there, like a single fucking soldier, this administration is no different than any other one. 100%. Yeah. Yeah, 100% man. But yeah, I mean, he goes over, goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour. So he stopped, stopped in the UK. He went to the UK first. He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food they got over there. Gordon Ramsay's only wanting us to make food over there. That's why he's so fucking famous, bro. That's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous. He's only one over there. He knows how to make food. But yeah, we got one. He goes to the UK. He meets with King Charles. I mean, this is right after he got kicked out the White House. I don't know if I've had to verify that. He was kicked out the fucking White House. After that fucking meeting, they were both having a joy. He went on a Brett bearer somebody in like half a pile of drives. Half a pile of drives. Listen, and dude, real talk. The motherfucker has never said thank you. Ever. He's come here and threaten us multiple times. Remained. When he dude straight up demanding that we do this, demanding it. Demanding it. Dude, who do you think you are, little man? You know what I'm saying? Like, bro, I'll beat your fucking ass. So fucking, oh, just about the guy's fucking 5.5. He's over here. No, he ain't. If they claim 5.8, he's 5.5. You know how the internet works. Okay. So it's true. It's true. Yeah. It's 5.5. So, you know, I don't know, dude. I don't think in shit's big. Did you see that fucking video that dude crying? Oh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the back. Oh, dude, dude. I thought that was like a fake. I thought it was a first time. You know what? That guy has to be a fucking influencer that they pay to do that. Yeah, there's no fucking way. I'm not crying on TV. I'm not crying on social media. I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. No. Um, yeah. So I mean, he goes over there. And like I said, apparently this is how this dude's been. But then there's something interesting. He called another emergency summit with, you know, they tried to play it off. It was just, you know, European leaders. It was all of NATO. All of NATO. Emergency summit. Um, check this clip. All NATO members. Look at all that diversity. Yeah, a lot of diversity. Look at all that diversity, equity and inclusion going on there. See, it's good for everybody else, but it ain't good for them. Well, not, not to mention, bro, like, okay, like you do this without, you know, do this with NATO, but the United States was not pressed. So you don't need the United States. That's my thing. No, no, no. Here's what's happening. So now these motherfuckers are trying to send troops. Like Britain says they're going to send troops and a couple of these guys said they're going to send troops because they're trying to get the war popped off because if it pops off and NATO's, they're, the United States legally has to, but if Trump is who he says he is, he would go on TV today and guess, and say, guess what, NATO, you're on your fucking own. We're out. Bro, we spend the, we 60% of NATO's budget comes from us. I know. And then you would see these people change their too. They would be like, oh, we're not sending anybody anymore. Fuck it. I, even if they tried to backpattle it, I'll still pull out. DJ, we shouldn't listen. We shouldn't be in it. America first, America first. America first, America first. You want to, you want to do strategic military navigation moves that are going to benefit this country and they say, oh, well, over there, like little man says, you know, over there, you're going to feel it come over to our shores and this and that. No, we aren't because we're going to take Canada. We're going to take Greenland and we're going to create a strategic base and everybody's going to be fucking happy over here. And if you come over here, we'll fuck you up. That's what's going to happen, just like it's happened for the last fucking 250 fucking years. You are not coming here and that's where Trump should be spending his money. And he should be working for Greenland and he should be working for Canada in a diplomatic way to make an alliance that is for our continent. In our area of the world and over there in Europe, and I know a lot of you guys listen in Europe, but you know, tough shit. That's what you guys should be working on. When we talk about us leading by example, you should lead by example over there. If you live in Europe and you listen to the show, why don't you build yourself into a leader of your community there and start inspiring change over there. It's not America's responsibility. It is not my brother or my cousin or my dad or my nephew or my sister or anybody I know is responsibility to get there. It's responsibility to go to Europe and fucking die for your shit. It's just not. You guys need to wake the fuck up and stand up for yourselves and we'll work worry about us for the next 30 years. And then we'll see where everything is once we look good, we can say, okay, well what about you guys? But you know, like we live in a situation where these people fleece us. Like us, the citizen. Like dude, you guys would have to pay the tax you paid if we weren't supporting all these bozos. Well, I mean to your point too, it's like the people that are still crying and crying in support of Ukraine, but go over there. Because I mean, it's not like you even have to go volunteer. They'll get you right off the fucking street, bro. Oh yeah, here's a video I want you guys to see. I don't know if you guys have seen this. This is a video of what conscription looks like. This is a dude that was just walking down the fucking street in Ukraine. Yeah. And the fucking military van pulls up, they jump out and they fucking kidnap you. People think this is bullshit. No, this is how they're doing it. Hundreds of these videos. Hundreds of these videos. They killed two generations of men in Ukraine over this. And I want you to hear this man's voice, by the way, when you guys are listening to this clip, check this out. He's terrified. Sounds like he loves his country. Yeah. Yeah, no shit. It's insane, but then I wanted to, you know, let's enter the chat. Jasmine Crocket. All right. And let's hear what she has to say about this whole situation. What should you do? So, unfortunately, we have someone that is occupying the White House. And as far as I'm concerned, he is an enemy to the United States. He's sworn oath just like the rest of us. But right now, when you are literally putting us at risk all because of what? Because you want to convince your followers that you should be a dictator too, that you should never leave the White House. Red Bull bitch. That's how you fucking need to talk that into. The fuck out of here. She's a fucking idiot. Yeah, she is an idiot. Dude, listen, she's a product of fucking DEI. We got a house for people that represent us, even if they're fucking idiots. Yeah, right. The fuck out of here. Yeah, I mean, I'm a snail stripper. I can't say it. I don't give a shit. I don't care, dude. But Mom, if she opens her mouth, it all goes away. No, I mean, it's like Jesus Christ. She's an idiot. Yeah. Other things that come out now that in addition to that video that clip, you were just talking about. Dude, by the way, you're calling the president of the United States. She said occupied the White House. Yeah, right. You know, like we're not the motherfuckers to stole the election in 2020. Right, right. Did we steal this one? Did we stole this election? Yeah. Dude, what they fucked up though, because like, you know, they gave everybody a perspective. Like if they just let Trump stay in there, the media could have kept him under wraps, because nobody had woken up. Nobody was paying attention. Now they now they woke everybody up. Yeah. Last little piece of update on this, man, is you got Trump. Trump's made another another announcement with all of the shit that's the lensky's been talking about. So Lensky just made another statement. And this was Trump's response. The Trump says, quote, this is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky. And America will not put up with it for much longer. It is what I was saying. This guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's backing. And Europe in the meeting, they they have with Zelensky stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the United States. Probably not a great statement to have made in the terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking? And yeah, because I mean, they've been calling it and Zelensky is standing standing pretty firm and saying that the decline the mineral rights deal to kill. The decline the fucking cease fires. It's declined all of it and saying that the Ukraine war, the end of the Ukraine war is very, very far away. So you got that going on. Now I want to turn our attention to something else real quick before we get to our next set of headlines. Because again, we call it how we see it here. And this is a this is something that bothers me. I know it bothers you. Yeah. I already know where you're going to go. Yeah. What's been happening on the other side? There's always something. You know, what you know, when you have these giant distractions like this, we always have to look and say, hmm, what are we not supposed to look at? So let's let's I know exactly where you're going. Yeah, I was going to go there. Hmm, let's go there together. Let's we can hold hands. All right. Let's come to me or come to you. I will do it later. All right. Yeah. But here's the thing, man. You know, we're complaining about the, you know, billions of dollars that were sent into this unnecessary war. We're, you know, we're complaining about the tax dollars and that, you know, it needs to be a cease cease fire. We need to bring it to a piece and, you know, we can complain that and call that out and say, that's not right. Okay. President Trump, I have a question for you. Why the fuck are we sending billions of dollars to Israel while all of this is going on? And nobody wants to talk about it. Well, we'll talk about it. We'll talk about it. Rubio expedites delivery of $4 billion in military aid to Israel. Let's dive into this. United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday he'd signed a declaration to expedite delivery of about $4 billion in military assistance to Israel. The Trump administration, which took office, everybody knows on January 20th, they've approved nearly 12 billion, which is actually 15 billion. And a major foreign military sales to Israel. Rubio said in the statement that it will quote will continue to use all available tools to fulfill America's longstanding commitment to Israel's security, including means to counter security threats. Yeah, $4 billion just got pushed out with another 12 billion coming within the next I think three to four weeks or over the next three to four weeks. And I found this try. I want to bring up some other data for people to look at here. If we look at all of the aid that has been sent from this country to the country of Israel since Israel's conception, which was 1946. As you can see, Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of United States aid by double by double. Now, it's not the biggest, you know, in population size, land mass size or any of that yet it doubles. I mean, like that's not that's not foreign aid. That's that's payment for the blackmail that they have on all the leaders in the United States. Yeah, I mean, that makes that makes that makes that's that's that's pay us or will expose you. And just like all of the attacks the United States has had on all of the countries directly bordering Israel, why is that? Why is over the last 80 years have we been offensively engaged with almost every single country that borders Israel? And we've turned them into fucking desert. Why would you do that? I mean, I mean, speaking of Israel, I mean, there's another question we need to be asking, where is the abstineless? We ain't getting it. We ain't getting it. Dude, cash per tell edited statement, when he said there will be zero stones unturned and we will find them and prosecute them. He went and deleted that out of his tweet. Did he really? Yeah. And then you got Bondi saying, oh, it's the this and that and this. Listen, you guys promised us that it would happen on day one. It didn't happen on day one. It's not happening now. And you tried to pull some bullshit with some redacted nonsense shit that we've had since 2017. You're drastically misjudging your base. Okay. People are upset about this. They want to know the truth. And they won't allow the truth to come out because it's going to expose all of the intelligence blackmail that our country in Israel has against everybody. So basically, here's the question for them. Do we expose it and give the people what they want or do we try to give them a version of it that they will buy so that we can keep our leverage over everybody else in the world? That's the only two options because the third option is we we we we tell on everybody and we let it go and we lose all of our all of our leverage. They're not going to do that. We lose leverage, bro. The world would fucking like bro, it would send the world. Yes, because it's going to implicate Israel in a legitimate child sex abuse blackmail ring and probably implicate our country as well. Oh, no doubt. Yeah. So yeah, I think it's a joint. The more I dig into this, I think it's a joint massage CIA blackmail operation to control all influence political figures, entertainment, fucking everything so that they control the narrative. Well, it makes perfect sense because like this is something I've always maintained, right? Like looking at our government, how are government operates? They always operate within the means of the laws that they create for themselves, right? And so like yes, it's a law that I see I a cannot operate on you as soil. There's no law that says miss I can't that's how they've been doing this. Yeah, and they say, hey, what's you guys fine? You know what I'm saying? So it's like, well, you got we'll share information. Yeah. What you find on our citizens will tell you what we found over here. Exactly. Oh, and by the way, go operate this blackmail sting over here with Epstein and then again with Diddy, you know, will that Epstein do the financiase and the and the fucking political figures and socialites and socialites and then we'll let we'll let Diddy do all the hip-hop culture. You know, there's more of these people they just haven't fucking who's in the country music industry. Yeah, I mean, we got Harvey Weinstein. We got, you know, that we get we know that's in the movie industry, right? But like, well, and they hide behind anti-Semitism. Like if you criticize Israel and you criticize Masad, you say they say you're an anti-Semite. No, that would be the same as criticizing the leader of any country. Just because I criticize Joe Biden or criticize Donald Trump does not mean I'm anti-American citizen. Right. Right. You know, or whatever. Like just because I criticize Diddy doesn't mean I'm anti-black. Just because the people who, you know, get accused happen to be mostly Jewish doesn't mean that I hate regular Jewish people. It's not anti, it's a fucking smoke screen they use for defensive mechanism. Don't say this or you're this. Well, I don't really give a fuck what you think I am. Well, I mean, they use it for every single fucking, you know, line that they try to divide in this country, right? Like, oh, I hate pedophiles. Oh, well, you hate LGBT people? No. Exactly. No, what the fuck are you talking about? Yeah. Why? I hate the leaders of BLM and the organizers of that movement. Well, you hate black people there. No, I don't hate black people. I just don't want to fucking money stolen from my communities and use to burn them down. Common sense people all understand this. Right. And the average human is starting to realize what's actually going on and how this, how our narrative is crafted and forced and collectivized across many different celebrity influencers, right? And the problem that they have is that those people have lost their credibility completely. Nobody believes Brad Pitt's social service announcement. Like when Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg did the commercial in the Super Bowl where they were yelling at each other. I hate you because I don't understand. Bro, it was a joke. People were laughing at it. None of that shit matters anymore. Do you know what matters? Independent media sources that people know for sure are not compromised or affiliated with any of the mainstream shit. People don't trust Hollywood anymore. They don't trust the MSM. They don't, you know who they trust? They trust Rogan. They trust people like us. They trust people like that are out here, can't assoants who are fucking completely unaffiliated with any of this shit who are just telling the truth. That's where the trust has gone. So they can run as many commercials as they want with Brad Pitt. And they can work. They can run as many commercials as they want with some sort of, you know, music and they can work. It's going to work on a very comparatively a very small amount of the population as it did before. You know, we're calling these people. Yeah, for sure. That's about it. Some people who live in a protected little bubble. So it is what it is, dude. You know, people are waking up to what's going on. You know, like haven't you ever stopped and thought. Like, let's just say before five years ago, like back in the, you know, 16, 17, 18, and the internet was fucking cranking. It was a thing. And we had all these people with coordinated messages, right? Like all the actors and all the musicians and everybody always seemed to like fall in the same political play. What are the chances of that? Right. What are the chances again with the most? What are the chances of every single person that you personally know falling right in line with the political beliefs that you have? It's not reality. No. Okay. So to think that all these actors and musicians and political figures and whatever. People of influence, athletes are going to fall in line with all the same narrative. They all think the same thing. And then say the same thing, almost verbatim, right? Nobody believes that anymore because during COVID, it was very apparent to the uniformity of the message that was being delivered. And, dude, these people have lost all credibility. And they're starting to figure out because the natural, the natural, the natural, the natural thing to do would be to like, question that, right? Like, how are all these people saying the same exact thing? And then you get to the conclusion of, well, they must be being told by somebody. Well, who's telling you? Well, and why are they listening if they're so rich? Like if you're, if you're that rich, you don't have to listen to people. Right. So why, like that's what I was thinking. What would make you want to listen to that? What would make me as a pretty wealthy dude, wealthier than most of those dudes falling in line with the most, falling in line with something to say with everybody else? Well, the only way that I could think I would be done is if someone was threatening me in some way, shape it up. Right. Something on you. Yeah, I'm going to kill your kids or I got this picture or video of you doing this. Right. Okay. And then I would be like, all right, fuck. Well, what's it heard if I just say this? Safe in the face. I get to go on my life. I keep making money. Exactly. Right. So, dude, then I start thinking, okay, well, how do they blackmail these people? And then I see this upsteen shit come up. Right. And I'm like, holy shit, dude. And then you look at the list of who's been to his New York apartment. Bro, the old president of the Israel visited this fucking house in New York City on multiple occasions. What? Why is the president of Israel visiting Jeffrey Epstein's New York City home that has all the cameras and shit in it? Why? You see what I'm saying? What's the boycage? I'm not doing that. I don't know the occasion is wrong. Right, dude? These motherfuckers, they're all compromised. They're all f***. And did we're not getting the Epstein list? We're not going to get it. That do you know why Andrew Bailey wasn't chosen as a fucking. Raph B. Yeah. For a attorney general. You know why? I tell you why. Because Pam Byron, tell you why because Pam Bondy is part of the club. She's not going to tell on things that her side could be directing her to do that might be unethical. And that's become very clear. Okay, because here's what I think. I think all of these people are part of it. And I think she doesn't want, she's being instructed to not release it on behalf of the people that she is actually friends with. And I believe that they would have chosen Andrew Bailey. He wouldn't put up any of that shit. I know him personally. He'll call it wrong no matter who side it is. And they don't want somebody like that. They want someone who's going to operate within their boundaries. And that's why they chose her. Geez, man. That's my opinion. Geez. I'm not happy with this shit. It's wrong, dude. We need to fucking go ahead, you know, bounce that check, Rubio. We don't need to be sending anything over there. Listen, I don't care what country. I don't either. I don't sound about Israel. It's about fucking any country at all. If any of the last four weeks have proven us to anything is like one, that four billion ain't going to fucking to the Israeli government. It's not going there. Right. Period. If anything in the last three weeks, three, four weeks have shown us, bro, you're looking at maybe half of the money. If you're lucky, actually makes it to where it's supposed to go. If you're lucky, they still, I mean, if anything has taught us, bro, like, how about we not send anything out? We should be cashing any fucking checks. Dude, I get what you're saying. But people are failing to understand the scale of the data collection that these agencies have and participate in. So the average person's going to look at like what's going on. And they're like, well, you know, they didn't get to this guy, right? They didn't like, they didn't get to cash for tell. So he's going to tell the truth. Well, you know what's likely happened between now and then is they approached him with some shit that they have on him. Hey, here's this. And you wonder how they do it to make him delete his fucking message. No, bro, listen, this is how they do it. People do not understand. They think this is a bullshit. They have the data of every text, every recall that you've ever made on your cell phone has been recorded. Okay. Every picture you've set, every conversation that you've had within the distance of your cell phone has been recorded. And Masad has that information. So anybody that gets too out of line with what's going to happen gets approached. They call it calling them to the mountain. They get called to the mountain. Okay. And then they fucking show you. Hey, remember this. Hey, remember that. You remember when you did this. You want everybody to know that? You want your wife to know that? You want your kids to know that? You want this to be front page news. And by the way, who hasn't done some shit that they're not proud of in their life? Right. Who hasn't done some shit that they're embarrassed of or wouldn't want the world to know? Every single mother fucker on the planet, every single one. So when you ask about like what sort of leverage these people have, they have leverage on everyone, including you. And for this to ever be broken, this system to ever be broken, the collective is going to have to say, well, fuck, it's all of us, man, we're all guilty. We're all sinners. We've all done our own version of fucked up shit. And I really don't give a fuck because we're all guilty. And when you do that, it frees everybody from them being able to blackmail. You have to lower our expectations of perfection. And what is the good boy in our eyes? You know what I'm saying? I can stop thinking that there's no there's no perfect human dude. It's biblical. It's biblical. It's biblical. What was once in the dark will now be in the light. Maybe that's what we're talking about here. Maybe we're talking about everybody shit being out in the open. And everybody's seeing everybody else the shit. And if everybody saw everybody else the shit, you know what you'd say? You have a lot more grace for everybody else. You'd be like, oh, well, you know, DJ, you did this. Well, fuck. I said it was nine. It's really eight. Like I give it to you. Well, centimeters fucking, but bro, you know what I'm saying? Like there's a level of grace that will be had for everybody because every now it wouldn't be with like the kids shit. The pedophile shit. And I think that's where they get these people right. But like, you know, dude, they can they can get to anybody, including you, including me, including anybody. Fuck man. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. It's it's not okay, dude. No. And if we're going to be America first, let's be America first. Let's not be fucking America Israel first. Let's not be America. You crane first. Let's not be America. Anybody America America first. How about that? You know what I'm saying? Like, fuck dude, we got we got veterans on the street starving. We got cities that are crumbling. We got communities in every single Democrat city of black Americans that are getting just trashed by our own government for the last 60 fucking years. You know what I'm saying? Like, dude, we have problems here. Real problems that need to be addressed. And it's interesting that the people who have the least amount of issues in their life are the people who advocate for us going over and helping everybody else. You know what I'm saying? And they lock their doors and speed through red lights next to their neighbors. Roll the windows up. Let's not talk about going through red lights. We don't talk about that. It's okay. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Would that be so let's go crew some comments? Let's scroll through these. I'm talking about blowing through red lights. I'm talking about like the little stop sign up here at the at the end of our parking lot. We stop at that one. I never see it. I keep forgetting it's there. Not damn it. I allegedly never see it. Well, I don't see it because it wasn't there for a long time and now it's there actually wasn't there for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's go through some of these comments, man. This first comment comes from Dakota Lloyd, 4251. Really, if the mystery show of politics, french fries, and how to be a successful motherfucker, you never know what you'll get, but you know you'll regret it if you missed an episode.

It's like, you know, like they're fucking travel agent versus like, oh, you've never been to beauty. If you haven't been to East St. Louis. That's right. Well, this is what I'm talking about. This is what I'm talking about for real. We're talking about what we're just talking about. Like bro, St. Louis is an amazing city filled with amazing people. And the city government itself doesn't do shit sucks to help the city. All of the good movements are led by the citizens at their own expense. The charitable, like dude, it's it's fucking bullshit. Yeah. I don't know on my head. So itchy, man. The fuck do you put something in this? I'm shit. It's been fucking itch powder or something. All right. You see, you're getting ashy on your body. No. Oh, I think you didn't cut it. I mean, because usually it doesn't cut it. Yeah. Well, that's why usually is like naturally lubricates itself. So I don't know what's happened. It's just it's it's your head like precomes. Let's check out this next comment. This is a good one. You'll like this one. This is from New definition of dickhead. This next comment comes from Rashad the great. All right. And then he has a little financial advice for you. Okay. Rashad. Yeah. He's got the great. Rashad the great. He heard of him. He wanted to let you know about some of your your financial moves and just give you some insights. All right. Rashad the great. He says first, um, all depreciating assets. Real wealth is intangible health, love, salvation, 401k, Roth, IRA, etc. I don't know why most Americans obsess with liabilities. I think we're talking about one of your cars or something. Oh, really? Yeah. Uh-huh. Um, get yourself a new car, bro. You feel better. Just go get the bug. Yeah. Bro, so now I'm looking at the short that y'all posted. First of all, motherfuckers, I don't post the shorts. Yeah. Right. Okay. You're not on there talking to Andy. All right. But you are talking to Madat. So, so here's the short. Just so we're clear. I just want to fucking. It's fire. Hold on. The short shows, which by the way, I have 40 fucking cars. And they're all plus. They're all none of them are fucking poor people cars. Okay. They're just not. Yeah. Okay. Career GT. I bought that from my friend Ryan Harwick. I paid $650,000 to Ryan for the car. The cars work two million bucks now. Okay. The next, the next car in the lineup is my acid green GT2 RS, which I think I paid like three something at sticker. It's worth five and a half six right now, probably. Okay. All low, all very low mile cars. Um, 918. I just said double my money more than double my money for GT next to it. That double my money. Yeah. I got it. I paid for it. The sticker was 400 bucks. It mines a mine's a one off. Around show, boy, Alice, it was the first customer GT delivered. And it's worth fucking right now, probably one to one and a half. And then I have my carbon GT that I paid fucking 704. That's worth two. So don't talk about things you don't know about, homie. Like you don't know what the fuck you're talking about is the average everyday bro Lamborghini going to lose your money. Absolutely. Is the average everyday bro fucking Ferrari going to lose your money. Absolutely. But how have those kind of cars, dude? Yeah, that's real man. He's going to really hate the new car content. Look at all those depreciation assets. They do people have the wrong mindset about winning, dude. Yeah. Well, they don't know, bro. Well, this is why we're starting the MS CEO back up, bro. And if you guys want to get it, go in and register to the Andy Graham on my email list on Andy for cella.com because it will be the most powerful entrepreneur information that you will ever fucking receive because it comes from someone who's actually done it, not someone who speculates about how to do it. All right. And by the way, if you don't want to let's not give a fuck either, but if you want to know real shit, that's what we're going to teach. But the point here is that like, we have a we have so many of these knuckle fucks out here, given this kind of advice. Okay. Real talk, dude. The old way doesn't work anymore. Okay. It doesn't work. The scale of what things cost versus the scale of how wages have gone up is drastically out of whack and it ain't getting better anytime soon. So you have to figure out how to out earn the fucking that curve. Yes, bro. And dude, this you're giving a shot and look, I'm sure you're fucking good, dude, bro, because you do care about health and love and salvation. I'm not saying you're a bad dude, but you don't get it. You're going to have to if you do life that way, when you're 60 years old, you're going to be having to get a job. Yep. Okay. So just so you know, you're you're giving average people advice and average people advice end up with average people when they're older and they can't produce anymore being in poverty. Okay. So instead of pretending that you know on the internet, shut the fuck up because you're hurting people with that advice. That's real shit, bro. That's real. That's real man. And I mean that out of a place of respect. A real love, okay. Yeah. Like bro, you live that life. I'm sure you want to be successful because you're wearing a suit. You looking nice. You know, but bro, you're going to be broke with that. It's real shit, bro. I'm not broke. I made $250,000 a year. Okay. Well, let me know how that goes. You maintain that. Keep, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man. Let's keep the screws moving guys. We got headline number two. Andy, let's let's go up to Boston. Boston's a good place. I love Boston. Yeah. Great food up there. I love Boston. Great people. I love the city. Mm-hmm. I love, I love Boston. Yeah. They talk a lot of shit about their sports, which I can appreciate. Not everybody can take it. Yeah. I mean, they're pretty obnoxious, but I give it right back to them. Yeah. It's all good. No, Boston was great, bro. I like Boston a lot. Beautiful place. It's too bad their mayor is fucking it up. Huh. Did you see this shit? Guys, listen, I'm going to read this. Hitline reads, Boston mayor, Michelle Wu, other woke city officials offer condolences to Ken of armed maniac shot by off duty cop and chick filet. Makes sense. Bro, listen, bro. Like, she went up there. Do you have the video? Oh, I got this video. Let's play video for you. Yeah. I got the video. Let's let's check this out. Uh, who are they? The influences and and all of our thoughts are with the family of the individual whose life has been lost. What? Bro, Eddie, if you would have came to me in like 2013, 2014 and told me that in 2025, you would have mayors go on television and offer condolences to people who are going around trying to stab and kill people. I would say you are full of shit. That's because this person has never faced that with their own face. They've never dealt with it. Bro, they've never seen people like this. These people are elitists. They don't, they don't understand criminals or criminals. You understand? Or you know, you know, yeah, like, bro, you fucking get it. But I mean, like, dude, it's insane. Man, that would be like when I got stabbed in the face, the newspaper saying, man, our condolences are the dude stabbed this dude in the face. Like, you know, he's going to jail. So yeah, our condolences are losing a good brother. Just go to jail. This woman's insane. And it's been real talk, dude. Like, it's weird because the only people, I think it's because Boston has such a so many, like very far left colleges in their vicinity that they are. Let's just take it over the holes. Yeah. Yeah, because dude, the average people from Boston, I know ain't with that shit. No, bro. I mean, listen, like this, we've actually gotten a lot of good stuff from the show. Like this ain't our first time in the show. Let's go back a little bit. You guys remember when the Boston mayor on the fire for no white Christmas party for cities, elected of color, right? Or or how is that not racist? How is that not fucking racist? This fuck today, we will have a y'all. Okay. Everybody could come. So white people. How's that now racist? Like, what if what if white people had a party like that and said, oh, everybody could come, but black people and like set it out loud. Yeah, publicly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like people think that's what, you know, like what you're talking about. That's really what I think that's what they talk about. Yeah, right. Right. Right. I've never, I've never in my life ever fucking heard that from a white person ever. And that is on my fucking mom, on my dad, on my fucking entire family tree. I've never, ever, ever heard a white person say something like, oh, we're going to have this party, but don't invite your black friends or don't let black people. I've never fucking heard that. It doesn't happen. I've never heard that about any group of people. Yeah. I've never heard it. But certain cultures do this so frequently in the background. And by the way, what is she? Oh, she's Asian. I mean, I don't know if she's, is that Chinese? What is that? Yes. That Chinese then and no, that's Korean. She, look at her eyes. That's great. Now, I think she's Chinese, bro. What's the rule? But the point is, I don't know, but the point is this in Asian countries. Oh, they're racist. They're very racist. Oh, they're racist as fuck. Okay. So it's an, and then bro, by the way, we have a lot of black culture that openly speaks against white people. And if you would say the same thing about black people, they will freak the fuck out. That all this shit needs to end, dude, all of it, all of this hypocrisy and fucking. That's insane. It's insane. It's insane. It's insane that it's allowed. Yeah. Like she should have been kicked out of the office for that. For that. Yeah. But not, I mean, she kept going not too far after that. She then tried to, you know, she wanted to give anybody above the age of 11 these illegal migrants that were in voting powers in the city of Boston. She tried, she actually tried to do that. So I mean, like said, she's been in our headlines a few times. But so bro, she's a fucking full blown communist. Oh, no doubt. Yeah. No doubt, bro. She's a communist. I mean, her most recent, I wouldn't be surprised. She's funded by CCP legitimately. I wouldn't, I wouldn't doubt it. I wouldn't be surprised. No, I'm most recently, I mean, she's been on, she's in the party of, you know, no ice officers here. You know, we're protecting our illegal migrants. Careful with that. Well, she's in that campaign. Yeah. She's absolutely. And that's her most, most recent. What did you see the other thing? Did you see that Pam Bobby said she's going to charge AOC today? I didn't see that for for for what she did of of AOC. Oh, I saw, I saw AOC write a letter or something to my wife, I mean, investigate it for a few days. Apparently, apparently charges are on the horizon, no shit. But like, you know, really real talk. I don't care until you tell the truth about the things that have been going on. 100%. Like quit throwing us these little biscuits. Well, I mean, dude, like this, but I mean, on the ice topic, though, I mean, there's been a lot of this shit going on. And I got, I haven't seen one person arrested for the shit like that. Like, that was a reporter just came out a couple of days ago. He leaked ice rate details and they doubled down on them after he got called out by Fox News. You know, this got Pablo man requests. You know, he he had posted a on on Twitter, leaking the information about these ice rates, telling people, stay off the highways, how many fucking search ones they had approved. And like, I mean, one, how was he getting this information? Because he's just a fucking public activist. So somebody's giving it to him. Yeah. But then he's put publicly posting that shit, you know, and then it doubles down on it. I will say this. I got some direct information from some people that I know would tell me the truth. That did tell me that ice is not just deporting, quote unquote, criminals. Like they said, they were going to at first. Yeah. That they actually are this time to hit like small shops and shit and construction sites and shit. And and do that's not what they said they were going to do. I don't really like that. I don't like. I think if people were here pre, you know, Biden administration, they should be given different considerations than the people who came during. Yeah. Because I believe that the people who came during were intentionally brought here to disrupt and create crime and third world eyes this country. And I think those people should be the priority removing. And from what I have heard from a few sources who listen to the show and people that I trust, that's not the case entirely. So I don't like that either. There's been a lot of weird stuff going on with this man. I'll be real, dude. I'm not feeling good about the things going on. Like this, this shit, this, this Israel ship being swept under the rug while they talk about Ukraine. That's not cool, man. No. Like bro, we got and this is not anti fucking anybody. This is just American first. Like we have people here. We got our own problems, man. We do have our own problem. And dude, this thing of like us being the savior of the world, like you can only save the world when you're good. Yeah. You know, save the world when you got fucking when you're not good, bro. No. I mean, a prime example of this. Let's go to California. We're not good where we should be. Yeah. We're not even close to where we should be. No. If we were where we should be, do real talk, we would be like, you a Dubai and fucking, you know, over there. Yeah, bro. Like, well, we wouldn't even give a shit. Four billion. Okay. Cool. But we wouldn't even care. No. Because we would be so fucking good here. We'd say, Hey, yeah, you know what? You're right. Yeah. You know, but like, I mean, we like to your point that we do have problems here. Like let's go to California real quick. Because I thought this was interesting. This headline reads podcast host waited nearly an hour on hold with 911 after coming home to a horse scene. So it's fucking house got broken into a lot. And they stole a bunch of valuable shit like, you know, personally, the pastor. He's a podcast host of LA and a minute. It's something like local LA show that goes on his name's Evan. Evan love it. Let's check. I'm going to watch. Let's check this clip out real quick. This shit is unnerving and it's not cool. And I'll tell you what else. I was on hold with 911 for 59 minutes, 59 minutes. And luckily, it's just a home burglary. It wasn't somebody dying choking that was shot or something. But what happens if it was a real time emergency? Luckily, the police when they did show up came they were very nice. But they mentioned how under man they are. And that's a problem. We'll get over this. It's going to get boarded up. My son's a little unnerved. My wife, I am. We're all unnerved. But this is a problem. This is a real problem. So I'm going to get into more depth on this. But God damn. Well, let's let's examine your social culture history and things you've advocated for and the things you voted for and the things that you supported over the last 10 years. It's interesting how people and by the way, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he's Alex Jones Jr. I don't know. But I glasses definitely aren't. I would assume that this is a left leaning human being. Maybe I'm wrong. And if I'm wrong, I apologize. But the first thing I think when these things happen, especially in California is, well, what have you been advocating for? And what have you been voting for? And who's side of you been standing? And it's weird because it's like these people advocate and post and vote in a way that they don't think that the repercussions of those things are ever going to come to them. And if you would for a second, consider that you are just like everybody else. Because what happens is these people believe that they are elite. They believe they are voting for all of these people below them. And they can't fathom the idea that the repercussions of their political positions and their societal arguments are somehow some way going to end up at their doorstep. They cannot comprehend that. And when it happens, their mood and their position changes drastically. And if people would just come to the understanding that your vote and your advocacy and your words and the things you post on social, will affect you. We wouldn't have a society of these kind of things happening because everyone would say, well, that's not a good idea because that could happen to me. This is not a good idea because I could be out to dinner and, you know, I could get a car jacked or this is not a good idea. But instead, what they've advocated for is things like, hey, don't wear your jewelry in public. We live in a country where you can't even enjoy the things that you enjoy without someone else wanting to take them off of your fucking wrist and neck and public. That should be a problem to everybody. Now, but fuck the police, right? Let's defund the police. Yeah, like, dude, where are we? We're in the department. They don't have no more resources. Dude, it's well, I didn't know that's what you can't fix. You can't fix ego problems. This is that's what this is. This is an ego elitist problem. Okay? If you think that you are not going to be affected by certain things that you vote on and you want to vote on them because it makes you feel better, what you're saying is, I'm above all that. So I'm going to vote for this. So you are a classist without realizing it. You are an elitist without realizing it. And then these same people try to say fuck the system even though the system is the government and all of the dark money and all of the big corporations and all of the things that actually they claim to be against and they can't even comprehend that they're rooting for it too busy and fucked. It's insane. It's insane, bro. It's crazy. It's total delusion. And you know what? Maybe this guy is not one of those guys, but this is what that reminds me of. I mean, it's happened time and time again. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. That being said, let's quickly get to our third and final headline. I know. I know. I know. Hurry bro. Okay. We're in no hurry. All right. You know, my buddy Vince, he fucking got caught. He got caught outside his home. There was a big deal. He lives in California and two dudes like followed him home. And then they they he's he's a wealthy guy. He's got a nice home and got a little wall around his home and shit. And they jumped over the fence. And now Vince is a real American. Like he carries a gun no matter what the law is. And these guys came in and started shooting at him and he fucking had his gun, which you know, is not socially acceptable in California. Shot him back. Hit one of the guys. The police came to him. Took his fucking gun. And I believe they tried to charge him. He ended up on Fox News and they dropped the charges. But the point is is like we live in a world where you can't stand up for yourself. Otherwise, you get prosecuted and we have to ask, well, how do we end up there? And why is it that way? Well, we ended up there because USAID sent $260 million to George Soros who then implanted these prosecuting attorneys who sympathize with the criminals. And why do they sympathize with the criminals? Because they want society to crumble. They do not want you to have all the things the American dream has promised you. They want crime. They want disorder. They want confused people. And people can't connect the dots and haven't been able to connect the dots that every time you fall for one of these social narratives, all the money that's donated goes to these people. It's due to it. It's getting old. Imagine, imagine. So imagine you go your life. You live your life. You try to make a good living. Half of that money gets taxed. But then you want to reward yourself for the fruits of your labor and you go, you want to get a nice car. But then they create the environment on the back end. So unbearable. And so hard to fucking even enjoy that you're fucked either way it goes. Yeah, well, why do they do that? Why would they want to discourage that? Why would the powers that be want to discourage people from showing their success? Which by the way, this is a whole side up. It used to be in America that success was celebrated. When I was growing up, success was celebrated. If you won and you built a big company, people are like, bro, be like that guy. That guy did this. Now he does this. You could do it too. That was the fucking message. All right. That has been intentionally degraded and removed from society to shame people into feeling bad or embarrassed or ashamed of their accomplishments. Why? Why? Why would they do that? There's only one reason why they want you to never show your winning so that the younger generations will never understand what winning looks like feels like. And that it's possible for them to and by squelching the motivation for success by shaming the people that actually have it, you create a scenario where the younger generations think that it's not possible. And so they never try ultimately making them easier to control for their entire lives. That's what we have going on. The villainization of success, the entire movement as a siop to control people for the long term. And bro, that's something that people have to realize. When we talk about personal excellence, being the ultimate rebellion, part of that is showing the fruits of your labor and showing the wins. Okay. And if you don't do it, you're falling right into what they want you to do. 100%. It's fucked up shit. It's fucked up shit, man. We guys, let's get to our third and final headline. We got headline number three. You know, we did a, we did a, a fry ranking a couple of CTIs ago. And we left one off. We left one off one fry. We left a fry company off. And you know, I've been thinking about this more. I'm gonna go back. We're not gonna go back. We don't have to go back. Well, who do we forget? Staking shake, bro. Oh, yes. Staking shakes. Staking shakes. All right. They got some good fries. And they just got to be in the mood for them. You do have to do what do we have? A B C D F for the grades. S. Yeah, it would you put staking shakes? I would put staking shake. I mean, I give them a solid B. I think a B too. I give them a solid B. They're done right. And they're not soggy. Yeah, right. Like if you get them in their crispy, they're fucking amazing. She's in there. Yeah. I like dude. I like to put a lot of ketchup. I fucking hate ketchup. I'm like, well, I don't care what you like. I'm saying what I like. No, I get that. But like, I hate ketchup. Fuck it. It's because you brain normally. No, I actually, are you gonna be that big and I like ketchup? Well, I have a story about it. Actually, what do you put on your food? It's a very dramatic. That's a problem. You put, you probably put mayonnaise or some high calories shit on your shit. I like mayonnaise. I don't make my fries. I don't do it with the fries though. What do you use for fries? Yeah. Keso, both. You're not good cheese. It all adds up. Yeah, I mean, I fucking love cheese. legitimately. I love cheese. All right. Here we go. But Keso, I mean, but we catch up out the out the question. Now, you know why I'm ripped and they catch up. Yeah, they catch up. Fuck. Fuck. Ketchup my secret weapon. Is that what it is? Anyway, back to the story. Text out. I like a lot of ketchup. Yeah. All right. And it's not because I use it all. But what I like is like when the little bitty fries kind of get mixed in with the ketchup and you can't get them out with your hands and you gotta use a fork and you kind of drip. Bro, that's the best fries. What? That's nasty, man. Ketchup. Fucker. Ketchup is peasant shit, Andy. I'm actually disappointed, bro. I put ketchup. My fucking steak. Your monster. I don't really do that at home. I do it. That's nasty, bro. No, it ain't. It's fucking nasty. I don't actually do that. I believe that the fucking. Did you see me do it the other night? Well, no, because you rely on me for your food when we were in the restaurant. So I can be all I didn't rely on you. We just like the same shit. Yeah. Yeah. You know, so we got that peppercorn. That shit was good. This shit's good. Hey, I never had a meal with DJ. I didn't like. That's okay. I'll tell you that. I also never been to a restaurant with DJ where he didn't try to order a grape margarita. It is what it is, man. Every single time we go to a restaurant, this motherfucker tries to tell the waitress every single time that I like grape margarita. He says, kind of margaritas do you have and should go through the whole list and he'd be like, you got watermelon. That should be like, no, we don't have, you know, no watermelon margarita really. We don't know. We don't have that. You got grape. Yep. And then they'll get it and then they start laughing. This is walkoff most of the time. Yeah, I have to tell him. I'm like, hey, he's a little racist. Yeah. That's not racist. No, no, it's fine. I'm inherently it's fine. It's not racist. It's not. That's a stereotype. Stereotypes are based in truth. It's true. It's true. Yeah. But yeah, we left Steak and Shake off the list. And I think one that needs to be on the list definitely in the B category. But they may they may be getting a bump. We got to go we got to go find a steak and shake and try it out because apparently steak and shakes says they have RFK their fries. And they're opting for a healthier cooking method. They're using beeftalo now. Yeah, I don't know. Is that good? I don't know. I don't know. Apparently McDonald's used to use beeftalo to fry their fries. Now they just use the best apparently crack cocaine. I mean, dude, how can all these food companies legitimately? How can it be straight additives in there? Yes. That are addicting. How is that okay? Yeah. Fuck, dude. I'm fucking shit and supplements, bro. Yeah. Fuck ripped. Yeah. Yeah. I'm loving it. I wonder why you got crack cocaine in the house. I bet you do love it. Yeah. Yeah. Apparently. Yeah. So they're switching. They're going they're not switching because they never use beeftalo. But they're going they're going to be using beeftalo. So we got to put that on the list to go try it. I saw a steak and shake that was still open here. I thought they all closed. There's only one. I thought no, there's three. There's three. I've got to I got to low down. So there's one out highway 30 on the way to like Chuck's boots out there. Might go by the farm. Okay. It's on the right. That one's still open. The one at Kirk was still open. And then I think there's another one still open. But that one and the bluff turned into Freddy's or some shit. Freddy's is good. Yeah, everybody seems to like it. I never had it. Freddy's slaps. What is Arnold Arnold is it still open, dude? All right. Well, that's the other one. Okay. So that's four. Dude, I remember when they were all closing down and they had these beer seven. Where are the other ones? They're seven open ones. I can't say they're all addresses. I don't know. Is there anyone on the moon next to your second? Take the shake and then go see. Zee Shines building a whole town on the moon. If there's one on Marley's the King, do you drive? We ain't going there. I did try that. I did try the fries on March 1st when they said they'll be nationwide. Yeah. It did taste a little better. Really? Yeah. I was you trying to be like less chemical or was it just like a placebo? Could be. I would have to like go again and see it. Yeah. But it did taste good. Well, you're you're you love food. You're a food guy. I can eat until I die. Yeah, this motherfucker goes to India every year. Cause back 20 pounds. No, they're good. I think is that she's eating mom and dad's cooking bro? When you're over there? You guys? Yeah. My mother is just phenomenal. Yeah. Apparently. Oh, yeah, for sure. This last time you came back though, you didn't put on too much. Oh, because I did 75 Horn in on mental discipline. Yeah, that's true. That's true. My man. My man's a machine over here. Nice. Yeah. How's that 7-11 doing? Good. Apparently you just had some customers up there. Yeah, right. New white people come again. But yeah, so I mean, they're they're like, so we gotta go try them. But that's just the intro to three. Have any of you guys that are listening, try these beef towels yet? Yeah. So I want to hear, I want to hear about it because I haven't tried it yet. I want to go try it. We gotta go try it. I'm on 75 Harbor. I'm saying I'm like, you know, that's why you said like you're looking good. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't take long. Yeah. It takes about a good week for me to start getting it back in line. I mean, I did it. I would say it did leave a little bit of aftertaste. Really? Yeah. That you would not find with regular fries. It was like a film, like a mouth feel. Yes. Yes. So that's how I figured out it was beef towel. It was fat. It was different. It was, yeah, it was fatty. Yeah. But it tasted good. Well, when we came, you look like you're over there fucking rate. Yeah. I'm talking about my man's hungry. I'm just looking at this fucking picture. All right. Let's move on. They're golden. They look good. Yeah. I do. Fresh fries are my kryptonite, bro. They go with everything. They fucking go with everything. You can do so many things. So you could eat it with Chinese food. You could eat it with sushi. You could eat it with pizza. Like dude. Yeah. That's real diversity right there. Yeah, that's right. Bro, fries go with everything. Everything. There's not a, tell me something I don't go with. Ice cream. They go ice cream comes after. Bro, were you talking about you dip your fucking fries in the motherfucking ice cream? Like the frosty's is shit. See, it goes with everything. You can't prove me wrong. I'm not trying to. I'm not trying to. But yeah, I mean, that's that's cool. When I become a food critic and you want to get a top rating, just serve fries with whatever comes. That's how you go, Mr. Fercel, we brought you some complimentary french fries. There we go. I can six stars. Yeah, there we go. I like it. But yeah, I mean, this was interesting. Like I mean, you know, RFK, you know, he's in office. I mean, he never had a bad french fry. I've never had a bad one. No, a bad french fry. Like a real like one you were like that was cooked properly. Like I've had some soggy ones and shit. But I'm saying like, well, have you ever had a french fry? I mean, I did not like. Yeah, and you were like, it was done right. And you were like, oh, this was not good. Oh, shit. DJ's we work it out for an extra week now. I haven't either, bro. Yeah, I've never had a french fry that I didn't like. Yeah. So like ranking them is sort of like, you know, yeah. What? I really can't think of a time I ate a french fry. I didn't like it. That's right. I concur. Yeah, really? Yes. Bro, if you had to eat only one food your whole life, what would it be? Me too. You can make it so many different ways. Match potatoes. Funny thing, the place where I come from in India, there has to be one meal in the day that is potato. It's like the, you know, the labor food or whatever it is. It has to be potatoes. I have what happens if it's not? You die? We have it, all. You go to India, jail? Yeah, straight to jail. Yeah, straight to jail. You can do so much with potatoes. Dude, I agree. You can make potato pancakes. You can make diced potatoes. You got french fries. You got fucking baked potatoes of all different kinds. I mean, what you got tater tots. Bro, bro, baked tater tots. What else do you got? You got all kinds of shit, bro. Like the, you got mashed potatoes, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, sweet potato french fries. That's not a potato. That's a different, that's a fucking potato. No. Potato is a potato. That's why they call it a sweet potato. Yeah, it's a regular potato. Just a little, you got a little regular potato superior, fuck, a sweet potato. Sweet potato fries are for people that like guacamole toast at $40 a piece. Bro, have you had sweet potato fries? I have had them. They're okay. Fucking good. Now it's good as regular fries. No, yeah, I mean, I, I'll take a piece of avocado toast for $40, please. But this period of mobile, we posted on Instagram. Instagram's made so much, made food so much more expensive because people are willing to pay like ridiculous amounts for whatever's in. Just dump shit. Do you remember like three years ago or four years ago when avocado toast was like a fucking, like it became like a, the thing. Yeah. Yeah. I like avocado toast. I bet you do. It's good. Yeah. Put a little salmon on there. Like raw salmon, like the seabed. What else can potatoes be? Like wedges? You know those got good potato wedges? Hux. You're going to a Hux or a fucking Casey's sounds like I don't, I'm not allowed there. Yeah, it's kind of out there. It's kind of out there. You might have to go with me. You don't go to places that are named after the first name of somebody. You just don't do it. Yeah. No, I love fucking potatoes. There are several curry dishes that we make with potato. Several of the other. Several? Yeah. So you, you haven't. I don't think I've ever had a curry dish. What is it? Probably don't want one. It's just spice. It's not hot. It's not spice. It's just spice. I showed your video over being made. No, that's all right. No, no, those are like some stuff. Okay, let's get to what we're getting at. What about the fresh fries? Is this it? I don't want to see no nasty shit. What? No, it's not nasty. You've seen the videos, like the street vendors, they just throw all the shit in the fucking. I don't care. Yeah. It's um, well, IE street tacos, bro. Like when we were in Austin and we fucking, I look at like the taco place. I look at like the, I look at like the worst looking place. I was usually the best shit. Yeah. No shit. I don't think that's the same in any of though. I don't think that applies. Anyway, what are we talking about? RFK. Okay. All right. He's in the story. Okay. Because they're, you know, modeling, trying to model this new healthy America. But there's interesting things going on. RFK is actually getting some heat right now. A long time skeptic. RFK junior urges people to get vaccinated for measles, mid deadly outbreak in Texas. So he's making, you know, dude, this was listen, our RFK has never been anti vaccine. Correct. Okay. Because you oppose certain medications that are not vaccines, they change the definition of vaccine. A vaccine used to mean they give you a shot or not. And whatever they gave you the shot for never happens to you. Okay. And they changed it so that they could get around the accountability aspect and the liability of it. Yes. Correct. So vaccines, by law, can you cannot sue medical companies for vaccination? Because that's what everybody thinks, too. They're like, oh, I'm going to sue them. No, no, you're not. Yeah. We try to tell you this, too. Yeah. You can't do it. So they switched definitions. So get away from accountability. A number of years ago, RFK has never been anti-vax. He's anti-COVID-vax. And I believe that he's anti giving infants 4,000 vaccinations the day they're fucking born, right? Which has shown up in the autism rates of this country for 20 years and people still defend it. Still defend it. Well, that's where so some of the heady's actually getting is from people on the right because of that reason. I mean, the measles vaccine is one of those things. And now he hasn't been around for like a hundred years, 50 years. Yes and no. They've changed it. Right. And I got some data here to bring up. You know, I think the first thing that we have to adjust is that he's, I mean, he's on a very, very pro measles vaccine. And it's concerning to me for like, for sure personally. You know, but I wanted to bring some numbers in just to make people, you know, well informed about what the reality of the situation is because this measles talk has been going around for a couple of weeks now. And then I've already freaking out. Okay. So as of, I believe these numbers was February 27th. So just a few days ago. Okay. There's 164 cases right now in the United States. We go one year ago. 285. Okay. So you get to argue, okay, we're a month in, you know, three months in the year. Okay. Maybe concerning. Maybe. But it's, but it's interesting. But I mean, it's nothing really crazy, crazily, definitely the same shit they're doing with the plane crashes. Dude, right? There was more plane crashes to this point in 2024 and there are 2025. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. You know what I'm saying? So I mean, it's interesting. Like why are we being so fucking crazy? And then you even go out a little bit more. You know, let's go back from 1985 to present, bro. Like 1990, they had 27,000 cases. So I mean, is this really a fucking outbreak? I'm saying, what are we, what are we rattling up and like, it scares me, bro, because it's like, you know, this is not new data. Like this is straight from the fucking CDC's website here. Did he make like a big press conference on this or was he just passing through and someone said, hey, what do you think of this? No, it's starting to, he's trying to talk about it heavily now. And so I mean, it is, to me, it's concerned. Bro, it seems like there's a lot of weird shit going on. That's what I'm saying, man. Like dude, I'm going to be real, man. Like as much as optimistic I was about this changing, dude, I don't, it feels the same. No, it doesn't even feel the same. It feels like we got completely fucking lied to and that these people made big promises and we're ending up with the same old shit and it's very frustrating. Yeah, you know, like sending billions dollars to anybody is not America first. Okay. Saying you're going to release this and then finding all different kinds of reasons as to why not release it. That's not America first, bro. No, you know, Trump, you came in here saying we were going to get all this shit and you have people who aren't doing what they said they were going to do. And I don't know, I don't believe that's coming from Trump. I believe that's coming from pressure from other places. Maybe it is coming from Trump. I don't know, dude, maybe, I mean, look, I don't think he's fucking stupid. I think he knows exactly what he's doing. But I wish, I don't know, I just don't feel good about it right now. Dude, I don't feel good about it right now. I don't, I don't feel good about it. I feel like I mean, look, I said I'm waiting to see. Yeah. 90 days, ain't been 90 days. I'm in 90 days. I just, I don't like the fact that we're making this big push. I really don't like this fucking big thing in Ukraine. And then send the money to Israel. I don't like that we talk about, you know, abolishing income tax and, you know, how many of you guys are still going to have to pay tax coming up here? I don't like the fact, I don't like a lot of this. I don't, I don't think we're moving anywhere towards an meaningful way. What this country was legitimately founded upon. I feel like I feel like we're just switching to the other side for a minute, which is what's been going on for the last fucking 50 years. And I just thought this was going to be different. And maybe it will be, and maybe I'm wrong, and maybe, maybe, you know, like I said, maybe there's things we don't know. Maybe there's reasons we don't know. You know, you know what, how I look at this and what, what kind of bothers me about the soul situation is I'm starting to see the same things that we were seeing his first term in the sense of he, and this is my personal belief, I believe that Trump is just like that in the first term, he's surrounded with some people that are not giving him the true data and the true temperature of the people, right? And a prime example of this is like the Epstein shit. Trump hasn't said anything on it. And when all these release dates were come, came and gone, nobody said shit, bro, these fucking, you know, influences that they use and you know, they keep in their little fucking circle, bro, they got fucking hammered. I think I think these, I think those people are discredited forever. They got hammered, right? And I don't think Trump is seen. I don't think they're even letting him see that shit. Well, Trump gets hammered every day. It makes no difference. No, I'm, what I'm saying is the people's rebellion, like in the first question. Yes, I agree. I think he's not getting the proper temperature of what his movement is. He can't be. You know, there was a, I saw they did in the first term. Yeah, true. I saw, I saw a tweet, a pro Israel influencer made a tweet and said there's something going on on Twitter. You know, a pro pro Israel influencers aren't getting nearly the traffic or likes or shares or comments that they were before. And he was basically insinuating that there's some sort of bigger plot. And like, no, dude, people are done with the fucking bullshit. You're shit. Yeah, they don't want to hear that. They, they, we don't want people in our country who are more loyal to another country. That's why people should move to another country if that's their country of loyalty. Right. If you're loyal to Ukraine, move to Ukraine. If you're loyal to Israel, move to Israel, that is why these places exist. But we, we as Americans as a whole are tired of every other country getting funded off the backs of our labor. Every other country being liberated off the lives of our children. Retired of it. We're fucking tired of it. And the average American person, man, woman, they're tired of it too. And this shit that they're doing, it, it's going to piss people to fuck off. Yeah, bro. I think it already is. I know it definitely is. There's a lot of people who fought for Trump to be in office who are now saying like, this is, this is kind of bullshit. Bro, and that's the thing. And if you're not reading the room, but if they're not even letting you read the room, then like, that's the only grace and I'm willing to give them because again, I know we know how a circle is, bro. You know what I'm saying? And it's like, that's a dangerous place to be at. Both for him and more importantly for the country, man. Like it's it. I don't like it. I do not like it. And like, when I saw what they were, bro, they were deleting comments of people calling them out on that bullshit. They're deleting comments. Yeah. The influencers. Yeah. I don't think those influencers that did that. I think they did a massive, massive damage to their credibility because like, dude, if you wanted to see who was on the payroll and who was getting influence or who's getting the perks to sit. Look, man, a fair and free press does not mean that they're going to agree with you all the time, right? But it also means they're not going to attack you all the time, right? Okay. And that right now, you know, when they get up there and they say, oh, fair and free press. And then they only choose influencers who are very, very, very much so pro Trump. That's not fair and free. Okay. Fair and free is somebody like us. Okay. We will talk both sides of the topic. I still going to lean towards Trump much more than these guys. And I still like Donald Trump. I like him. I want him to win. I want him to succeed. And really, every American citizen should want him to win. Why the fuck would you want to write? Why would you want the motherfucker driving the boat to be bad at it when you're in the boat? Right? It doesn't make any sense. So it's not a like or dislike. It's the honest evaluation of what's actually going on. That is what press is. That is what the media is supposed to do. It's, you know, it's not supposed to advocate for one side a hundred percent of the time or the other side for a hundred percent of the time. It's fair. Fair means sometimes we're going to praise. Sometimes we're going to criticize. That's fair. And if they really wanted people to build trust in them, they missed a tremendous opportunity because they decided to give it to people who propagate for their cause versus people who are openly fair in their assessments or at least try to be fair in their assessments. I mean, everybody has bias. Everybody has things that they are going to affect their positioning. I have that as well. Everybody has that. You can't nobody is not bias. Right. Okay. Because we all have different life experiences. And I personally have the experience of knowing exactly what America can create for you. If you're willing to give it what it needs. And I believe that tons of other people would have that same journey if our, if we weren't oppressed financially the way that we are. That's why I argue for so much because I want you and your children to have a better life. I want you to have an easier time doing the things that you want to do than I had doing the things that I've been doing. And if I, I could tell you for a fact, if I was paying 50% less taxes, I'd employ 100% more of the people. And my company would be tremendously bigger and doing way more good than some of these big-ass companies that have monopolized the market. You know, it's not about, you know, and that's another interesting thing. People say, well, you know, we got to pay taxes to keep the greed in check. Well, that doesn't really make sense because that fills on itself. Hold on. Think about this. So you as a socialist, communist person say that these people have to be taxed more because they're greedy and they'll keep all the money from the economy. That's their argument. Well, if they were really greedy, like you said they are, what they would actually do is they would grow their company to the maximum size because they would make more money. They wouldn't just keep the money that they're being taxed on now. If I didn't have to pay tax in my company and personal tax, that money would be reinvested into my company to grow bigger and every real greedy and you want to more. Well, I mean, like, dude, I'm an entrepreneur. I grow and build shit. But like that is what creates the local economy. We forget all these things and we don't understand these things. And so we stand in line fighting against things and justifying them for the exact opposite reasons of why they happen. So like that argument of, or we're going to toxic this dude and pay his share and this motherfucker, those people pay more in a year than you're going to pay in your entire life real talk. And second of all, if they were really greedy, dude, they'd be reinvesting the money because ultimately, that would make them more money. So like, let's decide what you think it is because it can't be both. No. So anyway, uh, fuck, I don't know. We'll see. We got we got two more months. Yeah. I mean, look, dude, I'm I feel better about where we are now than where we were with Biden and all this fucking debauchery, ridiculous shit going on. Yeah. Um, feel a lot better. Yeah. Okay, but there's some things happening that I just don't think that should be happening right now. Yeah. Guys, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Let us know where you would like to know. I honestly would like to know where our community stands in terms of, you know, satisfaction. Well, no, just like, are you guys okay with your tax dollars being sent to all these people all over the world when you're having to struggle to, you know, build your own success here. Like, do you feel like that's fair to you? Is that fair to your family? Like, is it fair that we're the only people in the world that work? Basically, our whole lives and take half our income and it gets sent all over the world to subsidize people who, you know, for whatever reason, can't take care of themselves. Reason I can't take care of themselves because we've always been take care of them. Let them fucking figure it out. That's real, man. Not as well down in the comments, guys. That being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. Now, usually we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck, but it's been demanded. People like that tier list ranking. The French fries, French fries. Okay. So, you know, we don't have French fries today. Instead, let's do some pizza rankings. Oh, man. This should be, now listen, I know we pissed a lot of people off. With the French fry ranking. We ain't gonna stop there. So, don't you worry. I got you. So, yeah, we got the list here. Let's bring the list back up. All right. So, you know, I know you're a peasant, bro, because of the pizza places you picked to put on this fucking list. Well, though, I, well, so listen, I went with, you know, we went and I discussed this. He's gonna shake it. I got no text messages. Listen, I would make this real easy for you. I'll go to the fucking bottom except emails. Well, let's talk about it. I mean, I think this is worth all conversation. Let's talk. It's worth. I think E-Mose for sure is just a superior pizza. Well, listen, go ahead and let's do it. Yeah, we'll just go. We'll go down, you know, right, right down the list. You know, but I went with, you know, these are you pretty for the most part that we get him anywhere. Yeah, they're universal. Got it. Okay. I mean, and almost everybody knows about E-Mose pizza. Roughly, you know, celebrities come here and shit. They always try it. So, I think E-Mose, it's safe to say that's a superior pizza. Yeah. Okay. We're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're both. Now everybody who comes here from out of town is going to be like, oh, it's fucking trash because that's a cracker. That's the trendy thing to say. But when you go to your, how you go to their house on the Saturday morning, what kind of fucking pizza box do they have? Exactly. Every time it's always this nonsense talking shit about literally the most amazing pizza ever made. Provella cheese. Actually, it's a tie. There's a, there's a three-way tie for incredible pizzas. Uh-huh. They all come from St. Louis. Okay. And they're not all three on this list. Only one is on the list. Why don't we do a single specific one, but I'm not gonna. I'm like, both of these brands are going to be available nationwide. Who Katie's pizza deserves superior. Katie's is up there. Okay. Katie's pizza is a superior pizza. Everybody agree? No, there's no doubt about that. Have you ever tried their take home pizza that grocery store pizza? It's fucking amazing. Okay. And they just got to deal with Walmart. They're going to be everywhere. So wherever you live, the next time you go in your store, look for Katie's pizza. Know that that's from St. Louis. It comes from amazing people here in St. Louis. And it's definitely superior pizza. That's not an ad. That's just as good as shit. You could sponsor me though, Katie. And the other one, the other one is Antoninos. Antoninos. Antoninos on the hill. Now, I think they're doing at home now. They're just getting it going. Okay. But if you want to fucking gourmet, ridiculous pizza, Antoninos has it, bro. And that's not an ad either. Those are just my people. So that was all going at the top. Okay. Now we do. We got good pizza here. We do. I mean, fuck there's thousands we can name. We do. But everybody from the East Coast, because they, you know, they all got big old fucking yappers. Yeah. You know, they talk. They come here and they yappy, happy. People from St. Louis are a little more quiet. Yeah. We're reserved. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to come here to look. Yeah. And we're just like, yeah, whatever bro, then leave. Yeah, right. Don't come back. Yeah. All right. Casey's Casey's pizza. This is, so this is gas station pizza. It is. Everybody knows Casey's. Okay. I will say Casey's is gas station pizza. But it's better than all those other pizza. It's pretty fucking good. Yeah. It's all right. You got to call in and order it. They'll make it for you. It's pretty good, dude. See? Now, I give it a B. I give it a B. Okay. All right. And he's feeling a little generous today. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Dominoes. Where's Dominoes? Dominoes has made massive improvements to their pizza. Their garlic butter. It used to be total garbage. Okay. It used to be the little caesars. But now it's become, I say, respectable delivery pizza. Mm-hmm. If you're like drunk. Right? So, so like Dominoes is a drunk pizza. Yeah. Yeah. But it's fucking great when you're drunk, dude. It is good shit. I mean, or cold. By the way, they're usually open. Yeah. You call those guys late. They will bring you some pizzas. Yeah. So I give them some points for that too. Dominoes is good. I would say Dominoes is a, it's a B. Yeah. And I think it's a C. It's not as good as Casey's. Oh, see, I think it's better than Casey's, but I would switch Casey's and Dominoes, bro. Really? Yeah. Well, it's a good thing you're not running the show. So put that down. I work at the PowerPoint. That Dominoes there in the C. You know, just like I told you to. All right. Now, now this is a classic. This is a classic. So, Sino's pizza rolls. Those are fucking deep, bro. That's that's that's that's that is my childhood, bro. Tino's pizza. Yes, I understand that. So we had. I know you're emotionally attached to pizza rolls. And I know there's a lot of people, bro. They are, but I mean, that's a fucking that's a C. Give me a guy to go to see that's a C, bro. You baked the mother fuckers, bro, for like 15 minutes, if that's a C, then Dominoes is a B. Okay. I'll give you that. All right. I'll let you have a move. Okay. All right. But for me, on the call, Tino's is disgusting. You know, Tino's pizza rolls. I just realized first of all, dude, when do you ever ate one? When is anybody in the history of fucking pizza rolls ever ate a pizza roll and I had a burner fucking mouth? Yeah. It's like it's an unedible food. It's the best part. Yeah, unedible, whatever. I'm not a fanatic genius. I'm a DJ. You know, I just realized that I thought it was toast Tino's. There's not a S in there. You call it Tos Tino's your whole life. Yeah. Bro, what's that? No, it's like the fucking Bernstein Bayer's, bro. I just had a moment. I could have swore with the Tino's. I could have swore with the S in there. Pizza rolls. I don't like them, bro. They're not my pain relief. I, you know, I used to eat a lot of those too when I was younger. Yeah. Just try my thing, bro. That's the struggle. I get it. I don't like it. All right. DeGiorno, not delivery. DeGiorno for real talk. DeGiorno for a fucking at home pizza can be pretty decent. The pretty decent, bro. I like the cheese stuff. I put that in the C category. Okay. They're not, it's not nearly on the level of Katie's or Anthony. Oh, no, for sure. Yeah. By the way, just so you know, Katie's and Anthony knows you see that shit in your store. You take that home. That's like a nice night, bro. You don't fucking, like you don't, you, that's like a, I'm going to have a date. Nice little date. And I have some, you might have a whiskey. Me myself. She might have a wine. Yeah. You know, the candles going like that's a pizza. That's like a good pizza, bro. To pie. Yes. Yeah. So that's the my palate. I have an elevate my palate has gotten more refined. Did I elevate your palate Andy? Yeah. For sure. I don't know where you learned all that stuff, but like you definitely know the pretty good stuff. DJ's a fancy guy. That sounded gay. Oh, did it? Yep. Well, I didn't mean it in that way. I did. See, I'm not against gay people. Like you guys are, you bunch of homophobic fucking bigots over here. I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to be honest. I go to dinner with DJ. He knows some fancy shit that I didn't know about. I'm a white trash eater, bro. I still like to kiddo's a quick trip. I feel you, bro. You know, I'm just happy I could satisfy. Bro, we started getting these steaks one time from like all my buddies sent me these steaks. I can't remember what the company's called up in New York. I think it's DeBrogas or something. Oh, yeah. You have one of those. Yeah. Yeah. You're so good. It's some good meat. Bro, we started getting them. And I had, we had to stop getting them because like it made the other, all the other steaks taste like shit. Yeah. You know, that's what that's what fucking Katie's and Emos and Anthony knows done for me. If beats a little pizza, yeah, that's all there's very few places I've had good pizza outside of St. Louis for sure. Bro, you go to Chicago. It's all fucking sauce, dude. If that deep dish shit, no shit is overrated, guys. I'm sorry. It is. It's overrated. Like what do they, you go in there and it's this fucking thick. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. You got fucking heartburn for three fucking days. Like it's not, it's overrated. New York pizza is pretty good. But the, my complaint about New York style pizza is that it's usually like a kind of soggy. Yeah. Like I wish it would, they would cook it just like a five more minutes, bro, and it'd be pretty good. A little, a little, a nice crust. Yeah. Yeah. Little Caesars. That's, I mean, we all know we're little Caesars. You go to little Caesars when you're fucking looking in the couch for quarters and shit. Yeah. That's a fact. $5,000. Yeah. We all been there. All right. There's all, there is a time in all of our lives where little Caesars was the deal. It says it was all we could get. It's like taking home the really ugly girl at the bar. You know what? Shit, man. That was a grenade, bro. Yeah. You know, I wouldn't know, but I assume that's like that. So I've heard. Yeah. Pizza Hut. That belongs next to the ominous. I would agree. Yeah. I like pizza. Pizza has good pizza. All right. Now last but certainly not least. The Papa John's. Papa John's goes to fucking there's not enough levels down. Papa did, maybe this sounds personal, bro. It is personal. It's fucking very personal. I thought they got, they got pizza. I used to think so too. Yeah. Fuck Papa John's. We don't even allow Papa John's to be delivered in our businesses. Like if you order Papa John's in one of my companies and I fucking see it, I will fire you. That's how much I hate Papa John's. Oh, but the pepper and the little fucking garlic butter sauce. It's not about the food. It's about how I was treated at Papa John's principle. One time when I was about 20 years old, okay. I was in living in Springfield, Missouri. And it snowed like two feet, legit two feet, and everything was closed. But Papa John's was open. So I ordered the pizza and I was driving in his Susu rodeo. You probably don't even remember what the fuck that was. I think I know that it is. Yeah. So I drove that motherfucker. It took me like an hour to get up to Papa John's. And I go in there and I had a credit card and I go up there to get my pizza and the dudes like, we're not taking credit card now. Cash only. And I'm like, what are you talking about? Cash only. You didn't tell me that on the phone before I drew up here for a fucking hour. So he goes, well, our credit card receipt paper is a credit card machines out of paper. A lot of papers can't take credit card. I said, no, you can still take credit card. It'll batch out at the night. Charge will go through. Because I fucking own a business. I know how to use a POS. Yeah. Yeah. I said, so just charge me for the for the amount and we'll be good. No. And I'm like, what do you mean? No, I just drove up here for fucking hour. And he's like, well, you could drive back home for a fucking hour. Oh, fun. And so like that's what he said to me. And so I started getting upset and I'm like, hey, this is fucking bullshit, bro. Like, you know, anyway, the guy ends up calling the cops. Yeah. So it went back and forth. He and I took them an hour to get there. Well, I left before they got there because I knew it would take him a long time. So, so anyway, so I call the store back the next day. And I'm like, hey, this is what happened, bro. And so this guy, the store owner calls me or somehow I got the store owner on the phone the next day. And I said, hey, this is what happened where he went to that guy. And that guy told him that he told me that if I went across the street and got to the ATM, which I couldn't because it was fucking closed, that he would give me the pizza for the cash. And I said, he's fucking lying, dude. Yeah. And so anyway, so they look up on the fucking cameras. I was telling the truth. They were lying. And corporate Papa John's calls me like fucking four days later. And they actually offered me free pizza for life. No shit. Yeah, I told them to fuck off. Oh, Andy. Yeah. So, man, that's it. The guy was a fuck, don't hire fucking assholes. There's a good business. So Papa John's can suck a dick forever. Yeah. And if you eat it, you can too. So we'll just leave Papa John's at the bottom right? Papa John's shouldn't be considered in this conversation. I fucking hate Papa John's. It's a good pizza. I products are right. Yeah. You know, but you know, maybe they fixed things since then. Yeah. But I, you know, it ain't my thing, bro. Ain't my thing. I don't appreciate that. Yeah. No, listen, service is a, you know what? I told them motherfuckers. I said one day everybody's gonna fucking know what you did. That day is today. Oh, fuck, man. All right. I'm satisfied with this. See, I'm gonna get mine no matter what? Like your motherfuckers think you can fuck me? Real talk. I will get back at you. You do not understand. I never forget. I never forgive. Payback is coming. So you better off apologizing now than letting me get that get to the part of the list where your name is on it. Pro Papa John's bro, you're gonna have corporate. They're gonna have a fucking terrible sales day today. I mean, the fuck this is I don't appreciate it. No, it's right. Because dude, for me to get even any kind of resolution, I had to get all the way to the top and take that. Yeah. And it wasn't like there was like five conversations that happened between that and the fucking people kept siding with this fucking clown. You know, like he's straight up lying, dude. And so I ended up getting, you know, like I made enough noise to where I got a call from like somebody who could do something. And I'm not interested at that point. You know, I just wanted you to know what the fuck you got going on there. Yeah, right. And like bro, I'm all about forgiveness when you make a genuine effort to forgive or accountability or something. But like because dude, that guy deserves some sort of punishment, bro. Like, and then they try to fucking buy you off free pizza forever. No, I'm not eating your pizza ever again, bro. And not only am I not eating your pizza, I'm not letting my people eat your pizza in my presence. It's not happening. I love it. Yeah, I fucking mean it. I love it. So if you work in one of my companies, because I don't see you all my fuckers every day, just know, by walking or eating Papa John's, we're gonna have a problem. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over. Your life is over. It's over. All right. Well, I'm pretty satisfied with this list. I like that we didn't put Papa John on it. Yeah, we won't even put it up there. Yeah.
