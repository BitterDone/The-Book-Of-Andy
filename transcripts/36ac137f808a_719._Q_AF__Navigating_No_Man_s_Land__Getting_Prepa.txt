It's a we got a good weekend looking for to yeah, it's been some good time today tomorrow Man and by this time Monday, man We'll be running full seam This is Monday Don't don't start that shit Andy. Don't you it is my that shit Don't bet but look man. I got I got three good ones for you. All right. Let's get after let's get better Just let's make some people better guys and the question number one high Andy in team. My name is Anthony I'm 29 years old and I've transformed my life because of 75 heart and all facets mentally and physically I'm a public servant firefighter in a large city in Arizona and I find myself getting let down by people in regular relationships on a day-to-day basis And in building new ones I get to a point where I understand that they're not about being real as fuck my question is How do you navigate having high expectations for people? And always getting let down but keeping a positive mindset for future relationships. Thanks for the help every single show I'm not a hoe I appreciate all well. Hey, man I think that's a great question. You know, here's the thing we have to understand When we go out and we try to get better and we try to improve and we raise our personal standards we are elevating ourselves into a Place where there are just less people available that share that standard all right higher standards Equal fewer people to connect with so What you're experiencing is you've raised your standards you've decided to be a better person You've decided that you were going to pursue excellence You've decided that you're going to get the most out of your potential and now because you've decided that and you've committed to it You're looking around at everybody else and you're noticing that they don't do that and when you were one of them You didn't notice it because that's just what we did So now that you've committed to being better it stands out and it becomes very obvious all right So that's a challenge because most people are going to continue to live the way that you always live before you became Who it is that you are now and that can be very frustrating because we spend time alone, but here's the thing People often say things like oh, it's lonely at the top or I can't find anybody to relate to That's not the truth the truth of the matter is is that you're in between phases, okay when you started out on 75 hard and you said man I want to get more out of my life. I want to improve. I want to get better Everybody else around you was doing the same things that you've been doing and now that you've elevated You have moved on past that group and you have started to progress down the path and you just haven't Connected with the next group of people that are going to share your mindset share your drive and goals for yourself You haven't gotten that network of friends built so you're in what we call no man's land All right, no man's land is when people start to become successful They start to get better and they find themselves alone because all of their old friends are now Kind of out of their life and they haven't developed new friends yet And this is where people come with that saying oh well, it's lonely at the top no dude You're not at the top you just got fucking started all right You're just in between phases and you need to settle into this new lifestyle give it some time start to you know Rekindle these relationships and build friendships with people who are like minded and once you start to do that You're gonna find that that old group of friends Was holding you back and you're gonna realize they were holding you back a lot more than you realized at the time And you're also going to figure out that this new group of friends is much more rewarding and fulfilling to be friends with because they share the same Viewpoints that you have the same desire you have the same drive you have the ambitions the goals the dreams They are connected to you in that same way So you move away from people who are saying stuff like oh man Don't forget where you came from oh dude. What do you think you're better than everybody? Oh, you're getting a little too big for your bridges there and all these people that try to you know Pull you back into their circle and you move into a group of people where they're like bro This is awesome that you're doing that. You know what? Let's get together and work on this. You know what? Let's go outside and get a workout in together You know what let's do this. It's gonna improve both of us. Let's collab. Let's build this Let's do this and now you're in a whole new group of network that actually pushes you forward Which makes progressing that much easier and if you choose to continue to progress beyond that point You will continue into another phase of no man's land because there will be people in the second group who decide this is good enough for me This is where I want to be and that's okay, but the longer you go the more times you go through this process of sort of washing away the old and replacing with the new and That's a good thing because we're not supposed to just stay stagnant or a whole life Just because you were born around certain people doesn't mean you have to stay around certain people Just because you had friends in high school or friends in college doesn't mean that you need to be doing the same shit that you were doing in high school Or college or else you're not real anymore. You're you you forgotten us or you're too good for us That's bullshit. That's what losers fucking say to make you feel shitty and do you really want that in your life? No, it's annoying all right And every time you scale up and every time you push forward you're gonna find yourself connecting with more and more people that Not only Encourage your success, but also contribute to it So you're just going through the normal process, dude. This is part of it and You're in between friend groups and what I would encourage you to do is to stay on the path Keep pushing keep getting better and the right people will find you the right people will start to realize that you're this kind of person And you will start to connect with these people one by one by one and soon after some time You'll have a whole new network of friends, but there is no quick fix to this there is no you know Group or whatever that you can join that'll just automatically get people To replace your old friends, you know like this is a process and it takes time now You know, you could go on the internet and you could you know search 75 hard hashtags and you could start to connect and follow and Kind of build your relationship with other people who are driven along the same goals You know, you could go to certain events like the one we just had this weekend summer smash where everybody's here aligned They're trying to get better. You could join communities that are you know, there's a lot of run clubs There's all these things around where people are getting together to improve and it's becoming more and more comments So that you can accelerate the process by doing things like that, but Ultimately, dude, here's the deal throughout your life You're going to continue to push and not everybody is and that's gonna be weird because you're gonna wonder why they're not pushing too And it's gonna be fucking annoying all right, but at the end of the day you can't sacrifice your potential and what you're supposed to become because of the inaction Or unwillingness of other people and you just have to keep going. Yeah, I love that man a couple things on that you know You mentioned like I feel like you know, it's almost like a it's a bad Expectation to think that you know this new group of people is just gonna magically find you yeah There is some work on your part that you have to do yeah to cultivate those relations for sure I think that's super awesome one thing you always also say to do is you know high-tides raises all shit That's right now with that being said like you can like yeah, I'm sure you know You might get one of your friends that move up with you. That's right, but I feel like a lot of people will have a knee-jerk reaction Where you know they put themselves at this higher standard they made it up here They know it feels great, but then because it's so much pressure from those people they tend to all right Well, maybe this standard I can drop this one just a little bit. It's like a knee-jerk reaction almost right I'll just lower this when I maybe just want to be People will cause you to compromise yeah, and dude you can't compromise because once you start to compromise You start to compromise everything so there can be no Compromise in your standards and if you compromise it wins the next time you're gonna compromise the next standard and the next It creates a snowball of compromise to where eventually you find yourself back where you were all right And yeah for sure and usually it does get worse because once the once the slippery slope starts. It's hard to stop it But you know this concept is the same in relationships like romantic relationships partner relationships You know, it's not just friendships like a lot of people you like a lot of you guys are out there looking for a significant Other you're trying to meet people, but you're not considering like what you bring to the table like you you think you're gonna Go out there and you're gonna meet you know some person who's got all their shit together But you don't have your shit together and what you have to realize and what I hope you do is that you won't settle until you're in a really good Place because when you get to a really good place You're gonna attract people who are also on that level which means your Your ability to to get the ideal partner is gonna be much greater at that point in time So you know we have to consider that too dude like look Yeah, you gotta live your life. Yeah, you gotta have fun. Yeah, you gotta have friends Yeah, you gotta date all these things But you should realize that you're never gonna get the best of those things until you're the best product yourself And that's going to take you taking six months taking a year and becoming Exactly who the fuck you're supposed to be and you could accelerate the results of your life in a tremendous fashion by just saying hey You know what? I'm not dating I'm not fucking around. I'm not going to do this I am going to put the next year 100% on me. I'm gonna become the best version of myself And then at the end of that year, I'm going to evaluate and I'm gonna tell you this dude if you take that mentality All your friends are gonna be better the people that want to be friends with you are gonna be better You're gonna make more money. You're gonna have a better life the people who want to fuck you are gonna be a lot better options Okay, so I'd have no other way to say that, but that's the reality like Yeah, become the best you get the best You're not entitled to anything so yeah, I love it man. I love it guys any question number two Hey Andy, I'm 18 years old just graduated high school Not going to college, but I want to go into business and build something looking at your life and seeing that you were in my shoes I know it's possible You always talk about reality and how the real world works and I feel like I'm unprepared My question is what was going through your mind when you were about to leave the nest How did you work through that where your parents supportive? I mean you were 19 in the city with just you and your best friend just going I need some help in insight Well, you know, I was fortunate that I grew up with parents that sort of let me do what I needed to do They weren't too overbearing, you know, they let me go out and make mistakes without like you know putting too many rules or restrictions on me and you know I was sort of allowed to do whatever I wanted as long as I didn't get in trouble and I Think that helped me because that way when I was away from home. I didn't go crazy I already kind of understood how to handle myself So there wasn't any awkwardness there, you know when I said hey, I'm moving to Springfield and I'm gonna start a business I mean it wasn't like anybody said no, you know, so I just did it And I don't come from a traditional family. I wouldn't you know like I didn't grow up with the white pick offense and we sat down for dinner every day It was it was you know, it was different and So I don't know that wasn't really a factor for me now was I nervous to go out and try to do something Did I feel unqualified? Did I question myself? Did I doubt myself? Did I think you know? Fuck am I going to be one of the people who are chosen for success? Absolutely, I you always wonder that in the beginning. Do I have what it takes? Yep, dude That's that's normal all right, but you have to fundamentally if I could like I Wish I could like reach into to you guys who are young into your brain and make you realize just this one point and It's this I Used to think like you think I used to think there was magic to it or there was luck or you had to be in a special Circumstance or you had to know this person or you had to be like and invite it into the club I used to think like all these things that you guys think like You know am I going to be one of these people that is chosen quote-unquote For success and if you've been following me for a while you've heard me talk about the quote-unquote success fairy And how I used to think about it was like there's like people and you have a group of people that are like You know there's ten of us in the room and one of us gets chosen to be successful by some force that we don't understand And I call that force the success fairy and what you have to understand guys is none of that shit is real None of that shit is true. There is no success fairy There is no special fucking secret club with secret handshakes and there is no you know You got to know this person or that person you will meet those people as you go out and build things That will accelerate your career, but nobody meets those people on day one You know you're gonna have doubt you're gonna have frustration you're gonna have anger you're gonna have mistakes but Those things are necessary for you to gain the skills all right, so When you really look at what it takes to build something like from my perspective I can very confidently say it is very simple It's inputs equal outputs. It is what I do and what that creates and if you show up every day and you're effective every single day And you continue that for as long as you can and keep the ratio of wins much higher than you do losses meaning like you win Let's say 95% of the days or even 90% of the days bro There's no denying that you'll get where you want to go It just depends on how long it's gonna take some of you guys come from total shit Like for real and I'm most you guys will say you come from shit, but really you come from a middle class upbringing doing all right There's people who come from fucking literally nothing no parents fucking Adopted no money dirt poor we're in the same clothes every day who have built Literally billion dollar businesses, okay if those motherfuckers can do it. I'm a hundred percent sure that you can do it so But it might take that person longer because they didn't grow up with you know parents that taught them about business or Parents that you know taught them basic things in life. So yeah, we all started a different place and that means that It might take you longer, but that doesn't mean it's impossible and that's what you have to understand if you were born in a shitty spot And that's the card you got dealt guess what the reality is you got to do more work That's what a fucking comes down to and you can bitch about you could cry about you could play about it You can write fucking blogs about it. You could make videos crying in your car about it. It ain't fucking fair There's no it's not fair But if you just accept the way that it is and you say all right look I was born with fucking bullshit circumstances I better get to work because it's gonna take me five years longer It's gonna take the guy who grew up in upper middle class America. You know what I'm saying? So We just have to accept that and we have to understand that it's still possible It doesn't mean it's impossible and there's no magic to it all it is is You try something it fails. Why did it fail? Learn a lesson you try something again. It works. Then you try the next thing it fails Why did it fail you learn a lesson then you try it again? And it works. That's the process that's repeated Thousand hundreds of thousands of times over the years that makes you a skilled operator and that brings you success fulfillment and the life that you desire and anybody can achieve it So that's that's the that's the way the game works I want to ask you this man because you do know a lot of successful people right like you know these people You can touch them you feel them right have you noticed that Is there any like correlation between you know having you know the The late start behind the starting line by the unfair Initial circumstances. Have you have you seen the correlation between that and the people who are super successful? Pro I actually think it's a huge advantage. That's what I'm saying like I think you're more successful Yes, yes, it is a huge advantage to come from fucking nothing Here is why because you had the biggest mother fucking chip on your shoulder you could possibly have you got fucked in every way Everybody tells you shit. Nobody thinks you're gonna succeed Everybody laughs at your shit and if you're smart you could absorb that energy and use it to move forward and dude Every single successful person at a massive level has this crazy story of how the fuck they did it and where they came from And it's not because they just get there and start making up stories bro It's because those people have something to prove they have a mission They have an enemy and those are three things that you have to have to be successful So if you're one of these people and you're moping around but I'm not coming from nothing You're blinding yourself to the reality that it's actually one of the biggest advantages for the massive amounts of success that you could create Do you think that middle class weak-ass pussy mother fuckers gonna do the shit that you're willing to do He doesn't even know what hardship is those people are easy as fuck to beat if you come from that place So like dude don't cry about it use it to your advantage and I guarantee you You'll be much more successful than the soft mother fuckers that come from the rich family that their mom and dad pay for everything for them That's really shit man. Yeah, I know it's real bro It's funny too man because you know What you said there's like you know, it seems it just seems so wild and Unreal when you can look at somebody's life and see where they are right But then they take you to a little grave a road And you're like bro this how the like how does this make sense you know but but it makes it was the first thing I did when I fucking met you that's what we did bro I showed you my place and you showed me your place bro You know why I did that to show you where you came because I didn't want you to think I was some rich fucking mother fucker Didn't know shit. Yeah, first day I work with DJ I said get in the fucking truck and I took him to where we fucking grew up and I said this is where we come from Yeah, the reason for that is I didn't want you to fucking think that I just is where you came shit out of my ass bro This I fucking I have paid in blood for the life that I have and that's how I know it's possible for all these mother fuckers out there Should be willing to do it. Yeah, yeah, I love it man. I fucking love it guys Andy. Let's get to our third and final question. Question number three Uh Andy my name is Tanner Uh, and I'm an entrepreneur at a global company my job deals with a lot of networking and building relationships uh, and because of this Alcohol is typically involved and I have realized that drinking alcohol hinders my ability to be great Um, I'm not saying the people who drink are wrong I have just realized that it's not good for me and the life that I am trying to build How can I still network in my job while not doing uh, what the people I am trying to build relationships in the workplace Are doing I don't want to seem rude or virtuous Uh, but any advice would be great now you like I you have your great person as because you haven't really drank Alcohol since what 20 was the 2017 2018 2018 right and I'm sure you get all I mean I do it's like twice two three times a year Right, it was just like before that I drank Thursday for I sat on a Sunday Every week for my for 10 years 20 years, okay, so how do we handle this B.O.D.R bro authenticity wins When people sit down at dinner and everybody's drinking and you just say I don't know I'm good. I drink this And just stand on that without making any excuses or apologizing that actually builds credit and respect with other people That shows that you have self control that shows that you care about what you're doing So I would recommend just being who you are all right There's something very powerful about someone sitting down and saying now I'm just gonna get a tonic water Or I'm gonna get to this or I'm gonna get to that a diet coke or whatever right And people saying what do you don't drink no, I drink I'm just not drinking now There that that shows people that you're in control that shows people that you take your shit serious and in fact I have when that happens to me and we're in a social situation and someone sits down and just says everybody's drinking and says I don't I'm not drinking that shows that that person is not breakable by pure pressure So they actually fucking says a whole lot about you without saying anything So I wouldn't try to compromise that I wouldn't try to explain it the key is to not explain it does my next question Do you owe the my explanation? There's a matter of anybody in explanation like you're a grown fucking man. I do what the fuck I want That's the attitude that you need to have people respect that it's authentic. It's real And if you could sit down and do that it's like look dude If I was a dinner with all of you guys and we were all drinking and the new guy showed up And he was like You know Yeah, I don't I'm not drinking what you don't what you got a problem with it you're a pussy No, what do you alcoholic No, man, I sometimes I do but I'm not right now because I'm doing this and this you know, I'm gonna look at that dude I'm gonna be like he's driving I'm gonna be like that guy can fucking make decisions that will not be affected by the pressure of everybody else I'm gonna look at it like that guy's in control of his life I'm gonna look at it like that guy possesses a certain amount of discipline that most people don't possess And I am gonna look at the other guys and be like man, I wonder if these other guys got that Okay, so there's a lot of credit that you could build by just owning who the fuck you are And not apologizing for it and you certainly don't need to apologize to anybody for not fucking putting alcohol on your body Like that that's not an explanation that you need to have now if you have a problem like If you feel awkward about it or whatever you're not ready to make that stance. I would just Ask you to recognize that the right people will respect that if they don't respect it and they make fun in They make they peer pressure and this and that bro that probably not a good group people be around Yeah, that's but that was my next question for you because I mean, this is such a great topic, but You know like and I don't want to foreshadow any like you know Like bad things in this guy's life ten or hope you're doing great. Hope you love where you work But do you think that I mean isn't a possibility is there something to be like like genuinely cautious about That could become a reality because I know for me like I don't drink how I used to drink right? Yeah And like I'll be honest like drunk people kind of annoy me. Yeah, right? And so it's like Do you think it's something that he should be aware of that there may come a time where you just may not want to be doing that line of work, bro because it can get It can get annoying. Yeah, you know, I'm saying like it may not just be good for the environment for you Is that a possibility? Yeah, for sure, you know look man I can't say yes or no to that. It just depends on the person It does depend on what profession you're in there are professions like You know Honestly a lot of them where alcohol is a major factor, right? It's culture, bro It's your best culture and you're yes, but the problem with that is is that most of these motherfuckers can't build culture without it Right, they can't operate without it What kind of dude would you think of someone if they were able to have a great time and you know for a fact They didn't have one fucking drink that makes you like triple cool, right? So like you know people People drink it's a part of business. It's a part of networking. I understand that but I think if you handle it right I know if you handle it right people actually respect you and and what will end up happening is like some of the other guys will come up and be like you know How do you do that? What do you do? You know, what do you tell me about your training because dude They don't want to be fat fucking drunks either bro. They just are because they don't they lack the ability to say no Because of the social pressures involved right and that's something that works, you know, what won't you do live hard once you do 75 hard It honestly becomes really easy to just tell people to eat shit You know what I'm saying like because dude you realize that other people just are not living at a higher standard That goes back to the the first question we had you know Yeah, until your point DJ. It's really hard for me to be around people that don't hold a high standard You know what I'm saying like drunk drunk motherfucker. We're saying drunk people I don't say it like I don't drink the dinner. It's not even drunk people bro I don't mind if like one of my friends gets drunk like I'm like, oh that's cool like fucking at party hard to I get it, you know But what I do mine is when someone's fat as fuck they're fucking got that red drunk face They're clearly a piece of shit and they're always fucking drunk and they're always talking Bro, I punched those motherfuckers in the face. I can't fucking stand oxygen. I cannot fucking stand them I'm like dude listen to this guy listen to this guy talk shit about how good his life thinks he is He's fat. He's fucking Shits hanging over his belt. He's drinking 500 beers. He's not making any money And he's talking shit about all this stuff like dude Like that's just a bullshit human being real talk. So that's real man Let me let me follow up on one more thing to you here because and I'm not saying that this is this guy situation But you know, he's like I don't want to seem rude a virtuous How rude huh? It's rude to yourself to not be true to yourself 100% you know what's rude Violating your own integrity because of the pressure that other people put on you that's fucking rude You know what's rude is giving up on your own hopes and dreams because some fucking losers say shit Okay, that's rude You you have to be self you have to be self Focused you have to be selfish almost about your dreams and hopes because everybody else will try to erode them because they don't have those You see what I'm saying 100% man. I was just saying that to say like I mean how much Like self-talks a real thing man like and how many like do you think this is a thing to where he's just like these conversations in this negative I guess Reaction to this stuff like it's all in his mind kind of like I mean is it really a reality that people are that like just complete dicks like that or are these conversations he's making up in his head to think no I think it's him not being comfortable In that situation yet you know what I'm saying yeah, yeah, okay, so just be mindful of it. I love dude. I'll you know real talk dude like Just look at the motherfuckers the pressure you to drink Do you want their life? Do you want what they got really like because I don't I look at people like that real talk like you know How I look at it I do like I walk away This fucking douche. Yeah, you know, I'm saying yeah, I don't care how much fucking money you got you You can't control yourself you're not in control of your own life. Yeah Whatever you got you're definitely missing someone to go and I just look at him and I'm like dude Honestly like this is gonna sound so fucking wrong. I don't care. I just look at them and I'm like that guys are pussy And I'm not that guys weak and I'm not that guys less than me. He is and that's that's reality because he is You know, it's it's not that's not arrogance to say somebody with more self control and more discipline more mental toughness It's a higher quality human being that somebody without it. That's just reality dude. This is You know people love to say this shit. What do you think you're better than everybody? Yeah That fucking scorecard says so I Fucking handle my shit. I fucking have discipline and this goes for you guys too if you have it I got my shit together. I'm working hard. I'm doing the right things. I'm living a virtuous life I'm doing the best that I can you aren't even trying yes that makes me better than you I'm sorry that you don't get to be the best when you live like shit And I put in all this work to be who the fuck I am that's like you oh Oh, so you believe in participation trope right basically yeah, right like it's an absurd conversation and people love to throw that shit out there And it's never rich people are fucking people that have high levels of success that say that shit They're never out there saying oh that guy that has a little like you never hear a wealthy person or someone who's got all their shit together Say oh that guy that's got more than me thinks he's better than me. That's not the fuck they think Only fucking losers say that shit and it's to validate themselves for not even trying dude Most people legitimately wait their entire week to go out and drink beer Like for real that like I was overpriced beer. Yeah, by Thursday. They're going to fucking Happy hour Friday night. They're party in ball Saturday some sort of day drinking and then fucking night drinking Sunday I know because I live this I did this for years Okay, my life sucked. I wasn't happy. I wasn't fulfilled. I was making far less money. I could have made I wasn't good in terms of friendships or relationships like And that's reality dude Like there's guys that were better than me and not even where I'm at now. They're still dudes better than me now And we have to be able to admit that that guy's got a shit together more than me That that should that shouldn't be some whiny shit like oh that guy thinks he's better than me. It should be like Damn dude, I need to get better. They're guys better than me. Yeah, I gotta get up there Yeah, that's how winners think winners look at people that are further down the road from them and say fuck All right, I got work to do and they get to work They don't hate the motherfucker because he's doing better. They're like fuck that's inspiring. Yeah, 100 present man I love it. Well guys, Andy One more one special sauce. Yeah, yeah, all right special sauce try give him a full the full 45 girth the full four point five In your case, yeah That's two trophies. I'm giving him a dime. Oh god damn you didn't say nothing. You don't have to you did all right Guys, Andy question before a little special sauce. What's good Andy? I just wanted to start by saying thank you for changing my life I've been following since mfceo and I've really bossed the fuck up since listening to you I was homeless without a job straight up lost By listening to your podcast completing the 75 hard program I am now a six-figure professional tattoo artist that works at one of the most famous studios in the country My life has completely changed. I owe you bro Now as I mentioned earlier, I am not working at a famous tattoo studio with some real heavy hitters I've been here for five months now and to be honest things cannot be going any better I am growing in the company tattoos are getting better and building great rapport with the owners of the company I can't help but notice that the attention that I am receiving from ownership on top Uh, maybe my personality is starting to step on some toes of people that I work with Especially people who have a much longer tenure than I do at the studio I've heard the saying to never outshine the master I have only been tattooing professionally for about three years So the last thing I want to do is seem arrogant or cocky Coming from an athletic background. I have a team first mindset But as I'm noticing these co-workers talking shit I'm starting to wonder if I should even give a fuck Um, I put in the work and I ask the questions whenever I get the opportunity I want to be a team player but at the same time I don't want to let someone else's insecurity stop me from being the best version of myself Should I try to accommodate these workers to keep a friendly peaceful work environment or should I just say fuck them We ball and keep moving regardless of how people I uh fill about it. All right first of all never let anyone Fucking anyone slow you to fuck down bro if people stay in your way you run them to fuck over Okay, you don't wait for him to catch up you fucking make him catch up all right This question is such an important question because so many people struggle with this they start to get good And then their friends that they made in the workplace start to like notice and then they start to like tone it back down It's no different than what we talked about with low no man's land. All right So what you need to realize and how how to handle this would be very very very simple one Continue to work your ass off and get better do everything better than everybody else Let your work speak for itself to the point where it embarrasses their work all right When they have a problem with it or they talk shit smile be cool Just laugh it off and keep moving all right treat him with respect if they're disrespectful to you Treat him with respect and what's gonna happen is your life is gonna speak for itself And their life is gonna speak for itself and by you treating them well even if they're being douchebags You're showing the ownership that like it's them not you okay? So when you have a situation where you have a bunch of employees and Then you have an ownership group then you have you who's new One of the things that can happen is because all these people have tenured relationships with the owners They can fucking go to the owner and be like this guy's a problem. This guy's a cancer guy This guy's it You don't see what he does when you're not around you don't see how he treats people And usually when people come to you the owners with that It's usually because they're high performing people and those people are threatened and they're trying to hold them back And your ownership will fucking recognize that as long as you continue to do great work If you continue to put in the work you continue to be humble about it open to getting better That's what I mean. I don't mean humble like oh, I'm no good. I mean humble like hey, what can I learn from this guy? How can I get better? How can I can prove? How can you make it known that you're looking to improve? All right That's what matters and that's what's gonna matter to the ownership and then when those guys go to the ownership and they start chirping about you know Oh Then the ownership is gonna look at those guys and be like the fuck's wrong with you and they're gonna start telling on themselves So but that will not happen if you treat them like shit back because remember they have a tenured relationship So if you were at those people were getting rude and you're like hey, fuck you motherfucker I'm better than you but I'm blah blah blah blah blah and start doing that The owner is likely to look at you as the cancer because you're the newest element to the team So it's very important do better keep on the gas stay humble enough to keep improving Work harder than everybody else produce better than everybody else and then when they fucking Have an opinion about it or you hear them talking keep a positive attitude treat them with respect and you do you the way that you know You're going to do you keep your integrity strong and they will weed themselves out or they will eventually join you And they will say you know what this guy's actually really good dude I'm gonna try to work get on his team So you'll either pull them with you or they will separate themselves because they will show themselves to be cancers So this idea of you know never outshot on the master that is that a relative that those guys are not the master those are peers Those are peers those are co-workers those are peers and by the way There's a way to outshine the master in fact if you have the right kind of master They want you to fucking outshine them because they want great people on the team But the problem is is that most of the time when people try to outshine the master they fucking have an ego about it If you have a if you have someone in your organization that's better than you it's something as an owner I'm glad about that I want that because I want the team to fucking win like if we're on a football team And I'm not as fast as the guy that's out there running up 4 to 40 on the on the Y receiver You think I just don't want him on the team because he's faster than me No, I want to fucking I want him on the team because he's gonna win in that position. So There's a way to do that. There's a way to be better than the guys who even own the company But also Recognize that you're better in this area You're not better than and you're just part of the team over here And you know that's the way to do that is to always stay humble To accept responsibility and give away credit That's a massive thing for peer leadership and leadership like if you're a leader It's not your job to get the credit everybody thinks that as a leader It's their job to get the flowers and the credit and the celebration and the claps That's not your job your job is to take that credit and push it to the team and say hey This is a team effort dude. I was walking through HQ today and and a guy was like You know your change is so many lives and I'm like no We are changing so many lives. You see what I'm saying and then when things go bad It's not oh my team fucking sucks. It's man. You know what I fucked up because I didn't show you guys how to do this the right way You see what I'm saying. So dude accept responsibility give the credit even as a peer leader and you're earning the respect of your team and the ownership I love it bro. I love it man. Well, that was for yeah What? Hmm. All right guys Let's go have a great week. I see you guys tomorrow
