Like I'm not trying to fucking participate. I'm trying to be number one. All right. You guys should join me. Yeah, man. Hey, look, it's a lot going on in the world, man. This is a, I know it's sad that if you guys watching Friday, when we recorded, there's a lot going on, man. Yeah. A lot of stuff. So let's just let's get into it, right? Well, hold on. How is Thanksgiving? I was good. Yeah. Yeah. It was good. What'd you do? You know, so you've been hitting hard on your diet lately, but it's just most serious. I've seen you. So yeah, I sent you my two week pick. I mean, look, yeah, you look, it's going. Yeah. I got a lot of work to do, but it's going. Not it was good, man. I went to my family's house and then went to Alex's side and it was cool. Yeah. Nice and easy. That's crazy. Yeah. I saw you smoke one of them. I did have one of those plums. Yes, they were. I like those plenties. Delicious. They are good, man. Really good, man. I've discovered more and more about cigars a little bit. And I think my favorites are now the Patrons. Those are good. The Patron 64s and the plenties. Well, that was just something about, you know, so I was at my mom, my family's side. And there's just something about smoking with cigar in the midst of poverty. It just... You feel like that much bigger of a boss? I got the zoom. I know it was the car, but if I would have zoomed out just a little bit, like you guys would have understood where I was feeling. Oh, so it was like a therapy. That was great. Yeah. I felt great. This is fucking great. Bro, you know what? I can't believe how much I like the cigar thing. I started to really like it. I'm doing it. Yes. So I hope it doesn't fucking kill me, man. Like dude, no, there's just one guy. I think he's like 103 or he may have died at this point. Yeah. He's like 100. He's like, you know, they asked him like, what's your secret? He's like, I drink like three fingers of scotch a day and I smoke a cigar every single day. Bro, I, I help three years old. Like earlier in my life, like I tried smoking cigars a few different times. Yeah. And I just never like, I never got it. I never got into it. But as I've gotten older and I've been around, like other guys that do it and like I've kind of seen the dynamic because it's not about, it's not just about the cigar. It's about the conversation around the cigar. And that's what I'm starting to really enjoy. You know, they're opening a cigar club here in St. Louis called Carbon. No, it opens December 15th. And I'm a founding member of it. So yeah. So we're going to have to go. It's like members only, but I'm sure they'll let you in. Yeah. Well, you have to come. You're going to have to let me in. It's part of the team. Yeah. That's what it is. So I'm excited about that. Um, but yeah, dude, I don't know. I'm something about, like I used to be really big into it. I actually, I had a membership at a cigar bar over in Sula. I used to go to all the time. I had a little locker and everything. But then once we moved, it's like, there's nothing really close out there. But I'm building myself a little little cigar shop down in my basement. Yeah. It's nice. Yeah. Yeah. I've been wondering where my scar's been going. Andy comes over one day. I have an inventory is a little low. Where the fuck you can all be sure. No, man. It's it's fine with me as long as I know when I come over, I'm supposed to get shit. Hey, always. Yeah. Only the best. That's right. That's right. Yeah, man. Well, let's get into the cruise, man. I got a lot of stuff going on. Let's let's knock this out, man. It's a trending topic right now. So let's just cover briefly. You know, we've covered the Palestine Israel thing. But there hasn't been a development. That's important to bring up. But it's bringing a lot of interesting feedback on it. Right. So the headline read, Tamas releases 13 Israeli hostages, 11 others to cease fire holds. So the terrorist group of mosques released their first wave of hostages beginning a four day exchange that has paused the violence in Gaza. 24 hostages were transported out of Gaza via the Rafa border crossing on Friday, according to the times of Israel siding Israeli officials. Now, at least 10 Thai nationals and 13 Israelis were released into the care of Red Cross personnel who were seeing carry in those rescued via ambulance from Gaza into Egypt, the Israeli hostages were then expected to be transported to Israel to receive care at various hospitals. Qatar, a key player in the cease fire deal negotiations said 24 hostages have been released in total, including 10 Thai citizens and a Filipino citizen earlier. The Thai foreign ministry said that 12 Thai citizens have been released by Hamas. Now, Israel Hamas have agreed to a four day cease fire during which the terrorist group will release 50 women and children taking on in the October 7th attack on Israel in exchange for 150 Palestinians in prison by Israel. So that's the gist of it. Now, here's the counter narrative and what this has to do with us here in America. This is a trending topic on Twitter right now and the topic is no Americans. They have at least 10 that we know of. Then this guy, Carmen Savia, he tweeted this out, he said, President Joe Biden has said to have brokered the deal for the hostages with Israel and Hamas and somehow no Americans were included. This man is seen now. Not only within that included Biden is quoted to say he was gratified by the exchange, by the deal in the cease fire. Quote in a direct quote, quote, Jill and I have been keeping all those held hostage and their loved ones close to our hearts these many weeks and I am extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls who have endured weeks of captivity and an unspeakable or deal will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented. I'my said in the statement thanking the leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Israel for their efforts to secure the agreement. Now, it should be noted, this is the first wave, but I do have a problem with how we are funding this. Taxpayers, American taxpayers are funding this, right? We couldn't even get a couple, right? Anybody, any anything on this? Well, I mean, I think in these situations, we have to think as if we were them, why it would be this way, right? And so if I was thinking as the leader of Hamas, we're getting our asses beat in. Okay. All of our children are being murdered in the fucking streets. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Like I don't think a lot of people have really taken a look at the civilian casualties and who the civilian casualties are made up of. It's a lot of children, dude. And it's fucking horrible. And so when we think about it from Hamas' perspective, it's, okay, we'll release these prisoners from these other countries. We'll release some of your prisoners. But I think on the world stage, their biggest poker chip are those American hostages. Right. So, so for example, what they're probably thinking is, if we give them everybody, bro, they're just going to kill the rest of us because the overwhelming amount of force that has been applied, which has been, you know, this is why we're seeing protests all over the world. This is why we're even seeing orthodox Jewish people protest in favor of Hamas. Okay. Like, there isn't total unity amongst the Israel citizenship regarding the actions of Israel. And people don't understand that. So if you're Hamas, you kind of think of it like this. Okay. We give them this, we give them that. And we keep these guys because if we keep these guys, because like, think about it, it's still leverage. If they, the way that Israel has behaved, I think most people can agree that it's been extremely fucking brutal. Okay. We can argue all day about justification and all that. And everybody has their own opinions about that. But the reality is, is that that's the precedent that's been set. Okay. So if that's the presence that's been set and you're the team that's been getting their asses beat, why would you give them everybody? And then they, like, here's what my fear would be if I was them, they're going to give us back our Palestinian, still in citizens. We're going to give them the Americans and the other citizens. And then they're just going to continue to kill all of us because now they know that the hostages aren't in danger. Okay. So that's, I assume that's probably what's going on here. And I also probably bet that there's a two stage or three stage plan here to try and de-escalate the situation, right? Because it's like, it's like, dude, like, it's like whenever you get in a fight with somebody who's stronger than you and you happen to fucking get them on the ground and you're like, bro, are you cool? Are we done? Are we cool? Are we done? Yeah. Right? You happen to get them and then you let them all the fucker up and you beat the shit out of you. And that's that's kind of what we're dealing with here in my opinion, though. And that's come from the the assertiveness and the aggression, the retaliation from Israel on on to Palestine, a mass, okay? But all in all, dude, I mean, real talk. It's fucking super tragic that so many children have been killed. And, you know, for the lives of what, how many hasty is total? 240. Okay. So there's been why estimate? How many casualties sent like over 10,000 thousand? Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's just a fucking terrible situation, dude. And I hope that they find a way to de-escalate it. But the reality is is I don't see that happening. I think, I think what we're more likely to see is Israel do exactly what the fuck they've been doing. And the minute those hostages are fucking out and they're safe, they go back to bombing it. And I think that triggers a, could potentially trigger a massive worldwide effort against Israel because of the brutality. Yeah. And, um, you know, this is what I've been saying for, for, you know, since it started, is that we have a problem here because there's 14 million people that are considered Jewish, 16 million people worldwide, right? So there's three billion Muslims that are up in arms. And this is, they're having riots and protests in every country. I mean, those numbers aren't good. And if those people decided that they wanted to like remove Israel from the fucking planet, they easily could. It could happen easily. And, um, that's where we get in a situation where as Americans, you know, we get drug into a situation that honestly, like, do we even know that we could win? You know what I mean? So there's a lot going on there, but I don't see it as Biden being seenile as much as I'd love to. I see it as there's probably a multi stage agreement that's happening here, um, to try and deescalate, but I don't think the deescalation will happen. I think, I think because of the nature of 2024 and what's going to happen, they're going to try to create as much disruption as possible for the elections. And as I've been saying for, I don't know, the last three and a half years, I believe they're going to try to play another pandemic play and award at the same time to completely fucking shut down the possibility of Donald Trump coming back into power because if Donald Trump comes back into power, the globalist situation falls apart immediately. So and all of these people are globalists. So there's a lot to look at here, but that's that's my take on it. Yeah. No, that's a great take, man. Other thing I tried to pull up before is I could not confirm it, but I saw something that, you know, the newly elected president of Argentina, um, melee, he just pulled them out of the World Bank, the central banking system. Yeah. Well, that means that they're going to assassinate him. He that means he goes. Yeah. So if you any any leader that's ever tried to pull off the Federal Reserve since the beginning of time has ended up being killed. All right. So and that goes for Hitler, it goes for Qaddafi, it goes for Saddam Hussein, it goes for John F Kennedy. Okay. And we go down the list of any leader that's ever tried to pull off the World of Shit, the Federal or the Federal Reserve Bank system. Yeah. They've all been killed somewhere or another. So, you know, I mean, I hope he can do it. No, I'd be yeah, be great. I mean, do the economy shit right now because of it. Yeah. But I mean, I also feel like this guy is I don't I'm not sold on this guy yet. You know, we talked about him the other day and I was kind of like, you know, I don't know. I love I love I love I love his presentation. You know, I'm saying, but you know, we're going to have to see what he does because there's a lot of affiliations that don't make sense for what he's saying. Right. Yeah. So yeah, a lot of yeah, I don't know. Well, guys, that's uh, let's get into our headlines. Remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to anyfacela.com. You can find them there. If you're watching in on the two, check down in the description below. You can find them there as well. So with that being said, head on number one headline number one reads, Dublin mass stabbing children among the injured. Um, now this is a tough one. So five people were injured in central Dublin, Ireland on Thursday. Two of them seriously injured in a mass stabbing described by police as a quote serious public order incident. A man was arrested after multiple stabbing attacks on Parnell Street, Dublin on Thursday. Among the five people injured are three young children and one of those children and an adult woman are said to be in serious condition. The Irish independent described a quote scene of terror as pedestrians fled on foot from the attack and reports of the male suspect arrested in relation to the incident has also been injured. A witness cited by the papers that the stabbing took place near a school and that quote, the kids were out walking. All of a sudden, one of them fell to the ground and another fell to the ground and another falls on the ground. Then this guy started running past. Passer-buyers helped wrestle the suspected knifeman to the ground and jumped on them. Others have intervened to prevent the suspect being attacked. It was said, uh, Griff reports the Irish justice minister said police are following a definite line of inquiry and are not seeking any other individuals over the attacks. He added quote, my thoughts now are with the innocent children and the woman who have been attacked their families and those who are caring for them at this time. So you have the stabbing take place? Well, I'm kind of confused. So it's saying there were some passer-buyers that had intervened to prevent from the suspect being attacked, like as retaliation. I guess. Yeah. What the fuck? Kill that motherfucker on the spot, dude. On the spot. We need on the spot justice because these people have to learn that when you do shit like this, it's immediate. It's an immediate fucking strong hand. Agreed, man. So you have this attack that happened Thursday and then directly following that, um, Dublin erupts in protest. Um, 34 people arrested in Ireland riots after a child established a doubling on around 500 people rioted in doubling after the knife attack. Police in Ireland arrested 34 people in relation to riots that swept through Dublin on Thursday when cars and a bus were burned following a stabbing earlier in the day. Around 500 people wreaked havoc on the streets with about a dozen stores looted while rocks and bottles were thrown at a crowd control officers equipped with helmets and shields. The violence began after rumors circulated that a foreign national was responsible for stabbing outside of school on Thursday afternoon. The suspect who was understood to be a valgerian descent is a naturalized Irish citizen. Um, attacked three children with a knife outside an elementary school in the city center just after 130 pm. Um, there's a quick video of some of the, uh, it's like those, uh, those mostly peeps peaceful riots we had here in 2020. No difference. Yeah. Except these ones are far right. Oh, it's funny to say that, Andy. This is exactly what they're calling them. Oh, yeah. Far right protesters burned in the loot and I'm always two steps ahead. I'm afraid you always on it, man. Where's violence in decades? Yeah. Far right. Right wing protesters angered. So wait, hold on. Yeah. So, so people that are angered by a stabbing attack are now far right. Immediately. People who believe that a man as a man and a woman as a woman are far right. Far right. People who believe that criminals should be prosecuted for the laws that they break are far right. Far right. People who believe that elections shouldn't be stolen are far right. It's weird, huh? Yeah. It's interesting. Interesting. It's weird. It's weird how anything other than the thing. But thinking you, it's okay to cut kids' dicks off. That's normal. Yeah, that's normal. And if you, if you disagree with that, that's far right. Far right. You know, if you don't, if you don't be a nice little compliant NPC sheep, guess what you are? Far right. Okay. So eventually you have to get over that and say, well, fuck it. If that's what you think I am and just whatever the fuck it is, I am whatever you say. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. It wasn't the wild would that still get some. Yeah. It is. It's appropriate here too. I mean, yeah. So I mean, that's just there's a lot going on here, man. You know, and I think, you know, one could say, you know, I've been seeing a lot of people like, oh, they shouldn't have protested, right? But then you go back to like May of 2020 on their lines and, you know, on their timeline stuff is justified. Oh, yeah. Conversely, right? And it's just, it's just interesting. Now, you know, this migrant issue has been an issue. Hold on. That, that point alone, why do you think it is? Hold on. That's, why do you think it is that people are so comfortable saying one thing and then the other thing? Why do you think that is? Because I don't believe it. They don't believe any of it. And they're just doing and repeating and parroting what they're told. They're not thinking at all. Exactly. And they're, they're going on the internet for like shares, views, and coming up with a creative way to say whatever the thing is and get celebrated for it, right? So when you guys see these people who say one thing and then another thing, you have to understand there's a couple things at play here. One, they don't know what they're talking about. But two, a lot of these people are professional manipulators and they get their power from pressing their viewpoint onto you because it's the powerful narrative, right? If, if the powerful narrative that was backed by, if they understood that the far right was actually the more powerful side, which it is, if they understood that, they be on Twitter saying that's shit. Right. You know what I'm saying? It was about. Yeah. These people have, they don't operate with logic. They don't think like you and me. These are what's called NPCs. They are non playable characters. These are people like when you play grand theft auto, when you were younger, if you still play, they're the people walking up and down the street, bro. They have no idea they're even can't talk to them. Yes. That's most of your family. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? It is what it is. Yeah, man. But I mean, there's a bunch going on here with this with the situation. You know, and then this is not, you know, I will first first time having a problem with this. You know, this headline reads, use of Polonny Jeld for life, for murder of Aiden Mothat and Michael Snee and Sligo. He was arrested after going on a LGBT rage of killing, killed a couple of gay guys within a four day killing spring use of Polonny. It's, it looks Irish. Sounds Irish, too. Sounds right. Yeah. You know, or this person, Ashling Murphy, man sentenced to life for Irish teachers murder. Yosef Puska, who's 33, killed a 23 year old teacher stabbed in the neck 11 times. You know, he's not Irish. Not from Ireland. And then you see things like this that come up, you know, interesting. Muhammad was the most popular boy's name in Irish city in 2022. Muhammad's not Irish. It's not Irish. Sure. It's fucking, you know, and so it's like, you know, it's, it's interesting. There's a lot of stuff going on. But here's the thing that, that I'm seeing is that the people of Ireland, they're done with it. They're done with it. We'll see. Have this video here. We'll see if they're done. I don't know if you saw this video here. I got it, got it clip for you. This is the fellow that was walking around Doubler for the last eight months, calling people fire Roy and racist from the artist. Times is, hey, look at them all. Look at them all. Fire Roy. Look at them. Look at them. There he is. Everybody remember him from a few months ago, calling people fire Roy and racist. Yeah, he's going to Roy. Where are you going to read the Times tomorrow? Clay, if I help, was it? Was it a Clay, if I help? Fucking God, if you look at all of them, look at them. All of them. Fucking, doing for a good star. He died. They've laid a portal back on the artist's people. Look, look at this cop showing from there. Very immediate. Look at them with handy. He's not listening to me. We're not going to be intimidated anymore. All of you. Yeah. Yeah. Coming down on his push boy, he just got the star. You know what he's going to say about the artist's people now. He's fire Roy. Are you racist? Are you racist? Are you racist? Are you? Yeah, you are laughing at the eight months ago when you are telling you this is going to happen. All is all is fucking hacks. Yeah, come on. Look at them. Look on your boy. On your fucking boy. Come on. Do you want to show me the video? Yeah. On your boy. On your boy. Can I even listen to you? My other Scotia. You're on your fucking now. Yeah. He's under scene. We all seen it. Come on. On your boy. On your fucking boy. Yeah. Hack. Hack. That was polite. Yeah. It was very polite. And then you know, in response to that actual video, Conor McGregor is now jumping in on the conversation. He tweeted this out. All right. Shall I read it in this? I love the Irish accent. Isn't that something? No, that's how it is. I don't know. No, but he tweeted this out. Quote, isn't that something? The absolute picture of weak and feeble. The most divisive of all is the weak man. One of the most horrific crimes this nation ever seen has occurred. We do not care anymore. What you said cases got to shit, man. What the fuck? He's he types an Irish fuck. He fucking tight tight types of Irish. Bro, okay, fucking. We do not care anymore. What you said cases have got to say and they wore you are nothing. We are not backing down. We are only warming up. There will be no backing down until real changes implemented for the safety of our nation. We are not losing any more of our women and children to sick and twisted people who should not even be in Ireland in the first place. Call it what you want. We do not care. May God help us all Ireland for victory. Anyway, we got on this. I think he's right. I think it's time to stand up. I think it's time to say, hey, these people don't belong in our country. I think that goes for here. It goes for there. And it goes for all of Europe and everywhere else that has had these people forced into their countries with no approval from the citizenship who have come in and taken their resources and committed violent crimes. By the way, who advocates for these people to come into these countries politically? Generally. Oh, it's everybody but the far right, which is a very small percentage, the far left, right? Because there's only two far left and far right. So it's the leftist who advocate for this. And did you notice who this guy fucking killed? Oh, he went on a gay killing spree. Now, why if you were a leftist and LGBTQ was a priority for you? Okay. And this is something that you claim to care for. And by the way, if you are LGBTQ and you're advocating for migration, why would you might advocate for people who traditionally fucking hate you, who are going to cause you harm? Okay. Like this, this reality, it's because these people are NPCs. They do not know what they are doing. Okay. And we, the, the intelligent members of society, whether we think more right or more center or even Democrat type thinking, the intelligent people of society, when we point this out, we are called names. We are called racist. We were called big it. We were called, you know, all of these things. And the reality is, is that's how they've gotten their way. They've gotten their way because people have been afraid to speak up because they feel like being labeled those things is not okay. You have to understand those labels do not mean anything anymore. They do not mean anything. Let them call you whatever they want. The reality is, is if we don't stand up and I'm talking about the citizens of Ireland, the citizens of France, the citizens of Italy, the citizens of Germany, there will be no more Germany, Italy, France, Ireland, England, the United States, the way that we know it. Every, and this is reality, every culture is being intentionally intertwined with these migrants for the purpose of removing the national identity of that culture. This is part of the destabilization process, which is comes after the demoralization process. All right. So what they're trying to do is for the next, in a hundred years, they don't want any white Irish people. They don't want any Germans. They don't want any Italians. They don't want any French. They want a single race of mixed race of the mix between Caucasian and Middle Eastern and Black to become this like, oh, one identity. Yeah, to become this same race of humanity. And on the, on the, on the surface, that sounds okay. You're like, okay, well, that's cool. We're all the same. What difference does it make? I agree. But what that also means is there is no Irish culture. There is no French culture. There is no Italian culture. There is no American culture. And what they're doing is they're trying, just like I tell you, every single fucking show, politics is downstream of culture. So where are they attacking? They're attacking culture because they know if they can make everybody the same race and everybody the same culture that a world government makes perfect sense. Okay. And this is, this is fact. This is what they're doing. And anyone who's pointed this out for the last 15 years has been called a bigot or racist is not racist to want Ireland to be made up of Irish people who have lived there for 5,000 fucking years. That's not racist. Okay. This is called the way it is. When you go to France, that should be for French people. When you go to Italy, that should be for Italians. When you go to Germany, don't you want to see Germans? Like, this is the reality that people do not understand. And they're afraid to talk about it because they're afraid to be called names. But this is happening here in America too. And people will say, well, America's a melting pot. It is. But the might these people that are invading our country, they're not a black Americans. They're not Latino Americans. They're not white Americans. They are people who believe different things that we all believe. And what I believe they're going to try to do in the near future. And I think this clip will age very well as they are going to try and create a big divisive divide between the migrant culture and the American culture. And they're going to try to get all the blacks and all the Latino Americans in with the migrants saying people of color. They're going to try to make this a white supremacy issue. Yes. When it's not, it's a fucking American issue versus people who are not Americans. And that's what we're dealing with. And if you do not see that, you're either not intelligent enough to understand what's going on. Are you having been paying attention? Or you're an NPC? Because that is exactly what's happening. This is what's happening. And by the way, if you go read anything that these people write about in the global economic form and what they believe they will flat out tell you to your face is what they're doing. And people are afraid to stand up to it because they're afraid to be called racist or afraid to be called like bad names. Bro, the biggest thing that America has to understand right now is that Americans, whether they be black, white, Latino or anything else, Native American, we are on the same team. Okay. And when these people stir up the shit and they try to put everybody else on the migrant side, we have to remember what the people of Chicago are dealing with right now. The black communities of Chicago, they understand this. They understand those are not Americans. And we cannot buy into over the next 12 months or the next however many years this might end up being the idea that this is some sort of identity, politic issue. This is not that. This is Americans versus non-Americans. This is Irish versus not Irish. This is fucking French versus non-French people. And this is that Europe is years ahead of us. So what's happening in Europe will begin to happen here. And here's the reality and people hate this, but it's the truth. We're going to have to run a massive deportation operation in real life that involves checkpoints and involves like real shit for a little bit of time to get all these people out of here. Okay. These people have to go. They cannot stay here. I'm not talking about our Mexican friends who come across and come here for the better way of life. I'm talking about the fucking criminals that are being flown into South America and Central America and told to walk into America while all these other countries empty all their fucking prisons. And we have to take them and our dollar when we've got fucking tens of thousands of homeless veterans. And fucking 27,000 murders in the inner cities happening already or 100,000 fentanyl overdose. Like we have our own problems, dude. These people cannot be here. And the reality is is like we're going to have to do something very drastic to remove them. And it's going to be uncomfortable. It's going to be hard to watch because the media is going to show all the little kids crying and all this shit and people are going to have, you know, they're there. They're simply right. It's going to be hard, dude. It's going to be fucking hard. And it's not racist. No. No. I'll tell you if it was. You guys jumping on this conversation. Tell us what you guys think about this. This is a real issue. How has Shaq Hacks? Let us know what you guys think. So that big set. Now let's keep this cruise moving. Got cruise comments. Let's check this one out. So this one's coming from Stig. Mr. One. He says, uh, when are y'all restocking more bison real American freedom wear? I was legit working late that night. And by the time I got online and making my order, everything sold out. And he got anything for him. Well, we got to watch that day in the life that's coming up this Wednesday at 8 p.m. Central. But that's not the big announcement that I'm talking about just so we know. But that will that update will be in there. Okay. All right. Well, there you go. Stigs. Yep. Just wait on it. Appreciate you, bro. There was there was over 10 pissed off. There was over 10,000 people in checkout when we sold out. Yeah. So like it was there's a big demand. Yeah, for sure. So we didn't anticipate that level of demand. We knew people were going to want it. We didn't know that many people were going to want it. So uh, I'm sure a lot of people were buying multiples. Yeah. I'm saying. Yeah. Well, it's it was awesome. Yeah. And it's really cool seeing everybody wear it and then tag us in it. Yeah. No, it's fucking great. It's fucking great. Well, yeah. So still it's coming. Yeah. Just wait on it. Yeah. All right. Yeah. We appreciate you guys. I mean, I think you guys would be a real ass fans as always. Remember, we don't miss information. That was another firewall. Yep. That's right. I think you say it better, though. What is it? We don't miss information. Yeah. We don't miss information. So if you don't want to miss information, listen to the show. Yeah. See what I did there. I'm about. Yeah. Yeah. That's really great. I think you guys just get back to it. We got a headline number two. Lohan DeDomas action. Did that comment say I can't wait for Andy's 10-hour history lessons so we can explain where all the corruption was dead from? Oh, man. Well, I could do it about an hour if we really wanted to. Wait, where is it at? You scroll past it. It was up there on the beginning screen. It's all good. 10-hour history lesson, huh? Well, it only takes about an hour. Just people don't like the truth. Oh, it's the first one. Who else is excited for the idea of a 10-hour history lesson from Andy about today's corruption and where it stems from? Well, apparently a lot of people are actually. Yeah. Well, it's not that hard to figure out. You just got to pay attention. And if you've been paying attention for the last three years, I've said it about a 4,000 fucking times, but y'all just don't pick it up. My goal here is not to give you a fish. It's to teach you to fish. That well, we can't win without people who can critically think and look into things. That would be able to do that. The reason that we're losing right now is because even you guys depend on what you hear from the internet, including for me, as your only source of fucking information. And that's why we're here. And that goes for even you guys that only listen to what I say and don't go look into it. You should go look into everything I fucking say. That's why we give you guys articles. That's right. Go look at it. Yeah. Absolutely, man. It's important. It's important. We have to learn to critically think for a better America future. Absolutely, man. Well guys, keep this cruise moving. We got headline number two. Can we get a little endodomous? Well, it's pretty much every day now. Yeah, I know. Right. We want to take a guess. You mentioned it. Let's see if you pandemic. Oh, man. I know. I'm good. Okay. All right. Well, behind door number two, Chinese hospitals overwhelmed with sick children after surge. Are you guys? Yeah. It's a prize. You're going to stop doubting me. Surprise. Motherfucker. That's right. Yeah. All right. Continue. This is great. Yeah. Hospitals overwhelmed with sick children after surge and respiratory illness. Now, these are a few MSN articles for you guys just to see how it's being played out. So these are article reads hospitals in northern China appear to be, quote, overwhelmed with sick children as the country grapples with a surge in respiratory illness and clusters of pneumonia, prompting the World Health Organization to ask Beijing for more data. At the Beijing Children's Hospital in the capital, long lines of people were waiting to register during a visit by NBC News on Thursday. Waiting rooms were crowded with parents and children. Some of them on IV drips in a review of China's data, the World Health Organization said that the increase in cases came earlier in the season, quote, but not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions is similarly experienced in other countries. According to the who Chinese health authorities did not detect new or unusual pathogens and the rise in respiratory illnesses has not resulted in patient loads that exceed hospital capacities. So you got the who in there, okay. But it's okay, guys, because guess what mainstream media, they have all your answers, right? Could China's child pneumonia outbreak spread? We have everything you need to know on it. Now, how would you have everything that you need to know on it? Something is just now getting going. I think that's a very, you know, well, how have I been talking about this for a year and a half, two years about this actually being a pandemic for children. I mean, there's only probably 30 fucking 50 clips of me saying this exact thing. Oh, Andy, no, bro, listen, AP fact check that. There was a fictional virus that would create it for training exercise, not for another pin. Okay. So the AP is credible. Yeah, it was just for, yeah. So, you know, like that training event, they call catastrophic contagion where they had that thing called serious, right? That, you know, the exercise simulated a series of World Health Organization emergency health advisory board meetings addressing a fictional pandemic that was set in the near future that disproportionately affecting children and young people. Yeah, that one. Yeah, the one that actually said there was be 20 million plus child deaths. Who said this? Who said that they were going to run a pandemic that affected children that then was going to actually kill children so that they could blame all the people that they are saying caused all the problems last time. First, it was grandma killers. Yeah, that's not his kid killer. Yeah, but here's the problem. My opinion when I, and I've said this plenty of times in the show, in fact, we should probably go find a couple of the clips and throw them in here. So if you're on their team, you can't lose because if you lose, it's your life. And if we're trying to figure out a plan on how to not lose, here's how you do it. You get, you test everybody like we run like what they're doing right now, say, well, where are we at with people? Are they going to wear a mask again? Are they going to line up and get this vaccine again? What are they going to do? How scared are they still? All right, then we take the temperature. That's what I believe this is. Then we release something that actually kills people. Now they ran one called sears. And in the sears pandemic, 20 billion kids die. All right. Now if you were trying to control the population and you were talking about this in public, like Bill Gates does, do you think that it would advance your agenda if 20 billion kids died, a whole generation of kids in certain places? Would that advance it? It sure would. Now, what do we do with the people who are calling bullshit? Well, we can make them the enemy because if we release this thing and these people are saying, hey, resist, do not comply, then it's their fault that the kids die. Then they criminalize those people, removing from society. They put them in camps or they execute them. And then they run the world because there is no resistance anymore. That's what I see their plan to be. If it actually kills children, their plan might work. Yeah. And that's the fucking danger. Like I think these people would kill 20 million children to keep from what will happen to them. If they if they remain if they lose power from happening. Yeah. I mean, does anybody think that? I mean, I think that I think they're absolutely doing it. I mean, now, now, what would they, what would that do to the parents of the people who have been calling bullshit on the pandemic for 2020 and 2021, 2022? And who now saying, do not comply, do not let them do this again. What would that do to those people? What would create a situation where they were legitimately try to round those people up and fucking kill them and you would have public support because people's kids are dying. And these people wouldn't realize that these people killed their kids just to remove this, just to remove the only obstacle between them and total control, which is the people who are going to say no, and call for accountability. Yeah. 100% do now. I'll say that these real, these people, these people, the fucking same old villains, they should be rounded up and fucking dealt with now. Yeah. Before they can before they can't release the shit. You know what I'm saying? But I'll say this though, because I'll, you know, following this stuff for the last couple of years as we have, you know, it's important to understand where we are in this process. Right now what I believe that this is this specific story that's happened. I think this is their temperature check. Right. They're just, they're going to put it out there, see what the reactions are, is something, are they not worried about this? Because that's what, that, like it's typically a play for them. Right. They do a couple of small little like testers, right? Fear, you're going to decent temperature gauge on and see where, where everybody's at. You know, I mean, they try to use fear first, right? And here we are at the holiday times, you know, families are home. I mean, I don't know, man, people shouldn't resist to the first time because now it's going to get worse. And, you know, these people already made pregnant moms get the vaccine. They, they, they, bro, the death rate is higher than it's been, what 80 years we looked at, almost every country. Yeah. And almost every country except for the ones that the amount of child deaths are at a high. Okay. And it's because of these forced vaccinations by all accounts. I mean, that's, that's what most people are saying. And it seems to be accurate. I mean, I actually think there's a whole lot more death that's, that's happening that people just are not, they've kind of tuned out or they've kind of gotten used to it, you know. And, bro, I could see this in my own life. Like I've, I've known a number of young people who have died suddenly or died unexpectedly. And, and, and, you know, there's, I mean, dude, when we talk about this, we get tons and tons and tons of feedback from people who are like, there's no doubt this people are fucking dying. And they're not talking about it at all. And so like, what do you think these people are willing to do to go past that? Like in my opinion, how I see this is very simply, they need to maintain power. If you were guilty of the things that they are being accused of, that means the punishment would be a total life imprisonment or probably death. Okay. And so what are you willing to do to avoid death? Well, you're willing to do whatever you have to do. And these people are no different except they have all the money and all the power and all the control and on the media. And so we're in a situation where this is pretty dangerous because these people can manipulate the narrative quicker and harder and faster than than anybody else on the planet with total unity, which makes it appear credible. But people have gotten smart. People have learned that, you know, the CDC and the WHO and Fouchi and all these people, the media gates. People are not listening to these people anymore, right? So how do they get the power back? Well, they get the power back by creating a scenario where they can legitimately remove the people who are calling them on their bullshit from society, which what better way to do that than to start a pandemic that actually killed people at mass and then turn the people, the families of the people who were killed onto the people who have been saying, do not comply. Don't trust these assholes. Don't support them. Don't listen to them. Keep your business open. Stop doing this. So this to me is a strategy to remove the resistance globally from their ability to maintain control of what they're trying to do. And so that's my personal opinion. And you know, I've got a pretty good track record. So it's going to be a very difficult situation if this is true. If this is a real pandemic, now you could be right. You could, this could be practice. But if this is a real one and kids are going to die, this is going to present some very difficult times. You know what I mean? And I think it's important for everybody to recognize right now who the fuck's responsible for this shit. And the night that's the that's the thing that bothered me the most. They tell you yeah, they don't hide from it. They tell you exactly who's responsible. Yeah. We just don't listen. Yeah. We don't fucking listen. Well, they run this. They did their same shit with COVID. We're in the we're in the tabletop exercises months later. Boom. There it is. Yeah. They run this exercise in October 23 or October 23 of 2022. Yeah. And here we are. Right before election season. Right. Yeah. So perfect timing. Dude, listen man, it's this is a big problem. Like it's a big fucking problem. These people, if you guys would have spoke up and held these people accountable after what they did in 2020 instead of protecting them or pretending like they didn't know what they were doing. These motherfuckers knew exactly what they're doing. There is there is like thousands of hours of videotape of every single news outlet parroting the exact same phrases like the exact same phrases that they're supposed to say. This is a coordinated attack and it was global and it's headed by the people of the world economic forum. Those are the people in charge of this. They talk about it openly. They've written books about it. Clash Schwab at a motherfucking book called a genital 2030. The great reset COVID-19 like literally in 2020 as it started happening. Okay. Bill Gates and his organization ran a pandemic exercise in conjunction with the world economic forum in October of fucking 2019 and you all know what happened in 2020. You know that dude it's a sick part of the piss me off is like China. They're coming out saying that this hell on the Chinese blames weak immunity from coronavirus lockdowns for respiratory outbreak in children. I don't know. I mean, so you're telling me so the lockdowns were bad. We do admit that but we're going to lock them back down. Let's go back to it again. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Or isolation doesn't. You know, like I do. Do I remember with you remember that video that came out? Could we talk about it? Like, you know, when when there's stuff like this that actually helps your immune system by being around people and expose you need bacteria floor on your fucking body. Move around. That's how you do that. There was a there was only like, I don't know, thousands of doctors. There were some that were speaking up this and they all got fucking their medical licenses fucked with and labeled a quack and fired and removed from you know, never do. No, I'm never fucking doing it again. Never. And anybody else regardless of what they unleash, you cannot fucking bend the need of these people. It's not your people. The people who are saying stand up, speak up, call these people. I'll hold them accountable. We're not doing this. Do not comply. They are trying to protect you and you are not following their lead. And because you're not following their lead, these people are remaining in a position to continue to fucking do this to people. Yeah. I'm guys tell us what you guys think. Let us know down in the comment. Tash tag round two. Let us know. With that being said, let's get to our third and final headline headline number three. I like when I see the left eat their own. Yeah. Right. So that's what headline number three is about. headline number three reads mayor Adams response to sexual assault accusation after reported reveals suspicious detail about a accuser. He is he's going down there. I think they're done with him. That's what it's looking like. Okay. Well, that's what it's looking like. So so New York City mayor Eric Adams spoke to reporters and responded to allegations of sexual assault on Thursday. Adams was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 1993 in a bombshell legal filing. The accuser who was not identified by the messenger filed a summons Wednesday night under the adult survivors act the same law that allowed each gene carol to go after Trump 30 years later. The plaintiff accused Eric Adams of sexually assaulting her when they both worked for the city of New York. The messenger reported. Here's the video of this response. As I was stating, I want to respond to this lawsuit that was just brought to my attention. It absolutely did not happen. I don't call up a meeting dispersing and I will never haunt anyone in that magnitude. It did not happen. And you know, it's going to go its course. You know, I think it's process. But it did not happen. And that is not who I am. And that is not who I have ever been in my professional life. And you know, it's just something that never took never took place. Mr. Mayor, that's all we have. That's all we have. Thank you. Thank you. I'm not the same name. A person by the same name has filed quite a number of lawsuits and has even written a book that appears to be on sale on Amazon about how to file lawsuits and how to wear. Does that make you question the credibility separate from the fact that you're saying has never happened? Well, as you know, I've been in public life for almost 40 years. And people know my character. They see how I am, how I carry myself. And I could just radically state that one, this never took place. And I do not recall ever meeting the accuser. And it's just not who I am. And I would never do anything to harm someone. Now, I did not know in all seriousness though. This is not just this one before we can get into it. Yeah. Do you think he's what do you think he's lying about? What is he telling the truth about? I think he's I think he's telling the truth that see, I don't I don't know man. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think he knew her, but I don't think it happened. Yeah. I think yeah. That's how I felt. Because when he said I don't recall meeting them, if you didn't meet him, he said, I'm never fucking heard of this person. Right. Right. Okay. So he's trying to dance that line about does he know or does he not know? And in his head, he's thinking, do I have some sort of connection that can they can expose me on? Right. But I think I don't think he did what they're saying he did. Yeah. I don't see it very similar to I don't know another guy from New York. Yeah. I mean that guy that guy that guy was president. His name was Trump. Yeah. Rump. Rump was still skin. Big, rumpy Trump. Yeah. All right. Like this dude, this dude gets accused of shit every day. And you know what's interesting? It's interesting that Eric Adams has championing these things this whole life in here. There's a there's this word for this. I forgot what it's called. It's called like Marma. Rounds with Shorama. Shwarma. Karmah. Karmah. Karmah. Karmah. That's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. See, I think it might be something a little bit deeper than just playing Karmah too though, bro. Because you know, right before the sexual assault accusation that comes out, you got the FBI, they're they're searching this fundraiser campaign manager consultant. Who's even the most critical of last few few months? Yeah. I mean, and here's the thing. And then we've seen this happen in other places too, right? Like remember our friend Bob, Bob and then Dazs, he just got charged with with bribery for a foreign government, right? Do remember, remember our other buddy, Cuomo, he had sexual allegations. And what were they covering up with that one? They were trying to get him because of what happened with the pandemic response in the nursing home scandal, right? So what did what did Adams do that would make them put them off to the side? That is a great question, Andy. Yeah. And it's a very, very simple simple answer. He's been extremely extremely vocal and critical of Biden. And the migrant response and what's going on in New York. So is this a thing of like you're talking too much, you're getting too loud, we have to get this guy out. Yes. Undoubtedly. Yes. That's what's happening. Yeah. Do you guys ever wonder how they come up? Listen, this is how they get everybody out of the way that they don't want. They come up with some bullshit sex scandal from 30 fucking years ago, bro, and bring it to the forefront and make a big deal, discredit the person and make the person try to resign or embarrass and bear some of the point where they're not credible anymore, right? Because the accusation alone, dude, it should be a red flag to everybody. Yes, the accusation alone is damage. It will do the damage. It's neat whether it actually happened or not, the accusation alone creates so much damage. He's done. He's done. Well, that needs to change. Yeah. Not to fuck that culture. We need to change. We need to start realizing that when people get close to the truth, they get made to be the bad guy. Look what they did. Look, you can say whatever the fuck you want about Andrew Tate. All right. Look what they did to fucking Andrew Tate. Okay. Look what they've done to anybody who speaks up enough and stands up enough. Look what they're doing to Trump. Look what they're doing to any, this man does guy who's one of theirs. Okay. These people have weaponized this tactic. When I say these people, I mean Joe Biden and I mean the three-letter agencies and they are working together to create a scenario where they can fucking create anything and it doesn't even have to be true and it's always a sex scandal. It's always an abuse scandal. It's always a rape situation because that's the one that people will care the most about. Dude, or what is the other one that they always figure out? The people always end up being. What's that thing they end up being? A what a file? Head of file. Yeah. Right. And oh, they got pictures of child porn on their computer. Like I'm not standing up for any of those people, but you know, the CIA and the FBI and these people who are very powerful, they do have the ability to put those images on your computers. Like there's that, right? So like we have to start understanding that like when people start to stand up for the actual reality, like I don't like Eric Adams. This is not a defensive air guy. I'm not a fan of his. I don't like his politics. He's full of shit. He's fucking rude sometimes. You know what I'm saying? But like wrong is still wrong. Wrong is wrong. But I'll also say when people do the thing right, like earlier in the show when they said Biden's CNL said it's not Biden. This is now is really fuck here. Yeah. That's right. I'm going to call it how it is on both sides. And I don't like Eric Adams. He's not my cup of tea. But here's the reality. He understands that New York is being fucking destroyed. And he cares enough to at least speak out on something that's unpopular within his political affiliation. And this is how they get him. Yeah. This is this will happen to everybody, bro. At that. Dude, if we don't change the direction in 2024, politically, this will start happening to anybody who speaks out. They will figure out a way to fucking prosecute or destroy or ruin anybody that speaks out. And until culture changes, meaning we don't destroy people just because the media says this or these random accusations. And we start abiding by the assumption that they are innocent until proven guilty. Because very rarely do these people get found guilty. It's just the accusation piled on it. Maybe that and if that doesn't work, they'll do another one. And they'll make another one come out. And then they'll make another one come out. That's how they do this. And we've seen it over and over and over again. And when you say who's doing it, well, I don't know. You should probably look at who the people are. They're being criticized when these things happen. Yeah. Okay. Because it's always consistent. It's always constant. And you're correct. They are eating their own. Right. And so Eric Adams, I guarantee you he's sitting there right now and he's like holy fuck. I picked the wrong fucking team. Right. Because they'll kill him just as much as they kill the people they say, hey, like these people are fucking ruthless, bro. There's no loyalty amongst these people. And honestly, you know, like if I'm being honest, those people deserve this shit because they've done it to other people a thousand times because they're on the team. Right. Right. They know that it's cool. It's nice and easy and it's comfortable when you're on the team. Yes. Yeah. But see, you don't think Eric Adams knows that they've been doing this for the last 30 fucking years. That's what I'm saying. And then does didn't like he was he's not doing anything that any other mother fucker. No, doing it. And because they didn't stand up and speak the truth and say, this is wrong, this should not be happening. Now it's happening to them. So real talk like anytime accusations come between especially like sexual allegations or rape things, I don't fucking believe them anymore until they're proven because do we have such a change in culture with the me too, shit, where every fucking man was an abuser and every single and bro, all those same women are now complaining because no man will fucking date them. Well, no man will date you because men are afraid that if they even like talk to you a certain way, they're going to get fucking slapped with some sort of fucking allegations, bro. Like it's the truth. Bullshit, man. Yeah. Bullshit. So we need to get smarter as a culture. You know, something else. I think we need to change culturally, totally unrelated. Um, texting people on fucking Thanksgiving and Christmas. No, I gotta be real with this. This is this is fucking real. Yeah. Okay. It used to be that Thanksgiving and Christmas and certain holidays Easter, you know, these times were made for our families. They were made for us to have family time away from work. And now most people, they have a pretty high attachment to their cell phone in regards of maybe just in their social life, some people do it for their professional life too. And because technology has never been talked about in ethics of technology have never really been talked about, it seems to be appropriate for everybody to text or mass text and say happy Thanksgiving on fucking Thanksgiving when we're trying to fucking chill, bro. You know, I'm saying like you guys have to start realizing that this is rude behavior. It's rude. Okay. If it's your close family member, if it's your friend, maybe, but like just random people that you haven't talked to and fucking you only talk to them. If you go in your phone and every time you talk to someone is on a holiday or their birthday, stop fucking doing it. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like dude, for me, like listen, though, for me the last 10 years of my life because I've been on social media and I've had somewhat of a following every holiday and every birthday has been completely fucking wasted by people texting me. Do you think that I want to sit there on my fucking birthday and get 4,000 fucking text messages from random random people? Yeah. Like do you think I want 4,000 DMs from random people to say, have the bro, I don't want that. Nobody wants that. No. And like bro, this doesn't have to do, which is me. It has to do with anybody. It's culture. It's a cultural correction that we need in terms of what is deemed appropriate behavior. Technology has changed things. We don't have holidays anymore. We don't get breaks anymore. Like how many of you guys have worked on your cell phone or have massive time on your cell phone and like you just want to fucking chill on these days and you can't because you got every moron that you know texting your fucking Turkey emoji. You know what I'm saying? Like get the fuck out of here bro. It's true. It should be seen as rude to do that. Unless it's like you know like close friends like real close. Yeah. You know the truth of the matter is people don't do that for the other person. They do it for themselves because remember it's always like the same fucking 20 people that you know that do it. They're doing that so they can be seen as the person who's thoughtful or you know more caring or whatever bro you're not fooling anybody. Like every time someone who only texts me two three times a year on those days text me it just furthers my fucking my perspective that they're fucking dumbass right it makes you want to spend less time around them. It makes me value them less because I see how they actually are. You see what I'm saying? It's real shit dude. Everybody like that's the thing. Everybody's like that. What everybody I mean I would say most people get that. Get what I'm saying? Absolutely. I feel the same way. Like bro stop. Yeah. Start seeing it as rude. Don't do it. Like it's rude. It is. Like you wouldn't like you wouldn't go to someone's house on Thanksgiving and just stop on the fucking knock on the door unannounced and say. Happy day's giving. Happy day. All right I'm gone. And then the next guy shows up and then the next guy and it goes on for hundreds of people. Then you don't ever get to spend your day with your family your friends doing the things that you want to do. You're accommodating all these people who are being thoughtful. Well I'm going to be thoughtful too and I'm going to sick it the fuck out. Like bro I'm so over it dude. I'm going to get rid of technology eventually. Like the this is real shit. Presidents order. Listen. Life was better. There's a lot of good things that have happened with the internet. There's a lot of good things that have happened with social media but I am telling you as someone who grew up for 20 years 21 years before this shit really took over. I'm telling you if you understood how much life how much better life was without it you would give it away in a second. It's stolen so much from us and we've had it for so long now that people don't understand what it's even stolen. It steals everything. It steals our whole ability to live presently in reality all the time. Like it's completely different life. It's completely different and not for the better. Regardless of the economic success that I've had I've had my whole life for the most part that has been built through the internet. Okay I would give that all the way in one fucking second to not have it. That's how much better life was. I would give it away fucking a hundred times the zero over how much better it was without it. Like this is ruining our lives. It's ruining our relationships. It's ruining our ability. Our human experience. Yes, it's ruining it. Yeah. And we keep going more and more and more and more and more into it. It's fucked up dude. Yeah. So at least give us a couple days. You know like the holidays so we can like chill and like spend it with our families and fucking relax. Let me go argue with your eye or something. Yeah. It's oh well just don't answer your texts. Well it's kind of hard when it happens every fucking two minutes. You know like real talk like all you guys have my cell phone number I'm getting a new number. I'm not giving it to you. I'm not I'm not giving it to anybody. You guys in this room will have it. The people here. Key people will have it. My five closest friends will have it outside of here and that is it. Yeah. That is fucking it. So that's coming soon. I love it. Yeah you ain't getting it. I love it. So don't ask me the worst is is the people that fucking like you just meet and they'll look good. Get your number. Absolutely not. No. No fucking way. I don't know who the fuck you are. He's one of these people that fucking text every fucking 30 seconds. Yeah. Yeah. No. I'm not happy to. Yeah. But guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Hashtag time is up and let us know your thoughts. So what that being said man that was our third and final headline. Eric Adams looks a little shocked there. Don't he? Like he's a little taken back like No, he was just about to go off on a reporter. He should have. Yeah. He should have. But he couldn't remember he just from his observation. Yeah. He couldn't remember if he actually knew this person or not. That's why I was picking up. He couldn't remember. It's like, fuck do I know this person or not? He didn't want to say, I never fucking heard of this person. Right. Because he's that against you. Yeah. Right. Yeah. He was being careful with his words. Yeah. He's not sure. Yeah. So guys, let's get into our final segment of the show. We got thumbs up and I got a good one for you. This is a really good one. I like this one a lot. So this is guys for you guys that don't know or knew. Maybe this is your first episode. Thumbs up with dumbest fuck. This is what we bring a headline up. We talk about it. I don't get one of those two two options. So our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads teacher of the year creates mock vacation to Mexico for her students and even gets them to stand in line for their passport applications. Now this happened about a month ago, but there's a follow up here that I thought was pretty awesome. So a first grade teacher has gone above and beyond for her students by putting together an elaborate simulated trip to Mexico. And now viral footage on TikTok. Sonya White was seeing creating faux passport, boarding passes and an entire air travel simulation for her classroom to bring awareness of Hispanic heritage month and improve their money handling skills. Quote, come along with first grade to Mexico White said in the video, here we're taking passport pictures. I'm going to eliminate some boarding passes and I'm going to eliminate some some brairos and make them our placemats. So here cultural appropriation. That's what that is. Yeah, no doubt. Yeah, that. But let's watch, let's watch the video. We had it soon. We're going to the passport. We are headed to the passport office. Come along with first grade to Mexico. Here we're taking passport pictures. I'm going to eliminate some boarding passes and I'm going to eliminate our some brairos and make them our placemats. Are you excited? Where are we going today? Mexico. Did you bring your stuff? Oh, it's a nice song. Are you going to Mexico? Good morning. Good morning. Where are you going? Mexico. And now I turn into superwoman. I'm going to change my classroom into an airplane. I found a video on YouTube that they're going to watch to make us feel like we're in the air. They have passport. They have boarding passes and of course we are flying southwest airlines. I'm going to give each young adult their passport and their airline ticket because no mamis are allowed to go and I'm going to match their little passports up to their faces to make sure they are who they say they are. So now I'm a TSA agent. They are going to board the aircraft and get ready for takeoff. They can sit anywhere they like on my plane. They're never been in TSA agent. That nice. No, I'm a f**k now. Search that little muffle. It's cool, man. This is cool. This is f**king cool, right? So this is a little simulated. No, she's teaching them real skills. Real skills. I actually think this is amazing. They had to like you know they budgeted their money like it's f**king cool. I thought it was f**king awesome. So like I said this story is about a month old, right? There's been a new development. Yeah. Right. So I'm back. Huh? They fly back. No, man. So in her classroom she simulated that they were flying with Southwest, right? Well, Southwest reached out. The satellite reached Southwest helps teacher turn mock trip into reality after viral video. So after that video, but that first great teacher down in Texas, Southwest, they reached out to her. So the videos by now has gotten millions of views. And Southwest decided to plan a field trip for all the first grade students at the school. The students started their trip at the Southwest Dallas maintenance hanger for a behind the scenes tool of how real airplanes work. They then boarded a Southwest Boeing 737 Max 8, which for some was the first time they have even seen a real plane Southwest said. Just like with the mock set up in the class, the students interacted with flight attendants took their seats and they were served as special snack. They also got to do some fun activities like constructing a Southwest plane made of paper, an actual pilot hopped on the plane with the students to teach them more about aviation and told them inspiring messages like always follow your dreams and stay true to your heart. Afterwards, the students were able to see real planes taking off into the skies from Dallas, fourth, and a national Southwest said as a thank you to help you shape future leaders, the company gifted all the first grade teachers and the school principal with two round trip tickets to anywhere with that airline. Quote Southwest is honored to have the opportunity to create a unique aviation experience for the first grade students, just as Mrs. White did for her class. Who knows, maybe there's a future Southwest employee in this group of sweet kids company said. And here's a few pictures from that field trip. That's cool man. I just thought do that. That's super cool. That's cool. That's super cool. Like that's exact. I noticed the Southwest brought him the nice plane though. Look at those. Yeah, I say dude. There's somebody on Southwest. It's really good at PR. We're like, Hey, we'll get our nicest plane. We'll do this thing and we'll get massive press. Unfortunately, I believe that's what this is. This is a PR move, but it's a good one. It's a good one. And it's still cool for the kids. So everybody's winning. I don't have a problem with it. Yeah. Would have been cool if they would figure out a way to actually like take those kids somewhere in Mexico, like as a group for like a couple days. I don't know how you would do that. That's probably why they didn't do that. Yeah, logistical nightmare. But I think this is awesome. I mean, really like mass. Like we give the teachers a lot of heat in here, right? Like, yeah, we got to most of them are teachers. Okay, most of them are full of shit. Yeah. But reality is there are some really good teachers that really become responsible for any success or, you know, I don't know, winning, you know, good things in these kids' lives, you know, and this woman is clearly one of them. She's teaching them real skills. They're having fun. They're getting a good life experience. I mean, if all teachers like that, this whole country would look completely different. Yeah, no doubt, man. Yeah, no doubt at all. So that woman, that woman, there she's probably getting paid, you know, fucking what 60, 50, 60 grand maybe like that's this is why teachers, if we could correct the pay scale with teachers and stop spending our tax dollars on Ukraine and like all this useless woke shit and all this bullshit. And we actually increased teacher salary to a level where they could actually live a more comfortable existence. It would attract better quality teachers and get rid of all of these people who are just there to push their own agenda on children. So if I were president, that would happen immediately. Immediately. I would sign a fucking executive order to like increase basement when paid for teachers and any teachers that had any of these other flags besides the American flag will be fired immediately. Trump's talking about something like that. Yeah. He funding those schools, but we have to we have to reward and make the career positions that are most important to the future of this country. The more lucrative. Yeah, the make a break for compositions, because this wouldn't take people who would otherwise go be something that earn more money. They would maybe have interest and say, you know what? I'm going to go do this instead. I'm going to pour into these kids. I'm going to teach these kids real skills. And dude, we have to have that. It's a must have. So I got an interesting idea. I had this idea pop up. I feel like there needs to be some type of program incentive. Right. You talk about giving back to your community. Right. So like let's say you were like, you know, a high level artist, right? And you retire from being an art and want to like in order to like the part of your fucking community payback is you have to go teach for two years. If you're a fucking entrepreneur in business and you kill to have a successful time, once you retire or get done, you go teach. You know what I'm saying? Have there be something? You could do that. Yeah, you could do that by simply giving tax advantages to those people. So those, yeah, I think that would be those individual people. Like if you said to those people, okay, like go build your companies. Yeah, let's just say this. Okay. Let's say you built a company and you retire because you sold it. And they said, okay, you're going to be taxed at 15% capital gains on your business sale or you're going to be taxed at 8% if you agree to go teach for four years, four years, exactly. At, you know, this salary, we're going to pay you. But if you agree to go, dude, we have a totally different country. Bro, yeah, that's not going to be some powerful. And you're actually being taught by people who, yeah, I don't know if that's the exact way. Some, some, I'm sure some farmer that they'll probably could fuck you. Right. Right. I mean, we're just kind of thinking it up right now. But the reality is if we don't incentivize high skilled people to go do these jobs, high care people to go do these jobs, because it's not just about the caring. It's also about the skills for sure. This woman cares and has skills. See, she, she cares to put on this effort for these kids, but she also has the skill set to understand that those kids are going to learn in a fun environment, not a lecture environment. Sure. And so those are the kind of people we must have teaching our kids. We must have people that are high care and high skill. And right now, I think we have a lack of both. I think we have a culture where a lot of teachers are there because they get three or four months off a year and they could do whatever they want. And while they're there, they don't care about the kids. They care about pushing their own personal agenda or whatever their political lane happens to be onto these kids. And we're seeing more and more and more of that. But I also think on the flip side of that, we have to remember that that's not all teachers. And that's probably not the majority of teachers. But those teachers that do those things should not be teachers. I agree. And those teachers who do things like this woman, you guys should be the ones that were standing up saying, we can't have this. We got to do this. Right? Yeah. A massive. But they're afraid of the own teachers union. They're afraid to speak up. They're afraid that they speak up. They'll get black ball out of their own job. That this is what we're dealing with. We're dealing with oppression and tyranny on multiple different levels and intimidation tactics. No different than Eric Adams being accused of this thing is our teachers afraid to speak up because they're afraid they'll be punished by a teacher's union. That's wrong. It's fucked up. The teachers union should be abolished. I think all unions. Well, that's a discussion for another day. But I mean, unions serve a particular point up until the point of when they become more worried about the union's strategic partnerships and less about the actual union members who are supposed to work. Exactly. Okay. And we have that situation going on across all the unions in this country where a lot of the unions are partnered up with these big funds and these big political initiatives. And they tell their members to vote a certain way or do a certain thing. But the reality is is the interest that that union is advocating for do not represent the interest of the earn of the worker. They represent the interest of the bosses who are getting a cut of whatever corrupt deals being made. Absolutely, bro. So like we have to be honest. It's not like it's not like unions are a terrible thing if they were actually operated appropriately. But they've become so corrupt over the course of history that now we have a situation where even the union in a lot of cases doesn't serve the workers. It's a bad thing. No, that's real man. So thumbs up on the story. Obviously, great job. And this is white. And with that being said, man, any guys, that's all I have. Yep. Don't forget next Wednesday, 8 p.m. Central, day in the life episode two. And don't be a hoe. Show the show.
