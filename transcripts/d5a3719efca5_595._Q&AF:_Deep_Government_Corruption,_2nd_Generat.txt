What is up guys it's Andy for Sella and this is the show for the real estate about the lies, the fitness and delusions of my society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today. We have Q and A F that's where you submit the questions and we give you the answers. You can submit your questions a couple different ways. The first way is guys email those questions in to ask Andy at Andy for Sella dot com or you can go on YouTube on this very episode the Q and A F episodes which drop every single Monday and ask your question in the comments there. Don't forget to click subscribe. Now your questions they can be about anything they can be about what's going on in the world but on this particular show we like to keep it more so how the fuck we can make you better okay. Personal development business entrepreneurship how to improve your life. All right this show if you weren't aware used to be called the MFCO project and the MFCO project was the number one entrepreneurial podcast of all time hosted by yours truly and the reason people listen is because I'm one of the few people out here who doesn't speculate on the things that they teach but actually has a stack of proof to show you what I've actually built. So what we like to do on this shows help you win. So if you have questions about business personal development how to get better how to build things this would be the place to ask those shows okay. Entrepreneurship success personal development is the backbone of the content that we provide here even with the popularity of CTI and by the way if you don't know what CTI is that stands for cruise the internet that's what we do every Tuesday and Friday that's where we put up topics on the screen we talk about and speculate what we think is true what we think is bullshit and then we talk about how we the people are responsible for fixing these problems in society and you might be asking why do we have CTI and Q and A of slash entrepreneur content why do we do that well because it's very simple without freedom we can't win without freedom we can't build businesses without freedom we can't build success without freedom we can't be entrepreneurs so we have to pay attention to the soil which is the freedom and also what we plan in the soil which are our lives all right so that's how these things go together it's kind of like peanut butter and jelly so those are two main shows that we do and then we have these other shows that we do as well one of them is called real talk real talk is just five to twenty minutes and me giving you some real talk then we have full length which is very similar to what you see on every other podcast on the internet where we bring in someone who's got something to offer and we have a conversation with them kind of like what we did with Curtis Bowers which we talked about communism in the United States he's dedicated his life to it and we just have a conversation if you have an elicit that episode I think it's one of the best we've ever done by the way and then we do this thing called 75 hard versus 75 hard versus is where we bring people who have completed the 75 hard program who have transformed their lives with the 75 hard program we bring them here live in studio we talk about how they were before we talk about how they are now and then we talk about how you as well can change your life with the 75 hard program which you can get for free okay it's the world's most popular biggest whatever you want to say mental toughness transformation program okay it's mega viral and the reason that you've probably heard about it is because it actually works and it's also free so if you want that program you go to episode 208 you can listen to it there's also a book on my website which is unnecessary because I give you the whole program an episode 208 which is on the audio feeds only but if you like the book if you like to know the ins and outs and wise like I do for me I can't get into something unless I understand it completely I did write a book the book is available on my website and you for sale.com totally unnecessary you still get the program for free so that's the rundown of the show now special thing that we have here on the show is we tell you to pay a fee the fee isn't then mo it's not subscribed to my shit it's very simple share the show share the show all right if you give value from the show share the show that's what we call pay the fee so make sure think make sure laugh it gives you some information if you learn some things which you're going to all we ask is that you don't be a hell and you actually go share the show all right so what's up man hey how's it going good yeah yeah what's up with you oh you know just thinking about that peanut butter jelly you you're alluded to peanut butter

all right good let's let's get into this Andy guys question number one Andy hey Andy I'm a fairly new listener uh your show was recommended to me by a friend of mine I would love to get your take on something that I've been wondering about for a while we talk about this obvious corruption in our government and it's becoming clearer who the head of the snake is my question is how deep does it actually go I do believe our government has bloated to no end but how deep down the chain do you think it goes is it just a bunch of mindless NPCs working facts machines in these government organizations or are they indirectly or directly involved and culpable as well I would love to hear your thoughts and input on this oh dude I think most government employees have no idea what's actually going on I think I think most of the police don't know I think most of the military is unaware I think most of the three letter agencies are unaware I think I think they're all just doing a job and that's why I would agree with that yeah I don't I don't feel like your average you know ATF agent or your average FBI person is like there being like yeah I'm gonna fuck the American people like they're middle-aged yeah or you know like I don't I think they get a bad rep because you know there's a there's a few ways that this needs to be talked about okay they get a bad rep because people understand that the police and the military and these agencies have taken an oath to protect the people and when they don't see the those people protecting the people such as when they arrest people on a beach when they're alone and during COVID right and cops were arresting business owners for trying to keep their business open which way they were fully within their rights to do and you know zooming back now that's all been proven correct right when they see these agencies do these things they start to believe that the average officer or the average member of the military the average three letter person is part of the quote unquote you know corruption which I don't see it that way at all I actually think most of those people are just people who have a job who probably are in debt who probably are leveraged just like you guys are leveraged who have bills to pay who are afraid to stand up because they're afraid that it's gonna cost them their own ability to do their thing you know pay their bills take care of their family but the problem with that is is that when these people just go along and they say well this is my job that's how the most incredibly horrible horrific you know things in human history have happened you know people who were in a position to stand up and say this is not right refuse to do so because their own individual situation dependent on it and so that's what I see happening here and that's not excusing that behavior because I believe that even my personal opinion is and you guys could say whatever you want I know we have a lot of police and a lot of you guys listen to this show especially you know you guys are a sign a list in the show too right so yeah so like shout out to you guys you guys are being fucking cowards man and because you're being cowards people are starting to think you're evil and you guys have an obligation to stand up for the oath that you took you know for years and years and years and years and years and years for decades that oath didn't really mean anything because there was no there wasn't this kind of disruption happening in our society but now we're in a position where you know people are seeing the direction of the corruption and the evil that it can potentially lead to and is leading to and uh not enough of these people are speaking up and not enough of these people are making a stand and here's the thing if all the police and all the three-letter people just stood together and said no this is bullshit this shit would be over tomorrow this shit would be over tomorrow so as far as how deep it goes I don't believe those people are quote unquote in on it but a number of them are becoming complicit in it with their silence and their passivity and and their desire to protect their own lives and what you guys who are listening you know and you're listening right now and you're saying yeah we'll fuck you you know well bro I'm risking shit too we're all risking shit to talk about this okay and real talk every single one of you that I'm talking to I'm risking much more than you a much much much more all right so yeah it's hard and yeah it sucks and yeah it's scary but also at the end of our lives we're gonna have to come to a point where we have to analyze the actions that we took during our lives and for me being able to look myself in the mirror and say bro you did the right thing you did what you knew was right is the most important thing and uh you know I think that's where people got to get to but I do think that if we don't see some sort of awakening and whistle blowing at a mass scale amongst the people who we the people pay their salaries with our taxes to protect us we're gonna have big problems here in the country and um you know so how far does it go are they in on it no I don't think they're in on the planning of it but it's becoming up to a point where they're complicit in it because they're passive in the situation so who's behind it well those are the people we talk about on the show all the time these are these people who are you know mega mega mega mega mega the wealthiest people in the world who meet once a year in Davos and you know to to discuss the direction of the entire western world and uh that is you know the world economic forum um the build a bird group and these people who have been in power for generations uh on generations on generations um and they they make deals with each other and and it's them and us they are very clear on that that's why we're not invited to those parties that's why we're not invited to take place that's why when you try to go to Davos when the world economic forum unless you're part of their club you're not allowed in it so they understand very clearly that it's them and us but we don't understand that right and that's the biggest problem the biggest problem is is that we all have good hearts we have good intentions and we care about people they don't and there's not a single one of us listening here that would say hey let's start a group and let's meet once a year and then let's pull our resources and let's make all these rules to make life harder on the rest of the fucking world like we would never do that would would you do that would you would you would you guys do that I wouldn't do that either and I know none of you listening would we're all good people but there's people out here that do this this is why there's good and evil and I think the biggest problem that we have in this country is that we have we we have been so conditioned to be passive and give people the benefit of the doubt and to say you know well you know I'm sure it's a coincidence or I'm sure it's incompetence instead of looking at the reality of there's good and evil and these people doing this stuff to us are evil and they don't care about us and they're willing to sacrifice us they're willing to kill us they're willing to make our lives incredibly hard like when you guys think about what you learn in high school and you think about what what you learn now now look at what they're teaching today which is many times less valuable than what we even learn but even when when I was in high school and I went to at the time what what what was a very very very high ranked academic high school um they didn't teach me about you know debt they didn't teach me about how to balance finances they didn't teach me how to protect myself from you know all of these things that we deal with as a human being once we're kicked out into the real world like and that's because our debt is their asset and our struggle is their win and they want us to struggle and they want us to be indebted and they want us to struggle in a way where it's hard for us to get ahead because if we're in debt we're in debt to them that makes them rich and if we struggle to get ahead that means we're less powerful to provide any sort of resistance to anything that they do and so when we really like break this down you have to understand that our entire system is corrupted even down to the way that uh uh the things that they teach us at a basic level and so you know when you guys think about where's it start where's it in what it is it what who's doing it this and that it's not as simple as saying oh it's Joe Biden like bro this has been going on for a hundred years this is this is our systems this is our way our our like when you really like if you're you guys who are business owners out here like if you were an average person and you actually understood how small and medium-sized businesses get taxed and you actually understood how they tax you exactly the right way so that you can barely get ahead and then they have the biggest companies in the world pay zero tax and then these biggest companies in the world then put out propaganda to you to get you fired up saying tax the rich like that tax the rich messes that you see from a OC that comes from the richest people in the world and they want you to look at your neighbor or your local entrepreneur and burn their business down because they you know they're they're the rich to you right they know that you're not going to look at them and think they're the rich you're going to look at your neighbor driving a BMW and say fuck that guy and this is all psychological societal propaganda that we've been dealing with for a long time so like where who's in charge where's it go I mean dude that's a history lesson that would take me literally 10 fucking hours to unpack but at the end of the day the world economic forum is the centerpiece for it in my opinion along with all the governments that align with them along with you know really that's it all the governments that align with the world economic forum and the people of the world economic forum are causing 98% of the disruption in society and that's why when Trump was in office he went in there and fucking fuck with them and pulled out and you know we shouldn't be a part of that no no I just pulled up some of these federal tax rates on some of these companies man they're shit is sickening like there's companies that are operating on a negative tax rate mm-hmm I don't even know how the fuck that's possible yeah they're getting tax grants from our gu- so like this is what people don't understand when they say tax the rich they want you to yell at me mm-hmm okay while the biggest companies in the world get government funding for their projects you see what I'm saying no bro the people don't understand it they don't teach you they don't teach you the show game like like like you know like you walk down the street in New York and you see the dude with the three cups in the ball they're not gonna teach you the trick but I can promise you the trick is to keep you struggling to keep you unhealthy to keep you sick to keep you dependent to keep you confused so that they can maintain control and power and uh prestige over us and and and bro it's us versus them they understand that very clearly we don't understand that we're not smart enough to understand it they don't allow us to be smart enough to understand it like if you were operating from this place and you would you and now you're them mm-hmm now real talk now I know you're a good dude and you know like you wouldn't really do this yeah but let's say you're them okay and you have everything in the world the you've been brought up to believe the world is yours and that these people do not matter they these are no different than you or I would look at and and people get mad when I say this but this is true they don't have any more care for us then we would have care for a cockroach in a infestation in our garage okay so if you were them why would you teach us how to win why would you teach us how to be healthy why would you teach us how to make money why would you teach us how to become independent why would you teach us any of the things that are required to actually become better human beings there's no motivation there to do so no because all of those things threaten my position correct yeah so we have to understand the position to understand why things are the way they are and when we unload the educational system as a load of shit which we all know it is it makes sense as to why it's a load of shit right they want us to be incapable of any sort of resistance and at the same time they need us to produce their taxable income that they can then go spend and use and steal that's what the fuck it is and that's the system we live in and if we pay a 10% tax you know as a as like if this country was truly patriotic and truly cared about its people and truly stood for the things that they people say it stands for that we've been led to believe it stands for then we would tax the citizens the minimum amount it would need to make this country safe and and powerful enough to protect itself and then you know prominent in terms of financial success but that's not what happens okay because you could do that on a 10% tax rate all right if everybody paid 10% those those global corporations you're googling your neighbor the all the fucking people that don't pay any taxes if everybody paid 10% we'd have more than enough money to make this country exactly what it's supposed to be and enough left over to make it even better than that but but dude like you guys are not understanding like that 50 60 70% of tax you pay when you add up all the taxes you pay right not just income tax but you know sales tax your property tax all these things that you stack up you're paying plus 50% of that to the government and they're stealing that and that makes you a slave you're a slave you pay more tax to the government when you add it all up then you get to take home that means you exist to provide for them and that is the fucking dot the connecting of the dots that is not connecting for people people are not understanding it because they're constantly distracting us with propaganda saying tax the rich but they're really talking about the middle class business owner or the successful middle size business owner like me right and not the biggest companies in the world that are worth fucking a hundred billion 50 billion fucking dollars okay they let those guys off the hook why do they not attack those guys why do they not hold on why why do they not go after those guys why do they make it the mid-level guys because they need the societal disruption the class warfare to divide for their agenda and they don't want to piss off the people who actually fund their shit this is why you have such a big disparity amongst people who vote for the Democrats Democrats are only two kinds of people to vote what kind are they they're broke super broke super poor super destitute or they're super wealthy and don't have a care in the world and the super wealthy ones lie straight up to get the broke ones of O forum and then make laws to make those people suffer more and they profit off that suffering and that's that's what we're dealing with with the left the right ain't much better but they're not as bad as the left the right has its own problems their cowards okay they're not standing for what this country is supposed to be they're in on the take two in a certain ways but they're not in on the take like these guys on the progressive left are these people are straight up on ethical crooks so we could talk about this and talk about this and talk about this but at the end of the day we're peasants they're them they hate us and we have to learn that there are enemy and look if we're going to make any progress and we have to stop infighting we have to stop arguing with to stop you know picking each other apart and we have to start realizing that it's us versus them just like they understand that it's them versus us they very clearly understand that try to go to a build a bird party try to go to the fucking world economic forum try to go to one of these try to go talk to these people they don't police bro they don't give a fuck they'll spit in your fucking face bro you are a cockroach to them and until we start understanding this at scale nothing can ever change because the division the identity politics the arguments over abortion the arguments over race the arguments over class warfare the arguments over the black square the vaccine the mask you crane now the Middle East these are all surface level arguments that they perp that they prop up in society for people to fucking divide you divide over which allows them to maintain control so that we're getting hit from all these different places right we're getting hit from our education system we're getting hit from our financial structure we're getting hit from the media and the propaganda and because we're getting hit from all these places and we're always fucking being overwhelmed by this shit how do we ever sit down and have a conversation like hold bro whoa whoa these people are fucking us all that's what they're afraid of there are that's why they banned fucking bars during COVID bro because the seeds of revolution were sewn in taverns that's a that's a famous saying it's been around for 250 fucking years like restrict the ad bro everybody bonds over a beer it doesn't matter what your fucking politics are and like bro you're sitting across you know I'm sitting in a bar and there's a bunch of dudes over there that you know maybe they look a little different than me and whatever way might be drinking blood like yeah whatever bro yeah that you do whatever and and you know eventually you look up and you're like what's up guys and they're like now man what's up with you we're good bro what do you guys think of this bullshit well fuck man we think this shit is bullshit fuck we do too and they don't want us finding out that everybody thinks it's bullshit so like dude until and this is what I was getting on with on CTI last week with the conservative influencers like you pro-freedom influencers that continue to propagate for these people you're a fucking pond in their machine without even understanding it like we need fucking real unity bro we need people to get along at the street level we need people to commit to personal excellence and the only thing that we have right now that we're in control is our own individual commitment to break free of the matrix by becoming personally excellent if they want us fat you can't be a fat ass if they want you broke you gotta try not to be broke if they want you consuming all these pills do your best to fucking be healthy so you don't need them if they want you streaming all this bullshit data and scrolling on your phone go touch some fucking grass man and create some shit in real life like unplug yourself by becoming personally excellent that's the only thing we can do besides unite as a as a as a people which I don't think we're ready to do yet I still see these people falling for this thing over and over and over again and real talk you guys the millions of you that listen to this show you should be yelling at those people and saying bro you fucking guys are part of the fucking problem man like you guys are on here every day dividing everybody hyping everybody up you're not trying to solve anything how about let's hear what your solutions are because I got a thing in my businesses it's real simple you're not allowed to bring me a problem unless you bring me a fucking solution and we have lots of people here crying about the problems everybody knows the problems everybody can open their wallet everybody go to the gas pump everybody go to fucking grocery store everybody can look at their fucking adjustable mortgage rate everybody can look at rent we know there's a fucking problem what are we gonna do about it that's what I want to hear that's what I would like to see where's the solutions because as far as I know there's me and like maybe three other people out there providing actual solutions one of the solutions the only solutions I know besides legitimately creating violence which dude I think is a bad idea I think we lose that battle is to fucking become personally excellent commit to that as individuals bring that example home change the culture in our communities and then also work to unite people those are the only two things I can think that will fucking fix what's going on because if you went and did a violent revolution do you think they're not gonna do what they did a J6 do you think they're not like let's everybody's like oh it's time for violence well okay so you get the the the most violent people together to go do this violence and they drone strike the entire group and then you have no leaders now what you're fucking guys are you guys are fucking idiots like you can't think through shit you need we need people to have the track record of critically thinking their way through life I happen to be one of those people I've been very fucking successful in real life and I'm telling you I've thought about this I've dedicated a major part of my life to this I understand exactly what the fuck is going on within my capacity to understand it and the only two solutions we have here are to take individual responsibility for ourselves to become unplugged from the matrix meaning don't be fat don't be broke don't be lazy don't be stupid and work to be a great example of a human being and then work to unite people those are the only two things that we have the capacity to actually do and control and those happen to be the two things that will restore greatness to America in a real way not Trump comes in as a new president or fucking whoever right me or anybody bro even if you guys elected me as president which you know I can't fix your fucking shit I can't fix your life I can't make you not fat I can't make you smarter I can't make you wealthy only you can do that and until everybody takes control of that and says bro I'm gonna live in a high standard regardless of what the fuck is going on in the world we got none to talk about and I'm gonna get fixed and the reason people shy away from this as a solution is because it takes personal effort to execute it's not easy no it's hard to do it's real shit man but we got a big problem and I can tell you this it's hard as that will be to do it's gonna be easier than what the what they're gonna do to us which is making us eat bugs and starve and have nothing and you'll be happy I mean I tell you right to your face 2030 you'll own nothing and be happy you know they've already got half of your commonsense that's a good idea because you don't own shit anyway you know they go to these Gen Z kids who haven't and by the way there's a lot of good Gen Z kids too I'm not gonna see here I'm coming I'm not gonna be one of these douchebags that throws them all under the bus because they ain't true there's a lot of great ones but they're going to these kids of any age they did it to fucking they did it to fucking millennials they did it to they done it to every generation the the the the communist left goes to the kids who haven't had any time in real life to build anything real and then they like sell them on this idea of how unfair it is that bro you're 17 you're not supposed to have shit you know I'm saying like you're fucking 25 you're supposed to not have shit yet just because you don't have shit in your life yet doesn't mean you're getting fucked it means you're 20 fucking five that's the game yes it's the first quarter like bro so they sell him this idea yeah they sell him this idea that the world is not a fair place but the reality is if you go out there and talk to anybody who's actually built anything they're gonna tell you yeah it's really fucking hard but you'll get out what you put in why do you think every successful person says that why do you think that you think they're all just got together on a story no motherfucker that's how it works like it's hard but if you do the work it produces a result that's it like mowing the grass in July when it's 115 fucking degrees outside guess what that's hard but if you do it the grass still gets cut you see what I'm saying like this is a this is a fallacy that is sold to our youth that doesn't have the life perspective to understand that they're not supposed to have anything yet you know what I mean absolutely and that's how they mobilize these young kids but like a lot of these young kids are getting smart enough to where they're realizing like fuck if I buy into this I'll never have anything yep that's refreshing to see as well absolutely man absolutely loving man guys any question number two Eddie I am currently working for my father who owns a very successful business which is continuously growing my father built the business from the ground up which puts tons of pressure on me to continue his success I know statistically speaking second generation businesses typically don't survive I use this as motivation to not only maintain what my father has built but to continue to grow improve that I can do what he did and more what advice do you have for a second generation business owners like myself who refuse to be another failed business statistic the fact that you're aware of this and that this drives you already is really what you need okay so here's that's fundamental that no that's the reason you're not going to be that person awareness is the key here dude this is why 75 hard works so well because it's not because it's a diet program or it like bro it brings you to a level of awareness that you can now discern between two distinct influences in your life your boss voice which tells you to do all the shit you know you're supposed to do and your bitch voice which works tire tirelessly to talk you out of doing those things and when you become aware of those things then all of a sudden it's a different game because you don't want to be a fucking loser so you tell the bitch voice shut the fuck up and you become aware of it now you have a skill that your whole life called awareness right most people live their life with no awareness and the reason most second generation businesses fail isn't because there's some like disadvantaged to second generation businesses it's because they lack the awareness to what this individual just described in his question or in her question which is this I understand that second generation businesses fail I don't want to be one of those people I have taken it upon myself to prove to myself and everybody around me that this second generation business person isn't going to fucking tank like all those other pussies okay you are already aware of this which gives you a huge competitive advantage because the people who kill their parents businesses they kill them because they they don't have what you have in your brain and your heart right now they have a entirely different set of programming which goes like this I'm rich my dad was rich my parents were rich now I'm rich and I get to keep being rich and because I grew up rich and because I grew up with money and because that means I'm always going to have these things so it really doesn't matter what I do look at my bank account it looks great I drive a Mercedes that's awesome I have a nice house I have a lake house and they don't worry about a mother fucking thing until the shit is burnt to the ground and then they're like oh fuck and that's where they learn their awareness they they're going to learn the awareness eventually but because they're not aware on the front side they get taught the awareness on the backside which is in the form of a failed business so a lot of times guys and this goes for any problem in your life if you are just aware enough to to be understanding of the position that you're in in a real way this is why this shows called real AF by the way the welcome to reality that's why we say welcome to react because this is fucking reality okay if you're aware of reality and where you sit in it it makes it very easy to navigate it's when you tell yourself stories that aren't true that that gets you in positions you don't want to be in so you know when you think about like yourself right now this person who asks this question I would personally bet and I would bet this for real that that person will go to take the business to multiple levels above their parents because that happens a lot too there's a lot of second generation business people who took what their parents built and fucking 100 exit right that's how you should look at it that's the mentality you should have what your parents did they set you up for a good a good base and that's okay some people are going to talk shit and the bigger you get they're going to say dirty gave him a silver spoon and all this other fucking loser shit okay here's how you shove it down their fucking throats by taking what the fuck your parents built and building it to a hundred x that level and then what are people gonna say nothing well they're gonna say the same shit but you're gonna look at him be like suck my dick brawn give a fuck you know what I'm saying so how the fuck did my dad get me here my dad didn't even get here he don't know how to fucking get here you see what I'm saying like that's the story so like you know how you it's kind of funny because that's for people who were born into their parents business that's their biggest insecurity right people saying you were born with a silver spoon or daddy gave you something or this or that and and I know this because this is a question I get all the time from people who are in this situation how do I get people to stop saying that like this is fuck blah blah go build something that's so undeniably massively more impactful and bigger than what your parents built and shove it down their fucking throats yeah so that's my answer the fact that you're aware is what's going to save you from becoming that and I think you're thinking about it the right way I think that should be your mission and I think anybody who finds themselves in a position where they were taught things by their parents they should escalate those things many times over that's the why your parents taught you that you know my dad was an entrepreneur now he never gave me anything he never wrote me a check he never handed me shit but I did learn a lot of shit right I was around his business I got to see how I ran I learned a lot of things and you know and quite honestly this is just real shit I've taken it to about a hundred fucking times the level that he did well actually mathematically more than that all right so what are you gonna say that's my dad's proud of that right he's right over there he's got an office he's on my payroll I can see his I see him he's right there see if I go over there and ask him if he's proud then we went out and built something many multiple times bigger than what he's gonna say yeah that's why the fuck I taught you that was a point yes and so you have an obligation to think about it the way you think about it and and the reason that people fails because they're not afraid of what you're afraid of I want to actually this because and correct me if I'm wrong you know but like when I was thinking about this question I imagine like you know you're in 1970 Cheval right yep that Chevy when it was made in 1970 it was a beautiful beautiful vehicle runs great right you know but it's 2023 puts a look you know that's a different time there's new tires that have come out you know maybe new synthetic oil how do you know what to change on that 1970 to keep it run it's already well you mean in terms of the business in terms of the business oh well bro that's the greatest thing so so you know once you see and this is a great this is that's a fucking great question okay so I'm glad you asked that a lot of these younger people they understand the world in such a different way yeah then what like somebody who's the see I'm lucky bro like I'm in that very fucking like and very very rarely well I say I'm lucky you will never hear me say it but I'm gonna say here's where I got lucky I was lucky to be born at the exact fucking right time where I built a fucking very successful business pre-internet and then I was able to fucking build another one post internet you see what I'm saying both sides yes and that's what makes me understand what we do and why I'm successful at it yeah a lot of these other brands the reason they struggle so hard is because they only have been around for five seven ten years in a post internet world they don't understand how business was done before because they're too young to understand it that's where my advantage is like dude that's a gift like that's a fucking dude I do not say I got lucky but I got lucky about that I can't control where that when I got fucking born all right well I mean wasn't it wasn't lucky or did you make the the did you make the right pivots as an entrepreneur I was born when 2001 happened I was 21 years old okay that's when the internet started going the next seven or eight years social media wasn't really a thing that's when I made my first built my first eight figure business that was successful right I pivoted those same principles into the technology that we have my point in saying all this is that the world continues to evolve and so if you're a parent like in this scenario where the parents have built a good base this young person who might have a different perspective because they grown up in an entire different world might be able to come in and be like well why don't we do this for that why don't we try to do that and as long as there's open discussion where you don't just discount the parents because you think they're old and you don't just you know run with your ideas because you think this is the way it's supposed to be now you're gonna come to this peanut butter and jelly sandwich right that tastes really fucking good much better than yours it's right tastes like mine okay but you're gonna come to this level of of of coming together that's going to bring together the things that you did right the old way and the things that can be done to improve upon them with the new technology and now you have something that other people don't have so what this person has is an opportunity to sort of do what I've done in a different way by leveraging their parents knowledge of their business you see what I'm saying so and I think that's the game I think the game I think and I don't think this I have like stacks and stacks of stacks of undeniable fucking track record and evidence over the last 24 and a half years 20 IBM business 25 years on January 1st bro it's wild so knowing what I know and understanding what I understand this person's situation is almost perfectly aligned with my situation if their ability to understand the way business was done before is translated into the way technology is now and and what I was getting the point out here is that in my opinion which isn't really opinion it's a fact because we can look at all the evidence is that that's the the game is to take old school business and then utilize technology to do the business yeah guys Andy are third and find a question question number three Andy I got a five year old and I wanted to ask you how would you teach the concept of earning the things I beat him yeah well just beat him just beat your kids hey listen I'll make a tick-tock out of that shit I turned out just fine yeah just beat him but how would you how would you go about teaching the concept of earning the things that they want for example she's got a long list of toys dolls dresses etc that she wants us to buy but because there are not now those aren't needs I don't feel comfortable just buying her whatever she is this question from you no no it's real okay that's not for me no I knew the answer I'd beat the shit out of my head no surprise oh yeah like you want to say I know traditionally parents oh I know you guys got a little princess over there bro yeah yeah we two of them it's hard to say no but I mean how do you do it say fucking no all right well answer mine not old let's ask the question she's still in that phase like I just you know you can get it right now she ain't oh see you oh she's young man I got it all right we shame through yet all right so we got a big shit talker in the house that's right there is all right let's let's get we'll get to that in a second all right keep interrupting no you're good she says I know traditionally parents use things like completing chores and getting good grades and schoolwork to accomplish this but these days I've heard that bribing kids can actually backfire because ultimately we want them to learn to be internally motivated instead of externally motivated yeah I'm thoughts on this yeah a lot but let's get back to what we were talking about okay first off my peanut butter jelly's beat New Wars all day second off how do you handle this in your house yeah I mean like I said I think I think for me is a little different like my daughter like she's three years old man like it's very hard to say no not being here yet no not yet I'm sure she's gonna get there man because she's getting a little sassy yeah she's sassy as shit she's a star bro yeah man listen she's so you wrote this question you want me to answer it no I got it we'll be approaching this for sure but I mean because like that is DJ cementing his own questions hi you too all right both you guys what you are this five this is actually Joe's fuck Joe I knew what do you guys all right so but earning right like most internal motivation like earning principal basics so it's very important that you understand the kids can understand reality very very simply when I was a young kid my dad took me to the graveyard and where his his adopted father is bearing and I was only like I don't know three or four we went and he's like see that right there he's like that's your grandpa he's in the ground there and guess what he ain't coming back and I'm like what do you mean he said once you're dead you're dead you can't come back you said that's why you can't do anything stupid that's why you don't run in the street that's why you don't because once it happens you're in the ground forever all right and dude I'm fucking I'm 44 years old I still remember that shit all right I got it right away like fucking be careful got it you know yeah yeah so so we have to understand the kids have the capacity to understand these things if we explain them and we also have to understand that we have an obligation to teach these kids the way things actually work in real life from a very young age and where I see parents getting a lot of trouble and this is perpetuated with the school system and the way that these values have been taught over the last 20 plus years you know if you got a person who went to high school and and they're coming out right now bro like real talk you guys have been fucked like you've been taught the wrong things and if you want to look at the what the wrong things are versus what the right things are we can look at all the things society says which is everything's supposed to be fair everything's supposed to be equal everybody gets what they want everybody's a superstar if they're loyal to themselves I'm not in competition with anyone I'm only in competition myself participation trophies matter people's feelings matter we can we can scoop all that over here and probably a whole bunch of other stuff right I'm missing but in real life let's go watch a football game and let's think about what goes into the football game okay football game these dudes are on the verge of a physical fight to the point of injuring themselves and sometimes even killing themselves to win it they practice their entire lives they practice hard they lift weights they eat the right foods and they did that for 20 fucking years before you ever saw them on a college football Saturday all right in most cases now what do that what does that example show us it shows us that work in equals results it shows us that work must be done over the course of a long time it shows us that competition is very real and it shows us that winners are rewarded for winning the competition at a very exponentially high rate okay like nobody gives a fuck about who lost a Super Bowl last year gives a fuck you know what I'm saying nobody cares about who fucking lost the world series the other day like people are talking about the team to one that's that's life okay so we have two very distinct ideologies in society we're both are valued which is super interesting right like how do you convince the population that real life is this I have idealistic nonsense where there is no competition and people win them for showing up life just takes how do you and then still get them to pay for football like that doesn't make any fucking sense at least to me so when we think about if we want our kids to win we have to show them the model that wins and the model that wins is the game of football or the game of athletics that we can observe in real life it's called natural order the best people win and they get rewarded and all this other shit that they teach that's fucking that you're handicapping your fucking child okay so when your kid wants a you know a fucking bike you know I would do something like what my dad did my dad made me earn all my shit all right and my dad had the means to buy me a bike or you know whatever the fuck you wanted to buy me but when I went to him when I was like seven or eight I said dad I want a bike I wanted a Mongoose Mongoose back in the day I don't know if Mongoose is good still but Mongoose used to be the shit that's the shit all right so I wanted a Mongoose fucking be a max bike so I could be cool right and do bunny hops but the reality was is my dad was like no not getting you a fucking bike like you're gonna go earn the bike because that's the way the world works and you know what I did I went door to door and I sold fucking light bulbs until I earned enough money to buy the bike now where did I get the light bulbs well I got him from my dad he helped me out that's what's called good parenting right he gave me a vessel to do the work I learned the lesson it's stuck with me and here the fuck I am okay but like that's those things stuck with me since why was a kid right like when I when I talk about when I first saw the Lamborghini and I said dad what's that he's like that's a Lamborghini and I'm like holy shit the next thing he followed it up with was hey you got to work really hard to have a car like that I don't know my group no yeah he's like look and and do you know where most parents would look at that guy and be like you don't want to be that guy that guy's a greedy fuck my dad did the opposite my dad said hey you know what if that's what you want this is what it's gonna take when we would drive down the street and I said look at you be like all right well if you want that this is what that's gonna take and that was a constant reinforcement that Sal and I both got from our dad Sal wanted to be a professional baseball player and so you know what my dad told him you said well you're gonna have to fucking practice every mother fucking day and you know why Sal was fucking you know the baseball player that he was because he practiced every mother fucking day you know I use ten times better than me at baseball because while he was practicing I was playing fucking video games you understand so like I will you we learn these things um through practical lessons as a parent you just have to be brave enough to teach them this is also why I write the children's books I write the children's books a lot of you guys don't know I write children's books and have since 2016 and the whole entire reason that we fucking produce these books is to provide a tool for parents like this person who may not understand exactly what to teach or maybe they haven't been able to find success yet in their life and how do you expect someone who's never found success to teach their children the principles of success confidently well we have to give them tools and so this set of children's books which are available on my website um basically provide the tools for the parents to teach the values that apply to the football model of life which is parallel to real life yeah okay yeah can you touch on two real quick on on because you mentioned like you know this being internally motivated versus external motivated you know and and I feel like the like there's a certain point or or segment of society that like they're still kind of like looking down on on materialistic goals and you know the way I would yeah there is you know what you know those people are called losers yeah that's what I'm saying yeah but it's like they shouldn't listen to those there's nothing wrong with material goals especially not not always or nothing wrong with it material goals actually lead to a tremendous amount of good things let me explain this to you okay so Gary V used to bust my balls about material shit and I love Gary I wouldn't be here without Gary okay so this is not a knock on Gary Gary's one of the smartest guys I've ever known but Gary also is from New York all right he's taking care of everywhere his whole fucking life he doesn't understand cars I'm a car guy I've been playing hot wheels since I was fucking five four years old and micro machines and RC cars I fucking love cars bro and so and and come you know in all fairness his argument is don't get the car just show off okay like and that's a fair argument but Gary and I have to have this conversation so many times over the years and I always explain this to people you know people who shit on material success there is a time in your life when you have nothing where material success could potentially be the only thing that will pull you through the hard times and so when we villainize material success we're taking away people's dreams and saying you're immoral for having those dreams and when we tell people they're morally inferior for having dreams of personal success when they have nothing we're taking away maybe the only thing that these people will have that will pull them through all right so there's the first problem with it yeah the second problem with it is that nobody thinks of the big picture implications of what material things can actually provide by having those goals now when I started in business I didn't know shit about business but here's what I did know I wanted to be rich and I wanted to have cool cars and I wanted to do cool shit with my friends all right so the first fucking three years where I didn't get paid shit all I thought about was hey man this is gonna be worth it because I'm gonna get to here okay and then the next seven years where I got paid six hundred ninety five dollars a month you know what I thought about I thought man you know what this is really hard but I'm already three years in that means I'm three years closer to my Lamborghini than I ever was before right and these thoughts pulled me through because there's gonna be this gap between where you are currently and where you want to be that's going to have to you're gonna have to have something to look forward to to pull you through otherwise you have no hope all right and when you're young and you have nothing the hope is hopefully I won't always have nothing right so so you you paint these pictures in your head of like driving up to the restaurant in the Lamborghini and getting out and everybody being like damn and like you know that shit's great like it's fucking one of the coolest things ever I hope you get to experience it it's awesome but the reality is is that eventually what happens is is you mature and you get a little bit older and you start to value other things and and so without the material things you can never get to the point to actually value the real things which is the people that you're doing the things with and the people you're trying to provide value for okay so you you go from your ambition being selfish to your ambition being selfless with a over the course of time especially after you've experienced some of these things right like what cars mean to me now are not the same thing they meant to me 10 years ago like I don't walk in my garage like everybody else does it walks my garage is like holy shit to me I'm just walking through the garage I don't give a fuck right I could do with or without any of those things my passion now has grown into this bigger mission that I care about which is providing careers for the people that go to war with me every day and doing so in a way that actually benefits other people and though that mission becomes the passion whereas for the first 10 years it was about what the fuck I could get and here's the ironic thing and this is the best lesson of the whole thing once you actually make that switch you actually do much better in business because business has to do with you trading something of value for money so when you become more focused on the value that you're creating for your employees and your customers those people go out and do a better job and they get better benefit and then all of a sudden your business does better so you actually become way more successful by making it about other people but you can't get to that point without the selfish desires whatever that might be and so when people shit on success and material things they're not thinking about that because they've never experienced it which goes back to my fucking point of motherfuckers talking about shit they've never been through which is the entire fucking internet now Gary has a fair perspective because his perspective is don't buy the shit and put yourself in a negative situation to you know financially and hold up your success to show off that's also true yeah but that's the yes reasonable yes so and you know so there's new ones to the discussion but ultimately no there's nothing wrong with material things in fact material things are often times very necessary for people to pull through the hardest times of their lives so that they can succeed through that and you can't listen to any fucking loser on the bro we have so much loser talk on the internet it's 90% losers like 90% of what you consume on the internet is from fucking losers and you let that you cannot you should mute every single person you should fucking unfollow every single person all of them who spew that user that loser shit for real talk like it's here's what it is it's people because here's what people do and I've been alive long enough to notice this they start out with ambitions those people want a material success too they wanted the shit to they wanted a bank account too they wanted all that shit but here's what they found out they weren't able to actually cut it okay and then they adjust their whole dream and then they come out in the social media and they say I've re-evaluated my priorities in life and you know all the shit that I used to think was cool I think is for losers now and what I actually think cool is what I was calling a loser just a year ago right and really what it is is they've given up on their hopes on their dreams on their success and they've adopted a new persona to fit what it is they're doing now so that they're not embarrassed and they can save face and that's what you have to know what you're looking at and people I'm gonna get a lot of people being like who's not always what it is yeah it is that's what the fuck it is you couldn't fucking cut it you did it for long enough then you had some sort of fucking decision to make and you said well instead of me fighting harder through the time to get where I ultimately wanted to go I'm just going to accept my reality and I'm gonna pretend what it's what it's always wanted to start with which isn't even true yeah just gracefully yes yes so you have to understand what they're looking at and who this loser language comes from that's it comes from people who have literally given up on themselves that's who's telling you this shit so pay it no mind these people don't know anything they're not more enlightened they're not morally superior to you because because that's where they try to take it they always try to take it as I'm enlightened and I'm morally superior than you because I don't like material things okay cool man yeah I rip myself a lavender and smoke out your wash that's all you got that hold on hold on what else do they got yeah what else can they talk about what else can they say that's all they can fucking say and if that's all they can say that their opinion doesn't mean anything because they have no option to have a relevant opinion outside of the only thing they they're they have available to say so why would you give them any weight in anything that you do you shouldn't like those people are fucking losers 20 years ago when they spew that shit we call those people losers in fact the internet should bring that back like get that loser talk out of here loser like these are fucking losers they're fucking losers bro and they're gonna lose and if you hang around with them you'll lose too if you listen to him you'll lose too I love it man guys Andy that was three go pay the fee and go in
