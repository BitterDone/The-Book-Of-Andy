What is up guys, hey, it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about it lies, the fitness and delusions of my society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys. We have Andy and DJ crews, the motherfucking internet. We also have a special friend here today, Mr. Dean Stott. What's up bro? Hey, how are you? We needed some accent on the show so we decided to bring Dean here. Yeah, that's right bro. That's right. Did you notice my play on the intro? Hey, that's pretty good huh? Yeah, that's total accident. Just came out. Sounded right. Yeah. Well hey listen. It's a T.I. That means we're going to be cruising the internet. Before we get into cruising the internet, we have these other episodes that we have with shows within the show. This is where we go along the lines of what's going on in the world. We talk about headlines. We put a couple on the screen. Talk about what's true, what's not true, what we think we need to do about it as individuals to solve some of these problems. And then we might move into some other things as well. Other times when you tune in, we have shows within the show. Like I said, we have Q and A F. That's where you get to submit questions and we bring you the answer. Now you could submit your question one of a couple of different ways. The first way is guys that first way you can email those questions in to ask Andy at Andy for selling that. Or you can go on YouTube on our Q and A F episodes and drop a comment right down in the comment section and put your question. And we'll pick some from there as well. Other times we have real talk, real talk is five to twenty minutes of me giving you some real talk. And then other times we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus is for people who have completed 75 hard or the live hard program, which is available for free. At episode two, eight, it'll change your life. We bring those people on. We let them talk about their journey, what they've learned, who they've become and how you can become whatever it is you're trying to become as well. So that's the run down on the show. Now for all that stuff, we have this thing that we call the fee. The fee is very simple. If the show brings you value, it makes you think, it makes you laugh, if it gives you a new perspective, if you learn something, it inspires you, please share the show. All right, you'll notice that I don't do hardly any social media. So that means if you don't share it, people don't know about it. A lot of you guys message me and you say, oh, these messages need to be heard. Yes, I agree. That's why we make them. But it's up to you to share them. So please pay the fee. Don't be a hoe. Share the show. All right. So what's up, dude? Yeah, what's going on, man? Nothing. We got Dean here. Look at Dean's arms. I mean, do you just make it? Like, you just got, do you? I do 50 press ups for all coming to another. I'm just saying, man. No. I had a friend in the military and he said knock on his door and he'd have to wait because I know that he's at the other side of the door doing 50 press ups. I'm like, look, before you hear me, I don't have a cure women behind me. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying welcome to the fucking gun show. Yeah, right. It's here. It's here, man. So what's going on with you, man? Just busy with life. You know, my wife's in town. She's, she's guest speaking this week with your wife at Women in Business. I've just spent a month away traveling. Did the last two episodes this new show and this mainstream? I can't really go into too much detail, but it's a special forces show which will be out at the end of the year and then bounce on there onto Scotland. My wife was awarded the MBE by King Charles in Edinburgh for weeks now. So yeah. So me and myself and the family went back and sort of shared that experience with her. So and it's actually my first time back in UK since being in America. So you've been gone. Now, is that the picture I saw with you with the Kilt? Yeah. I had the Kilt on. It was my son likes to call a Kilt. He's never going to wear a Kilt again. So bro, I'm just saying that's a good look. Don't you free ball in Kilt? I don't know. Yeah, you do. You do. That's like a thing. Oh, really? You can hang low, go commando. Yeah. Well, hey, it's a good look. It must be comfortable too. I'm just saying. Well, remember when we had that fundraiser at my house and that dude showed up in the Kilt? Yeah. A big ass dude, he's like six, eight fucking three, fifty. You can't say shit too. No. You look good now. It's good look. Anyway, I think I might have to do the Kilt. Maybe when we go golfing. Can you mix golfing and Kilting? Yeah, you can. Well, the birthplace of golf was stolen. Well, yeah. But you can actually also design your own tartan as well. You don't know what you have to go with the pattern. Oh, yeah, yeah. So what's that called? Tartan. Tartan. Yeah, the tartan. Tartan is the pattern. I just learned that. Yeah. But the great thing about the Kilt is you can actually, you know, you can wear it over a smart attire at a wedding with the, with the big tie. Or you can actually wear it just throw a football shirt on and just go to the game. No, normally we start the weekend with smart attire and by the end it looks like something out of hang of writing, writing paper. Yeah, for sure, bro. I'm in, dude. I'm listening. I'll try and get one. I want to kill. I am. I do have some Irish in me. I think that's close to Scottish. Yeah, that's close enough. That's close to where Kilt. Yeah. I'm definitely getting one. I'm down. You want one too? Yeah, let's do it. I'm going to be in America. I was Scottish Irish. I'm there every time I've been there. Yeah, 17 percent. It's because we all love to drink. The perfect. Yeah. So, dude, next time Dean's on, it's Kilt. It's Kilt. Yeah. I'm down with that. No underwear. Yeah. I'm down with that too. All right. Cool. I know you are. Luckily we got these boards in front of us. We're taking the boards away. Yeah. All right. What's up? Well, it's good to see you, bro. Thanks for coming in. Dean's going to sit in on CTI and, uh, we're going to, we got some good ones for us. We got. Cruising, man. Cruising. I ain't even fucking hate it, bro. I didn't sleep at all last night. Yeah. Why, why is that? I don't know. Just happened sometimes. Yeah. It just happened sometimes. I slept like 15, 20 minutes the whole night. So my brain, this is. You're looking good. So. Thank you. This is going to be an interesting show. So. No, no, no, no, no, no, Biden's on it. I might. I'm interested to see what you cruise in there. It might be slightly different from what he cruised over. Yeah, it was. It was. I got some good stuff. Uh, I think, I think first, before we get into our first headlines, because Dean, uh, as, as you guys know, uh, listen, being's been in on a few episodes. Um, but you talked about how you kind of escaped, uh, the quote unquote, COVID tyranny, right? Um, um, and somehow major way to calm you foreign you. I'm not sure how that worked out, but, uh, I wanted to bring this up because, Andy, you also mentioned, and we talked about a lot on the show about this pendulum swinging backwards, right? And some of the dangers of it swinging back too far the other way. Uh, so I wanted to bring this up before we get into our first headlines. Uh, but this headline reads, uh, burger and pie in an out burger requiring employees to show medical note to wear mask. Now, this is, this is creating a, a fuss all over the internet right now. Um, and I wanted to get you guys a take on this. So, um, little back story. So the, uh, this is a bright bar article reading. Uh, in and out, the beloved California fast food empire has sparked left wing hate over a new policy that will require employees to present a medical note if they want to wear a mask to work. Uh, Dr. Lucky Tran, a science influencer shared the new in and out mask policy on Twitter, which was reportedly sent out to employees via a memo ahead of the policy's implementation day. Quote, although in and out has not publicly commented on the policy, trans shared screenshots from the email should receive that appeared legitimate, uh, noted the Mary suit. Uh, the new policy will apply to stores in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Texas, and Utah. So here, uh, it's just a 10,000 foot view of the email that was sent out to in and out employees. Um, but in it, uh, it states, quote, it stipulates that no employee may wear a mask unless they provide a medical note that exempts them from the requirement. If they provide the medical note, they must wear a mask company provided in 95 masks, uh, unless they can produce another note exempting them from that requirement to it added. Um, in and out will reportedly not enforce the policy in its home state of California, uh, for employees who wish to wear a mask, the new policy says that the medical note must, quote, clearly state the reason for the exemption, uh, including the estimated duration that the mask will be needed. People who failed to apply can face disciplinary action up to an including termination of employment. Uh, the company further said that the ban would help to quote, emphasize the importance of customer service and the ability to show our associates smile. Um, now, Dr. Lucky Trans call on it discriminatory, of course, um, and, uh, encourage people to voice their disapproval to it. It wasn't discriminatory when you fucking screened everybody and the fucking everywhere we went with our fucking mask. I remember when you needed discriminatory, I remember when you needed doctors note to, to not wear a mask. And people are not, you know what I'm saying? So like people are such hypocrites. I agree with you, man. I agree with you. Um, in and out, they've, they've, they've kind of, they're, the conservative leaning. Uh, bright wire news reported the conservative leaning in and out clashed with the, uh, California government. Uh, during the coronavirus pandemic due to its refusal to enforce faxing mandates at some stores in 2021, the San Francisco Department of Public Health shut down the cities in an out burger restaurant near Fisherman's worth. Uh, because quote, employees were not properly, uh, properly checking for customers vaccination documentation. Uh, in a statement at the time in an out chief legal and business officer, Arnie, uh, West New Year, uh, said the company quote, fiercely disagrees with the government mandates that forced businesses to discriminate. Uh, they said we refuse to become the vaccination police for any government. It is unreasonable and invasive and unsafe to force our restaurant associates to segregate customers into those who may be served and those who may not, whether based on the documentation they carry for any other reason. Guys, what do we got on this? Well, I mean, the hypocrisy is pretty blatant. Okay. You guys are totally okay, screaming at everybody everywhere they go for three years about wearing a mask. Even though you have the man who told you to wear a mask, who told you previously before he told you to wear a mask to not wear a mask because it wasn't effective. Now that same man's come out and said that the mask were not effective and you're still wanting to wear the fucking mask. Okay. And now you're mad because people don't want you to wear the mask because it's unsafe. All right. When people can't see your face, look at all the robberies and the burglaries and all this shit's been happening through COVID where people can just disguise himself with mask. And not only that, this has become a blatant political statement. Like this isn't about this is not about safety. It's about virtue. It's about showing what team you belong to. That's all it was ever about. And a lot of you real talk went along with it without doing any research on your own when people like me and DJ and a whole bunch of other people told you this shit that there's plenty of science available then that show that it didn't fucking work. And you went along with it and now we're here. Now the world's fucked up. Okay. That's the reality of what's that's what I think. I think had you guys had enough sense in the first place to not wear the mask and understand that that's not even how you handle a pandemic. You're quarantined. The people who are vulnerable. You move them out of society and the safety and the rest of the world goes on with life. And because all of you do good in dumb fucks out there decided to go along with this shit. Now we're in a situation where a whole entire country is totally fucked. Alright, they've printed more money than in the last three years than they've printed in the last 100. Alright, you're all that you guys. Oh, how is this related? Everything's all related to this. This is how they force compliance among all of us. This is where I started. So and dude, the people who are still hanging on. Those are the motherfuckers that forced it. These are the same people that were screaming at you in home depot or wherever you went to buy your groceries on airplanes for three fucking years. Like do fuck these people. That's my opinion. You want to know what I think that's what I think. I'm fucking over it, dude. Like it's still a political statement. It's still like dude, you have the man who the dude who told you to wear the shit has since told you that it doesn't work. And you're still wearing it. What's that say? That says that you're too fucking stupid to understand data and you can't understand that you were played. And your ego is making you hold onto this fake identity you created for yourself. And personally, I see these people as the entire problem with society. That's my personal thing. Yeah, I have to live in California and actually, well, Orange County, someone class that has California. So I have seen a huge reduction of people with with masks. There are those still holding on. I think either they had Andy's right to put, you know, having a statement. I also think there's an element that has stupidity as well. It's not I drive along and I see someone in their car on their own with a mask. We went to my daughters as a school concert and during COVID and they had masks on as a plain flute, but they cut a hole in the mask. And I'm like, well, that's just stupidity. And then there's the third element of those actually have been listening to the rubbish that we've been told and our scare mug and then generally believe that their lives are still at risk. But I think for this, yeah, it's just a statement. I think if you are wearing a mask, then you shouldn't be front of house. You shouldn't be that person engaging with the public. Right. I was at a fast food place the other day. And the only person with the mask was the one who's calling out the names and no one could hear it. You should only have a mask if you've got a big pimple or something else. Or obviously, you know, some of these people, let's just be honest. They're fucking ugly people. Yeah. Okay. I'm being real. Like they weren't blessed with the fucking the good. They don't take care of themselves. They're not healthy. They're disgusting looking people and they cover their disgusting faces and they're disgusting viewpoints and wave it around with this mask. Like bro, you don't ever see super handsome or beautiful people wearing fucking mask because you know what? We want to show this shit off, bitch. Exhibit. Like we're not that's what I'm saying. We're not trying to hide this. That was the whole reason I wouldn't wear a mask because I was doing everybody's eyeballs of fucking disservice by wearing one. They reflect on the brand as well. If you walk into in an hour, I want to be meeting with a night smiling face. I don't even met with a mask and then not being able to understand what that person is actually saying because that does everything to reflect reflection on the brand for me. So yeah, if you want to have a mask, then you'll probably going to end up a job out of the back. Well, I mean, here's my thought on this too, right? Like it's in and out burger. It's a fast food joint, right? Like there's nothing healthy quote unquote about. It's fucking it's a cheeseburger and fucking french fries. You weren't a mask because you're worried about your health. But yet you're going into like, bro, you never see healthy fit people doing this. It's always obese people who have terrible habits who don't take care of themselves who are complaining about everything. Not just the mask, not just it's everything's unjust, everything's unfair. You're fat, fover, per point now that they're fucking fat, bro, you're fat. You eat the wrong fucking foods. You don't move enough. And there's nothing. You're not a victim. You're a victim of your own inability to stop shoveling shit into your mouth. Right. Like real talk. Right. Like all you have to do is not do something. Like you can't even stop doing all of you is not do it. Just don't do it. Like stop. You know, like I want to take five thousand calories of food in but please deliver my meal with a mask on. Yeah. And health. Bro, dude, dude, it's so like I think people need to really remember how insane this 2020 2021 and 2022 were. Like it was insanity, dude. It was total crimes against humanity. Real real shit. And these people, I think Dean, you make a fair point. Like we're taught, I like to talk shit on these people because I view them as the propagators of this entire situation that we're in. It's the it's the useful idiots. But you make a great point. Some of these people probably are brainwashed into truly being afraid. Right. Like I think that's a minority. I think most of these people are just they want it. They want their political identity known. And I think it's our duty as red blooded Americans to fuck with these people as hard as you possibly can. Like and I don't mean like physically, but I mean, no, you mean like what Max, what Max, me what are you saying? I mean, no, like punch them in the face like getting their faces. No, I don't mean like that. But I mean like when we went to the Tuxedo store and the shit was fucked up and I let the motherfucker know about it. Like bro, I won't even talk to you if you have a mask on like you have a mask on. I'm going to ask you to take it the fuck off. Like I'm so my safety. Yeah, I'm so tired of this shit. I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of these people who don't know shit, who don't contribute shit, who are completely misinformed, complete sheep, costing the rest of us literally everything. I just had a conversation with a friend of mine who was talking to me about how money is tight for him. And he's like I'm not spending any more money that I was in 2019, but I can barely afford to survive now. And I was well, I was doing well then. And we started talking about it. And this all of this problems that you guys are like the financial pinch. I don't think people are connecting the dots that it all goes back to this mask issue. Okay, a lot of you were cowards and a lot of you wore the mask, even though you didn't believe in it. You talked about how you didn't believe in it, but you still wore it. Okay. And what you did was you created a scenario where it appeared and we covered this at length a million times on the show where it appeared that the majority of the people were with the narrative when it wasn't true. This empowered a lot of these people to do really ridiculous shit like shut our entire country down. If you guys hadn't of all worn the mask, they wouldn't have known that they could shut the country down. Then they shut the country down. Now we're talking about more money being printed in the last three years that have been printed in the previous 100 years, which means that you're paying an extra nine to $12,000 to even live right now. And this is because of people like this and like do this tolerance shit that we've had. Taller they don't have any tolerance for us. Do you not remember what happened during COVID? Like like do try. Have a conversation with one of these people about the mask during COVID. You can lay out the scientific facts and they will literally lose their shit screaming at you. Your racist like do look. There's going to come a time. No, there's going to come a time where these people need to be punched in the fucking face. And that's real shit. Okay, because we've let we've let whiny crybaby temper tantrum throwing people who contribute nothing to society control the direction of our society. And it's ruining our society. How many kids stayed out of school for two years and now have learning disabilities because they couldn't watch the other kids speak because the mass. Like the social cues that are needed. It's all because of people like that. Yep, I was going to touch on that. We we came to America in October 20s. My my son's first two years at school was with a mask. He was threatened to get sent home on number occasions because he wanted to take his mask off because he couldn't breathe. One day he actually vomited in his mask took it off and then they sent him home. And so you know. And as you've touched on the children's a friend of ours their child has speech impediments. Yeah, as a base he has been paused for the last two years. Can't progress because they can't lip read their teachers. So as an adult, you know, I used to spend my time in special for the respirator on. So you know, I was used to it. But for these young children they just didn't know they couldn't understand body language. Is that teacher smiling at me? You know, there's so many things. I think yes, it's affected the children more, more serving the adults. But yeah, I think yeah, with yourself, I think everyone needs a punch. Yeah, dude reality man, like we have to stop allowing the weakest most uninformed, least contributing members society dictate the direction of the whole. Okay, we have to stop that. The tail has been wagging the dog long enough. All right, and these people who are continuing, they're actually showing themselves about who they are. These are the main and the main characters. Yes. Fuck, dude, I'm fucking over it. No, like dude, if someone says something to me about a fucking mask ever again in public, I'm punching you in the fucking mouth. And I don't care how much it costs me. I don't care if I go to jail. I don't fucking care. I don't care. Just want me to nowadays you'll be out in 24 hours. No, not me. You would be. Why is that Andy? It's the truth. I love it, man. Well, guys, let's get into this show, man. We got some really good headlines. I think it's gonna be a good one. So, you remember these people, remember the amount, like the amount of shit these people caused. Oh, yeah. That's why I'm saying like the pendulum swinging back. It's like, you know, you guys are talking about America. I came from the UK. We're on the UK in Scotland. We were only loud out one hour a day, one hour a day. Yeah, it's insane. We had to be within five miles of your home. If you're anywhere outside that you've arrested. So believe you're not coming to the US, even coming to California from UK was a positive. Well, bro, it wasn't just the US. It was a wild is there wasn't 17 firearms in every single American household. It would have been just like that or worse. Yeah, I'm sure. You know, like dude, these this shit is insane, dude. I'm tired of it. Like I'm real tired. I saw this video today of this dude on on TikTok. I forgot the guy's name, making fun of the sound of freedom movie and all the people that like it. I saw that you did was the Asian guy. I don't know. This was a big white guy. This guy was like Asian and he was like, you know, all you fucking right wing ass hats. You know, you you didn't give a fuck about these kids and kids. Kids engaged didn't even fucking happen, bro. And all I did. But it was under Obama. Well, it did. That's been fact check. It wasn't no. It didn't happen what they said happened. What they said happened was these kids were separated from the no they were held separate from their family to be interviewed to see if they were actually being trafficked or not. Then they were put back together like you're actually making the cause or the case for the movie being relevant in your argument with the kids. Like dude, these people just hear shit and repeat it. And dude, I don't know man. I'm just so tired of people who don't contribute anything society dictating the path of society. Like I'm fucking over it. Yeah. Let's get into this. And you mentioned the tolerant left. So I thought this would be a good first headline for headline number one. And number one reads black lawmaker flooded with racist hate mail after switching parties. Can we take a quick guess? Let's just let's just guest. What party this black lockmaker was in and where she is now. And where the hate's coming. Obviously because all Republicans are racist. She had to have been a Republican and she switched to Democrats with which nobody had Democrats or a racist at all. Right. They can't be racist. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right. Not at all. She enjoyed the state rep. Misha Maynard made headlines when she announced last week that she was leaving the Democratic party. And in the days since she has received a virtual title wave of hate mail. Much of it overtly racist and profane. Maynard shared some of the emails she received riddled with nasty language and racist epithets in a series of screenshots on Twitter. And so she left the Democratic party and now she's receiving hate from quote unquote tolerant Democrats. Correct. Correct. This is one email. So she captioned all of her tweets. She posts the picture of the email or the screenshot of the email and she captioned all the tweets saying, dear Democrats, sorry, you feel this is not a good thing. Here's one. So this is an email. Oh, this is wonderful. Oh, yeah. So it says very tolerant. Quote. I would like to help your black ass by telling you that saying you would support any candidate picked by the GOP during the primary is not only is is you live up to the word by just following blindly. Remember, you were a Democrat and felt abandoned to become Republican. And now you're going to follow blindly like you did with your party. You're the stain on society that needs to be flushed. I wish you the absolute worst in your political history. You Uncle Tom bitch. That's a go. It sounds like some of the stuff that you got the last three years. It does. Yeah, it does. Here's another one. So so basically this is like a survey, right? The people can respond to them assuming on their website. So like one of the questions that the survey asks is what concerns you? What are your priorities? And the person responded. It says quote, you dumb ass ain't Jemima motherfucking trader. I'm sorry. Yeah, this is fucking serious. Stop this serious. Fuck. We're starting. Sorry. Here, it's hard to believe how unhingeese people. Bro, bro. Okay, try to get. All right. Here we go. And these are the people. These are the people that lecture you on racism. You know what I'm saying? Like, okay, wait, okay. All right. You quote, I gotta make sure I say quote here. Okay. Quote. You dumb ass. I'm Jemima motherfucking trader. I will be sure to take a good chunk of my retirement savings, which is substantial. I'm sure. I will donate it to whoever it is that will be running against you. You self hating black. Dude. Oh, it's a new. Okay, listen, I'm willing to bet a thousand fucking dollars. That's a white person. That is a white liberal right in there because black people don't have retirement savings. That's wrong. But what does this big bro? What concerns you? What are your priorities? Quote. This bitch killing herself. How would you like to help convincing conservatives and their dipshit children to commit suicide as the greatest service one can offer to humanity? Hold on. Now make sure you have tolerance for these people. Gotta have time. Make sure you respect them. Make sure you take all the abuse that they give you. Make sure you let them, you know, do they're yelling and screaming in your face and public. Keep letting them do it. They have they have tolerance for you. This one quote you bitch. You need to get back on the plantation before massastacey whips show black ass into shape. You need to stop eating your fried chicken and watermelon with Vernon Jones and get back Miss Nat Turner. Right now. Now listen, these are just some of the emails right and she's she's mainly on Twitter. Yeah, she's posted these. So this is this is her. I'm opening for her. Do it absolutely is. Yeah. And what's even more eye opening is so this is her Twitter page. So if you guys want to go follow her, check out her page or post for yourself. She's also on Instagram. But she's been handling this very, very well. So this was the initial post that she made made on July 11. That's quote. My name is rep Misha Mayner. And today I made the decision to leave the Democrat party. I represent a blue district in the city of Atlanta. So this wasn't a political decision for me. It was a moral one. I will never apologize for being a black woman with a mind of my own. And she continues to go on. She says quote, I can do more for blacks as a Republican than I could as a Democrat. Hashtag stop selling dreams. What do Republican support? And she lays it out. She says educate the marginalized workforce training for marginalized victim rights over prosecutors, safe communities, Medicaid expansion for the pregnant, support small businesses, increased teacher salaries. Black people are in trouble as their population dwindles with perpetual minority status when poor leadership prevails. America is 50% white and each demographic considers their issue more important than their neighbor race realism puts food on the table while fantasy gets Democrats elected. Who's been saying that? What's that guy's name? I love it. She stopped selling dreams. Yeah, stop selling dreams. Is that not is she not saying exactly what we've said on the show. I mean, literally hundreds of times the promise where they come in every two years, every four years, promise to do all of the stuff and then go back to Washington or their state legislature and actively act against the interests of these communities to make it harder. So then they can continue to sell the dreams. I love that an actual elected politician. She's black is actually pointing this out. But call them a should out. This is the first time I've actually seen a real human being who is a part of our government actually point out what's going on. Yeah, yeah. And one thing that I love something like you said she she's seeing the you know she's seen the truth for what it is right. It's amazing. The amount of hate from our own party. But I also want to point out the positives and the benefits right because she has also been receiving overwhelming love and support from the alt right madra, maga ultra magas. Let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a question before you get into this. Have you ever got any any time you've ever gotten a message like that because I've seen a lot of you and you show me a lot of messages that you get. When when you get those messages who do they come. I would say well win. So we go back to say years ago. Do they know do they come from the left or do they come from the other off from the left. Have you ever ever ever gotten a message like that from the right. No. It's interesting that everything that the Democrats and the media matrix says the opposite is actually true. They say that they're the party against racism. Maybe you should consider that everything else they say the opposite is true about them. I mean it's crazy. But I mean it's been overwhelming love and support from from from from from the right. I mean these are some comments now this is on her Instagram page. But these are some comments on the most recent post. This comment says we need more people like this young lady in our government. I am not from Georgia. But if I were I would sure vote for her or this person. I'm glad you had the courage to do what your heart told you was right. I support you. Even if I'm not in Georgia. We need more people like you in government. This guy says I salute you young lady for being a voice for the children in Atlanta by putting children before politics. You stand out as courageous and principled. It's been overwhelming right now. This is a great great segment. I mean a great great screen shot into it. Okay. So you have a black woman up top. She says quote this black woman supports you right in the comment directly under it is a white liberal lady and she comments hashtag Misha Mena resign. You know it's just like come on man. Oh no dude it gives these white liberals a free pass to show what they're actually made it. It's a complete. They feel totally justified saying these racist remarks because they think in their heart and their mind that they stand with against racism. Yeah. It's it's insane. It's fucked up shit man. And like I mean like you said there's a lot of secret racism. You guys remember the video from the view with what's your name Osborne. They made that really really bad comment. Yeah. Yeah. Mexican people born at grass. Yeah we got it here. Trump is a lightning rod even when he's not there. Look what happened on the view today with guest co host Kelly Osborne. There are a lot of Latinos here in this country that do agree that the immigration problem is a problem and it does need to be addressed and it does need to be fixed. It's interesting. But making those comments those racist comments do not help. And if you if you kick every Latino out of this country then who is going to be cleaning your toilet Donald Trump. Oh, in the sense that you know what I mean, like what I'm saying. That's so fun to watch. They don't know. I don't mean I get that's exactly what you mean. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean what we got what we got on this guy. I think obviously you know from an outside looking at that. That's a powerful brave move. Those emails is panic from from the left because they know that she's probably right. And you know, let's put it started the miser of the left. You know, that's first time I've seen that one. The one that really stood out for me was talking about when she left the bar for that. You know, could all I'm hearing from the left is white noise. I don't know which weird of me, but all I'm trying to do is pick up spelling and grammar mistakes on the emails. And I would, you know, Bruce who sent his aunt is a capital A and I would have probably just sent that back or just independent and send it back. You know, that's that's me. That's what I think with this is just the fact that you know it's brave. It's powerful. And I think there's panic. And that's what I see. And I don't read no too much about the American policy. I think we're having now been in the US. I think it's very difficult. If you don't because there's only two parties. Right. And I know there's talk of potentially a third. No label. Is it they're on the belt. Yeah. There's libertarian as well. Yeah, libertarian. So like any UK we we have more than the two parties. So, you know, because here it seems if you don't agree with the left, you're racist. And it's not. It's not on racist. I just don't agree with the left. So, um, you're either one or the other. And there's no room for compromises, no room for debate. And if they don't agree with what you're saying or you don't bend over to their terms or what they're saying in your automatic racist. And so, um, you know, I think this, this amazement is a powerful move. And yeah, it's just panic. The panic, the panic comes from their terminology and their abuse not working. Okay. 10 years ago if you called someone racist, if you didn't call them racist, there was a big deal. Like you'd be like, well, wait a minute. Why do you say that? What? Let's work this out. That's not true. I blah blah blah. It could be real damage. Correct. Now it's a fucking joke. Because every white upper class liberal woman has used racism so much that it doesn't actually mean anything. No one cares. Dude, people don't care if you call them racism. Because it's looked at as like, you know, whatever dude, like it's like calling someone a douchebag or something. Right. No one cares. I love it. Right. No, it's to and meaningless. And that's a problem. Because in the cases of real racism, they're impossible to identify now. This is the same thing the me two movement did with me too. Right. Now we have, we had a scenario for many years where everybody, every woman who was on the left, who was white, had been sexually harassed in some way, shape or form. And now when people say that, no one listens like they used to listen. So you can't identify the real problems. And this is the damage that these kind of things do. And so the reason these people, in my opinion, that they're so panicked is because they don't know how to get any kind. They don't know how to defend themselves anymore because we've stopped caring. That's the same is not complying to the government. When you stop complying, you stop jumping when they say jump, they lose all the power. This is what I've been trying to tell you about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion. When you unplug yourself from the matrix and you become fit and able to provide for yourself and intelligent and surrounded by a good community. And you do all these things where you don't need them. And you don't jump when they tell you to jump, they don't have any power. It's all perceived power, but they have they can't do anything to you. The only thing they can do is they can call the police in to come in but do reality. A lot of the police are starting to wake up this stuff. We saw this at the end of COVID where a lot of the sheriff's departments were like, no, we're not going to be able to do this. We're not enforcing this anymore. This is insane. So these people as a whole are losing power day by day by day by day. Tell me the last win they've had. What's the last win they've had? You can't go, you can't find something that's happened recently. That's pro their side. All right. So their weapons no longer work. People are waking up and it's a great thing. Except how are we going to identify? The actual racism ever again. Because it doesn't mean anything to boy crowds. Well, right. And and and and do this does come from white people. This does come from white people on the left. And you know, if you want to look who the real races are. Look who the people who are overly concerned about race and everything that they talk about. Because the people I know in my life, they don't give a fuck about race. We don't talk about race. It's not really a thing. We might take jokes at each other about it. It's nice and lighthearted. I might have some questions about DJ about black culture. Like I don't understand like why why this or that. And vice versa. Like why do I put raisins in my fucking Right. He doesn't understand that. But the point is is that we learn from each other. We work together. And that's what creates a harmonious community. That has made America, you know, work. And I don't know, man. Like I think it's funny because I think a lot of these a lot of these far left white liberal women are being exposed. And they're being real. A lot of them are getting really quiet. Oh, yeah. Really quiet. The ones I know in my life. They have said shit in a long time, which I'm thankful for. Right. Thank you. Since you finally realized that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Thank you. Be quiet. Drink your fucking mimosa on Sunday at your brunch, where you talk about all this shit that you aren't going to do anything about that you think matters. And go do that shit and shut the fuck up. Let running the world happen between people who are actually informed, who are actually contributing, who are actually doing things in society to make society better. Besides fucking breathing air and crying racism. That's my that's my that's very. I also think the art of debate is also dying. Yeah. You know, everyone's sort of well that's a fault too. Fuck. Yeah. But it is like I'm quite open. You know, if I, you know, back in school, we used to have the art of debate. You used to have a debate. And you'd have people in that room from different backgrounds, different views. And I'd be quite open. And if someone changed my mind, I'd be like, okay, but no one can debate anymore. It's like if they don't like what you're saying is then it's aggressive. You're racist. You're a home. I think it's an attack. It's like, wow. If you heard what I'm actually trying to try to say to you. So the art of the bait is gone. And as you're saying with these middle age women as well, no, unfortunately social media is not helping that as well because their own their own information source is is that. No, and they got one leader in their little pack that kind of sets the sentiment they send them all to do it. And it's like when Aaron Elmar was on the podcast and she talked about they try to out liberal each other. Yep. That's what they do. So like that's why we see this thing in Hollywood where like the social circles where you have, you know, all all the sudden, all the sudden after 100 years, all the Hollywood actress have trans children. Right. Really? It just changed. I love them. And you know what they're, you know, what they're excuse for it is. Well, now people aren't afraid to be trans. They were still living in secret. No, they weren't. You made your kids that way. You've emotionally and mentally abused them into this for your own virtue. For your own comparison. Oh, you know what? My daughter's trans. Oh, really? Well, I have two trans sons. Oh, really? Well, I have three and they already have bottom surgery. You see, that's what's happening. And that's creating this, this, like, dude, these people belong in fucking jail. Oh, that's real shit. Yeah. That's real shit. Dean to your point too. I think another reason the debates have stopped is because these people like what's the most important part about a debate is being able to defend. They have no position. They can't defend what they're fucking arguing for because it's, it's undefendable. No, it's not only undefendable, bro. It's they, they don't even understand what they're saying. Yeah, they're just parroting shit. Women are women. What? Right? It's like, come on, man. Yeah, but see, here's the problem. All the fucking rest of the people, the 90% of the rest, that's us. Okay. Most of you guys don't say shit. You don't, you don't call them on their bullshit. You're afraid you think live and let live turn the other cheek. And these people use that turn the other cheek mentality against you. They understand that that's our mentality. They understand that we are going to live and let live. They understand that we want to be left alone, which is what gives them the confidence to push this shit on you because they know that nothing's going to happen to them because nothing has happened to them. If nothing has happened to them up until this point in time and they've yelled and screamed and people's faces and they've pushed their kids to have gender reassignment surgeries. What makes you think they're afraid of you at all? There's been no pushback at all. And then this is emboldening people. So like, dude, this is why we talk about people have to speak up and they have to tell the truth. And dude, the art of debate requires humility. It requires you to know that you don't know everything. So for you and I to sit down as men, you have a completely different life experience than I have. And vice versa. I already know that. So I know Dean's got a whole library of shit in his head that I have no fucking clue about and vice versa. We that's what men know. And dude, people because of social media have gotten to a point where like they think they know with certainty what the truth is when the reality is the truth is based on perspective, which is also based on fact. All right. So we can't just make up the reality for other people when other people haven't even experienced any reality in their whole entire life. So like, dude, it's it's this this debate. The ability to to converse and debate has I personally think the result. It's been the result of the dumbing down of people over the course of like 20 years, 30 years. You know, we don't teach people to say, oh, you know what? It's good to talk. It's good to debate. It's good to structure conversation. We what do we see everywhere? All we see is shouting down and canceling. This is this is this is the truth of society that we live in right now. If you have an opinion and this is goes for the right and the left. We see it on the right right now. If you have an opinion, now I will agree that I think most of the canceling that's going on on the right is kind of makes sense because they didn't really start canceling people until it got into the kid stuff. But we have this of this thing going on in culture. We're unless you tow the line. You're an outcast of the group thing. And I actually think it's a great thing to be the outcast of the group thing. I take pride in that. I don't like going along with what everybody says. Bro, if you got 10 people in a room and everybody's thinking the same, nobody's thinking. I mean, look, man. Well, the other art debate is actually listening as well. That's right. You know, and then people won't listen. As you said, they'll just scream and shout. And if they don't not happy with what you said, they just get louder. But as you said, you know, you need a diverse group. There's a great book called Rebel Ideas about actually if you have 10 people in a room and they're all from the same backgrounds, and they just think alike. And that was a problem with the CIA, pre 9 11. They're all middle age men from certain universities and didn't know how they all fought the same. And then post 9 11, they brought people different age group, different cultures. So everyone had a different opinion because they came from different backgrounds as well and can bring more to that group and to help them sort of think out of the books that they were in. So yeah, that's the, that's the idea to baton. Don't you guys think it's weird? How How people are so unwilling to state obvious facts anymore, even if they're like blatantly obvious, they're just afraid to state like you could walk into a room right now. At most universities and you could say, Leah Thomas is a real woman and fucking people with clap, they cheer. And it's not true. Like it's not it's fundamentally untrue. It's a fucking fact, dude. You see what I'm saying? Like, dude, this is this is where we're at in society is so messed up that I don't really see how I don't see how we're going to solve it. I just don't see how we're going to solve it because like dude, it's these people have pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed. And now that pen on this swinging back and they seem to not notice that too. Yeah, they seem to not notice it. Like you guys who scream this shit belong to the tiny minority of the left. The rest of the people in the whole entire world, they know that a six foot nine swimmer with a fucking dick is a dude. And they're not willing to pretend otherwise. They might not say anything because they don't want to cause a stir. They don't want to deal with your shit, which is the fundamental problem. That's the problem. The first time someone said it, they got away with it. The second time someone said it, they got away with it. The third time someone said it, they got away with it. More people joined them. More people joined them. More people joined them. Now we have this culture that has been propped up through the use of technology. They've created bot networks and propaganda and they've used Hollywood to make these these outliers of society seem like their main stream. And that's attracted more people to their movement, but it's still such a small percentage. And these people have been emboldened to believe that they are calling the shots and society at such a level that they fail to notice the pendulum swinging back. And that that creates a very dangerous situation for them. And I've called this out for years like like dude. I said, you could go back and probably find 20, 30 clips of me in 2019, 2020 saying dude, you guys on the left need to be real careful because this thing's going to swing back and it's going to be very dangerous, very dangerous. It's going to be very dangerous for you. And now it's getting very dangerous. And a lot of these people still don't notice. And like dude, it's only a matter of time before people are just fucking dumb with it. And these people start getting dealt with that. And I'm not saying go do that. I'm not calling for violence. But what I am saying is that I see that coming because these people refuse to like, they won't stop. And I think that's what the quote unquote powers that be the media, the government, I believe they want to incite violence by me rubbing this shit. Everybody's face as hard as they can so that they can impose the force of the United States government on the people to create a reading out of the resistance so they can continue to to oppress. That's what I think is going on. I think they're trying to pull out violence. And I think they're going to get it. We'll see man. Guys jumping on this conversation using hashtags. What's up. I was going to what you guys think down in the comments. Like dude, at the end of your life, you're going to have to ask yourself. Like, did you stand for the truth or were you a coward? You know, I'm saying I already know your answer. But I think I think going back to you all one, but you know, if I was, you know, those people in that room all clapping, did they all agree? Are they just clapping because they don't want to be. That's right. And now I think the second, I think there's two problems here. There's that that mess has been imposed on you. But also those that are not brave enough to stand up because I think as we just see now with that Georgia rep, you know, she was brave enough to move, move across and look at the those that obviously those that sent emails disagreeing, but Those that supported her was more overwhelming and that you know, that's the same. I think we just need more people to be vocal. Stand up for it. I think you're right. It's going to get to a point where I think a lot of the lot of people at the moment are just happy to look not happy, but they're just letting it go. And it's going to get to a point. And that's it. We're seeing it. We're seeing it now. We're going to get to see it. I saw it now. Yeah. I saw a video this morning. Of climate protesters, by the way, all white Sitting in traffic and this was over in Europe. Did you see this? Yeah, I didn't do it by the hair. Dude, the people started beating their ass. People are tired of it. Like dude, and you know what? Those people deserve to get their ass beat. This this passive aggressive, like I'm going to just peacefully impose my will. I'm going to glue my hands to the pavement and disrupt society and cut their fucking hands on Like dude, I'm fucking so sick of this shit and everybody else is too. Like so like That's my take. If I was in charge and it's probably a good thing. I'm not, but I'd be cutting their fucking hands off and leaving the hands in the concrete to remind people. Don't fucking do that. That's what I would be doing for seller 2024 bitch. I think we're at that stage now where it's got to a point. No, even Coming from the military. It's having an effect on the US military, the recruitment and people are, you know, so that's one of the One of the best things about the US one of their proudest things is the military when you start messing with that people are enough enough to enough I think do you think that they're intentionally? I mean you have a more global viewpoint than what DJ and I have. Yeah, I mean you see us from the outside and the inside. Yeah Do you think that there's an intentional demoralization around the United States military to make the enemy make us look weaker so that other people feel emboldened? Yeah, well, you know, I don't think I don't think Putin would have done what he did if he didn't think that and I don't think China would be, you know sailing around Taiwan at the moment either so I think there needs to be a change, you know, America is the super force still is the super force, I think but that But that comes with action. You can't just have the equipment and not do anything with it, you know, I mean so Work the equipment who's gonna use it. Yeah, who's gonna use it? I you know I don't know. There was a survey years ago and it was like the top 10s um Spends in defense and you had America's number one. I mean he had no the next nine friends UK Russia, you know China You know you accumulate those other nine still didn't touch what the Americans had But you know, there's no point in having that if you're not gonna not gonna use it. You know the America is the superpower You know written go alongside America you you are a nation who can change what's going on in the world But you just don't have a commander in chief who knows what he's doing with his chess chessboard and that's the problem Well, maybe he does you know, is he doing it on purpose? But it's having a negative effect. It's having a negative effect on recruiting no, you know Now guys and gills don't want to join because you know, they've been told they've got to wear masks Who would send their kids or who would encourage their children to join the military to fight for these motherfuckers? I wouldn't now by the way The best the best point of that whole segment is what Dean said this woman's brave This is what we need this is the right thing to do and it would be nice if other people would join along We have a lot of cowards in this country, bro a lot more than what what I thought there were Guys, let's show move we got headline number two Michigan Muslim City Council fires HR commissioners for flying LGBTQ pride flag on public property Well, that's a fucking win. I think that's a fucking win. Yeah, I think that's a win Flag should fly on public property is the American flag. That's funny. You say that because that's exactly what they said Well, that's because it's common sense makes sense to me So you pay that That's public property that means you I and the rest of the 90% of common sense Americans pay for that Do you want that flag flying? Do you want any other flag flying? How about the communist flag? Let's fly that Let's know we fly the fucking American flag Real shit, man So this white bar news article reads the all Muslim City Council and ham track Michigan has fired two human relation commissioners After they flew the LGBTQ pride flag on public property in violation of a recent law banning such flags As bright bar news reported in June the all Muslim City Council voted unanimously On Tuesday to approve a resolution that would ban the LGBTQ plus pride flag From being flown on the city's public properties Reports at the resolution proposed by mayor pro temp Muhammad Hassan also bars any religious Ethnic racial political or sexual orientation group flags from being flown on the city property and only allows the American flag to be flown along with the state and city flags Other national flags and the prisoner of war flag The law did not specifically single out LGBTQ community members with the Saan and the city council Even saying that such people are wholly welcome in the city of ham track Which had primarily been run by Polish Catholics until recent years Less than a month after initiating the ban Russ Gordon and Kathy stack pool Were removed from the ham track human relations commission after they flew the LGBT pride flag Over a public sidewalk for several hours The two members of ham track human rights commission were removed Tuesday This is just an inner report. The city confirmed police were investigating the protest Sunday where Russ Gordon chair of the human relations commission And Katrina stack pool remember raised the pride flag on a city's flag pool along Josh Kampur Near Nebel Street the flag was taken down about two hours later by an unidentified person stack pool said um and it's not just there. I mean Uh for some reason I know the reason that it's not just for some reason but the Muslim community in America standing up against this shit Um, we saw this happen. This was a couple of months ago Um or about a month ago this headline reads watch fights outside California school board meeting over LGBTQ curriculum Here's a quick video So in this video you got these LGBT supporters A line of police officers and then probably hundreds of Americans that are not with the shit American flags They're trying to keep them separated. There was definitely a few uh, this is largely Muslim largely Muslim. Yeah I saw this I mean dude. It's great. Yeah now This is not just an American issue. It's happened all over the in a few westernized places, right? But it's funny because what do they always resort to when anybody stands up and tell these you know tell these People that belong to this community. No leave our children alone. What do they call them? Right wing Nazis right? Yeah, of course. It's funny because that's exactly what Justin Trudeau just called Uh Muslims in Canada Uh, say I reshustin Trudeau blames American right wing for Muslims opposing LGBTQ curriculum. Leave our kids alone Um, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blamed the American right wing for Canadian Muslims opposition to gender ideology and LBGTQ curriculum in K through 12 education The video was of Trudeau speaking with the Muslim community last week at Calgary, Mos Uh, Batoon, Normaus after hundreds of protesters rallied against gender ideology and schools chanting leave our kids alone. Here's a video Do whatever you want to do It's beautiful to see the starting uh, starting to go up but um What uh Trudeau said he says quote if you look at various curriculums there is not aggressive teaching or conversion of kids into being LGBT That is something that is being weaponized by people of the far right who have consistently stood against Muslim rights It's funny. He pointed out exactly what I was gonna say Um, it's interesting that you know things come full circle because 20 years ago The right wing was the same people saying let's go kill all the people in the Middle East because they're fucking terrorists Right, all right, so what's actually happened here is that Muslims and Christians are starting to understand what's actually going on Which is the delusion of moral standard across the globe By a certain group of people and at this shins going to end it's going to end because Muslims and Christians and whites and blacks are going to get together which is their biggest fear This is why they propagate all this anti white anti black racism between the two groups and the same with Christians and Muslims They've done it for years and years and years Most people when they think of Muslims in America they think like terrorists because that's what the media has built The image to be here, all right, they've been lied to and by the way I was one of those people that was lied to I was one of those people back in 2002 that said fucking let's fucking kill them all Like that was my mentality because I had just watched what happened here and at 9.11. I was 20 Years old. I didn't know that much shit. Okay, and I believe the news All right, so they made it seem like Muslims were all bad people and the reality is Muslims are actually great people Who have a high moral standard who generally stand for peace and they just don't tolerate any shit I actually love it. I think it sounds great They're way more aggressive than Christians are and Christians do this turn the other cheek shit that gets us in this What that man said was the wrong message Did you hear him he was saying all we want to do is be left alone do whatever you want? No, it's not do whatever you want That's the entire issue with the message They when we when we say do whatever you want they take it to this extreme They've already shown that they can't be trusted to respect other cultures or other viewpoints or other moral standards And this is not gay people. This is communist Okay, communists have infiltrated the gay community and using it as their weapon to try to demoralize and remove moral standard from society Is that Trojan horse correct? So so there's a lot of very good Upstanding Great contributing members of society who happen to be homosexual Whether they're gay or whether they're lesbian or whichever who are now getting wrapped into this this uh this Fight that don't don't even want to be in it. You know, it's it's it's sucks, dude I think going back to your one about the Muslims again. It's the propaganda with the news You know when we chatted last time is Some of the stuff I've done I've worked all over the milleys and probably the probably the most hospitable Uh group of people I've ever met and but a perfect example again of bravery And why is it the Muslim community are saying no to the The LGBTQ flag? Why are we waiting on them doing it? It should have been said before But I think if they didn't do that and they Those two will uh left to their own devices to keep it raised then what messages is that promote to other states That would just then have that waterfall effect. So I think that that was great But one of the great things about The US is the diversity that you know, I'm an immigrant. I'm an alien immigrant So uh, but I can come here and but what they what the Muslim community are doing is they're not saying You're not trying to push the Quran into the curriculum all they're saying is don't push LGBTQ Want to ask that's right? You know, 10 10 15 years ago They were set the the right wing was saying that Muslims were trying to push the Quran in community And do Sharia law and like they scared everybody and dude you have to now you look at what's going on And you wonder why have they intentionally made Christians and Muslims enemies and in propaganda Why have they intentionally made black people and white people not like each other over and over and over Those are the two messages that we've heard more than ever Over the last 20 years that should cause a little bit of a light bulb to go off and everybody's head like why Why do they want us to hate each other? Well the reason they want us to hate each other is because if all of us The Muslim and the Christians and the white people and the black people got together They are totally but and they know that so like maybe We should all heed the advice of one of the greatest Americans ever Martin Luther King and say We judge people on the content of their character not on the color of their skin because if we just automatically all flip that over And just look past the other shit If we would realize that we're all on the same team and we're being manipulated to not like each other for the gain of these people It's dangerous man And like dude we have to admit things like that we were wrong about like dude What I said just a minute ago about being wrong about Muslims like dude real talk like I was the dude who was like I'm so sick of this shit Dude, I don't even care what happens. I don't care if they're innocent. I don't care. Fuck him do it That's what I thought You know what I'm saying but like dude that's the amount of anger that they They like do propagated listen man. I remember a 9-11 When it happened, okay, and This is what makes me think that 9-11 really honestly could have been an organized Terrorism by the governments together for sure. I'm not saying it is, but like there's a lot of evidence to points to that direction You know, I'm not trying to assault anybody, but it should be a question that we ask because I can remember because I was 20 or let's say $2. I would like 22, okay When that happened I was I was an adult. I understood I can remember very clearly the day that happened It wasn't like it's a foggy memory and here's what they showed on the news dude They kept showing the plane fly in and they kept showing the the people jumping out of the tower on TV And then you know what they showed right after that over and over and over and over again They showed people in the Middle East celebrating Over and over and over these small groups. We're not talking about Thousand fill we're not talking about streets filled with a million people celebrating We're talking about maybe 50 to 100 people dancing in the streets And they show these two clips one after another one after another one after another and as someone who cares about America and bro Most Americans bought it most Americans were like fuck them right and what was it for What are they actually accomplished in the 20-year war that went after that Nothing they all made a bunch of money. They caused a bunch of death and destruction and nothing really came of it And so I was manipulating I understand what that was like because I hated those people. I hated them Okay, but then I grew up and I realized oh dude This isn't actually true This is this is wrong and see we have a whole bunch of people in the country Who are unwilling to have that conversation with themselves Like what do you believe That you actually think you believe that you actually know and if we're honest about it We don't really know very little yes And so do we have to be able to have these these These humble and honest Examinations of our own opinions Like do you think that Men are women and women are men like do you really think that? Do you think that it's okay for a kid who's You know at any age. I don't care what age for them to to to to irreparably mutilate their body Do you think it's okay for kids that are in second and third grade to be reading books that have sexually explicit material in them? Do you think it's okay for Certain ideologies to be forced down someone's throat no matter what they personally believe like If we if we're all honest with that most people say no, I don't believe that But we're afraid to say those things because of the social pressure that's created Where there'd be a work or whether it be on the internet or whether and part of the internet social pressure has been Manufacture which what what was what exposed by the Twitter files? Where they were using the FBI and the social media companies were colluding with empty accounts fake accounts Boosting up these narratives and then suppressing through censorship the narratives that opposed it and that created an optic that The common sense people were way outnumbered so everybody got quiet because they were scared So like do we're living in this illusion and it's just To me my perspective is slowly the curtains coming up and people starting to see this is not actual thing And a lot of people are saying oh the pendulum swinging back I actually don't think the pendulum swinging back. I don't think the pendulum ever swung over there in the first place I think it's all manufactured bro. I think people were just afraid because they thought they were the only one thinks that So I don't know man. It's frustrating though. Yeah, I think you're right. I mean it's the the fear of unification There has to be division that people have to It causes divisions and people have to be hating each other The whites the blacks the yellows the blues they can't get on well with each other the Muslims the Christians They can't but if we actually dig got air and well then we've then look up so back in history what now back with the kings and queens of the 1600s That's what they used to do in their in their course is that they they would cause divisions because if they unified They would then start looking up towards the tower Today man is very similar with the governments is they don't want you looking up And so what they do is they start causing divisions on the ground and then more that you can keep you occupied and entertained Fill you with propaganda, you know, you're not gonna then start looking up start questioning what's going on above and that's that's the fear And I mean you're right. I think it's gonna get to a point where and we've seen it. That's why I think it's great that the Muslim community Did stand up. Yes, they don't agree. I know back in Some releasing countries. It's illegal, you know to be gay, but they understand that they're in in America They're not saying it is illegal. They're saying just don't fly the flag on a do you know why it's illegal It's part of the I don't know why it's illegal, but you know, it's any certain countries as well But again, it's these countries. Do you think it's illegal maybe because they maybe have I don't know their their civilization is much older than ours I mean, maybe they've actually dealt with this before maybe they actually realized that when you start to let This start to happen This is what happens what we're dealing with now Yeah, I don't mean so much illegal, but it's in public illegal. I mean a lot that goes on behind closed doors But yeah, and that's what happens is when it's pushed in your face is when you've got a man in a dress You know, I mean with a dig. Yeah, I think listen dude. I think gay people really fuck themselves, bro By allowing the shit to get out of hand Like because now we're in a situation where you're gonna be able to convince regular Americans to like Fuckin be like no fucking no gay I think it's gonna make I think it's gonna make the whole LGB movement It's regressed at 50 years. Yeah, and I don't think that's okay. I don't think that's right Bro, what you're gonna see is your story in more than 19 Maybe maybe like let's say 2014 15 Bro We were kind of in a good spot like everybody like gay people had the same rights and privileges that everybody else had And they kept pushing and they kept pushing and they kept pushing and it became not the same But I want privilege over that and now we're in a situation where you have people who five six years ago Would have been like yeah, now I'm gonna fuck they're like no, do you keep that shit away from me? And like dude, that's the that's the social momentum swinging back Maybe going back in the closet row it sucks. It sucks because I know a ton of like gay people who are Completely amazing human beings like top to bottom. You know what I'm saying? They don't agree with any of this stuff that's going on with the kids and now they're gonna suffer the backlash You know because of this shit This is why I like what gaze against groomers is doing so much Um Where it's a community of people who are gay. It's a dude. We're not with this You know, that's important. That's an important movement because it shows people that You know, this isn't actually a gay movement. This is actually a hijacked movement by Far left. I would say Marxist or communist ideology that is being used to weaponize and introduce social initiatives that align with Marxism and communism You know, it's it's to re- Bro, that's I just sound like a broken record. I think the two communities is damaged You'd write your touch on their DJs is the is the gay the gay community and the fact that you know for years they've been trying to To get themselves to a point and and and they did and then the trend the trends are sort of just bolted onto that And then as you said the gay community like they're not part of our community But they're having a huge damage and effect on them and I do feel for them and also as we said before the women Yeah, it's affecting the women the women have been fighting the years and years for the rights. I mean all of a sudden Where are the women standing up against us? You see what I'm saying like like dude The women like you guys you guys have fucked yourselves like you you advocated for this trans shit to the point where now You have grown men competing in sports erasing you from athletics, okay, like it wasn't already hard enough to get people to watch women sports now I can promise you no one's tuning in to watch a dude beat a bunch of girls No one's tuning in, okay? So they worked this entire time title nine all these women's rights all of this stuff and and then and then women started advocating and this is the same class of women We spoke about earlier in the show It's the class of women who are middle upper class white women from the suburbs who do not have a care in the world Who do pinky up every Sunday and Saturday brunch who don't have shit going on in their lives who have caused this And we're erasing women from reality Went trans women are not women. They are trans women if they were if they were women you would not say trans in front of it It's not for you. You know what I'm saying like they're saying wouldn't even exist You know, oh, I'm non-binary. Well that makes you binary because either way you're either Binary or not by now Like it's just this it's this it's such mental gymnastics and like dude This goes into feminism right like All these women for the last 10 years that have been like oh, I'm a boss bitch You know I can do whatever a man can do and I can do this and that look man Now you have a situation where all of those same women are all can't find a good man I can't find any men to talk to me. Well, yeah, because first of all all the men that you Labeled as toxic masculinity like they're for they don't want they don't want you what you got They don't want anything to do with you. Secondly, you're left with all these like little Soy boy pussies, okay, that you don't like and then you're complaining when you created the problem Like you guys created the problem you villainized masculine men and now you're complaining that there's no masculine men You went for the little Leonardo de caprio looking boy looking dudes So because you could boss him around and you could run their shit because you're a boss bitch And now you're in a situation where you're unhappy you can't find a man and you don't know why and the reason why is through your own Manipulation these people have put on you feminism was a weapon no different than Silent majorities of weapon no different the cancel cultures of weapon no different than then political correctness is a weapon These are all social weapons, okay, and you guys fell for it And so if women if you want men to be masculine again and stand up you gotta start calling for it You guys start saying it hey, I'm not interested in these little fucking boys. I want a real man You start calling for that men will become men again That's shaman on this conversation. Let us know where you stand guys. Let's get to our third and final headline headline number three figure We check in on our presidential candidates here um Number three reads man rfk jr says COVID may have been ethnically targeted to spare Jews Now the internet And listen all you motherfuckers in the comments calm down relax. All right It's it let's just get let's get into it because I got the video Uh, so democratic presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr Dished out wild COVID-19 conspiracy theories this week Uh, during a press event at an upper east side restaurant claiming the bug was a genetically engineered bio weapon That may have been quote ethnically targeted to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people here's the video And you know, it's that what we the technology that we now have to develop these micro We have we've put hundreds of millions dollars into ethnically targeted micro The Chinese don't say anything In fact Hope in 19 there's an argument that it is ethnically targeted How the 19 attack certain races Disapportion the The races that are most immune to come in 19 are because of the structure of the The genetic structure I'm sure druff genetic differentials on different races Of the of the receptors Of the a-stubed sector um COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and and Black people The people are most immune are ask and articles and and Chinese And but we don't know the purpose really targeted that or not But there are papers out there that show the you know the The racial and ethnic differential and of the impact for that We do know that the Chinese are spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing We are developing ethnic bio-weapons that's where all those labs in the Ukraine Hurt out there collecting Russian DNA. They're collecting Chinese DNA Though we can target people by race What hey what Listen bro, this just backs up all he's doing is actually Well you go ahead and move on. Yeah, and I mean dude is Yeah, he's repeating data based upon who was affected versus who wasn't affected And then he's explaining the science behind it and now all the sudden it's you know He's a raging anti-Semite mm-hmm like bro people are tired of what's going on in the world and they're looking for who's doing it And I don't think that the idea of who's doing it should be left off the table that you can't criticize certain racial or ethnic ethnic groups For doing bad things just because they're a member of that group as we've discussed on the show many many times Every single racial and ethnic background has evil people within it and this is interesting and what I think here is Really really smart of RFK is he's and what I think he's doing is I think he's figured out a a Soft way of pointing out the truth which demographics are responsible for producing COVID-19, okay? So Now you have this scenario and people don't realize this but you have this scenario amongst the Jewish community where This particular sect of Jewish people that he's talking about are Are being attacked by other Jewish people because other Jewish people are saying yeah actually Those are the motherfuckers in charge and they are the ones calling the play and they are the ones doing this I think there's a good question go. I mean, I'm just saying like maybe we should be asking those questions You know like is he telling the truth because it sounds like he's repeating actual verified data about the statistics that COVID-19 Actually produced and data guys no matter what is not racist data is data Okay, it's no different than pointing out the crime data in the black communities like that's not racist to point out if we ever want to solve problems No matter what the problems are We have to be able to look at the data now. I'm no scientist and I'm certainly not uh You know well spoken on this area of expertise of you know what he's talking about But I think it's a question worth asking yeah, is he telling the truth? Because all I know for the last Five four years three years is that everything that's outside the norm is conspiracy theory Wow, conspiracy is I mean Doesn't it seem like the more wild the conspiracy theory that they claim the the more true it actually becomes I remember when the Hunter Biden laptop was a conspiracy Wow conspiracy theory so much so that the newspapers wouldn't even publish it I remember when the Russia Trump collusion was a conspiracy theory. Yeah I think obviously he's in a position now where he can't be censored is that right? So he's this is his platform and you know Where where where he's getting the information? You know he's using his platform to get out because I think if he doesn't say it then I think that's exactly what he's doing. Yeah, I think he knows that he can't win the election I think he I think he's running on a campaign of exposure Yeah, I think he ran for president so that he could get the news coverage to expose what he think is going on Yeah, he knows there's no way the the DNC's gonna So if he wasn't running for president and he said this shit nobody would even talking about I actually think he's being very smart about the way he's presenting information Yeah, the only thing only a hiccup that I got with uh with with with RFK is that He like okay, so that's great. We obviously know he's very very staunch on the vaccine um world right because he's very vocal on that um And maybe this goes to your point. I don't know, but I mean I would like they they uh they pressed them on uh On the Biden family corruptions And he's he said quote won't be a spirit tip to my campaign. I he's not even trying to address it and it's just like I don't know. I mean, but but if the goal was to just be simply exposure Maybe this is a below the line issue to him. I don't know But I feel like I don't think that hunter Biden Um Doing cocaine and being a degenerate degenerate is more below the line than a certain population of people They're targeted from a targeting another population of people I mean he's talking about targeted genocide. That's real. That's a much bigger thing than someone doing cocaine off of or putting skittles on his boner You know saying like yeah, that's what you know like dude the guys are fucking weirdo But like the point is yeah is like I think he's talking about the above the line big picture issue then People are not even talking about and he's just trying to put it out in a way that's gonna be Paladins because after he said this and then in the media spun it He actually printed a clarification tweet which many people Said was a retraction. It wasn't a retraction. He just restated that he's observing the data that He's and do stood wrote a book on this. I mean you wrote a fucking big book too about covid and And doctor Fauci and um You know My take is the same as yours brother like I think he's using his position to to start conversations that need to be had Yeah, I mean his tactics great as well, you know, I think they probably would Want him to start you know talking about the Biden family and the laptop. Yeah, like everyone else's But he's not he's not going down that route. He's got his own tactics. He's got his own message and I think you know for me I I'm paying a lot of attention to to him And because it doesn't he doesn't sound like the others as well. He's not you know using Whatever else is sort of saying about the Biden laptop and now he's attacking opponents Yeah, it's a big thing. He's not doing the other thing is this people are like well, I like RFK, but he's anti-gun Well, if he's running as a Democrat Democrats are traditionally pro gun control So if you think about it from a strategy standpoint if he actually wants to reach the people that he can reach He has to appear to to believe in what they believe He's gonna follow through. That's right. Yeah, I don't think he knows he's not gonna be president I don't think he intends to be present. I think this is all about disclosure and this is all about exposing the truth Yeah, and I think he's doing it in a very smart way How dude before he even said this and before Kanye you couldn't even say anything about Jewish people It was worse than saying anything about black people worse. Yeah Okay, like you couldn't even say anything about it and You know dude, it's like I've been saying it's not all Jewish people. That's an ineffective argument Like these people who just keep saying it's the Jews You're you're putting it's like beating your own dick with a hammer like you're trying to you're you're no it really is Like you're trying to point something out that you're ineffective at communicating and here's a guy who's communicating more effectively You understand yeah, like dude, we cannot generalize entire groups of humans into their ethnic or religious backgrounds and that's That's low level thinking. It's low IQ thinking like of course there's going to be bad people who happen to be white of course There's going to be bad people who happen to be black and of course there's going to be bad people that happen to be Jewish And because just because you call someone anti-Semite Doesn't really mean shit like I think people are to the point where they're like dude We're gonna find who out we're gonna find out who's calling the play and pulling strings here Yeah, and you know it's a big deal who can't you criticize? You ever want to find out who's calling the shots figure out who you can't criticize And it's his messaging damaging to the Democrat pides it help in the Republicans or is what he's saying You know Swain more to the Republicans and the Democrats or I don't know because I mean I think right now what we have I mean, I guess here in America is this uniparty. So I mean, I don't know if it's really damaging I think going back to the earlier point man. I think he I think I think it's just exposure Because this uniparty that we have going on like yeah, we got Republicans and Democrats but like Truth is like they're all together. Like like like it's establishment politics and I don't really know if it's definitely detrimental to that for sure. I don't know if it's we're one side of the other More heavy on I think it's just That's like the fact he's not scared to be quite vocal. Oh, you know, I mean he doesn't I know there's been concerns of farmer and you know, I know his His security his family security is he's gonna be a bit tight and now you know, you know history He speaks for itself, but uh, you know, I don't but me look I mean I don't know I'm afraid of these people Don't shut me down guys. I was a third and final headline. Join the conversation the comments hashtag. He said what Uh, time for a good segment. We got thumbs up with dumb as fuck. This is where we bring article up We'll get one of those two Options and with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads Sailor and dog amazingly survive on rainwater raw fish while a drift for two months Modern day castaway Uh, so an Australian man has been rescued in the Pacific wonder what his pronouns are Yeah Well, I mean, that's super essential to this survival story Very important you call him a man and he's not actually a man. He couldn't even survive. No, I mean that's he should probably suit You should probably go to jail. Yeah. Yeah, that's true There's an Australian man has been rescued in the Pacific after surviving for two months on rainwater and raw fish and what has been likened to the film castaway But his companion was a dog not a handprinted volleyball Sydney resident Tim Shadok a 51-year-old cancer survivor and his pooch Bella set off from La Paz, Mexico and April On a catamaran journey to French Polynesia, but their vessel was damaged in a storm several weeks later Australia's nine news reported here is the video of when they Rescue Tim okay, gonna get your name please Tim Shadok okay He looks a little bit worse for wear, but he's alive Sydney man Tim Shadok and his dog Bella Sife yeah, so the parish survived by drinking rainwater and eating raw fish as they waited for a miracle while the drift in the Pacific on Wednesday A helicopter conducting surveillance for a tuna troller spotted the tiny catamaran bobbing in the middle of the vast ocean Mike Tipton an ocean survival expert a tribute shadok's endurance to a quote combination of luck and skill Quote and also knowing for example as Tim did that during the heat of the day You need to protect yourself because the last thing you want when you're in danger of becoming dehydrated This to be sweating he told the outlet A Timton set Shadok was able to secure a fresh supply of water thanks to the climate and location Quote these voyages of any great length tend to occur in the Pacific he said If you look back through history, they tend to occur in warm environments because if it was a cold environment You don't survive long enough Shadok worked in the IT industry before retiring and looking for a new challenge for instance, telegraph Quote he's got a bit of money He gets bored and does new things and pal said about 20 years ago Shadok survived bowel cancer after periods of fasting and eating a diet of raw food the outlet noted quote But my health was at a critical stage it involved a lot of fasting juicing and smoothies Shadok told the website the raw food kitchen Quote I recall spending over three months living solely on green vegetable juice at one stage Shadok will now need to slowly return to a normal diet after his meager offerings at sea Quote It has uh Quote it has to be a slow return to normal and he will probably need to be kept an eye on for several months tipton So Guys what have we got on this I think for me I always look at how he managed to get into that situation It's two months and no one's actually realized he's gone missing You know if I was to plan something like that I would let people know my route Um, you know, you'd have on a boat is called an e-purb which gives off a a signal So I think a bit of a dumbass to get in that position, but Bums up for managing to survive Um, but um Yeah, that's that's be my question is it did no one miss him um, you know, the fact that he's obviously used to fasting helped him Um, I don't mean I would last a two months. I would have eaten a dog um, you know, and use that Do the dog actually know for real I caught that too Yeah, and you say maybe get some bait for fish. That's what I'm thinking. I don't think I could eat Well, like I think I'd rather just die with the dog. I just couldn't do it There's no way if it was my dog, bro Eminent survivor, you know, you could use the dog meat as bait and then go fishing Yeah, there's plenty of ways you could you could survive, but that's my first questions Well, as before you go on these things Being hot on getting some on our speed and pass something here Was a speed pass something here I think The roof roof now. I mean the dog's gone Well, it depends on what situation. I mean, you know, where you know, I mean, it's that it's an option But I would probably look at using the dog as bait first and then going with it with the fish, but worst case scenario I couldn't do it dude. I don't know I'm not built for that shit. That's why I don't do that kind of shit I've just I've just been out in Malaysia we went on a Got involved in a with air special for just on a survival exercise They do it in the swamps and they catch monitor lizards they catch pythons and no, we just witnessed it then if you're hungry enough You will eat, you know, you don't know what you're What you're capable of doing until you're in that in that situation, but obviously I think for him the dog was more Dog looks pretty healthy Yeah, but also, you know that kept your sanity as well, so I think that was the purpose of keeping the dog, but I think yeah Maybe the dumbass that he went and didn't actually have some type of backup. Yeah backup plan communication Let people know where he's going and you know, so he wouldn't have been as long as two months Dude, I just don't have that sense like this kind of sense of adventure that no, bro Is this black people stuff? Fuck no, all right. I'm just serious. Like this is the only ever see why people do shit like this You listen, I'm just saying you don't ever you really don't ever see anybody what white people doing this bro You ever seen black people die in the hot air balloon crash? No, no, I don't do that shit We don't do that ever see this is why I think I'm like you're right legitimately like A substantial percentage of myself is black. Yeah, because there's no chance. I'm doing that shit storm chasing it ain't happening No, I would do now the storm. I like to watch the storm, but I'm not chasing this one. I ain't chasing shit I mean I'll go outside and people think that's awesome. I said I'll say yeah, but that's just a Midwest that's Midwest Yeah, people people on the like when I go outside and it's storming I put it on the Instagram people are like, what are you doing? I'm like bro. This is cool. Yeah Midwest, but like when it gets real bad, I'm staying home. Yeah, right going after it now, you know, I don't know man What do you I mean yeah, no, I mean to me I think obviously thumbs up because you survived. Oh, yeah I mean no doubt about that, but I mean I think there's definitely some Now I could see Dean doing shit Like like you've lived an adventurous life like whatever this guy has in him. Yeah, you have a Like you did the the bicycle, you know that that reminds me of this in a more sane way, right? Like I'm being I'm I'm being totally honest dude because like I don't have this in like this thing of like the adventure boat No, like I don't I would rather eat a really nice steak and like potato and like Be healthy and like live in my nice house. I like I don't know like I never had I don't maybe I'm maybe it's me, but like what is it that like makes you want to do these big giant things? um I don't I think for me is just keeping yourself You have to have a goal. You have to have an object. I think in life if you if you stop then you know Bit of an acknowledgement my father he retired at ages 67 six months late in the day, you know, I mean, I just think that once you stop your body's like a river needs to keep flowing. Yeah, you need to need to keep moving as soon as you support should become stagnant You know, it's like those ponds you get you get illness um I just think for me. I've I've set the bar high and the problem I find is if I don't Hit the next bar then I'm not pushing myself um, I think yeah, would I think the the poor The poor planning here was selecting your team, you know, if I was gonna go sailing across You know from Australia Polynesian. I wouldn't take a dog You know dogs not gonna help me with the with the mast, you know, I mean it and so And so things things like I don't see that as a problem if you have the right team the right training right planning Uh stuff, but I I get asked that a lot though. What is it dry? What is your motivation? I generally don't have An answer for it, you know, I've been there some in you. I mean, it's just something in you I think you know, I did the bike ride because You know to stop myself smuggling people across borders and my wife was like you need to change Your lifestyle you need to do something that keeps you physically And mentally engaged so that's what that was for me and then it's like well what next and when I finished the bike ride First thing people said what next I'm not really. I've just come the first man in history to cycle I'd never cycle in that the world man. Yeah, and it's like, you know, they're already looking for the next the next thing as well so um, I don't know, I think it's part of it's it's in you um, but I do I also am conscious that You know, I've I've lived the great life of it. I've been in dangerous situations And I do believe your time is your time Um, and so I don't really get worried about things like that because I've been in more dangerous situations and I come out there and I've lost a lot of friends who aren't with me today And so it's like, you know, that doesn't worry me um, that source stuff for me, dude It's not a danger like it's not like oh, I might die. It's like I would just avoid that Like that's There's zero risk of me dying in the ocean if I don't go to the ocean. I don't know man like I don't know. I guess it's just different Objectives and different ways of being wired and I appreciate all of yeah, I think it's cool like the stuff that Like what you did and like other guys do when they do these amazing Like we got Jeff Spire running across America right now like that's cool shit. Yeah, but like for me personally Like it's hard enough for me to run my life, bro I'm just trying to like become a functional human in my own wife. Yeah, it's really and Everything I do is to be better at what I do and so I don't know I could admire that But it's just something that I've never I just I just don't understand it. That's what I'm curious about I did it to You know to keep myself physically mentally engaged I didn't realize the enormity of the challenge that we raised 1.3 million dollars which went to 11 mental health charities Which was great which helped no thousands of thousands of people, but then it was the waterfall effect afterwards that people Who'd never cycle before never ran before picked up some trainers and then decided to get there's a good ripple There's a good ripple effect and that's what I liked and that's why I sort of you know my wife gets upset in the fact They were sort of overlooked that I'd never cycle before then Yeah, smash the wheel record it was almost expected because you're in the special forces Yeah, you know, I'm still not a cyclist, you know, we're still human beings and so if I can inspire other people then that's what I do and and for me it gives me something to to to train for As well and to aim for and I'd like to I've sort of fallen into that that category of One-inch inspire people and one-inch to prove that anything's possible You know, and I think for me it's that I take a sport. I've never done before Which upsets a lot of sport in communities, but then Message-wise or other people is that you never too late to start a start sport I'm not just start them be good at it, you know, I started cycling at the age of 40 Smash the wheel record of 41 The most people are retiring at that point is that well, I'm just I'm just starting so So yeah, there's a numerous reasons why I do it. I get that aspect. Yeah, that aspect. I totally yeah It's such a good example. There's a positive ripple effect. Yeah, I totally get that point And like as you said it I like to be the outcast. I like to be the underdog. Yeah, I like the people I don't I don't listen to the naysay as it's just like well, what's this? I want to do this. Yeah, what's this space and then and then yeah, yeah, that's what I like is that you know When my sponsored marketing did the SWOT analysis, you know the only weakness it came that was my arrogance towards the cycling community Which I took as a strength But you know, maybe lucky no one ever ever said that but um for me, I sort of got that I know I'm 46 now You know, I could have a legacy now that my children be proud of but I think I've still got a few more years in me yet To sort rewrite the history books and you know, I'm in the right mindset and and everything I do No, everything from the military from the bite right.
