Now you guys might recognize Josh from a number of different places number one the bachelor Right, but also I think you're more recognized for You know Bachelor at star Josh Cider says he faked Transgenderism to expose gullible and delusional woke left. Do you see this? Yeah, I told you this guy was faking We were watching his videos in here and I was like that guy's full of shit. Oh, he's fake. He's trolling. Did we really see? Yeah, I mean Guys great. He's fucking awesome being a you know, you were once a Regular normal man and then you became trans now your D transisting right I did I did I see trans or trans trans which is valid and it needs to be recognized Which is I tried it for a temporary period of time and decided it wasn't for me and If they don't respect it there a big it I agree Who says you have to stick with something you know like like not being trans and then you would be trans you switch back That's the whole thing. Yeah, yeah, do whatever you know It's all subjective. It's all fluid. We make it up. It's our own personal identity There's no rules to it. So yeah, we can be anything we want. Yeah, I mean the thing is just like how far can we push these boundaries? You know I'm saying like if we're taking something so fundamental Right, I mean all right. Well, I identify as a 35 year old white man with a good credit score That would be I think it's valid you know I'm saying like You know all those fucking you know chargebacks. That's not me. Yeah, you know, I'm saying like no, I don't claim it You know like I mean like what what point how long did you do this like how long? Yeah, let's get into this like yeah, let's start at the beginning what Because dude obviously the entire internet site and they it was very polarizing right people people had There was a lot of people that believed it. There was a lot of people that were like I don't know and now it's come out that You know it was a troll and you were doing it to prove a point Talk about how this came about and like what the idea was and you know what made you go far with it Yeah, so I actually had a injury from lifting too heavy so I herniated my Lower back and saw stuck in bed for weeks Um, and I was just laying there and I was like man I want to do something productive while I can't move But what can I do from here? It's like well, I have a pretty big following on social media So you know me and my friends have always been Libertarian with a conservative bent I would say on most issues and I was getting really sick and tired of seeing Trance stuff not anyone can be trans it doesn't matter no one cares if you're trans We only care when you start putting it in little kids school books and talking to little kids about it But if you want to put on a dress no one gives a shit Um, but I was getting really sick of how far it was going in so I said I want to do something about this I want to speak out against it and my friend goes dude you say anything they're gonna get canceled They're just gonna say you're a bigot and a trans phobia can't get around that said well If I infiltrate them One of them and then Disprove it from the inside by showing It to be the utter mockery that it is then I can destroy it like a mole From the inside and if anyone criticizes anything I do all call them a bigot in the trans phobia And he's like actually that's fucking brilliant And so I go let's do it and that's how it started So did you guys just decide like to Like make our internet post and that was just how you started it? Yeah, I said you know what dude I'm I said I want a rage bait. So what will piss people off the most and he goes Don't shave your facial hair And I go yeah, that's really gonna piss people off. I'm gonna keep all my chest hair all my facial hair And so yeah, I just you know grab some Went to the thrift store and grabbed a bunch of outfits and threw on this was one of my earlier posts in the bikini And just started saying I'm a woman now and it kind of took off from there. So So how many people knew this was not Not real like did your family know or did people know or did Did like where they call you up? Yeah, so I would say people that know me very very well had an idea But I was still getting those texts like dude what hey, man. I didn't know what you're going through I'm not sure if this is real if it is I hey, I just want to say I support you man But if it's not please tell me and I usually wouldn't respond to any texts if it was outside my family or a few really close friends So I would say about 5 to 8 people knew the truth and then others I'm sure guest that it wasn't real but I never explicitly told them it wasn't But I was very careful. I never once in those five and a half months answered a DM or provided clarification to anyone And I was getting thousands of messages saying is this real or is it a troll? Probably tens of thousands and I never applied to a single one. Yeah, no paper trail. Yep. What was the initial Temperature from from the actual trans community. I was in a septum set day one like how did that How did that develop? That's a great question. It was pretty split So there was about half the trans community. That was like this is amazing I always knew that you were trans and all like Where the hell is this coming from You know Josh I saw this coming. I even had an old guy who used to book me. I was a dancer a male exotic dancer You know a long time ago and uh, he said hey texted me. Hey Josh I always always knew this and I'm just so so proud of you for Embracing the true you and I wanted to say dude are you fucking stupid? But I was just like hey, thanks man And then I'd say half the community the trans community was hyper critical and it almost it's because I made them look bad But they make themselves look bad because we're all men pretending to be women and so we have facial hair and body hair Unless we get it lasered off and so a lot of the comments from the trans community was you're making us look bad You need to shave and you need to dress better. Oh, so you need to stop breaking code and then I would magically yeah You know a woman apparently if I took a razor to my face. That's how it works um, but I just said it's not not the dick in the Yeah, I said hey the guidelines say that I don't have to shave they say it can present however I want I can present masculine every single day All that matters is my gender identities different than my biological sex and you can't criticize it take it up with the Science and they never had an answer to them So dude, let me ask you this so As this started to materialize Did it change your views on The trans community in general or How cuz like what I observe and what we've observed over the net we've been very critical of in the same thing that you said By the way, I'll give a shit if someone wants to be trans. I really don't I don't care how any adult wants to live their life It matters nothing to me changes nothing the problem is when we start forcing on to other people Enforcing it into places that it doesn't belong and That's where my criticism of it comes from Was that something that Ever came up from the outside to you whereas like people who are anti-trans were hitting you Up saying you know, hey, what the fuck are you doing? You know that I did I got a lot of hate from people that were like this is not okay What you're doing is an abomination Most of it though. I made a lot of posts saying oh, I use the women's restroom And I'm tutoring young women today and things that I always did something that had already been said by a trans person before So I never did something they haven't already done But I would use some of those themes and say it and so most of the comments Against me were centered around you know, I don't give a shit what you're if you want to be trans But you better not be using the bathroom with my daughter or teaching this to little kids or hey I saw your posts saying that a child came up to you while you're working out at the park and you told him He could be trans one day you're fucking sick for that and so understandably they were pissed off because my posts were Pretty in raging. Yeah, intentionally Intentionally and it was intentionally meant to shine a light on how ridiculous this shit is That's it's a very deep undercover mission man. I respect it I respect it It was in raging, but like you just said never doing something they haven't already done I was playing by their playbook within the medical guidelines the entire time in the scientific literature I never broke those guidelines about what it says you have to do to be trans Which is very vague and ridiculous um, but yeah, I wanted to expose it for how harmful and dangerous it is And I think that it it worked because at the end of the day they can say I'm I'm not real. I'm not I'm faking They're pretending trans women are pretending to be women their men pretending to be women I'm a man that pretended to be a woman So are you saying I'm a fake faker? Are you saying I'm a pretend pretender? We're all biological men Pretending to be women and I hope when you look in the mirror trans person you see my reflection I hope that you see that you are just a man in makeup trying to be a woman and you'll never be a real one Well, that's why they didn't like it because you're holding up a mirror that they have to look at right It's okay if I do it, but it's not okay if someone else does it and especially if you're shining a light on how Ridiculous what I'm doing is you know, what's the backlash been after you came out and said like hey, this is a troll came out again again After you detransition It's actually been tons of support from Lightsay libertarian and right-leaning people I get thousands of messages now Saying you know not all heroes wear capes. Thank you for what you did I have three daughters and I'm so scared of the world. They're gonna live in given where gender ideology is going from the bottom of my heart I just want to thank you for shining a light on how harmful this ideology is So I've just been getting a lot of support jk rolin retweeted my reveal South grover who is one of the people at the forefront of of the movement against trans ideology Has you know shine the light on what I did and so I've just had a Tristan Tate Was one of my first supporters that came out had me on his podcast on rumble and is just been Amazing and in my corner so it's actually been overwhelming and then being able to come here and do this with you guys So it's been a lot of support But I've also gotten backlash from the trans community. There's people that were like I thought you were serious How dare you you're faking it the whole time and if I respond I just go well then that makes two of us. Yeah That's exactly I do What what was like the final start like what made you in did like what was was there? Was it just the time was it a specific like thing that happened that like I this is enough. Alright, let me stop You know what I'm saying? That's a great question. So I have a really thick skin So I was getting tens of thousands of comments on my post because they were all getting hundreds of thousands and millions of views And so I was reading them and they don't really affect me But over time by like the four fifth month mark just seeing these comments like you're fucking Disgusting. I hate what you're doing this and that it kind of started to weigh on me But I had set out all along to run it for about five or six months So that's when it was gonna end regardless of what was going on And then I just decided you know what I could do a reveal with Alex Stein I think that would be really interesting So it just felt natural That it was time to kind of bring it to an end because my buddy kept saying Josh you need to do the reveal soon because don't forget the whole reason you did this Is to expose how Bad this ideology is so at some point we need to do that and you need to reveal hey This was a troll and I wanted to just expose it for what it is and so I was like, you know what at the end of the day that principle Is what I kind of want to get out there which is that hey we need to have a dialogue in a conversation about Gender ideology and where it's going and I could only do that once I revealed it was such what what do you think about it and where it's going and and What do you think the most damaging part is after you know, this is something you obviously care about we care about it as well I got two daughters. Yeah, it's important to me. Yeah, I think it's multifaceted I think women and children are kind of the two main things that I think about they are trans women specifically I don't care so much about trans men Biological females that are transitioning the men because what they're doing does not really threaten anyone because they're in a space of biological Males that they can't threaten because they're biological males now on the other side with trans women We're dealing with biological males going into female spaces. So that's where my concern is more so than with trans men um, and so you know, they're pushing women in a racing women Um, they're pushing women out of spaces that have historically been safe spaces bathrooms restrooms college sports It's really getting to a point they're stealing trophies from women though report just came out 900 trophies were taken from women by biological males this over the last year. I mean that's saying. Yeah, it's insane and so And then with them doing Drake story hour and pushing their stuff into little kids books and in the curriculum at schools It's now being They're trying to brainwash our kids and so between the kids and what they're doing to women It's gotten to a point where I feel like they will they need to be stopped I mean, it's bad. Yeah, it's interesting because what you said about trans men versus trans women You know, there is an intimidation of physicality factor that real Biological women can't really resist and that's where the problem comes in we also if we really Examined what's going on here. We don't see women who are now men. I guess trans men Wanting to read books at little kids events. That's a great point You know, we don't see that shit and what we do see is fucking weirdo men dressing up as women Wanting to be naked and strip dance and all kinds of weird shit in front of little kids Which is very clearly some sort of pedophilia Infiltrating that movement so they can get close to kids. Why aren't they at old folks homes reading old folks Why aren't they at high school classes reading to high school because they only place that they really want to be is around these kids And that's something that we don't see from trans men you never see it you never see a woman who's become a man and living a life as a man saying I need to go read to little bit of kids And I need to dress provocatively and I need to they don't do that So what we have in my opinion is an infiltration of pedophilia into the trans movement Um And it's not a little bit of it. It's a lot of it. I think that's a big big issue That's a great point in auto-guinephilia is a sexual fetish where men get turned on at the thought of themselves being women I would argue that a lot if not a majority of trans women are just Dealing with auto-guinephilia their men that get turned on at the thought of themselves being women good No one gives a shit if you want to wink it and address at your house Nobody cares, but the fact that they have infiltrated female spaces and lower education and higher education and like you said they're now doing drag shows in front of little kids It's ridiculous and that's at the point where we go We don't care if you have some sexual fetish. You're dealing with in private Don't bring that over to my dog my five-year-old daughter while she's trying to learn something in school I mean, it's just gotten to such Ridiculous degrees that it's what do you think it's a lot? What do you think it's caused that just just passivity amongst everybody else? I think passivity has been responsible for how much it's grown and metastasized But I think it's being actively pushed by these people within the community that like you said are either pedophiles Or they have a sexual fetish and for some reason the media lets them get away with it and doesn't just aid them They abet them in it and for some reason are politicians because they want to keep getting elected and they don't want to be canceled And they don't want to lose votes and they all know that lgbtqIA Lobby is a cut throat one that will you know cancel them or go after them publicly if they don't go along with they basically the lgbtq lobby is holding the politicians hostage. That's why I think politicians are going along with it Why the media goes along with it? I don't know but all of them combined they have been able to get to this point where they're now writing children's books talking about it in front of children and Having drag shows for little kids and it's absolutely Minemaking that people are okay with it and like you said very interesting you never see trans men doing any of this stuff Which tells you it's obviously just a sexual fetish of men and they've been able to get away with it Yeah, you know one of my biggest frustrations too is like where where are the feminists that Well, so there are a lot of what have been labeled terps Transexclusionary radical feminists, which is a slur and that is a label given to people like jk rolling who really are just normal feminists that understand The realities of biological sex and they are totally against this and speak out against it all the time I mean jk rolling is constantly raising awareness that these are men invading our spaces In taking over and it's not okay and it goes against everything that the feminist movement has worked for and stood for up until this point so the Radical feminists are totally against it what you have is the liberal feminists and liberal feminism says no Genders fluid anyone can be a woman. It's okay. We need to accept them There is no equality until you accept trans women into the movement then people like jk rolling go there are men Right that goes against the movement so the patriarchy Fuck the patriarchy, you know, it's like hey And that's what radical feminists say is it's all about male hegemony and patriarchy when you have biological men in Batyne our spaces So the liberal feminists have blood on their hands and the fact that they are okay with men Erasing women out of sports and scholarships and invading their spaces and restrooms and locker rooms is disgusting I said the same thing you said I said I don't know how any self-respecting feminists can stay silent and not speak up about men There's no sense man Well, it's because they don't believe what they say they believe that's just reality dude feminists I know there's feminists out there I have friends that are feminists who claim to be feminists. I respect them. I like them. They're my friends But the reality is is most of the shit they say is total bullshit The truth is really look at feminists then they are you can't fucking be a feminist and support Trans men and women's fucking spaces can do it you can't be a feminist and support Men winning trophies from women you can't be a feminist and support a political party that can't identify What a woman is and supports these causes if you are a feminist and you support that you are full of shit That is just the bottom line If you're an actual feminist you would be in support of these women protecting their spaces You would be supporting the party that actually protects women's rights instead of this bullshit bogus statement of Donald Trump's gonna take away all women's rights. That's not even true. That's a fucking Democrat talking point We took the abortion Law and we put it to the state level and if you live in a state that has limitations on that then maybe you should consider Opening up an organization in your own state or moving states or figuring out where you fit in these these things Are not in support of women and so they've got it backwards, dude. It's really really frustrating And a lot of feminists recognize what you're saying and actually are uh fleeing the Democrat party precisely because yes, good the you know what they call the Terps or the radical feminist like jk rolling sal grover They are sick and tired of Democrats allowing Transidentified men to come into their spaces and so now they have left the Democratic party and I'm proud of them for doing that Yes, they recognize exactly what you said these people are not for us and they're not supporting what we want or women's rights If they're allowing men to come into our spaces and bro I can res I can respect anybody's point of view if they actually live it You know what I mean? What I can't respect is these people who are pretending to be feminists and then supporting the same old shit Because it's very very damaging to what's to women in general I mean and many many different ways starting at little girls all the way up to grown women So that's good to hear bro. Yeah, that's man I think where where this stuff gets crazy And I want to bring this this article there before we get to our main headlines You know like I said you did a five and a half six months Social experiment is what I would call it You know, but the thing is like some people just don't understand and they're so deep into it And then they start bringing in the the legal ramifications and you know threatening lawsuits and things like this. How did you guys see this? Trans woman sues hooters after they refuse to hire I'm not surprised, but now I have not seen that This just came out a transgender woman is suing a hooters franchise for discrimination after they allegedly refuse to hire her based on her image Brandy Livingston are probably Brandon Uh as a one a regular at the restaurant famed for its scantily clad waitresses on Wolf Road and collunia suburb of Albany in New York Uh with career aspirations of working for the chain Livingston Uh had applied three times for listings which were all unsuccessful according to him Speaking with news 10 Livingston said he was not respected as a woman at the establishment alleging that workers actively Distributed against them. She told he told the outlet quote they would use male pronouns and they would refer to me as he Um on him being a not employment. He added I said do you want to see my experience or anything because I had previous jobs I had written down and he said oh we don't care about experience We hire on the basis of personality and there's an image that needs to be met Livingston said uh That he had also heard employees and a manager at the restaurant harass him about using their restroom I mean just a bunch of stuff, you know Now everybody knows the who to girls they're they're traditional. I think it's a staple of American culture almost Um These are hooters and uh this is a holler Well I can't have the beard. You don't have the beard though. I can't imagine why this person to get hired to be a hooter If they were a real woman they wouldn't get hired Bro, we have standards like So so so what did we first of all this dude's in New York so he's probably gonna win this shit maybe which is bullshit Well, he got some protesters out, bro. There's a lot of comedy if it was Three people yep, it's all fucking old white people And I hate the trans women are women They're not their males that are in costume and that doesn't make them women And I hate that the article keeps referring to him as her. Yeah, she she it's not it's a man Pretending to be a woman and it basically the headline should read man pretending to be woman mad that hooters recognized He's a man. I mean that there's no story here It's a man that wants to be a woman that's not sorry you have a mental illness I'm sorry that you might be suffering from gender dysphoria, which is a mental illness But don't make your mental illness our truth, right? I hate that they're constantly trying to make their problems Our truth and just because you think your woman doesn't Meingly have to recognize it. Well the roots of this go back all the way to communist, you know uh 1930s vimar republic in germany like this is not the first time this has happened and When we look at communist ideology the the first thing that has to happen is destabilization Which is the erosion of truth and identity So if you can get a person to Admit that a man is a woman and a woman is a man. There's really nothing you can't convince them of It's a fundamental truth that we all know from the time we were born, right? Um, and that's what this really has to do with and these people who are mentally ill are getting caught up in a political cultural revolution that's happening You don't know it. No, they don't know. They're they're actually Yeah, they're actually victims of ideological subversion is what's happening there pawns Yeah, for sure. That's exactly what it is and it's fucking sad dude like I can understand how you would be frustrated that when you walk around people don't you know go along with you But you have to understand too that when people fundamentally deny things that they know are true we ourselves lower Our own belief in our own integrity our own self-esteem because we know we're lying to ourselves Right, and that's not ever talked about that's not ever considered so while I can appreciate That you want to be respected you have to appreciate that there is a truth and you are not within the bounds of the truth You and we and by the way, I think most people are okay with someone living their own life Like you said Josh like if you want to wear a dress in the house or if you want to wear a dress out of the house Cool, I don't give a shit But you're not going to demand that I call you a certain thing You're not going to demand that you're fucking represented in front of our kids You're not going to demand that books teach little kids how to cut off their penises and shit We're not fucking doing it And that's that So when you when you guys in the trans community look at it and you say oh there's so much hate The reality is you're bringing it on yourself by forcing people to go along with what it is that you think is true Which we all know isn't you know, it's it's bullying is what it is They're not they're demanding that we all cause cause play with them They're demanding that we all participate in their live action role playing Yeah, you can larp as much as you want But you can't demand that me and my kids actively participating you're aligning They've taken it to a whole new level and I always draw the analogy of an anorexic person What you are just saying they're allowed to be whatever they want if they want to be trans and throw on address fine If someone wants to be anorexic you can be anorexic in America Can you imagine though if anorexic people went around demanding that every time they came near a sweet clapped and said Yes, yeah, you are fat at 80 pounds. Yeah, get more liposuction No, we're like they're mentally ill. They're allowed to believe that their fat at 80 pounds We're not required to play along with it same with a schizophrenic person It's you can be schizophrenic if you want and you don't have to get treatment for it You can think the CIA put a camera in your toilet But we don't have to go along with it We don't have to go yes the CIA is chasing you this morning And yes, they're right behind you and they that's the equivalent of what trans Specifically trans women are doing is they're saying it's not enough that you just allow us to be who we want You have to actively participate in a firm our delusions and that's where we draw bro And not only that How unhealthy is that like If I had something wrong with me I wouldn't want people to point the fuck out and be like bro This like you're anorexic which clearly I'm not but like you know You're not either motherfucker All right So I wrote your laugh at But if I was you know and people were You know we we are an empathetic Helpful Carrying society contrary to what these people say and when we look at that From someone who's based in reality. It's very clear that we can see this person has something mentally wrong with them And yeah, dude and you see what I'm saying I mean even on even on the the the the health care side of things right like Uh, I love psychology right like that's where I made you it in and like nowhere in there right. I mean we went through abnormal psychology We talked about the BSM we went through all of the stuff nowhere in there was there ever a conversation about affirming This like a affirmation care is it's new. It's not like this Imagine somebody that is anorexic right they go into to sit down with a psychologist and the fucking psychology Say you know what you are and the shelves this fucking fingers down this third. Let me help you out a little bit Like you don't do that. I know anorexic is where they start or believing. Yeah, you know I'm saying but like you Let's say let's try this hard. Let's say somebody comes in you know believe. No, we're not restarting. God damn it. Yeah But you know I'm saying like like the doctor's not gonna like help her fucking throw up You know I'm saying like but like that's what they're doing in these cases of the trans stuff It makes zero fucking sense. It's reinforcement and empower and and you don't do that is something that's totally unhealthy now I mean even then we talk about this too right because they're bro Why is it that all these trans dudes dress as like little girls and shit? Yeah, okay, they're not dressed so you don't see them dressed up like classy women They're dressed like fucking strippers. They're dressed like little girls. What what does that fucking tell you? There's a heavy sexual component to it and JK Rowling just made a a tweet about this and she goes You know they're fake women when every single outfit they have is is trashy lingerie type thing They think being a woman is acting a feminine and making their voice higher and prancing around in little tiny dresses That's that shows you that they're fake women because real women That's not what being a real woman is they think it's this weird view of femininity and only a man a deranged man Would think that being a woman is throwing on a tiny little dress and making their voice higher Did you guys see that In exchange between Ben Shapiro and that trans man So there's a good example of that what you just said Josh in that interview when that person walks up and goes to sit down turns the chair around backwards and sits in it No fucking man does that it's never I'll have a man in the history of my entire life has someone run up And thrown a fucking chair around backwards and sat in and be like so what's up dude? I'm a man like that's not what But see what we're looking at is a woman's interpretation Man is supposed to be advise versus yeah correct correct and dude that's it's very easy to recognize from the outside But those people can't recognize it themselves like why the fuck are all these grown men in their 50s who are trans wearing strawberry shortcake outfits and shit What who's that famous trans guy that's on the internet Jeffrey Marsha that guy straight up pedophile You know Dude you couldn't convince me otherwise check it's hard to ask this dude was on the fucking internet the other day talking about how If you parents are voting for Donald Trump then you should not talk to your parents anymore tell kids that Yeah, like dude and this person's always dressed in like little kid like Where have we gotten in society where we're allowing people who are very likely fucking pedophiles dude to have direct communication with our fucking kids And a prerequisite of being a trans woman is your mentally ill you have to have so they're mentally ill pedophilic yeah, but bro like when in society we start accepting pedophiles communicating with our fucking children out in the open that's fucking wrong dude and it needs to be fucking stock I mean, that's I think that just proves a point like the fact that we have to normalize when you have to normalize some in a normal Is that re-educated I keep seeing the spark people need to be re-educated and some kids might need to be no Your ideology is bullshit if you need to re-educate us and they're trying to get it little kids because they know no thinking sentient adult is gonna accept the absurd Proposition that a man can just magically become a woman because he throws a dress on so they're like fuck We can't get adults to go along with this. It's too absurd So we got to get them while they're young before their brains have fully developed which is complete fucking predator behavior Yeah And you never see trans men like you said doing this stuff. You never see trans men going after little kids No, they just want to live their lives from what I can tell which by the way I have no problem with at all nobody does Think I don't think anyone cares Anyway, yeah, man, you ready to use some cruising you want some drums or flats to be hard huh? What who does you say drums all that's be hard I want drummies. I'm a drummy guy You're probably a flat guy. I'm a drum guy. Okay. Yeah, I'm a drum more meat. Yeah, I agree. Who does wings are good bro? I don't care. I'm all I've had them. I've had them in the wild. Would you still eat there if she was your leader? No See, bro, that's how I thought it was real bro Like who does used to be like a plus yeah, and now it's like Got some work to do. Mm-hmm. You know, I don't know how to say that nicely You know, at least they are standing Protect them and I fucking old the old America where it was like we celebrated hot people that look good and shit like it's got to loot it Did you see that I want to I want that to come back Did you see the Abercrombie doc where it was basically two hours? He's a Netflix doc in their mad that Abercrombie wasn't hiring obese and unattract it's like the whole Brand is about this thing Why would they hire people who weren't that thing? What is wrong with that if their ideal is Attractive skinny muscular people what's wrong with that? Why are you forcing them over how about this if you want to be a part of it get your fucking fat ass in the fucking gym It's not being like shit. We're gonna start your own shit Hey, did you have to work to be a shape? Yeah, damn right 20 some year 22 years now. I gotta work my fucking ass off to be in shape I wasn't gifted with this I was born a fat little chubby fucking Meatball, okay, like I had to work really hard to be in shape So I'm sorry that you haven't done that work and you don't get the opportunities. That's it like Nobody wants to see some fat fucking a fucking Fucking Abercrombie in underwear or whatever. I feel like that's why people and society is getting more unattractive If I just look I have when I step out in Chicago and I just look it's so unattractive now compared to 15 years ago And I moved there and that's because there's no incentive to Take care of yourself because we reward people when they're fat with the whole body positivity Yeah, and we punish people like Abercrombie when they demand high, you know Expectations and so I just feel like all the incentives now run in the wrong direction. We don't reward hard work Like what's funny, dude, it's funny because they say that Everybody says that But it's still the people that do those things and the winning it's still the people who train hard and look good they fucking And work hard at their job that do well that's still it like they're not those people aren't losing They're winning even bigger because the other people have lowered their standards so much So in my opinion I think the opportunity to win is the best it's ever been because the fucking standard is so low amongst the everybody else You know, it's normal the reason that people try to normalize quote unquote Being obese is because they're obese and they want it to be okay And they want to like feel good, but I'm gonna tell you as someone who's been fucking heavily overweight I was 350 fucking pounds, bro I'm gonna there's no amount of bullshit you could tell yourself There's no amount of lies you could tell yourself there's no amount of affirmations you can tell yourself That are gonna make you feel good and make you feel attractive. It's not reality. It's just not and I've been there I know what that's like. I know what it's like to not want to go to a pool because I was fucking fat I know what it's like to not want to go on vacation because I was fucking fat. I know what it's like to wear the same clothes fucking Six days out of the week because I thought it hid how fat I was like I I understand all that you can't be happy With yourself when you're going through that battle. It's just not reality And people think they're fooling people like when they say oh, I love myself Even Lizzo had to lose all the weight because she didn't love herself. That's right, bro And that was her whole thing. Yeah, her whole thing was I love myself. Well clearly not Clearly you love all of it So at a hospital in Champaign Urbana where I grew up a hospital put out an announcement It was in our local paper the news Gazette and it said We are either getting rid of scales or there is I believe it was a sign above all the scales at the hospital That said the number on the scale is not a judgment It's just a number and it doesn't mean that you're doing a bad job. Why Would you tell morbidly obese people that the number on the scale doesn't matter I mean that's basically what it was saying was it doesn't matter. It's not wrong or right. It's just a number No, it's not it's an indication of whether you're healthy or not and you're just harm same with the trans movement By lying to these people you're just harming them or you think you're helping them You just want to virtue signal you only care about yourself. You just want brownie points If you really cared about the trans person you would tell them they're delusional and they should get treatment No matter what they do they can't become a woman But there's treatment out there If you really cared about the overweight person you would tell him that number matters And here's the way you can bring that number down These people don't care about the people they claim to care about they only care about looking good and virtue signaling And that's why I can't stand them and it gets put down through the health organizations because it makes for money It makes money The patient who's completely healthy or the patient who's 500 pounds that you tell the number doesn't matter who's worth more or Means to be on pro hormones for the next four exactly bro It's the same thing with trans there's too much money to be made these people want people sick They want people fat. They want people uneducated so that they can make money off of them It's it's no different than Honestly livestock that's what it is man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments I just know what you guys think That being said, let's get into our headlines man. Let's start let's start cruising I would remember guys if you want to see any of these headlines these articles pictures links videos Go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them all link there So that being said, let's get it to our first headlines for the number one Um We're all trash apparently Of course, that's fine. Like Biden brands Trump supporters garbage So he did this on a zoom call and It pissed a lot of people off, but there's some interesting things that that have happened since this came out So I want to play the original clip. This is from Biden. This is the zoom call of him calling Trump supporters garbage Let's check it out Our Puerto Rico where I'm in my home state of Delaware They're good decent honorable people the only garbage I see floating out there is your supporters Is his demonization of citizen is unconstitutional and it's un-american Yeah, so that was the comment and obviously they were talking about the Tony Hitchcliffe situation The Madison Square Garden Where he was referring to the trash issue the actual trash issue That's in Puerto Rico Kind of flew over the heads of some people, but that's fine But this was a Biden's comeback. Obviously. He's not in the best state of mind Hasn't been but it's funny to see the You know the the scramble to try to clean this situation up So you have the White House they they attempted to alter The garbage dig at Trump supporters. So one of his staffers Said quote the president referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as garbage White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in the statement. They also absolutely not what he said. It's not where he said it all Don't believe your lying eyes. Yeah, I mean that's literally George Orwell. Yeah, fucking nice Yeah, and obviously they're gonna have the media that you know jump in on the bandwagon Politico was probably the biggest proponent of this They had an article that was written by a Jonathan Lamire He says quote Biden in a zoom call with the organization Voto Latino Said the only garbage was the quote hatred of Trump supporters who said such things about American citizens He literally said his only garbage is his supporters. I mean, that's what he said they take it out And but that's what they do now Biden did release a an update Statement trying to clarify this himself or whoever his staffer was the holds his Twitter account But he said quote earlier today. I refer to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump Trump supporters at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage Which is the only word I can think of to describe it his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable That's all I meant to say the comments at the rally don't reflect who we are as a nation Um, and then then you started biting kids at a white house Halloween event Did you guys see this? I did see that He was biting biting people's kids There is listen There is no chance What the fuck no chance I would ever Ever Allow my kids to do if you were holding your kid and this dude came up put his nasty. I wouldn't be brother I would I wouldn't there's no chance. I would ever fucking have my kids anywhere around he has escalated from sniffing to bite My kids, bro. It's very old. Oh, there's another one. I didn't know that. Oh, there's three I thought it was just the turkey leg one That's weird shit, bro. He clearly has to mention. I mean, I he he's out of his mind. Yeah, he can't even talk He's out man. He's out and you know, but but why not what I thought was the most the best thing about all of this This garbage nonsense Is it's trumps response It's all of this it was fucking magic. It was magic check this headline out watch Donald Trump rides garbage truck to Wisconsin rally 250 million people are not garbage So former president Trump wrote in the garbage truck on Wednesday to his Wisconsin rally in response to president Joe Biden's trashing millions of Americans as garbage So as soon as they landed in Wisconsin, this was the view on the tarmac Giant Trump garbage truck rolling up. I love how they took the time to get it all the way low-goat and like 24 hours Well probably probably had to like you know make some reinforcements to You know put some bulletproof panels and shit in there as well. I'm sure I've ever said a fun time This was a trump getting off the plane getting off Trump for one Hello everybody. This is Donald Trump and 250 million people are not garbage So let's go take out the trash. This is uh, this is what he had to say in the truck. How do you like my garbage truck? This truck is an honor of Kamala and Joe Biden He's just like dude. I fucking love I need four years of this I The truck looks brand new. It does look brand new You can he bought it probably he probably did campaign probably Yeah, cuz I don't know I mean it didn't I don't think there was any markings as far as like the company It's so now bro he fucked he said buy me a trash truck and they went out got it. I'm gonna try to sound like yeah I just love it. I because it's funny because I feel like for like the last year Trump has really like Tone down the trolling comments and shit, you know But I feel like we're back at action bro. This is just good pivoting. I love it. I love it He took a great fucking that was a great opportunity. He did not miss one You know, I think it's important for us to discuss this in a serious sense, you know obviously Biden's insane, but There's part of me to think he did that shit on purpose because he hates Kamala so much. I keep hearing that yeah I've been hearing that man. Yeah, that's a very real. I can see that Possibility um, I'm not sure what the body is saying that it's important You know, did you guys see Kamala's speech out in front of the capital or the White House or whatever she did the other night One of the things she said over and over and over again, you know, she called Trump a Nazi and she called his supporters Nazis over and over and over And I think it's very important for people to connect the dots on what's being said there because it's not just some insane shit You guys have to understand that when they stand up there in front of the entire world and they say some really confusing shit that makes no sense They're actually making that clip for the future, okay? So what they're trying to do is they're trying to create The history that they want to be told 10 years from now just like when Biden went out over in Belgium And he came out and said, uh, you know, we need to get rid of Pluton basically saying we need to assess Call for the success and then all of a sudden there was all these attacks like that shooting that happened in Russia or the drone attack and all these things So when we look at and I would I think people should really think about this and I think it's because I think it's very dangerous When we look at what Kamala Harris says and what Joe Biden say They're telling the truth about what they think of you and I and anybody else that supports Trump And I think it's important to understand that the reason they're saying Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi Is not because they're trying to just enrage people It's actually because they're trying to set a narrative for what they plan on doing to remove those people from society and justify their actions moving forward so Just think about that because there's plenty of examples of them doing this like when January 6th Anniversary came and they were standing on the steps with a candlelight visual and doing like this big CNN production or when Biden came out in front of the red and black setting and basic red lights and shred of Donald Trump and all his supporters They're trying to create the narrative that Donald Trump and his supporters are actual Nazis that are going to have to be dealt with in an Anyway possible so that they can justify any actions they take in the future So it's not just like inflammatory rhetoric that they're saying because they're losing This is they're they're tipping the card to what their plan is so that the history is recorded a certain way And I think it's very important that people understand that they're playing 40 chess then because they're rewriting history Not in the future but as the history is happening and they have an assist from the media who you constantly see do this where they'll have a farce false narrative about something And like we said earlier basically say don't believe your lying eyes and they'll say oh this happened and you're sitting there watching the news And you're like that's not what happened But now it makes more sense why they give this totally false narrative. It's for the future For us to believe that's right right for the key And if they're willing to do that right in front of all of us and we're like that's not true Then what do they plan on doing with us? In the meantime, but no no hold on think about this what I'm saying here If they are willing to lie right in front of us and we're all like what the fuck are they talking about What does that mean they have planned for us the only logical result of that line of thinking is they plan on us not fucking being here to tell the truth So it's very fucking dangerous the situation we're in right now because they've created a situation where The progressive left I'm not talking about Democrats because I think most Democrats are actually realizing oh shit these people are fucking communist We're talking about the far leftist These people they want their opposition dead They don't want to coexist you some comment we had on the fucking show the other day We've got no interest in uniting with people like you and you're gonna be sorry for this and this and this That's their plan and which is laughable because these are the people that are least equipped for violence calling for violence, but You know, that's that's what I see I see history being rewritten right in front of our faces So that any plan of action down the road is justified Because of the situation they're creating now because dude I don't think most people on the right are like Let's go kill fucking all those people with weird hair like that's not what that's not the conversation that happens We're more like Yeah, fucking they can do what they want, but they're not gonna infringe on my shit That's where we're at, but that's not where they're at where they're at is we're gonna fucking kill these people They're the devil they're Satan they're Hitler they're Nazis and dude when you instill that kind of Belief into some people and you don't need a big group dude You get some pre-damaging results and history is showing that over and over again So it's very very important that people recognize Then anytime you hear a political figure or you hear the media machine and the political machine Say these kind of things they're actually just painting a narrative for the future And they've already shown they don't care about us. They're willing to censor us cancel us get people to lose their job simply for stating You know, hey, you're a man in a dress. You're not a woman boom life over canceled. You're censored. You can't write that on Twitter Before Elon took over so if they're willing to censor us cancel us make us lose our livelihood It's not a far leap to think that they won't have don't have a plan to try to get rid of us They're already trying to silence us Bro, they would have tried to get rid of us during covid if we didn't have the resistance we had That was the whole plan the plan was for covid to remove the resistance from society That's why they were putting people in camps and other countries They were talking like crazy shit. This is the pandemic of the imbax native You had that Michelle we or whatever the name was You know i'm talking about that Asian woman she's on tv saying What are we going to do with these people we they can't live in society We we got it we have to we have to exclude them from society like do that was the plan and if there wasn't the resistance There was during covid they would have taken all the unvaccinate quote-unquote in backs fucking tadros was on tv today Saying that we need to push back against anti-vaxxers because they're killing people that was today So they're still trying to figure out how to isolate this group of resistance They don't understand that it's more than them though. They think it's more of them than us And there's actually way more of us than that. Yeah, plus guns I was gonna say and think this is where the second amendment comes in because if you watch how canada How strict their rules were during lockdowns compared to us They didn't have to worry about norm citizenry So there's were much more draconian much more strict our government knew there is tens and tens of millions of people with guns We can't get away with it, but rest assured if we weren't armed They would have locked us in our homes They showed their two true dictator entire itself during that time they really did thousand percent agree dude Guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments I was that being said. Let's go crew some of these comments now in all fairness You What I say yesterday Trump should do because we didn't have a show yesterday What did I say you said bro? I said if Trump was a good of a marker to his he fucking thinks he is He would get himself going out and taking out the fucking trash today Fucking hour later. He's on TV doing it I will test that is the truth. Yeah, the vape did it too. The big yeah. Oh the big did it. Yeah, I love him Yeah, he's all and did you hear rfk is gonna be in charge of health in the FDA? Oh, that's gonna be awesome. That's so cool. Yeah All right, well, let's go about crew some of these comments from uh from from some real-ass fans This first one is from a trusted nameless Uh, he says what's a trans woman's favorite type of candy Hershey chocolate Ha give me day Have you seen the Trump commercials? It's like they're not Kamala's not for you. She's for they then So good that's such a good commercial. Yeah Uh, this next one's uh, this one's for Andy. This is from Joshua. You just said it's a simple attachment. There you go That's not real Is that real? Let's discuss that doesn't listen. I draw the line there I'm drawing the line. Is that real shit? It is Halloween today. Hey look that up, dude. Is that real? Dr. Dr. Rebukani corn you fucking drink it know the fuck I wouldn't You would If they made a zero one I would try Bro Come on, that's fake. It's just brain damage studios Oh, that's a apic actually.

Yeah, I do Like that some things don't go together. For what's this thing about? I've seen uh people take Pepsi and put peanuts in it The fuck's that about what I haven't seen that's a thing who think for whom yeah really peanuts in Pepsi who does that I think it's like northerners like fucking might you know Montana why own owners do that northerners. Did you mean white people? I mean You said some white people in northern north northerners Yankees What are the southerners right I see That's true So no candy corn Dr. Peper for the northern I just like you would try it I would not okay. Yeah, okay. All right. Well guys Just some quick ones just keep this cruise moving we do appreciate you guys for being real ass fans though. Would you try it? No, I don't like candy corn I don't There's something wrong. Do you like candy corn? You know as a kid that was like I associated my brain with Halloween But no, I haven't had it like 20 years. Is that candy corn? We got some of it. Yeah, I might have have a couple I can't help it You're not coming in the other neighborhood I'm not going. Well, you can't help stealing shit. So what the fuck it is damn Yeah I'll still everything but that Yeah, you can't a corn safe around DJ Oh guys, let's keep the cruise moving we got a headline number two. Let's let's talk about it got to talk about the election We're four days out. Oh wow There's some of the election and that crazy four days out And obviously there's some interesting things that are happening so let's as always connect some dots and talk about it Let's go to Pennsylvania first down the Trump suits Pennsylvania County for turning away our voters. He actually won this lawsuit That was filed very very quickly but in an Allen town, Pennsylvania Which is in Bucks County They were literally turning away people from registering and doing their early early voting hours before the polls closed Um, and you know the crazy thing is Um, is that there's actual like video proof of this happening. Um, check this video clip out Two officers are going out to the end of the line literally putting the sign 241 p.m. Post those today Wait, this is 241 the afternoon. Yep, and they don't close till eight tapioom local time. Okay Yeah Yep, um, and of course, you know mainstream media don't believe your eyes Uh, Donald Trump claims without evidence that Pennsylvania is cheating sous Bucks County It's like there's literally like there's literal video proof here man, but don't believe your eyes Um, now there's other things that also this is the one they won in 24 hours correct So so Donald Crem, Donald Trump claims without evidence That there's cheating going on in Bucks County. They file a lawsuit and they win in 24 hours But there's no evidence. There's no evidence. Okay, no evidence Um, now there's other things that are happening in Pennsylvania too that are a lot more sinister Then uh, just you know polls getting closed down early um voter registration probes launched in crucial keystone state counties And it claims of potential fraud um, this one's crazy. So uh in two counties two other counties in Pennsylvania landcaster and your county election officials and local law enforcement they're looking into um election related fraud after authorities received large batches of voter registration materials from a quote unquote third party organization Now uh should be noted that both landcaster and your county they have more registered Republicans that live in those counties Then Democrats according to you know the historical uh state data Where Republicans have like a 63% majority um in those counties um and uh You know from from the staff will read this uh quote staff noticed that numerous applications appeared to have have uh the same handwriting and were filled out on the same date uh, district attorney Heather Adams said during a press conference quote the confirmed indicators of fraud that detectives came across where inaccuracies with the addresses listed on the applications fake and false personal identification information as well as false names Also applications that had names that did not match the provided social security information um, Adams said the materials sometimes included correct personal information But when the individuals were contacted by investigators They reported that they did not request the application forms. She estimated that this week Um that about 60% of the applications were fraudulent 60% 60% 60 fucking percent um and then as of today another county popped up uh Monroe County also in uh, Pennsylvania They found fraudulent male ballot request forms um now this one's interesting because guess what it's tied to that same third party organization and landcaster in york This time in Monroe County um where several ballot male uh, male ballot request forms in my row county were found to be fraudulent uh district attorney mike uh man kuso said in the social media post Tuesday that the forms were not authorized by the people named as applicants And at least one example The named applicant was dead According to the DA Now apparently allegedly the company um that these uh request forms are being sent from as a company called field plus media core Which is a subsidiary of an Arizona-based field core um is the name of the company Now you go to their website uh field core when try to decide it Take a little dive here. Let's see who these people are Um, you go to their website and you know, they put on their bid and positive change for our community by way of three million door knocks two million calls made two million tech sent uh 100 plus successful campaigns Right and you can see obviously in the picture, you know, it's uh, I mean, I got some climate change in there um, you got it's all the shit yeah, what about the Cache it's the trans shit It's the fucking race shit. It's all the shit. Isn't it interesting to that scene you would think that's all that matters in the swirl You wouldn't think education matters you wouldn't think that anything matters other than trans stuff and the climate in view because that's all that these people talk about you never hear about Anything other than trans gay climate non-binary. It's like do they care about any of the other problems? They're going on absolutely not bro. In fact, they want us to be stupid. They want our kids dumb They don't want them to know how to be financially responsible They don't want people to understand the truth. They want control and the way to have control is by removing the actual skill sets that we need and our children need to be successful in America So the more of this shit that they push down their throat because like let's be real bro You're a very educated person We we only have so much room to learn right so if we could take Uh, you know what we're supposed to know and replace it with ungodly amounts of nonsense bullshit They're literally preventing people from learning the things they need by capacity we don't have the capacity to learn that match his races That's right to can be seven so like bro imagine a little kid imagine a fucking kid like imagine when you were You know in sixth grade fifth grade right Being told all this shit and not being taught any useful skills about the world and then going through your whole education process Freshman year sophomore year junior year senior and then graduating and then maybe going into college and getting four more years of this shit And then going out in the real world, okay? You go out in the real world and you think all the matters is my political views on trans or Gay or or the climate or this or that and you have no skills on how to Be effective in society what you've created is you've created a very dependent individual that is Uh, needed for the communist agenda to exist because we have to have dependency to have That level of government. So you know, dude. This is an intentional I don't want to snowballing or or Unequipping or or or dumbing down of America for for the sake of power and money by another class of people And that's such a great point you made because it got me thinking of it's like people that come out of a cult Colts only talk about two or three topics they get these people really young the cult just drives us home into their brains for 20 30 years and then they go out into society and that's all they can regurgitate because that's all they've internalized as the cult teachings This is a cult. They talk about two or three things that's all they talk about and then like you said when the people get out of the cult or They're still in the cult that interacting with normal society their brains can only focus on these It's like the person coming out of Scientology. There's nothing to talk to them bro and think about how bitter and angry and pissed off you would be Once you figured out that that's what happened to you and so now you have someone coming out of what is a cult Not effective in the real world. They can't fucking read right. They can't talk about different games Communicate with people and then you have and that so now are we surprised that we have this uh This problem with youth gun violence when they've basically been lied to their entire life Been told things are one way and then they go out in the real world and find there another way And then they're fucking pissed at the world bro. We can't be shocked about that And this explains what we were talking about earlier because we're like it's so weird They're not content just living their life. They need us to go along with it. It reminds me of a person who come is in a cult And he's screaming at the other people in society. No, but Scientology Da-da-da-da. They need you to believe the lies. They believe in their cult That's why the trans people are so in your face because it's a cult and they can't wrap their heads around the fact that we don't belong to the cult like they do Yeah, we don't want to drink that Kool-Aid They crave that external validation because they know they do know deep down inside that what they're a part of isn't right They know and I'm not judging saying they're bad people do because like a lot of really good people get sucked into shit like that many different ways I know people from many different situations have gotten sucked into different things that are closed organizations like that That the reality is is dude It's very very very harmful and it creates very very angry people who come out of those things and because they can't function bro Like they can't function like these people cannot go out and like they couldn't come here and be effective and then they look at like They end up like that woman trying to work a hooters and say nobody wants me. Yeah, no shit because you don't have any fucking skills or titties You know, yeah, you don't have any skills. You don't have any redeeming qualities You're not friendly. You're argumentative to everybody about their points because you believe you're right You know part of freedom is being tolerant of things that you may not necessarily agree with and so it's interesting that those people scream freedom so much But they are not tolerant of other people's freedoms at all. No, right? Like dude you and I Josh and DJ you're the same way. We all joke and shit. We talk about shit, right? That's the nature of fucking what we do But when we're getting serious look dude. I don't care someone's gay I don't care if someone's trans what I care about is that you respect my fucking beliefs And I respect yours And that only goes one way and it's only gone one way for a long time And now there's this massive pushback which makes them feel like they're fucking shits being encroached upon Well, when you are the oppressor for so fucking long because they are white men have been able to say shit for two decades bro You can say shit, okay? Now all of a sudden you come back and you say this is fucked up I don't I'm not with this blah blah blah when they've had their way of pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing Of course it feels like they're getting attacked but let's be real who's been attacking who for the last two decades You know, I'm saying who's been being called bigots for the last two decades? Who's been being called racist? Who's being called massacias? Who's being called all this shit? It ain't fucking them. It's us And I don't remember walking around being like oh you fucking gay people or you trans people or this or that Honestly, I didn't give two fucks. I didn't care until I started seeing how fucking It was decided it was being pushed on us You know one of the things that brought to my attention the very first time was back in like 2015 We were having an event and somebody asked me if we would fly the pride flag at the event And I said no And I didn't say no because I didn't I said no and my response was very simple It was no we fly the American flag because the American flag represents all of us And I got fucking yelled and screamed at and called a fucking big it and all this shit all over the internet for that And that's when I started to realize oh This is fucking fucked up Right because that flag that you're wearing on your fucking shirt bro That does represent all of us and that represents gay people and that represents trans people And it represents anybody who wants to live a life of how they want to live But if we're gonna live in a free country we've got to be able to respect Lifestyles that are not our preferred way of living and that From what I can observe that's been happening to gay people like and I don't even think gay people are a part of this to be honest I think most gay people recognize that this trend shit is out of control I have a I have a number of gay Close family members that are gay I also have a trans family member And I can tell you right now and I have a large number of LGBT Friends yeah, and close confidants they are all sick of the days. They feel the teas have hijacked the movement Dave Chappelle's even joked about there's teas that are pissed at that there's teas that are pissed at Everyone is sick of them and going back to your point you make such a good point It's about freedom and it's really freedom is not respected from the left anymore That's all you have to do is look at who's shouting and whose face yeah It's always the left shouting in someone else's face because they don't value freedom And it's really sad because when I was growing up in the 90s the left was all about minority viewpoints The left was all about diversity of opinion the left was all about people celebrating their differences They literally represent the opposite of all of those things now They're not for minority viewpoints. They're not for differences of opinion and they're not for diversity They want one big monolith that follows an official narrative and if you deviate from that They're gonna persecute you they literally are the opposite of what they stood for three decades ago And it's really sad to see what I agree with you And you know what's interesting is they don't seem to realize they've lost the power They don't seem to realize that culture has flipped they don't understand like like that person who was like threatening us You know you're like you're not gonna like how this ends up for you. Oh really Okay Like yeah, that's what I'm saying like you guys are don't have the power anymore Like you should realize that Culture is flipped people are sick your shit Piling on and canceling and talking all this shit saying ah don't fucking shop no one gets a fuck No one gets a fuck any more about that but doesn't stop them from trying You know, I'm saying so like even back to this company here, right? Oh, yeah, I forgot we're doing a show Even even doing some some more digging, you know, like I saw this little piece right here this 100 plus successful campaigns and I'm like, well You know who was on that you know who have they worked for you know, I'm saying I'm expecting to see you know some George Bush There's some some Trump pints on there of course not right It's been all left leaning by campaigns and politicians. I'm interestingly enough There's one specific one on here Biden Harris Biden Harris Biden Harris campaign was what oh that was the last Oh, okay, so this same company has been doing the same bullshit in the last election that makes sense Um, and not just Pennsylvania guys everybody's having some issues Miami-Dade they got pull workers that are throwing out ballot boxes on the fucking street accidentally Yeah, ABC they're they're putting up election results Before that you see this I did and but don't forget your conspiracy theorist if you point any of this out Yeah, yeah, it was just an accident, you know, we didn't mean to show what we're actually gonna be showing It's just complete bullshit now Um and some other stuff we got to cover this man because this is starting to really ramp up and gain some traction here The real Toria Brooke she's awesome. I follow her constant all of her page. She's really really awesome She does a great job does a great job. Yeah, she's fucking every I don't know how she's everybody She's literally everywhere. She's at all the fucking places. She's her full-time deal. Yeah, she she works hard But she she does fucking awesome Um, but she just tweeted this out today in case you missed it There is a nationwide issue with dominion voter access terminals That prevents voters from making certain selections According to Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Vincent. Let's check this video clip out Issues with the programming of the That's with specific Why was that only caught in the past few days and why can't it be fixed? I saw the release Yeah, this is a nationwide issue with dominion voter access terminals in In the counties that used them and the voter access terminals of course not all all the machines Just the ones that are accessible have an issue with the Straight party voting and a programming issue that's again affected the machines nationwide And I think all of us that used dominion machines were were We're unhappy to learn about this during the the testing period and and as early voting began so we're working with dominion to seek accountability On that front and also have are working with our clerks to ensure voters are aware of this Programming issue that will will require them to ensure they are Voting every section on the ballot Because we have straight part it's not it's it's not Struck me as I've talked to my other colleagues and other states. They're just as upset about it as we are So yeah, so so what is she talking about right? I'm going to show you another clip and this is what she's talking about In some places in some of these states this one specifically in Kentucky It literally will not allow them to click a specific You know party on the back which one yeah, or a shot party Just so happens to be the Trump vans I'm sure it's just a coincidence. Yeah, check this out He's literally clicking on the screen and it will not click it Won't click it It will allow you to go He fucking clicked Donald Trump in the Kamala Harris one lit up isn't this funny It's just like Google when you were good. They just came out a few days ago and when you Google Trump It would automatically Google would populate something for Kamala It literally exact same thing only it was for Google Dude, it's crazy now now now not only other machines have in this issue. Okay. There's another issue in other counties I'm in other places across the country Let's go to Colorado quickly. Okay, Colorado Kyle Clark he He's a journalist But he tweeted this out he says the office of Colorado secretary of state at Jenna Griswald who's a Democrat Didn't change leaked voting machine passwords until after the leak became public yesterday Griswald was made aware of the breach five days prior on October 24th She so so what happened here is hold on you know this lady is right This is the same fucking lady. They try to get Donald Trump off the fucking ballot. Yeah, same lady Same lady. So what happened here? These machines they have Access passwords right which like meaning the one they're connected to the internet Shocking but this password if you have that password you have administrative privileges you can go in and you know Put in inputs on how many people voted on it. It gives complete access to these these databases and so there was an interview that mr. Clark did i'm says county clerks Were not notified of the breach by Griswald until after the Colorado GOP called it out publicly yesterday I X Griswald yesterday whether she ever intended to tell the public she said that she uh that hadn't been decided listen to this fucking lady Um and her ego that sews out of this check this out. This is this is her here. That's why I hate her already Why why Because these are the fucking people that think that they are superior to you and everybody else To where they can decide that your votes don't count these people fucking think these people like this should be in fucking jail Forever okay, you are trampling and removing rights that are guaranteed through the constitution who's Many of these people that you're denying their fucking vote their family members have fucking died for us to have that opportunity And these people believe that they have the right to supersede other citizens in this country Anybody who fucks with the election in any way shape or form should be put in prison for the rest of their life Doesn't matter if they're doing it for Trump or if they're doing it for Kamala or if they're doing it for your local election any human being Who takes the right away from other citizens to have a say and what this country is about deserves life in prison and I am being Very reasonable because if it were up to me, I throw those motherfuckers in a wood shipper no doubt Anybody who has a fucking ego and a sense of importance and an entitlement and an elitism about them to believe that that's okay They will do that over and over and over again because their fundamental belief system is they are up here And you all the peasants are down here and you cannot correct that mentality that mentality is incorrect. Oh, okay, so prison for her And that's being nice. Yeah, yeah, and so again, so these passwords were leaked on October 24 It took five days And then it was made public like along with the passwords being league. Hey, we have the passwords Relic they stood in change the passwords until 24 hours after that Let's let's check this interview out You chose not to tell the county clerks about this password leak Were you going to tell the public about it if the Colorado Republican Party didn't go public with it today? So again, I am going to Push back on your gotcha premise We did not decide not to disclose something to county clerks. We were actively investigating along with federal partners We want to try to take as measured of approaches to situations as possible and gather good information So along those lines we are still in an active investigation our course remains As it was it's to gather information go into the counties Fix any issue that needs to be fixed out of an abundance of caution. Did you intend to tell the public if it wasn't revealed We were still in investigation working with federal partners and had not made that decision Great non-answer just like Kamala gets for everything. It's always a non-answer She's never answered the question ever. She has a five-minute long loop around I mean bro. She's a fucking attorney and a terrible one of that like not even she's not even convincing In her redirection at all it's so bad but the she couldn't get away with it if it weren't for a complicit media And they just let her get away with it every time she's getting away with it bro. Oh not to yeah But I think to her supporters they yeah, I think she they don't realize how stupid she is yeah now We've we've talked about a bunch of times on this show um that you know between now and Honestly when trump has to take inauguration if he does win this election They're gonna try everything you know, I'm saying there the doing the voter intimidation shit I don't know if you guys saw this the Philadelphia man was arrested for bomb threat against the Montgomery County Republican committee That's what happens when you call everybody Nazis, you know, you got the Jimmy Kimmel right he went on his show and told people to vote on Wednesday And they tried to kill trump twice Don't forget that either. That's the two times we know about yeah, no shit. Oh, there's a third time last week But the media yeah, but they didn't talk about you know, but you got Jimmy Kimmel On his shows telling people to go telling trump voters to go vote on Wednesday Obviously, that's the day after the fucking election which there was somebody that was actually sentenced to prison for doing that exact same thing So I mean that'll be interesting But you know again like it's gonna be fucking crazy. They're gonna do anything they got and anytime these things happen You always see some interesting headland. I'm gonna show this last one with you guys Geostorm could hit tomorrow NASA wars right and they've said this has been a very interesting year because we've had a bunch of these weird Geostorms that come out We have one back in May of this year Where pretty much all of it and that was down across the country for multiple hours Because that's what Geostorms do they even a minor storm can cause disruptions of power grids satellite Radio communications And they're saying that there's been a peak of activity every since October 15th and apparently tomorrow is supposed to have a pretty big one Which is today when you guys are listening Guys anything anything else anything else on this Can't say I'm surprised. I mean, and you know people were predicting months ago They said just wait if a follow-als fails Kamala is gonna try to out the whole trump as a fascist She is so that she has literally done everything people predicted she was gonna do So it none of it surprises me. She's so desperate. No I think it's I think we got to really think about this um I think it's very clear That Donald Trump is crushing Kamala the optics show it the Vegas line shows it the actual polling that the Democrats are putting out shows it I'll be at that much less than what the other places show, but they still show him winning I Think there's a good chance that Donald Trump wins Based upon the overwhelming support if you guys go out and fucking vote the way you're supposed to vote Right now, I think there's a big campaign by the left to make trump voters over competent and it did not show up at the polls So I think it's very important to realize that they could be pumping this to make it seem like it's Out of line so that you guys won't go vote You have to go fucking vote you have to go vote But I think there's a more important conversation. There's needs to be had here That what happens between November 5th and January 20th and that's something that people aren't really discussing because there is no chance The Donald Trump gets elected quote-unquote, you know, wins the election and then for the next 90 days everything goes smooth It's gonna be mass fucking chaos. So I think we need to discuss what that could look like and In my opinion what I see is I see them Because they've already labeled everybody not sees they've already labeled everybody this I see them taking extreme action justified action justified in quotes To keep him out of office I think you're gonna see riots in the streets. I think those people that are in the streets are gonna be painted as Patriots and freedom fighters and I think there's a possibility that they engage the 15 to 20 million migrants who have who are here illegally to Fight along with them or cause disruption with them Because they're gonna deport you if he gets in power, right? And so I think We have a very very very rough and dangerous and volatile situation for the next 90 days Regardless of what happens and I think it's very important to consider the things that could happen And one of the things that could happen is what I'm saying Mike Lover did a video on this. I think Mike Lover's a super smart fucking guy There's been a couple other guys that have seen this the same way. I'm seeing it as well so We'll see you know, I've talked to some other people some other people were like no because the migrants I'm gonna want to expose themselves because they'll get deported automatically. Well, yeah, that's if they lose right you only lose if you lose and I think it's gonna be very important for people to Especially police especially for military To consider that you might have some very difficult questions about who you're going to stand with and what you're going to do over the next 90 days Because there's a reason that 90% of these people who came from all over the world are military age males And it's not because they're bringing their families and all this shit Okay, these people are fucking a lot of these people fought militaries for these other countries All right, who do you think's more equipped to handle a power outage or total disruption? What if they turn the grid off for two weeks? Who's gonna fucking win that somebody who comes from a third world country Who's used to living like that or some fucking middle class American who's got fucking no calluses on his hands, right? Like there's a very dangerous situation that's brewing here that You know, I think they are willing to instigate To get what they want no matter what because like I've been saying for years bro The what would you do if you knew that if the other party was coming to power that you were gonna go to jail or be hung What would you fucking do you would fucking do whatever was required and I think that's where we're at So you have you have Kamala out in front of the White House saying You know he Trump's talking about the enemy within he's talking about you know He's not talking about the citizens. He's talking about the criminals at the top of the fucking food chain everybody knows that Except the people that are being told that so what if you're being told let's just position ourselves as somebody who listens to Kamala and listens to the media and believes what it says You're being told that this man is literally Hitler incarnate and going to What are you going to be willing to justify your actions To keep him out of power as an individual citizen It's you're gonna justify almost anything if you're not a coward because you're gonna see it as we're saving America We're the patriots we care about this and that's what they're being told and the problem with this is is that outside the Migrants these are usually the people who are least equipped to handle violence most of the two a crowd most of the veteran crowd most of the police Most of the actual military these are Trump people so we're gearing up here for a very dangerous conflict and I think it's very important for everybody not just people on the right or the middle who are voting for Trump But people who are gonna vote for Kamala too to remember that we are all being intentionally Pitted against each other and the only way that we can get through this Without major fucking damage. I mean, and I mean people dying Is to remember that we can't comply with their bullshit. We can't go along with their nonsense. We can't bite into it We can't and they've been laying the groundwork for this for so long the left has they are always playing identity politics They're constantly trying to divide and bulk and eyes and separate people based on race Gender identity sexual orientation. They know nobody has a problem or had a problem with trans people or gay people or anything And they didn't like that so they tried to pit us against them by telling these groups. Oh, they hate you Oh, you should go read to their kids because they knew if they had people in drag reading to our kids We go hey, what's going on here? They the left does not want us to get along and so they're constantly playing identity politics constantly trying to get us to hate each other when we didn't in the beginning and I think these people like you said are being used as pawns They think the Democrats care about them. No, the Democrats are just trying to get us to hate you Because if we hate each other Then they have more power when something like this happens and it's easier for them to censor us if they can demonize us and vilify us Which they've been doing for years And so I really think they've been laying the groundwork for a long time by separating us and trying to get us to hate each other That's why the media is constantly trying to You know talk about police versus black people and cis people versus non-Sis people It's all about division and I know I'm sick of it and you guys are sick of it But they had the left had to do this in order to prepare for a moment like this when they were gonna have to ask their people to do Do something big and they knew those people wouldn't do it unless they had sufficiently demonized To where they built the belief in their heart that if they don't do anything that Trump's gonna come into power Round them up and put them into camps. Bro, these these women on the view who are saying this shit They should go to jail for that like that's a complete lie Trump could have done that in his first fucking term Okay, you didn't do any of that shit and dude I think it's also important that these people that are progressive left Really stop and think before they go out in the street and try to fucking cause chaos because at this point in time We do have temperatures at the hottest point and you Your side is not equipped for that level of violence almost all the gun owners almost all the patriots almost all the veterans Almost all the police almost all the military age men here are on the other side And if it goes to the streets you're gonna get wiped the fuck out and I don't want that You don't want that and we don't want that in America. We don't want any history like that You know what I'm saying we don't need it. No, it's very fucking dangerous And when we talk about the enemy within it is not those people those people are ponds. They're being manipulated They're being lied to and they're being used For the preservation of the power and the tyranny of the people who are in power right now not Trump the people who are in power right now And it's very fucking dangerous dude and the left has such a long history of using vulnerable groups and pimping out their problems so that they can stay in power Oh you guys won't be able to make it in America you're black but will help you with these programs You wouldn't be able to do anything without our help Whatever they say about their belief about black people in general you wouldn't be able to do anything without our help What that's the most racist shit ever it's pretty racist yeah Pretty funny racist but you're racist because you made a watermelon joke right then we all laughed at my dad used to say It's the soft bigotry of low expectations and the left has such low expectations of all of these people that they tell them whether they're trans gay Black Latino You won't be able to be anything without our helping hand in all the reason they're doing is because they just want to stay in power So obvious to us but I feel sorry for the people like you said that are being used as pawn so that they can stay in power Charlie disgusting what they're doing Yeah, guys jumping on this conversation Let's know what you guys think down in the comments that being said headline number three Keep this cruise movie Check this out I got to talk about Diddy man. There's some interesting stuff happening there. Diddy. Yeah, P. Diddy. Did he did P did it? Yeah, he did it I think he did it lace in the baby oil. Yeah, let's let's dive into this. So you got FBI and DDA agents We're at the prison where did he's being held apparently there was some law enforcement operation joint task operation And they said it was quote designed to achieve our shared goal of maintaining a safe environment for both our employees And the incarcerated individuals house at mdc Brooklyn Now prison officials didn't comment on this at all They declined to provide specific details about the operation that happened on Monday Now since diddy has been accused of all of this stuff All of these allegations which I believe went back to september 24th. I believe um Almost weekly there has been more and more allegations that come out more lawsuits that are coming out This newest one Sean diddy combs accused in new lawsuit of sexually assaulting 10 and 17 year old boys um, and uh, you know, this is a new lawsuit that came out Where the lawsuits both filed in New York Um, it's the latest wave of lawsuits in which accusers alleged they were sexually assaulted by combs at parties and meetings over the last two decades now Diddy's lawyers, you know, of course, he's saying that you had this bullshit and the attorneys for the the suing parties are just trying to get publicity and um, all of that bullshit um, now the 10 year old boy who was not identified in the lawsuit Um, was an aspiring actor and rapper who had traveled with his parents from california for meetings with music industry representatives During what was supposed to be an audition for combs. He was giving a drug-laced soda by a combs associate And sexually assaulted by the bad boy's record founder according to the lawsuit The boy eventually lost consciousness and when he woke combs threatened to badly hurt the child's parents If he told anyone what happened the filing said um, the second one uh with the 17 year old also an identified male Uh, combs allegedly forced him into sexual acts with combs and a bodyguard during a three-day audition Uh, for making the band television show Um, now with all of this coming out um, we've been talking. I mean, this is obviously it's giving major Epstein vibes And I think the difference here between diddy and Epstein is that there's more information that's available to us now about the diddy shit Then it was with Epstein right um, but uh now in a private interview that was done um, anonymous interview Apparently, uh, it's been said that diddy quote has enough dirt to hang half of Hollywood Uh, panicky celebrities are praying he keeps his mouth shut Um, and so this is now coming out. This is an interesting article Shandida combs reportedly kept meticulous records of his infamous parties and quote has enough dirt to hang half of Hollywood according to a source Who added that well-known celebrities are panicking uh while they pray he keeps his mouth shut Um, they talk about his ex-girlfriends including singer Jennifer Lopez and actress Cameron Diaz Um, are in a major panic Um, that he will drag them down by revealing unsavory secrets about them if he ends up going away to prison the source told in touch weekly quote It's not like they've been going around trashing him, but everyone's been giving him a seriously wide birth the so uh source told the magazine Quote he's radioactive at this point even if he hasn't been found guilty his name is mud and it would uh, it would be social suicide to have anything to do with them Um, the source added that combs who's been in jails in september 16th Not 24th um as he waits for trial um that he's been getting pissed Um, expecting that his former friends and associates come to his defense, but nobody is uh, they don't want to risk their reputations Um, he says quote he's still in total denial and actually expected all his high profile friends And even his exes like jaylo and camera to stand up for him the source said Uh quote, he can't wrap his head around the fact that everyone's just dropped him and wants no part of this sort of scandal Um, and it's interesting Uh, because you know that we talk about how this operation, you know works, right? We're like, you know Epstein or ditty in this situation they they get these Do these parties they get this blackmail on these famous celebrities When they use that to hold them hostage and and push whatever narratives need to be pushed right it's a fucking it's operation Um, now an update in this uh jaylo uh, she was caught leaving a uh, some type of uh event and uh, was questioned and uh she uh She had a very interesting reaction I'm not sure if you guys saw this um, but jaylo uh walked away after being peppered with questions about her relationship with the ledge sex defender ditty At autograph signing a new video shows the singer who's 55 dodging the interrogation after she was reminded about her past connection to Sean ditty comb the stars previously spoken about her tempesterous And emotionally exhausting two-year romance with the rapper who's 54 Um, who she split with over his infidelities Um, or maybe parties. I don't know. Here's the clip Everything's cool. Everything's cool smiles. Everything's fine You're fine We're fine. We're fine Everything's fine fine Sign some stuff. Yep All right, I'm done. All right. Give the fuck out of here. I'm out You're not just fine So I mean, you know, I don't know. I mean, I think it's similar to like the Bill Gates shit, right? Like with uh with his wife like she like you can't be in those circles and not know what's happening Doesn't make sense to me So like I'm sure jaylo knows something But I feel like maybe all their hand away. She was photographed arguing with ditty the same night that that situation happened I saw that. Yeah, no shit. I don't know. The same night that situation happened where that 10-year-old kid Was making the Accusation against ditty. Mm-hmm. There's a photograph of her arguing with ditty that same night. No shit Just came out like you saw it. I saw yeah, and it's funny too because they you know Go figure said, you know when people are saying oh pizza gate and there's tons of pedophiles in Hollywood And there's this Hollywood cabal of pedophiles. It was oh, you're crazy. That's a conspiracy now with Jeffrey Epstein P. Diddy and a number of other people It's true and like every other conspiracy it turned out not to be and it turned out to be true That's right no one shocked because we called it but we're called conspiracy there Well, I think it's hard for a lot of people to wrap their heads around the level of operation that we're talking about here Because what we're actually talking about is a network of highly influential people who are position in Power so that they can collect and create blackmail information over other very important people for Influence, okay, so when we go out and we see like let's say during covid right they got Everybody to repeat the same exact talking points like the same words the same lines right you had all these actors Making these commercials say I'm thank you doctor Fauci, you know, and their complete character I remember Brad Pitt doing one specifically which maybe want to puke but the point is They all say the same thing and if you're a critical thinker One of the things you're going to think is like why are they all saying the same exact line What is this and we see this in the media and then it's perded by celebrities and then it's perded by the general public who follow those people So it trickles down through the power pyramid and so What people have to understand is that this is not just people who are raging pedophiles This is people who Understand that being a pedophile is socially unacceptable in every way shape of the form to everybody else So what they do is they intentionally get these people of influence to attend events at Epstein Island or go to a party at his brownstone or party with Diddy at one of his now famous Diddy parties and And that capture these people all socializing and whether they're participating or not They're complicit just by association and then what we have to remember is that there's many more diddies out there And there's many more Epstein and every industry man right about the Epstein did the politicians did he was in the rap industry I want to see the country music industry. I want to see there's someone for every main group of influence because they need Unification to push a narrative that makes no sense right So if we are a critically thinking citizen and we notice that something isn't right with COVID right and let's say we're We're someone who we have an opinion, but we also aren't aware of this right we aren't aware of this big operation The myth that we start thinking for ourselves we look around and we say damn dude Everybody's saying the same thing though. I'm the only one not saying it So like it must be true. I must just be reading it wrong And that's what they're doing to American citizens and people across the globe to go along with this crazy shit This is why we see you know this like trans shit Completely accepted by Hollywood and completely accepted by celebrities and music people and all of these things because they are told To do that and if they don't do that they will be exposed in some way shape or form And so that's what we're dealing with here. We're dealing with an operation of intelligence that comes from Masad and CIA which is going to be hard for people to accept And this is part of the reason why Israel has so much influence over the United States because they have blackmail and every fucking important person in the country and That's this is how they control the narrative and this is how they they control the culture and society and it's through blackmail And that's what the fuck is going on here, okay? So that's a hard thing for the average person to wrap their mind around like that sounds crazy as fuck like how the fuck Like bro you're could that's a conspiracy, but dude You listen you and I have sat down with guys that work for fuck at CIA who've looked us in the fucking eye and said what that's exactly how it works Yeah so It's exactly how it works. Yeah, and it reminds me when you said the person has that kind of waking moment where they're like wait What the hell's going on? What world am I living in everyone saying the same thing? This is all bullshit They're all lying to me. It's literally like the protagonist in 1984 in George O'olive's orwell's 1984 Everyone else is walking around in group think saying the same things doing the same things There's double speak where they'll there's a new language now where everything means the opposite of what it used to mean sound familiar Liberals are literally taking that playbook in doing it and they know if they can prevent free communication Open dialogue it will be easier for them to keep people from communicating Because if we communicate we our minds are open and we have more power and we can start to have a voice They don't want that that's why they're always censoring things. They never want an open dialogue They never want free discussion Because it's gonna screw up their plan which is to keep us all as these unthinking robots like in 1984 And then they can do whatever they have designed to do and so thankfully people like Andy and me and you guys and I think a lot of Americans in the silent majority that I think is out there and it's gonna vote this election has woken up and we're no longer sleeping And we're no longer just accepting what the media is parading and what everyone even though they're all saying the same thing We're like no, no, no, this is bullshit and I will believe my line eyes And so that encourages me and I'm glad that people are waking up and that we can find each other and talk about this and get to a point We're making fun of it and saying you guys are fucking stupid We're not believing your bullshit like you said earlier it ain't working It's not working. It's like it's like the it's like the abusive husband that comes home and fucking gas lights is Why yep and beats his wife and fuck like and then eventually one day she's like fuck you What are you gonna do beat me again? What are you gonna do yell at me again? Where she kills him? Yeah, and then and then he loses all power So the minute that we look at them and we're like fuck you. What are you gonna do lie to us again? Fuck off the minute we do that as this is they're done It's over for them And that's where we got to get society too and I think we are to your point Josh getting there At a rapid pace. I was just having this discussion with Ian Smith last night We're talking about this and you know, he gets frustrated because he's been in the fight Just like we have for fucking years and he's like fuck dude You know, I feel like people are waking up but not at the rate and I simply asked him. I said okay Well How many more people you think you're awake now than they were a year ago and he was like a lot But I don't know if it's enough and I'm like dude. I think you know It's it's getting there think about how fast it's accelerating like like more people have woken up in the last year And have woken up in the last four years more people have woken up in the last fucking 60 days They woke up in the last year So it's starting to catch and culture is with the truth culture has flipped and they're not worried about being called names anymore. I'm sure some people are but The the idea of calling someone a racist or a bigot or a this or that it doesn't work anymore because And which by the way is sort of unfortunate because there are actual Real cases of those things a misogyny of rape of fucking discrimination of racism These are but when you Overused the terms now no one fucking listens So these people have effectively created more fucking real life victims Through their overuse of this name calling because now when people say it everybody's like yeah, whatever bro Everybody is according to you Yeah, I mean I had a racist experience that target the other day Really? It was actually real No, no, I got I got I got racist. Oh, you did. Yeah, that's here it. Yeah, it was actually pretty crazy, man So I was I was that target I was for Alex's birthday. She went through some shopping and stuff I got the girls and we'll you know my little cart. You know we're going through and It was like an eight-year-old little little girl. It was her mom and then her mom's mom, right? So I got three generations and I experienced three generations of racism about 10 seconds. Oh really? Yeah, man, so I was walking through my girls, you know, they're eating the stuff. I'm fine bro. I'm being so serious You're fucking loud. I'm so serious. What happened? So I'm walking through and you know the girls they're eating there The little Starbucks and shit. You know, I got more coffee, right? We're just walking through and the mom goes She's like man your girls that they're so well behaved, right? I'm like, okay All right, yeah, cuz you know, what would you rather than oh? I was I what would you rather than be doing you know, would you just like fucking racist? It gets worse. Okay, but that's not racist This is the first generation of racism. Okay, then the grandmother All right, she looks at me and she's like well, it's probably because the dad so well behaved, right? I'm like, oh my god. All right. Well, if they only knew you. I'm like, all right. All right. That's all right The worst came from the little eight-year-old, bro. So like we pass, you know, we pass each other Well, eight-year-old girl goes. Yeah, he has those kids trained That's not fucking racist. I mean, you know, I should have just turned around like fucking mid the monkey dance some shit I did just here yesterday they were higher at your story reminds me of this they were hiring a new manager He's coming over. I can't remember his name, but it's an African-American man And so they went to the president I believe at the organization of the spaceball team And he was talking about all the great things about this African-American guy that they were considering for the job of manager of the baseball team And he said and he's just so articulate That is one thing that like it's when they say that shit They always tell on themselves. It's it dude. You can always tell him. Got you. Yeah When they say that shit about black people. Yeah, they're always so articulate. What the fuck? He's clean He's clean Those people are always fucking leftist always always always yeah So you think that was really racist. I mean, I think I think had I been you know Because I mean do look everybody's little kids are a little fucking tyrants bro They run around make a bunch of noise. You do have some well-behaved kids. I do. What do you mean by that? They're well-behaved. Yeah, they try to train them. Yeah, well the whole their father's well-behaved is the part that's that stuff Yeah, they would only knew Yeah, you know, so I'll be posting my black square tomorrow and yeah post. Yeah, we'll see how it goes and racism with the black square You should ask what do you mean by that? It happened so quick because it was like bam bam bam You know, I couldn't even process all of it because they hit you with so much racism. It's happened so quick Right, he was so much racism it frozen and then like you know when they fucking long gone past the aisles and shit I'm like, I think I just got racist Like I'm pretty sure that's what that was so basically the lesson is is if you want to be racist hit him with all of it because I didn't want to know what happened You can't they can't or have your kids do it Yeah, it's like yeah, it's loads of you know, so yeah, we guys jumping on this combo.

Yeah, no, fuck no, I don't do the you believe in ghosts No, I don't watch scary movies or horror movies. They just don't do anything. But do you believe like you don't think ghosts are real? No, I'm like spiritual. I think like dead people like their energy, but not to the point of ghosts No, I don't no paranormal activity No, I think that's all bullshit. Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, you know, maybe we can uh, we take a trip maybe All right, right? Where is this Andy's house actually? Oh, this fucking house is not his house is on it No, like legit like legit. We got videos We got pretty got some proof But let's dive in on this. This isn't Connecticut. All right the world's most famous Paranormal investigating couple left behind a museum full of real-life Haunted relics they collected in their adventures including the creepy doll that inspired the horror movie Annabelle Late husband and wife couple Ed and Lorraine Warren Who are now immortalized as characters in the Conjuring series of movies kept an occult museum on their property that is no longer open to the public But those lucky enough or unlucky enough to get a look inside are surrounded by occult items like haunted fragments of crashed Eastern Airlines flight 401 and organ that plays on its own and a human skull visitors are given holy water The sprinkle on their hands before setting their sights on the museum's most notorious item Annabelle a giant raggedy and all Uh, that isn't as aggressive looking as this Hollywood counterpart But sits staring quietly in a glass case marked warning positively do not open. Let's check this clip out So this is supposed to be like all of like real haunted shit from like all over the country man I'm okay So there's the infamous this is the infamous Annabelle doll This is the doll that's called so much havoc to people over the years It had gotten back in 1970 from two nurses in Hart, Connecticut Um, there's been movies of course made on it called Annabelle Annabelle creation and Annabelle comes home by wonder brothers Uh, it's a very dangerous object. It's something that We keep in the case because we don't want anybody to physically touch it with their bare hands We keep it locked up in this case and we have a priest come in and he does ritualistic bright binding prayers on this doll on a regular basis probably once a month He blesses the entire museum And he blesses specifically this doll By using holy oil and holy water and then a caset is encased in Was made by Damna Vera one of my eat investigators And he infused the stain with blessed holy oil and holy water And he mixed it in the stain when he did this and behind her Is engraved these lords prayer And on the sides are two plaques for the St Michael Uh angel on it and of course is a cross There and there's a cross carved in both sides And we never take her out of the case. We'll leave her in the case when we transport her and we transport her very rarely Yeah, I'm okay um, I was hit. Yeah Let me see. I'm gonna like jump out or anything. No. I mean, I was waiting for that thing Yeah, I thought a scary image. I thought you were like messing with us and you're gonna like a scary image pop No, this is like real shit. If like you know people have gone there and they've like you know said Or reported Uh, that like the dolls hand and shit will move when they go look at it and shit Um, you got a fucking put holy water on yourself before you even go in now I don't trust holy water that's in the fucking like you know co-coffee fucking jug But That's definitely that's a cold brew bro. That definitely is yeah 10 hour cold brew bro and then ones in the Arizona tea But so ghetto You know, but you know, yeah, I mean it's there and then this is the doll that was in the movies. Okay, that's fucking weird Yeah, that was scary looking that's that's but this is the actual original doll bro. I take that shit home sleep with it Yeah, it's not scary. Look. It's not what I was expecting. What are you saying you're gonna say something? No Well, I have the most I have the most credible Paranormal evidence video that's ever been caught ever and the internet's never seen. I'll show it to you after the show Yeah, it's real please. I don't I don't fucking it's the most convincing piece of evidence that I personally ever say it was in your house at my house Yeah, so I live in a historic property. Okay, it used to belong to U.S. S. Grant the 18th president United States Yeah, it's got a ton of history on it his original stables are still on the property So yeah, yeah And dude, I have we have security there on the property. So like we've caught all kinds of shit on camera But this one specific thing that we caught is fucking insane I'll show to you right after the shit. Wow. Yeah, I want to see that. Yeah, man And like I mean that doll inspired you know the movies the conjuring and shit and I don't I don't have any plans on going. I wouldn't want to I wouldn't even want to go anywhere. Where is that? Connecticut. Oh, I don't know. Connecticut. Yeah, I've never been there. That's not a place that I think about It's too far away I go within like a five mile radius in my house. That's pretty much it Yeah, well, we were gonna give this man holy water in Arizona T. Canes. I'm I'm saying Do you think it's bull? I don't think it's bullshit, bro I don't think the shit is like I don't think it's bullshit. Listen dude. It would be hard for me to say it's bullshit after the things I've seen yeah, so I don't know I think there's a lot of people out there like especially on these ghost shows and on these paranormal caught on camera shows I think there's a mix of some stuff that's like unexplainable and I think there's also people on there that are trying to like be on the show Yeah, and they create the things to like you know, yeah beyond the show. So I think there's a mix and uh I don't know, you know, I don't know people this is like people like to believe in things, you know like When a little legend gets started people like oh yeah, and they get some all hyped up and shit but I mean I don't know I was gonna say with this it reminds me of like religion. It's non falsifiable So you can't prove that God doesn't exist in with religion. I'm like an agnostic I'm open to it if there's evidence, but right now I'm not persuaded That's how I would feel with this summit like an agnostic about it if some evidence like his what he's gonna show me after the show You know convinces me then I'm open to it, but I'm not convinced based on this alone Yeah Guys let us know down in the comments. We'll be right. I actually agree with that. Yeah, I think there's a lot of bullshit I think I believe in these things Remember dude. I had dinner or breakfast with Sean Whaling we caught that fucking ghost on camera Like tank like eight years ago. Yeah, and then The restaurant we were in ended up being a fucking morgue before it was a restaurant We even know that yeah, wow see that's interesting.
