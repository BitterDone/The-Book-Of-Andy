where anybody says bro racism's funny it is it is I think it's important man that's all the way it is how we put it down yeah man oh man oh man all right well sweet yeah well you know with that being said let's let's give him a little bit more racism because I got rappers colonins oh we do and diamond change for you all right let's let's get into this before we get to our main headlines I want to bring this up because I thought this was pretty pretty crazy um ironies kind of there uh farmer a land of city attorney sentenced to seven years in prison for stealing 15 million dollars in ppp funds you know it's crazy I've been seen a trend there's been a lot of people locked up they've been they've been cracking down on this shit it's all been black people no bro that's not true that's all the ones out that's not true I see a lot of fucking white car too oh yeah really bro it's just low class where they were they buying like you know like just cash an out on shit I like how do they get caught bro I think they were buying like trailers like you know you know sand yeah the universal thing oh yeah okay all right well that's kind of this ain't this ain't this is this is just fucking by a colonins huh they're not buying colonins no but a coloner no they're probably buying like a 85 square body Chevy you know say it yeah it's a little different yeah man so this is this is an interesting stuff here with this one so a farmer city of Atlanta assisted attorney and Atlanta police officer Shalitha Robinson 62 has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison after she stalled about 15 million dollars in paycheck protection program loans from the government during the COVID-19 pandemic Robinson and other co-conspirators got the loans on behalf of four businesses she owned and control the Department of Justice said the news release Friday quote the loan applications falsely inflated the number of employees and average monthly payroll for each of the four businesses resulting in larger PPP loans than Robinson would legitimately entitled would be legitimately entitled to obtain Robinson and our co-conspirators Shandra Norton also submitted false tax documents to support the inflated statements in each long application Robinson used the money she got from the loans to buy luxury items including a 10-karat dime a ring the DOJ said she also transferred some of the money to other family members and our co-conspirator Shandra Norton now according to the FBI they wrote this there was this op-ed that came out and so far they estimate that about 136 billion dollars has been has been fraudulent we given out to different businesses and I said they've been trying to crack down on this one of the interesting things is she also donated to Fannie Willis but this is what kind of got me you got all that money you only did a thousand dollars see like like people don't ever lift each other up man that's a problem huh they're not lifting each other up you on the day of a thousand she can go to fucking jail yeah yeah it's interesting though right yeah this woman steals 15 million okay that's pretty stupid just gonna say that all right like the government is gonna get you bro eventually they're gonna fucking get you eventually that's why there's that saying you know there's two things certain about life death in taxes they're gonna fucking get theirs so any of you motherfuckers that think you're gonna get around that you're more on bro so many we'd be much better off uniting in the fact that we should pay no taxes and force our government officials to pass laws so we don't have to get fucking raped but it's interesting how much how many billions of dollars 136 billion dollars so so how much of how much money have they stolen from us and sent to Ukraine about that okay how much money have they stolen us and sent to other places in the world how much money have they stolen to us that's filtered themselves filtered its way back into their pockets how much money have they taken from us where the our middle class is strapped 70% of our entire middle class is living paycheck to paycheck uh debts at an all-time high savings is at all-time low cash flows and an all-time low and they're putting people in jail for stealing money that they have no problem stealing every single day I that's what I think when I look at this for plexing yeah when I look at this it's like okay so yeah this woman stole seven stole 15 million dollars that's wrong but these people steal trillions of dollars and don't bad and I'd add it right right so no questions no it's insane no and people don't look at it like that like what gives these people the right to steal our money listen to thing too like I mean it's the the hundred and thirty six billion that that's our that's tax dollars yes that's also tax dollars yeah and dude these these things you know people don't look at it like this no if people really understand taxes we'd have unity we would have a revolution yesterday but people don't people don't they don't understand it well we're part of that too though I mean because like even from my perspective but like you it's that's shit they make it intentionally hard to understand for sure it's fucking how big is a tax code book yeah thousands of pages you know I'm saying they and then even just the language of how it's written you know and it's like there's no like I'm not reading that shit turbo tax easy well they don't even listen they teach people in school that and I used to believe this too that paying taxes is a patriotic duty which might be the case if we were paying a reasonable amount that didn't strap us to the point of where we could barely survive and made life so hard that we can't pay attention to the injustice that our own government is perpetrating against us yeah you know it was actually going that's correct it was supposed to be going yeah we had great looking cities and great looking infrastructure and low crime and a great economy you know I wouldn't have such a problem paying tax if that were the case and I think a lot of other people would feel the same way but the reality is is we shouldn't be paying the percentages we're paying we are literal tax slaves there is no other humans on the planet that are told you have the American dream your dream as you can go from nothing to something you could spend your whole life and you can become something you could build something you could do something and that's that's great you can but we're encouraged to go out and do these things and then we're punished by the oppressive tax code so yes they want you to go out and build so they could take half your shit right and you don't realize that until you're actually like very far deep in the process when you start to realize how much they actually take broke yeah they encourage you to go do these things so that you could be their little tax bitch and they can steal your money and then they can send it overseas and do funnel it back into their campaigns and figure out how to make it into their pocketbooks and bro these people are fucking criminals that's yeah and then get everybody else to hate you oh yeah yeah the rich people are the problem bro what the fuck are you talking about the very rich people are the problem the people in the top 0.000000000 one percent the people who build yachts so fucking big that they have to disassemble bridges in Europe to get them out of fucking harbor who are those people who are the people that own the most property in the United States who are those are the same people that go on there and say the rich got to pay their share knowing damn well they're not talking about themselves they're talking about turning their local struggling middle class person against their own community against the people in their community who are donating to revitalize the city who are sponsoring their t-balls teams who are driving a BMW right and they're sitting they're creating class warfare and then they're standing outside kind of laughing as everybody fights yeah and dude this is this is a problem that you know has to be fixed or our country won't survive it just won't yeah the math the math the way it is it won't work that it doesn't work yeah I mean that's one thing too like even just like on the macro level right well I'm sorry the micro level like just looking down at the individual communities but like I live in stainless city my entire life my entire life and say stainless city believe it or not it does generate a decent amount of tax money right because there's still some big businesses down there you know things like that and like I knew what my streets look like when I grew up like they look like fucking dog shit you know I'm saying the alleys the fucking garbage cans in the out like they look like fucking trash and bro I remember when I got my house because you know where I live at it's in it's its own we're unincorporated single-in-one county right which means that 100% of our tax dollars just about you ever take minus like the fire protection and shit goes right back to our little unincorporated single-in-one county and like I remember the day I was moving in bro job in a U-Haul and I turned down one of the main such subdivision streets they were repaying the streets and I'm like I don't think I've ever seen a street get like real line just the the yellow lines were getting fucking restriped I'm like I don't think I've ever seen that anywhere yeah you know I'm saying so it's like it just shows you even just on that micro level like when the shit's actually going someplace yeah I mean I play a decent amount of taxes where I live but I see it going to use you saying now you amplify that bro look at our fucking government people don't understand bro we could pay less than 10% tax and be living in Dubai in terms of quality of buildings infrastructure crime you see what I'm saying yeah dude we all have fucking colinons and when I say 10% I mean 10% total not income tax and that's how we should be living but they don't allow us to do that and you guys a lot of you guys don't understand why the reason they don't want you to be financially successful is because you're harder to control you're harder to manipulate when you are actually in a financially successful place and you're looking around and you can see all the fuckery that's happening right no so they want people just in that zone where they can just survive they can get a couple treats they can have net flicks they can have you know a nice Tahoe they could drive in a Jeep something that they're proud of they could compete with their neighbors on their financial you know where with all and what level they're at and other than that they don't care and so this whole demoralization has been happening for 20 30 years in this country and when I was growing up in this country dude we were we were not just told that we could be anything we want we were encouraged to be great we were encouraged to win we were encouraged to build great things we were we're encouraged to become the best possible version of us and if you look at a lot of these young people coming out of our school system you can tell that they are legitimately programmed to be unintelligent that like dude look at these videos where they walk around they say who was the first president of the United States and people who were in their 20s and 30s don't even know you know what I mean we haven't bro we have an uneducated and intentionally indoctrinated mass group of young people who have been bred to be stupid through the school system and it's a big problem dude and you know when we look at like the fundamental culture differences that have happened in this country over the last 20 30 years we we have to consider what was once celebrated and what is no longer celebrated because what was once celebrated was what built this country to be great and what is no longer celebrating what's celebrating in his place is what's causing this country to be in such chaos and disruption and I actually don't know a solution to it without total reformation we're going to have to have somebody that comes in the White House who literally fucking signs a bunch of shit into law and we fix a whole bunch of shit at once I mean dude these people in Congress and Senate these people are they have no want or will or desire with the exception of maybe a few to do anything good for us it is all about them being in a position of power so that they can you know milk the teeth of you know the financial windfall that comes from us breaking our fucking backs to build a life it's dude it's it's completely fucked the way it is it is man that's real shit that's real shit but we got to I actually got something because I think the people like the global humanity is starting to understand and wake it up a little bit and we're going to get into some of our headlines because we got quite a while I want to say this too before we get into the next one you know you guys just support Trump you need to be leaning on Trump he said oh we're gonna we're gonna reduce the taxes on uh what was it something he said this weekend we're gonna uh we're gonna take tax on tips that's what he said we're gonna we're gonna eliminate tax on tips bro you guys who who vote for Trump you need to be pressing him right now on removing income tax completely on getting us to a 10% all in everybody pays corporations pay individuals pay if you pay tax it's 10% if you don't fucking pay tax you don't get to vote those are things that people need to lean on Trump for because they will fundamentally fix our country the only way communism works is by creating so many people that are completely dependent on the government and then allowing them to vote okay so we if we eliminate their ability to vote because they don't contribute to the system in any way which is right why should someone who doesn't contribute to the system be able to vote you out of your tax dollars or to vote your standard of living into our lower place that's not okay and that's against the American dream that's against every single thing this country stands for so if you really want to fix what's going on remove the ability for people who don't pay in to vote okay and then reduce taxes to a manageable level and then cut the abusive spending that's happening by firing a shit ton of government employees and reducing the amount that we spend those three things need to be Trump needs to be leaned on for those things because he doesn't ever talk about it yeah and if he doesn't talk about it it's not going to change and if that doesn't change our country's not going to get better that's just real shit yeah that's real bro that's real guys jump it on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments uh with that being said let's get ready to cruise remember guys if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for sell it.com you guys can find them link there uh that being said headline number one um we got to check in global temp check here man because there is some interesting things happening around the world on a global stage um other governments um it is just interesting stuff but let's go check in on France and the EU uh to get things started off uh headline number one reads macron gambles on snap election to fight far right surge we're ready to exercise power um so this is something that's that's heating up that's going on uh over in France um and the EU let's dive into this so um straight out of Paris uh european elections are meant to be worthy uh but boring exercises and sensuous coalition building not this time a surge in far right populism in France uh provoked president Emmanuel Macron into calling a high risk national election that could determine the future not only of his country but of the european union itself across the continent it was uh a good if unspectacular night for center right and far right parties and a terrible one for liberals and especially greens but in France the far right national rally led by Eurosceptic and NATO skeptic firebrands uh completely crushed macron's liberal renaissance and all other contenders uh the national rally is on course to win 31.5% of the vote more than twice the 14.7% projected for macron's liberal renaissance party uh in a high risk gamble to regain the political initiative macron bet that voters will turn back the far right tide and show marine lapins national rally cannot win at the national level so what exactly does this mean so because France has a bunch of parties right um there's one two three four five six seven eight nine uh different parties not very bipartisan like we are here in the US um and so there there are percentages of what's needed to actually win or obviously we're gonna be a little bit lower um and this is just the graph just to show over the last year um it called it uh the polls of polls um that just shows the populism of each party and the steam that they've gained just in the last year yeah so the national rally is up there at 32% um the highest out of anyone's um and so by more than double by more than double and so what he his solution is um is what they call a snap election and they're gonna run that uh believe at the end of this month uh where there is a national election um and he doesn't believe that this is gonna stay like this he's counting and saying that oh I believe the people are gonna speak and they're gonna come back home where they belong um I don't think that's gonna be the case um or he knows how to cheat just like they know how to cheat here there's a thing you're talking about a 50% difference well can you cheat that we don't know how we don't know we'll find out yeah yeah because because uh I mean they they told us that a guy who lived in his basement got 81 million got 81 million votes most popular president of all time and a lot of people blasted people for saying that that was absurd and now they're like holy shit you know yeah you guys believe that you know why because you don't pay attention and you know why you don't pay attention because you're too busy fucking around with the Kardashians or fucking around you know uh I don't know what you guys do but you're not paying attention yeah yeah yeah so Marine Le Pen she's the party leader right um and she's come out and already said that uh the her party is ready to take power um and so she's extremely confident uh in in in this snap election that's gonna happen uh now that's going on in the UK um I'm sorry that's going on in the EU uh EU and again it's not just France is having the same exact uh you know phenomenon quote unquote happened Germany's also going through it right now um there there's a bunch of other countries that I actually see in the same exact trend in the people that are you know moved away from these liberal far left policies and and ideals um now here's something that nobody's talking about and I think this is this is probably in my opinion the biggest new story of the day we see what's going on in Canada right now oh bro listen um so uh this headlamp reads canada's parliament rocked by allegations of treason but this is juicy this is juicy we're talking like like juicy grape like juicy grape all right this is juicy uh so uh out of Ottawa uh the capital of one of the world's most stable democracies is gripped by growing panic about foreign agents working in elected office a bombshell report by Canadian lawmakers has unnerved parliament heel alleging that unnamed politicians have been covertly working with foreign governments the revelation and heavily redacted findings released this week by an all party national security committee adds entry to a separate and ongoing inquiry into foreign interference in Canada's 2019 and 2021 elections the new report from the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians uh is the first to suggest that lawmakers in Canada's parliament their current parliament by the way may have helped foreign actors metal and political campaigns and leadership races heightened anxiety in Ottawa about foreign interference comes in the middle of historic global elections where factors such as artificial intelligence and emboldened foreign powers are testing the resilience of democratic systems prime minister Justin Trudeau is one of the ones that is being alleged now he's been on the defensive since the allegations broke out today when the show was recorded uh conservative leader Pierre Palavir is calling on the government to name names quote the national security committee indicates there are members of this house that have no one leworked for foreign hostile governments Palavir said Wednesday quote Canadians have a right to know who and what is the information who are they the findings put pressure on Canada's national police force to investigate potential criminal charges their report also refills debate on the ability of the federal government's deterrents mechanisms to curb foreign interference in a country whose political and legal system is considered one of the highest performing in the world now here is an interesting take uh so the deputy prime minister Kristia Freeland told reporters Tuesday that she takes the issue seriously uh she deflected when asked if Canadians have the right to know the identity of the parliamentarians involved quote we should recognize this is a new time she said adding uh that authoritarians want to undermine democracies by sewing public distrust in government now isn't that interesting I think that's a very shady shady response no she's saying they don't have the right to know that's exactly what she's saying she's saying this is a new time we're in charge and fuck you that's what she's saying trust us yeah trust us and uh you've got Russian uh maybe maybe uh maybe warships and nuclear powered submarines right off the coast of Cuba and what have we got on all of this well I mean look this goes back to what we've been talking about for four years now I mean dude there's very clearly a global coup an attempt at a global coup that has happened and it started with the it started a long time ago but it came to a precipice with COVID um and all the countries that went along with it and all the countries that made up you know their rules that is all coming out now it was bullshit um we had elections during that time in 2020 a bunch of countries you know magically elected people who were in favor of these drastic lockdown measures which apparently nobody was wanting right um you know I mean dude this is this is what we've been talking about with the world economic forum and all these members being a part of it macron uh you know fuckhead from Canada our own administration you know and we see we see all this coming to a head now you know these people are caught these people try to pull a global coup to create a global communist one world government and now there's enough people in each of these countries calling them out and I think they're completely fucked yeah yeah I mean so there's that we're at we're at a tipping point dude yeah where they're either going to pull the mask off and go full blown communist authoritarian which means they will start killing people or two we're gonna win and they're all going to jail are worse and that's where we're coming to and the fact that they're you know trying to put Trump and jail and prosecute Trump and all these things that's only making people more aware not just here domestically but internationally as well so people are recognizing not just I mean in the United States yes a lot of people are recognizing it's wrong but not a lot of people are fully recognizing what we're dealing with which is a communist revolution it's been happening in this country for quite some time and people in other areas of the world who have been through a communist revolution understand exactly what they're looking at and they're thinking like damn dude america's fucked you know and they're they're saying I mean we see this from people in other countries saying this on television on the internet you america's don't know what you're dealing with you guys don't have any clue what's happening and they're right and it's because people have taken their eye off the ball here and people believe that we're always going to be free and everything's going to be okay and that this is some sort of normal political ebb and flow this isn't normal political ebb and flow the world's never been locked down like that there's never been a transfer of wealth like that there's never been an intentional third worldization of the United States of America as there has been the last three years and we're dealing with that now and people are starting to wake up I just hope that it's not too late you know that's where I'm that's where I'm coming it does seem like they're losing favors so like for them to stay in power is going to require force on their part so I'm looking for them to create mass amounts of societal disruption or attempt to right another pandemic which they already tried this last week I don't know if you saw this but the w-h-o tried to claim that some dude died in Mexico of the new bird flu and the and the guy and the guys in Mexico said no that's bullshit they're lying okay so they're these people the world economic form w-h-o the n-i-h all these people they're not a they're not being able to execute what they were trying to execute right they're not they're not trusted anymore so now you have people in these offices who four years ago were terrified to say anything who were now calling these guys on their bullshit so you know a pandemic a major cyber attack quote-unquote meaning a shutdown of the grid for an extended period of time a massive war you know you have Biden and Lindsey Graham talking about sending America troops to go into Russia now you know like these are all things that they will try to do and it's very important that people don't comply it's very important that people just say no we're not doing that and don't do it and we gotta stay on the call for for accountability that a man for it I think the thing is man like you know this country we we have just had it so good for so long yeah whereas like you said those other countries they are so much closer not just in time but just just simple geographic to communism yeah i'm saying they're very close to it yeah right we have we don't know what that looks like we don't really know what communism looks like we've never really seen it i know especially the younger generation we don't know what that stuff looks like well i think when people think of communism they have this very cloudy vision of it from like my age you know of the of the late eighties and then people older people older than me i'm sorry younger than me those people have been brought up to believe it's some sort of utopia or it's some sort of maybe it's fighting the man they think it's some type of like they think that everybody's gonna have enough and that bro and they don't understand like dude when the when communism comes in the government expands at a rapid pace the currency devalues at a rapid pace food becomes unavailable because the government is inefficient at doing anything so they make all these laws about where you can get food which they're already doing here in the United States and they create a scenario it all sounds good right like i'm not gonna work and government's gonna provide everything to me except the government doesn't provide everything to you like they say they're going to and in every situation that's ever happened where they've tried to attempt communism a good part of the population has ended up being slaughtered because these people fucking that's what they are they don't the these people are one hundred percent comfortable executing people who stand against them and the minute they get enough power to stand up on their own and they don't fear the resistance anymore that's where you're going to start to see genocides and things like that these things that these communists have done over and over and over again and real talk communist should all be fucking eliminated they've done this for a hundred and fucking two a hundred fifty years they've fucked the world up number of times they don't deserve space in this world anymore and anybody who identifies with these people should literally be and i know i sound like them but us free people have fucked up the entire world for the last fucking hundred fifty years i'm tired of fighting people like this okay everybody else is tired of their of their um lives in their world and and like dealing with these people these are people who won't contribute they will not contribute they will not fucking work they will they think that everything should be provided for them and they use the weakest most unproductive dumbest individuals to push communism through and then they kill them like they don't people that fucking say like you guys out here you know these like weirdos to say i'm a communist openly these people don't understand the minute the communists get empowered those people get killed no well they're fighting for their own the famine kicks in because i already malnourished yeah no shit but i mean dude like that's what we deal with here we deal with people who don't know what they're rooting for they don't understand the consequences of their actions they don't understand what's actually happening and what's actually happening here is that we've experienced for the last four years in our face a global coup for world government that is communist and that is what we're dealing with and we're starting to see that unravel across the world so it's going to be interesting what they do do they back off and save their asses or do they push hard and nobody complies and then their asses end up in the gallows which i actually think the second choice of what's going to happen because i don't think these people might know what's on the line bro not only do they know what's on the line but like if you watch someone like Hillary Clinton right Hillary Clinton believes that she is still like as influential as she was 10 years ago she still believes you could see it in the way she talks she comes out she laughs she smug she's got all these things coming out about her and she doesn't give a fuck why why would she not care why would she not give a shit that all these things are coming out about her it's because she believes she's above everybody else and these people are showing their arrogance they're showing what they actually thinking it's pushing people to the other side and people are starting to realize man these people actually fucking evil right and so these people they don't understand that their influence bro has has deluded and that's why like when when we talk about former leaders who have been executed like those guys in Romania no Nicolai Tuchescu you know that's why when you pull them out to shoot them in the firing squad they're still given orders so it's not that they're it's not that they're just bold it's that they're ignorant to the tide changing they can't tell that they don't care bro they don't give a fuck about anybody but their little echo chamber and they're in a special club we're not in it and they don't realize that the size of their club is getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and the size of the other club is getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and eventually these people are going to walk themselves right into prison or or worse for themselves because these people for the last 50 years have been dead set on conquering the world on creating a one-world government and it's not worked and it all it's done is created death and destruction and famine and pain and murder and all of this crazy shit and we don't need these people fucking with our lives we don't need these people fucking with our humanity that's my that is my opinion i love anything on this russia shit with uh i mean yeah bro like because i mean here's the situation i mean i don't know if like you know nobody really listened to him but but Putin just last week said you know that if it was found that Ukraine is using us made missiles into russia that there's gonna be a retaliation no shit and now all of a sudden you have you know russia right off the coast of uh florida in Cuba with multiple warships nuclear power submarine and that they're saying allegedly they're saying allegedly those nuclear power submarines will not be carrying nuclear weapons allegedly but they don't fuck i mean i guess they couldn't know right there's sensors and data that they know if you know nukes are moving around sure what do you think what happened if the population of the united states knew that there was a nuclear submarine with nukes off our fucking coast of course they're gonna say it doesn't have any nukes right right it's the same man that's pretty pretty close to fucking bc yeah and we're getting put in a dangerous situation because of these fucking old decrepit crusty thieves your family is at risk my families at risk our fucking way of life is at risk because these people want to steal our shit and nobody wants to stand up and say anything about or do anything or get engaged i still see people on the internet saying i'm not voting what the fuck is wrong with you okay you can have principles that says i don't believe in voting but here's the reality not voting in this election just allows those people to cheat even further if we don't vote there's no evidence of them cheating so you guys are okay with this letting this go in a full blown communism because i'm pretty sure none of you mother fuckers are Rambo i'm pretty sure none of you are Chuck Norris i'm pretty sure none of you were going to the fucking white house or whatever in handling business you think you're gonna live out in the fucking country on your four acres and your bullshit garden and those motherfuckers are gonna come take it you don't get it we have to vote we have to get engaged you every single person listening to this show should bring two or three other people to vote that normally wouldn't that mean that's what needs to happen we want to talk about action plan that's the action plan aside from the things we talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion right being fit being intelligent pursuing success pursuing positions of authority and power in your local government being good to people uniting with people these are the things they don't want we have to do all of those things that's our duty but when we think of like what we need to do outside of that we we have to get engaged we have to go vote and you need to be bringing every motherfucker you know that would normally not vote to the polls that's the truth we don't know how long how big they could cheat i don't you ask me can they cheat 50 points in France we're gonna find out you know we should treat the fuck hard i wouldn't be against i don't i don't think that that's unreasonable to think they might do that do you i mean listen i know this apparently the the the the French turnout is supposed to be pretty fucking okay but what if they don't even it up what happens if they do cheat yeah are they gonna full blown revolution because i remember when canado was revolting against fucking true dough and they just drove the trucks and parked the trucks okay yes i told you mother fuckers finished job back then you didn't fucking finish it now you deal with the same shit so is that what's gonna happen in France we're just gonna we're gonna drive some tractors and throw some shit on people you see what i'm saying they ain't gonna get it done mother fuckers no it definitely won't man guys let us know what you uh what what your thoughts are on this um let us know down in the comments with that being said we got a little bit more on the election to

better step up my game tell your mom i say fucking bring it okay fucking mom no i'll congrats man i'll appreciate you guys thank you guys for being a real ass fans keep liking keep subscribing keep commenting and uh we appreciate you guys let's keep this moving head on to two right back at it um talking about elections there's some interest in conversations happening across the country um this time specifically in Nevada uh headline reads Nevada has a plan to expand electronic voting that concerns election security experts in it weird isn't it weird that like any steps to further secure our elections which are already allegedly secure are deemed threats to securing our elections isn't that isn't that weird that that's weird i think you know what i think it's weird we think i think it's weird that these people that there's even a question that these people are cheating and that it's tolerated by anyone okay the idea of our country is that you guys have some ideas other people have some ideas people get to decide what ideas they want to go with for the country and because these people on the left have decided that their ideas are superior and that they know what's better for us than we know what's for us they have decided that they believe that winning means winning at all costs and it means ignoring what the people want these people believe that they know what's best for us and that we don't know what we want and so they have a duty by all means necessary to put their policies in play and maintain power and what they do is they try to scare everybody into being terrified of Donald Trump because they understand that if Donald Trump gets into power they're going to be held accountable for all the shit they've done illegally to maintain the power then nobody wants in the first place that's exactly what's happening man and like out of Arizona Nevada this is specifically has to do with the local Native American tribes that are trying to get access now to speak because they realize that the Biden administration has not done shit for their tribes and their their Native American reservations and now they want to make sure their voices get heard but because of their you know geographic locations voting in person can kind of be hard so what make a day out of it make a day out of it but now get your ass to the fucking polls I agree so the solution is like this encrypted form of electronic voting for those that are you know hours away from being able to vote in person and so and it's being fucking knocked down because they say it's gonna you know create new concerns for election security now it's interesting you know they're saying that it's high risk activity trying like I mean just just complete bullshit right even though this is the same exact system we already use for those people for military members activity military members who are stationed overseas use the same system trying to extend it to people on reservations in there they're saying no there's actually over 30 states it already and farm or I bet the most fighters were voting Democrat they fucking say do it exactly that's what they're afraid of but that's that's the point of it that's that's the point of it but you know our elections are secure right you know not like that uh that situation down in uh down in Georgia where you know the pipes burst it and they cleared the cleared the room at night after sending everybody home and then pulled some ballots under from under the table and we had video of it yeah and if you said hey I see the video of the lady bringing in the ballots and putting them in you're you went on a domestic terrorist list right yeah I mean here's the here's the clip this is when it was originally reported here it is at surface during a Georgia state senate hearing on possible election fraud is now raising some serious questions tonight the video was presented by President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani and his team now it is surveillance footage you're looking at it right now ballots are being counted after the presidential election the place at Atlanta Georgia it shows at about ten forty election night the observers were told to leave that the ballot counting had stopped for the night but once everybody had left except for the ballot counters watch what happens in the upper right hand corner of your screen they're going to stop counting they will wait until the witnesses over there in that roped off area the press and the observers leave the room then you'll see them move into action and begin scanning ballots yeah now you know according to AP news who did the fact check on this um they even reported you know they reported it in reality the footage showed some confusion that arose after election workers mistakenly thought they were done so I was about they just thought they thought they were done but they were they realized that they weren't weren't done after everybody had cleared clear the room yeah they had to bring in the suitcases right they weren't done right and remember remember the curve remember the vote curve everything everybody stop counting at fucking 3 a.m. and then Biden jumped straight up ahead of Trump and then won the election it's bullshit no it's total bullshit it's absurd that people even believe in a little bit like dude look at the fucking visible evidence Biden's in his fucking basement for a year doesn't come out he goes to speak at high schools they have 12 people 12 people in the crowd Donald Trump does 30 rallies up until the day of the election that are getting 70 80 90 100 000 people every single day and we're supposed to believe that this dude got 81 million votes do you understand what's happening when he shows up anywhere right now he's getting heckled he's being told fuck you Joe Biden you're a piece of shit and they're taking the fucking audio off the clips they're taking the audio off the clips so people can't see what's actually happening Trump can't walk down the fucking street because there's a hundred thousand people around him Joe Biden people are throwing fucking fruit at him like they did in the middle ages there you go right there that's exactly what happened and people are like oh we just got a bunch of votes it dude like how can you look at this dude Pete listen people knew that this was cheating and they went along with it because they're candidate one 100% now they dude they put people on a domestic terrorism list for questioning this now in another movement and I don't know if you've seen this but this is uh this is something new that just came out um is you know you mentioned you can't even question it you can't question it you can't talk about it uh you know the we all know that the rise of independent media like ourselves um has been on a major rise across the country because nobody believes mainstream media anymore um and so even with that they are now trying um and attempting to suppress the independent news um like us uh Spotify just came out their new uh new guidelines this headline reads Spotify gears up to silence political opponents under guys of election integrity political opponents to do exactly exactly yeah so Spotify's platform quote unquote Revan Lucianized content streaming as Spotify likes to remind us uh quote we are the world's most popular streaming subscription service with more than 615 million users uh the now sweet and based Spotify is positioning itself as a gatekeeper of election information rolling out a massive censoring machine targeting what the streaming giant deems as quote disinformation just in time for a US presidential election that has big money leftists uniting the key former president Donald Trump from returning to the White House sound familiar uh so on May 31st they revealed uh this this plan that they have i'm informing the world quote how Spotify is protecting election integrity in 2024 uh the plan sounds a lot like what big tech driven by constitution devouring federal agencies did in 2020 election uh social networks and internet providers shut down content claim to contain disinformation misinformation and the o'willian sounding mal information uh suppressing information from primarily conservatives criticizing and in many cases debunking official information as we now know much of the censored content wasn't wrong it was inconvenient truth to the swamp powers bit on interfering in the election um and now Spotify's doing the exact same thing so they've updated their policy they've never had one before now they do uh so they will be monitoring all content related to this and demonet um election interfering content so that comes with another swole of censorship so how so are they censoring uh pro-biden shit you know if i if i was a betting man if i was a betting man i'd probably say no dude there's this is a bigger problem than just Spotify this is a problem where the town square the public conversation and dialogue has shifted from in person over the last 15 years where you would go to a restaurant you go to a bar you'd go to a rally you talk to people to online which is created in a network of gatekeepers that is very small that are all incahutes together they're all friends the people who own all the big tech all the media all the streaming surface there there's like 50 people we're talking about here you can fit them all in a very small room all right and these people now control free speech globally so there has to be some sort of reformation happening within our government system to fix that problem because free speech can't exist if it's controlled by a small group of people like that right so i mean that's it like that's my quite like who who deems something as the truth what makes it the truth i have this discussion with a buddy in mind who's all you know about AI and shit and he's like the best thing about AI is that there's no misinformation i'm like well who programs AI let's ask AI some some bias questions and see what it says because all of AI is programmed to sympathize with the progressive left in almost every case right ask it about transgender ask it about white people it'll tell you how evil white people are asking about black people won't tell you shit it'll say oh i can't there's something to that huh there's things no i'm just saying there's all kinds of bias written into the program and uh you know so your question is correct what is truth and that's the point like if you go back and look at 1984 by George Orwell that's the point of what we're dealing with we're dealing with the disillusion of truth so that nobody can really know what truth actually is and remember this phrase that's been going around for the last decade or so my truth there is no such thing as your truth it's the truth there is a fucking reality and then there is everything else and you don't get to decide what your truth is against the truth of the world this is what the trans community fails to understand they don't understand you are what you are born as okay you are going to be what you were born as genetically your entire life and there's no way to change it and because you want to live your life as a different gender you expect everybody else to go along with you and you expect everybody else to bend their reality to fit quote unquote your truth well your truth is not true and everybody else knows it and then you try to tell everybody that they're bigots or they're bad people or their pieces of shit because they don't want to go along with your false reality okay and I'm not saying this to be impolite this isn't about politeness it's it if a grown adult wants to live however they live on give a shit but when you start bringing into schools and you start bringing into kids faces and you start jamming it down everybody's throat people are going to have a problem with it and they're going to say you know what I was being nice to you before because I felt bad for you but now that you're acting like this fuck off and that's what's happening no I'm just so crazy man it's you know now I don't know what the repercussions of the Spotify's move movies are going to this happen so they announced the policy on the 31st but nobody really paid attention because it wasn't you know why would they want this to get out but now it's trying to pick up a little traction today when we started so how how are they going to what what are they greedish based company well they already do this I'm fucking you too bro right there we do this people don't understand that they they will censor any show right now and throttle the traffic of any show that talks about Biden Trump fucking anything election wise anything whatsoever they will they will censor the show why do you think our fucking traffic on our YouTube on q and a f which has one fifth the comments has triple the traffic as our fucking cti episodes they already do this now they're going to start doing it on fucking Spotify on podcast platform okay so we can't talk about anything well that's the thing it's like that's the whole point of like bro it's elections like people should be able to not only talk about what they think is going to happen and what their beliefs are but they should be able to hear other people's believe they don't want that bro they want to reward content that's mindless they want to reward content that's like how many boogers can I pick in 24 hours you know what I'm saying look watch this Lamborghini go through the fucking shredder like this is mindless moronic fucking content that's getting rewarded with billions of views whereas the most important issues of our whole entire world gets censored and that goes along with the idea of they want us fucking uneducated they want us stupid they don't want us knowing what's going on hey guys uh forget the fact that we're stealing all your money forget the fact that we're removing truth from society forget the fact that we're not going to be held accountable forget the fact of all these other things that affect your day to day to day life we're going to Lamborghini going through the wood chipper see that's what the fuck is going on here they're intentionally trying to dumb down society by rewarding content that is mindless over content that actually helps people understand what's going on because that might go against their agenda guys jump in on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments uh that being said let's get to our final uh headlock head on the three uh head on the three reads Biden administration secretly tells border patrol to release migrants into United States despite Biden's executive order well Ted Cruz said this is going to happen nice long I'm not a I'm not a I'm not a Ted Cruz fan I'm not a fan of any of these politicians outside of Eric Schmidt and Andrew Bailey who are my homies squad yeah they are they're fucking real patriots real patriots bro Ted Cruz said this he said you're going to see over the next four or five months you're going to see Biden come out and say all this shit about how he's locking up the border he's securing the border only to buffer the resistance that he's been feeling and get people to believe that this is going to be the way they're going to lock the border up finally you know we got enough people here their their story is going to be we got enough people here to fill the jobs everything's going to be okay and then if they win the election or they cheat the election however they remain in power they're going to open the border right up again Ted Cruz said this on national TV and he got laughed at but this is exactly what he said he said they're going to come out they're going to make a symbolic gesture to close the border and then they're going to let the migrants come in anyway there it is exactly what happened that dude listen I'm not a Ted Cruz guy legit like have to shoot he says I'm like bro what the fuck yeah like you're so you come on here and Rand Paul you guys come on here and you sound real good what the fuck you actually doing you know what I mean but he said this he said exactly what's happening yeah and that that is exactly what's happened and the president Joe Biden's administration has instructed us border patrol agents to release illegal aliens into the United States from all but six of the more than 100 countries in the eastern hemisphere rather than deport them the Washington examiner obtain the memo that border patrol agents were given by Biden officials which comes immediately after Biden signed a week executive order on immigration last week that he claimed would shut down the border if it became overwhelmed even though he had previously said that he couldn't do it numerous officials elected leaders and security experts have warned that Biden's executive order solves nothing and is little more than window dressing the instructions the border agents were given quote contradicts what senior Biden administration officials told reporters in a column Tuesday would be the case for migrants from eastern hemisphere countries who travel through multiple countries without seeking asylum in order to reach the US referred to as extra hemispheric migrants so Anna Geotrelli she is the one that that blue came out on this report and um yeah they limited six countries uh that that that's not allowed to come in and they say which ones they are there is who's beckostan to jackestan russia jorge uh kyrgyzstan and moldova no china no china no Venezuela no Iraq this bullshit yeah this is the actual memo from from the actual border at patrol agent um yeah so uh yeah and we got on this i mean nothing i don't have anything more i've been saying the same shit for fucking four years now listen until we get engaged until you guys stand up and until you guys stop thinking that people like me and other people are gonna carry the water here and just speak up you know any messages i get on a daily basis from people are like bro i'm so thankful that you're speaking up and then i go to their page that says shit okay until you get engaged until you speak up until you stand up until you take some fucking action nothing's going to change nobody's coming nobody's coming to save you trump's not gonna ride in on his white horse nobody's behind trump we are in legit danger of losing this fucking country forever and you you guys think that like you know a couple podcasters and some you know people who don't it what happens when they start banning those people off the internet because that's the next move after this election people like me people like Joe Rogan we're gonna get eliminated from the internet okay just like they're doing to Alex Jones then what then what are you gonna do okay posting memes doesn't get it done posting some comments on twitter doesn't get it done getting engaged in real life gets it done taking action getting involved in your community i can't come to your community and go to your school board meetings i can't come to your community and get involved in who's running the local offices or the state offices or the county offices i can't do that Joe Rogan can't do that other people you follow these people are lying the patriots they can't do that either you have to do it i said this a hundred times all right they want you fat so that you have to take their medicine when you're sick okay so what can you do be fit so you don't have to take their medicine they want you fat so you have to lay at home and watch their streaming services pay for all the shit make them much money what should you do you shouldn't do that okay they want you stupid they want you watch a Lamborghini shredder videos instead of understanding what the fuck is going on you shouldn't do that okay they want you to treat your neighbors like shit they want you to treat anybody who looks differently than you like shit shouldn't do that either we have to be the opposite of everything that they want we have to be strong wealthy intelligent hardworking unafraid courageous American people the people who built this motherfucking country we need to become that is our time to do that what else do we need to do oh we need to get engaged in our local systems we need to get engaged in our local politics we need to get engaged in what's actually going on in our communities if we don't do that we will lose period your kids will be fucking slaves and i don't mean slaves like we're slaves where they're just taxing us a lot i'm talking about actual slaves so like i don't understand where the disconnect here is this people have to get engaged they have to get involved when it comes time to vote you should be taking fucking five people with you to vote that would never not normally go vote these are things we have to do these are obligations as as a citizen for us to fucking do and participate in people have died for us to protect what they have created for us and our generation and when i say our generation i don't just mean mine i mean the entire group of Americans that exist right now we have lost sight of the fact of the price that has been paid for us to have this country and we are doing an abysmal job of protecting what has already been created for our benefit which means we're failing the future generations of Americans so instead of bearing your head in some porn or in some fucking video games or in some Netflix why don't you get your fat ass together start making some money get fit get healthy treat people right do the right thing get engaged in your community and start being an American the other Americans going to be fucking proud of that is what needs to happen because unless we fix the culture we can't fix anything that's the reality everybody thinks there's some thing that's going to happen okay let's say there is some revolutionary force that comes and takes over and fucking says all right America is going to be awesome America ain't going to be awesome until its individual people are awesome and its individual people have been beat down so hard socially culturally and physically and mentally that they don't believe they can even be great anymore we have a bunch of people who are fucking we have 500 pound people on health magazines okay the propaganda couldn't be any more in your face why do you think they promote body positivity the way that they do why do you think they promote being humble the way that they do because they don't want you have any money bro they want you to villainize people who have money because they know if you don't have any money then you have to fucking use them to survive all of this shit fits together until people start realizing this and taking an actual individual responsibility for representing what the citizens of this country are supposed to represent nothing will change and there's enough people that listen to this podcast if everybody took initiative to do what I'm talking about we will create the change that needs to happen in this country at least in this country I know that guys jumping on this conversation let us know what your thoughts are let us know down in the comments with that being said let's do our final segment of the show we got thumbs up or dumb's fuck now this is what bring our headline and we talk about it it'll get one of those two options that means that our thumbs up or dumb is fuck reads by North Korea launched another salvo of trash balloons towards the south have you seen this yeah I did but they did it again oh they haven't stopped okay I haven't stopped so cold war aerotectics are in vogue again at the world's most heavily armed border in recent days North Korea has sent roughly 1300 balloons carrying plastic bags full of cigarette butts scraps of used paper and cloth and other trash towards the demilitarized zone that separates it from South Korea they felt a mention these these trash balloons also carry shit like human shit they're filling them up with shit inflow these are the most recent salvo came overnight Saturday when 80 of the 330 or so balloons wafed it into South Korea here's a couple of pictures of these trash balloons I love how they're in like explosive gear making sure yeah but so far the south thord is the South Korean authorities have found nothing hazardous in the materials dumped by north the south some military dismissed initial reports that the North Korea balloons were carrying human waste but they actually they're just lying they definitely like I there there's plenty of pictures that they show that diapers are fulfilled with shit and put in those bags but the response from the south is also unusual it's turning on its loud speakers on the border to bombard North Korea with kpop that's the response isn't that like their backstreet boys well punganum style used to charge recent you music make your people happy and dance this is the most like this is the most respectful no this is like legit like a neighbor feud like I'm gonna throw my fucking my I'm gonna throw my beer can over your fence uh

say look at what they do to people in the US they fucking make them work their balls off they take half their money then they fucking poison their water then they fucking put vapors in the sky and then they tell them they fucking free and they all laugh is that what happens over there because like bro like I mean I'd we get worse the music played at us yes sure game styles the shit too that's a

you know would you rather have chemicals in your water vapor trails in the sky and half your money stolen or would you rather have your government throw back a trash in your yard once a week I'll be okay with the trash me too I'll be okay with the trash yeah I think everybody would so I'll take the kpop too yeah kpop real bad actually people need it people need to wake it no he doesn't people need to wake up people need to wake up to the amount of abuse that our own government puts on us it's bad of women's syndrome bro yeah it's ignorance too I think that's what we're going ignorance too if you tell look man if you tell people they're free over and over and over again over and over and over again they're whole entire lives for 40 fucking years 30 years 20 years they're gonna believe it you see like you you if you took a person and you put him in a room and you came in every single day for their whole life they never left the room ever and you came in and you said how you enjoying your freedom this is amazing isn't it and they were nice to you and then every once in a while they gave you like a good dinner and every once in a while they let you do something cool you're like fuck dude how cool is freedom would you believe it and that's us that's what we're living like the concept of freedom 240 years ago was a very noble concept but over the last 240 years like all free societies has been corroded by tyrants and if you read the constitution and you read what our country is about these people thought of these things but the solution to that was to make the constitution something that the citizens didn't understand and now we have an entire citizenship that doesn't even understand what our country was founded upon thinking that we live in the greatest country in the world when we factually do not we statistically do not that's not reality I love America I believe in what America could be I'm not when I look at the American flag and I say that's our fucking flag I believe in what that flag should and could represent not what it currently represents there's a big difference it's okay to look at your own house and say I don't fucking like my house right now I'm gonna fix it up and make it nice and that's what we need to do as American citizens yeah we need to start realizing that we have been lied to and we've not just been lied to a little bit we've been lied to a lot all right maybe even more than I understand maybe it's a lot more we don't know how bad it is because everything's a lie we're kept in the dark about everything who gets to decide what we can and can't know why is there such a thing as classified information why are secrets kept from us because these people are doing such bad shit that they feel the need to do that because they knew if we knew what the fuck was going on we'd do something about it and that needs to change we need leaders who are comfortable with transparency we need leaders that will go in there and be like yeah you want to know here's what it is here's what it is here's what it is here's what I'm gonna do to fix it for the betterment of all of us that's what we need it's real man guys I need
