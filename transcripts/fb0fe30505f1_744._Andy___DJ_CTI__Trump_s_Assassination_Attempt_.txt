What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realest say goodbye to the lives, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today. We have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking internet. That's what we're going to do. We're going to cruise the internet. That's what CTI stands for. We put topics up on the screen. We speculate on what's going on. What's true. What's not true. And then we talk about how we the people that solve some of these problems going on. Now we got a lot of talk about because we've missed a couple days. I apologize for that. But we're going to get you today and tomorrow. So let's get right into it man. What's up. Hey, pay the fee. Yeah, show the show. Otherwise you'll die. I mean, we all will at some point. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, you just doubt without sharing the show. That wasn't a threat. It was just a fact. Yeah, no, I get it. MSNBC. What's up. That's cool. Oh man. There obviously is a lot to cover. A lot has happened in the last few days. And you know, at first I was kind of like, like, man, we got to hop on this. But then I'm like, I mean, and this has been the case for a lot of this stuff. There is so much bullshit that comes out. Yeah. Right. And like, I'm kind of glad we waited. I'm glad we waited too because like, you know, it's so, you know, it's very important man. Like we're in a day and age. I mean, there's a lot of stuff that comes out. Man, like, I mean, I remember that was like, they had one due. They posted as like being the shooter. He was like, some overweight Mexican guy. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, oh, he's a thief and all that. It's like sometimes, man, you just got to like, just give it a second. I think that's part of the problem in the news right now. And so it's part of like the intentions. Oh, yeah. They want you to jump to all these different conclusions, which confuses people to where there's so much information. They can't know what's true and what's not true. I think that's their fix of like knowing that, you know, the spread, they can't stop the spread. So they just infiltrate the spread with just bullshit. Yeah. Intentionally to fuck people up. Yeah. I think it's important. I take our responsibility very seriously. I know there's a lot of people listening. So it's important that we give the facts, you know, and then we deduce from there. But lots of cover, man, lots of cover. We're going to get into it. But before we do, I think I might have found my favorite person on the internet. Yeah. Who's that? And it's not a deep way to do it, but not in that sense. Yeah. It's a dude, but not in that sense. Yeah. Well, it's not. It's not. Yeah. Well, let's try to explain. You try and tell us something. Listen, I mean, it has been a minute. Yeah. Sorry, mama. No, man. This is sorry, mom and dad. Yeah. Well, just, unlike Toby Sticks, just mom. Toby Sticks my favorite game. My favorite guy on the internet right now, this is this happened at the RNC, actually. Yeah. It was the moment when a man wearing a shirt with a very controversial question, trolled a CNN news reporter who was broadcasting live at the RNC. So CNN report from the Republican National Convention was almost derailed when an attendee video bomb, the reporter with a very off-message t-shirt. DC reporter, Christian Holmes was delivering a piece to camera from the Milwaukee Conference Hall on Donald Trump security arrangements when the man slipped into frame to reveal the question, where is the Jeffrey Epstein client list? And I love, like, let's just watch a clip. I got the clip for you. Let's roll it. Campaign, new and win because I have talked to a number of people who have been on the ground with the former president in recent days and weeks who had no idea. Now, one thing you remember, president of the whole community, I have made a security to he has been with the same detail for years. He is very mean. I love to initially, you see the camera man trying to like get it out. This is what happens when these people venture out from their little bubbles into like reality. The real world. Yeah, the real world, man. That guy don't give a shit. That's my new favorite human that I like that guy. I bet that guy is so fun to drink beer with. Oh, I guarantee you. I guarantee you, dude, you're having a great time and it's going to end with you getting trouble. Good old keys comes around. That's a fact. Yeah. Yeah, we were having a great time until I guarantee you like he playing like he knew he was going to do that. You have the shirt ready to go ripped open the buttons. Well, that's a very astute observation from you DJ. Yeah. You have the shirt ready to go. I'm saying like I know it was a whole walk through Kavo that morning when he was getting dressed. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I'm fucking with seeing that. He playing that out. That's your correct. Good job, buddy. I give you an A. Let's talk about some other stuff that was playing down. You know who my favorite person on the internet is? Yeah. Probably me. Yeah. What? I'm a likable guy. You're an likable guy. Yeah. I like you. I like me too. You know, I like you too, bro, which is not as much as I like me. Same. Dude. You know what, Lista? I want to see the list of all the people that shorted true social stock. Oh, man. Do I got? I got that. Oh, I don't have a list. See, this is the benefit of waiting for a minute and taking a breath. We'll get into that in a minute. There's always stuff that comes out, man. There's always stuff that comes out. I think that would be an interesting list. I think I would almost rather see that list at this point in time than the Epstein list because we already know who's on the Epstein list. Yeah, we know. We know. I'll be willing to bet. I'm willing to bet. It's somebody who makes a lot of money on the stock market every other single time. I bet it's somebody who's trading portfolio outperforms one buffet. I was going to say I guarantee you the list of the DJT stock shorters is the same list. No, she has to know. I'm just saying. We'll see. But, man, let's get into this. Let's get into these headlines. If you want to see any of these pictures, headlines, videos, articles, links, go to antifacilla.com. You guys can find them all linked there for you. With that being said, the moment you all have been waiting for headline number one. It is interesting. And obviously, this is a real situation. We're covering the Trump shooting. I got a lot of stuff here. But I want to call this out because this is a comment that we've been seeing that I've been seeing the guys and us, you know, digging through our comments on social media. Is this, and I know you've gotten this comment too a bunch of times. And do you call it? Well, that's not all I called. I've called every single thing that's happened for the last four years with the exception of two. And it's time you start putting some respect on my mother fucking name because I'm going to be real. And I've got another mother fucker out here that's called this shit the way I've called it. Period. That's it. And the only way that knows the people know that is if you guys tell them that. And I think it's funny how there's all these people out here who have been way behind the news cycle who are getting all this credit and clout. Yeah. And it's like, dude, what are you talking about? I just said that a year ago. You know what I mean? Well, I'm like, and I can say this to me. Like knowing you like this is not like, I know you don't say that to, to brag or boast or like, no, I say that because it's fact. Well, I mean, but not even that, man. It's just maybe brag a little. I mean, I'm be a little bit. Yeah. But I mean, like on the serious note, man, it's like, you know, being able to see that shit like the hopes is enough people listen that we can kind of prevent this shit from happening. Yeah. Like, that's the real hope, you know, and like people, well, I don't know if you could prevent that from happening. I mean, that was, you know, look, dude, this, first of all, I got to, I dig it a lot of comments about that. Yeah. We have, you know, I posted that, the story of all those clips. Dude, we have a hundred more clips of me saying that. Yeah. You know what I mean? And pretty much everything. But I tell you this, it ain't over. No. They're going to try again. The plan is still in play. Yeah. But let's get in there. So the idea here, I put together some, some, some hardcore facts where I dispel some of the misinformation that has been out there because we don't miss information here. And, you know, and then get in there. Let's have an open, real discussion on this, man. And let's talk about some things that, you know, just don't make sense. So obviously, Donald Trump, he was shot at a rally on July 3rd. Now a bro is catch up packs. That's what it was. When he hit his ear, it was catch up packs. Yeah. The secret service came in, gave him blood packs. Yeah. Trump set it up on his own to get shot. Yeah. And, you know, it was a huge false flag and then they killed two of the fans to make it look normal because that makes perfect. Yes. The guy didn't even shoot it. It was, it was totally fake. It was catch up. It's fucking insane. On side note. Now wait, didn't Alex Jones get fined a billion dollars for saying that for saying that just that, a shooting just like that was a hoax. He did. A billion with a B. Now I know a lot more people and they were children passed away in the other shooting. These are real people, but it was just as real. Yeah. So are we going to find all of these leftists who keep saying it's a hoax, a billion dollars each? Like we should. I mean, I think we should give him the choice. I think the choice is we can either forgive Alex Jones's one billion dollars or you can have a billion dollar fine as well. Whatever the choice is. You call that. Is that karma? What do they call it? And that shit comes back around, bro. It's fucking anyway. Let's dive into this man. So obviously there's a lot of questions. Trump, he was at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13th. They have the shooter. Shooter was killed on site. Shooter was a 20 year old man by the name of Thomas Matthew Crooks. FBI is allegedly investigating this, which I have zero faith in. I want to preface this to just from my own personal stake. I don't think we'll ever know the full truth of this situation. I really don't. I got to, there's not a lot of hope there because the people who are invested, I mean, like, second investigating yourself. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. I'm going to invest, I'm going to invest to get myself for stealing. I didn't find nothing. Yeah. That's right. I found it. Where'd you get that $10? I found it. I didn't find that. No. That was actually never $10 at all. Where'd you get that bite? Never existed. I was shaking. Jason gets pissed every time it comes in. That fridge gets lighter and lighter. I mean, we take all his grapes out of there. I could have swore. I just put it back in there. Jason's only one that's got grape. You actually never had the pack to begin with. Jason's only one that obviously has the grape in the good can. So we go out there and take it. Yep. Sorry, Jason. But, yeah, man. So Trump was shot in this rally. There were an individual who went to the rally as well, David. You know, I got an idea. Let's move this to the end of the show. Okay. Yeah, because now I'm just kidding. Everybody's waiting. It's such a asshole. Yeah. They're right now. They're like, you the fuck you do it? Yeah, right. Um, but, uh, you know, there was, there were some victim. There was a victim who died, died, died from this rally. Cory. They died on the spot. Yeah, he was killed instantly 57 year old man. Um, and, uh, two other people were, were critically wounded. They're still fighting for the lives in the hospital. Um, and there's a lot of questions here. A lot of, a lot of questions. Um, now, there's the problem that I've been facing is that there's like these, you have these parts. You have secret service. You have local law enforcement. You have state level law enforcement there. Um, who, you know, that's typically how these events go. They augment, you know, parameters of the security, right? Um, and it's like everybody saying something a little bit different, you know, secret service initially was saying it was manpower issues and it wasn't manpower issues, but then it was manpower issues again. And it's like, there's this back and forth. And it's again, it's hard to know what exactly the truth is on, right? And now I have friends in these agencies. You have friends in these agencies. We have listeners, fans of the shows that listen to the watch. The listen to these episodes that are in these agencies. And then we have people that aren't friends. Listen to the show that are in these agencies. Hey guys, you know, but like I feel like I've been able to build a pretty decent understanding of what happened and like, you know, there's still a lot of questions that I have. I'm sure you have that just don't make sense. Um, now, I remember initially they reported that they had a cell phone, but they couldn't get into it. And my first initial thoughts was like, well, it shouldn't be that hard. You guys probably set the fucking pass go to it. You know, but I also thought two men, it's like, you know, how easily they are able to investigate, you know, Christian families that go to church, you know, how easily they are to investigate people that, you know, peacefully protested at, you know, capital hill, you know, but all of a sudden we're having issues on the intelligence gathering side. And we can't crack a iPhone, make zero sense. For those of you guys that don't know, it's how simple that is. They literally just plug in a USB cord to that phone and it will download everything off of there. They're bullshit. You're on that. Um, and I know that for a absolute fact. Um, but there, there's talks of these transmitters. He had bombs in his car and his home, um, you know, and again, it's just been this back and forth, uh, you know, who knows what the fuck's happening now. You got Department of Homeland Security who oversees the secret service who reports directly to Biden, Biden administration. They're opening their own investigation inside of this secret service is doing in their investigation. FBI is doing their investigation. Congress is also, um, started a congressional hearing, investigatory committee, um, on this as well where they've already subpoenaed, uh, the director of the FBI director of secret service, uh, director of DHS as well. Um, there's a lot of stuff going on here. One of the myths I wanted to dispel quickly here too, um, this, uh, you know, a lot of people thought it was these two stipers on the roof that actually, no, they turned fire. Yeah, they didn't even shoot. They never shot. There was a building. So there was a identical building. Cap basically the opposite side of the stage that they were on, right, they shot from a lot of pictures of videos of that. Right. Oh, that, that have been released. So on the side where he got ushered off, there's a building behind that. And that's where they shot from. Right. Um, so these countries actually like seem like it was a much longer shot. But yeah, yeah. Um, but if you look at that, if you look at the angles, huh, they had a small around too. Like that. It was a 308. Yeah. Like, no, that's 308. Well, that's a 300, that's a 300 wind mag. And it's 308. They get killed and with a 308. Oh, shit. Yeah. I watched it. It was on a field craft survival's YouTube. They did a really, really, really good end death breakdown. Yeah. I watched it right before the show so that when you said shit that I could say, no, that's wrong. Like that. Um, you know, but, but here's the interesting thing, man, there's more reports coming out and they're now saying that, you know, they actually knew about this guy three hours. Yeah. Before he fired the first round. Yeah, his parents actually called the police and reported him missing. His parents did call the police. Yeah. Um, and not only to report a missing, but saying like, hey, we're worried about this guy. Yeah. Some things wrong here. Something's not making sense. You know, so there's a bunch of reflects. There's actually a video of Thomas. Um, about an hour before the shooting and you can, you can literally see him scoping out the video. Uh, the, the building. Here's the clip. He's literally scoping out the building that he went on top of. Yeah. Right. Now, I mean, Andy, you've had security for five years. I do your security, right? We do these events. And my body didn't even do an advance. They had no events. They didn't do an event. Dude, we do advances. So just so you guys understand what an advance is, that means like your team goes to the location that you're at figures everything out. Like before you ever even get that, okay. And usually they'll do it like a week ahead of time. And then they'll make a report and then they'll say, okay, here's the procedure of how this works. Just so you understand how ridiculous it is for them to not do an advance. We do advances before I go to dinner. Okay. For me, we do advances before I go to fucking dinner. So you're going to tell me that for the president of the United States, they're not doing an advance for a fucking speech. It's complete bullshit. It is. It's complete bullshit. And like even just in the simplest times, the whole point for an advance is like, don't you want to know the lay of the land? Wouldn't you want to know the weaknesses? Wouldn't you want to know the doors and the entrances and like, wouldn't you want to know that information? Right? Like that's why I do it. That's why we do it. I don't get to do the advances. I rely on my team that goes down ahead of time or wherever the fit. And they report to me, I DJ, this is what to expect. Here's pictures, here's videos. Here's blueprints like I get all that information. So that way, at least when I'm getting there when we arrive, I have some familiar and there's all kinds of reasons for that. There's, you want to know where the threats could come from. You want to know how to get out of there. You want to know, you know, how does it flow? Where do we need to move? Something where to happen, right? Right. And like, I mean, this is a basic, I mean, when you talk about getting into to, to protection and this is like one on one. Like this is the fundamental foundation, like tactic that you learn. Like this, what, that's what makes great because our whole job is to prevent things from happening. Right. The only way you can prevent things is by finding out and knowing your unknowns. Yeah. Right? Like this is like, it's complete bullshit. It makes zero sense to me, zero sense. And you know, I want to show this clip too because it's pissed off a lot of people. And you know, we know what the polls are saying. I got those a little bit later, but do you see this clip real quick? Now I'm just going to tell you motherfucking niggas straight after dark. Don't fuck with my motherfucking president. Do you understand me? Niggas, we ride with Donald Trump over here. Niggas, Drake, oh, we ain't playing with you motherfucking niggas. You understand me? Keep my motherfucking president name out to mouth. Fuck niggas. The saying, you let's just show. I mean, I just, I like that guy. Just saying now, bro, see, this is what I'm saying. That's America. We got something in common. Bro, I guarantee you we had an hour. That dude would be a blast. I mean, great time literally. Get higher shit. Yeah, leave her kids. Yeah. No, it'd be like the other guy. It all started out fun and games. Bro, those two guys in the room. Yeah. Yeah. No, but like, dude, that's so funny. Dude, what? Keep my president's name out your motherfucking mouth. Fuck niggas. But, you know, it's good to see though. Oh, it's good to see. It's really good shit, man. And I'm like, listen, I'm glad I'm glad Trump's okay. Did you see how many people have been getting fired from their jobs for saying fucking amazing? Dude, you know what? I'm anti-cancel culture, but these people have gotten away with this shit for so long. And they get everybody else fired for all kinds of shit. Fuck you guys. No. That's what I feel like too, bro. I'm not with the shit no more. I don't get what I've gone from this fucking place that I've been over the last two years to this other place. Like, almost a little bit of radicalization. And dude, it just is what it is. I'm sick of the shit. And I'm sick of these people thinking they could say, do, behave, insult, threaten, get away with everything. And dude, this is the reason they feel comfortable doing this is because it's been this way for 15 years. No problem. They could say anything. Like dude, you got Kathy Griffith holding up Trump's head. You got Snoop Dogg. You got all these people talking about, you got Johnny Depp talking about assassinating the president. You got Madonna talking about it. You got Maxine Waters talking about it. You got Biden saying that it's time to put the crosshairs on Donald Trump. You got all this, bro, listen. They didn't just instigate this. This was them. And as we watch the honor and see this week, we need to keep in mind that it was meant to happen without Donald Trump there. So when you guys see all these right wing conservatives come out on stage and talk about, affiliating and aligning themselves with Israel and Israel's first over America, that was supposed to be the message before Donald Trump survived that. Just so we're clear. Anyway, keep going. Yeah. Now the Secret Service Director, this Kimberly Cheetle, who I also have inside information, she will most likely not be the director by Friday. Just putting that out there by a source who would know. Yeah, there are replacements. The only issue is that she is literally in the pocket for Biden. She worked on his protection detail when he was VP, left Secret Service went to Pepsi and now it's back in Secret Service as the director. But she's like going back and forth and kept out of Fritos, Af. That's what it was. Yeah. You know, but she's, it wouldn't be too safe around you, huh? What's that? Those chili cheese Fritos? I don't fuck with them. Not a big fan. You probably like the hot ones. No. So I fuck with Sundance. I don't even know what that is. That's some black, that's some black. I like those chili Fritos. Those things are fucking good. Yeah, they're chili cheese Fritos, but they're just hot. Oh, that sounds, what do they call Sundance? Are they Fritos? Sundance Fritos? I read how I'm red hot corn chips. Oh, yeah. I seen those before. I saw them down the hill. Yellow bag, bro. Yellow bag. I was downtown St. Louis, I saw them. But she's starting a backpedal on some of her statements. And I think it's also interesting. She's done a few different interviews with mainstream media. Well, she shouldn't have done any. She should have done any. But all the ones that she's been doing are all with left-leaning media sources. CNN, ABC, MSNBC. And she's not like, neither here nor there. But now she's taking this tone that secret service is taking full and sole responsibility for security of the Trump rally. Initially, it was, oh, that was a local police department's response. They were outside the perimeter. Which is complete bullshit. Complete bullshit. So you're telling me 120 yards outside the perimeter? Right. That's it. That's all we got. Got it. And so like I said, there's just been a bunch of bullshit. Now, to your point, these leftists have been losing their minds. Completely losing their minds. And not just these weirdo ZZM's A's on Twitter and stuff like that. I mean, notable figures. Media sources, representatives in our own current Congress are unhinged. Completely out of the fucking election. I knew. We got this guy, representative Stephen Woodrow. It was out of Colorado. The last thing, quote, the last thing American needed was sympathy for the devil. But here we are. Where people like this, the Senator London Lamar, she says, quote, while I am praying for former president Trump and hopes he makes a full recovery, the extremism from the Maga regime has brought us to this moment. What extremism has the right shown? Well, that's all that's exactly what, I mean, bro, this is how to Saul Inske's playbook. You accuse them of what you're doing. Right. Because I mean, I mean, it's not there. They have not yet seen anything fucking extreme. No. Oh, yeah, there's been, they've seen a lot of restraint. I think I would argue too much. Well, I agree, but that's what they've seen. And then it's, it's, look, these people are the least capable and the least equipped for the war that they're calling for and the violence that they're calling for. They're not ready for it. No. People, we've been holding restraint back forever. Like you haven't seen any extremism, bitch. Not at all. No. You know, you got people like Rachel Maddow. Let's check in with what she had to say. Look back at that whole string. Going all the way back to the 1800s is that the motive of the person committing the violence is never relevant. Very true. The act of violence itself, ends politics, turns it over into crime and makes the views and the motivations of the shooter irrelevant. Everybody in politics, no matter where you are ideologically, must unite around the idea that violence is unacceptable. And it's unacceptable both when it comes to targeted stuff like this, but it's also unacceptable when you try to incite that as a way of getting things that you want that you can't get through political means. So it's true in terms of violent rhetoric. It's true in violence orientation toward the idea of confrontation with your fellow Americans. And of course, it's true in the case of some sort of insane event like we saw on Saturday in Pennsylvania. And I just feel like it was this. It's a very, I mean, obviously we're all very grateful that President Trump was not more seriously hurt. She can't even say that straight. Absolutely. She's shattered by the fact that somebody was killed. Somebody was killed. People were put in the hospital very seriously hurt. But I'm hoping that the one positive thing that come out of this is some sobriety around the idea of violence in politics being no fricking joke and nothing that. Two important things here that she said. One that the motives are irrelevant. I disagree. No, the motives are all that's relevant. I think it's extremely relevant. Yeah. And the motive is you fuckers have created so much angst and so much hate and so much division and so much radicalization around Donald Trump with all of your shit. You got your read sitting there. You got Rachel Maddo sitting there. You got these dudes on the morning Joe who got kicked off the air for a day and then came back and said, oh, if they do that again, we're going to quit. We're going to quit. Yeah, go where? Yeah, quit. Yeah, where are you going? You go start a podcast. Nobody's going to listen to. No. Ask Rachel Maddo how that is. Yeah. See how that works for me. Yeah. But like, you know, and it's not this, you know, this whole thing of like now they want unity. Now they, what does this call for unity now for? It's called fear. When two days ago, it's called fear. Is that what that is? Yes, it's called fear. It is complete bullshit and I don't buy it. You know, and then I look at, you know, people like this. Have you seen this clip? Mm-hmm. Apparently, I just noticed a tattoo. Apparently she's radioactive. Clearly. Sorry. Let's listen to what this person had to say. Absolutely. You guys are out here on the heels of the attempted Trump assassination. Can I get your reaction to what happened the other day? Well, it's a shame the person missed. But it's ironic that the shooter was also Republican. And I am scared about political violence. You're scared of political violence, but you was, I'm scared of political violence, but I'm sorry that he missed. And then the shooters are Republican. The shooter's not a Republican. The shooter registers Republican to vote in the fucking primary. It didn't vote in. Yeah. So I think that's interesting. Or even let's check him about it. And you mentioned Biden, right? You know, Biden, apparently according to him, he hasn't engaged in any type of inciting rhetoric. Trump has. And he's just talking about threats to democracy. He did an interview with Lester Holt on NBC News. Let's watch this clip real quick. And so the focus was on what he's saying. And I mean, the idea, but have you taken a step back and done a little soul searching on things that you may have said that could incite people who are not balanced? Well, I don't think, look, how do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real when a president says things like he says, to just not say anything, he's a man, he's somebody. Look, I have not engaged in that rhetoric. Oh, he's defending, he's defending, engaging in that rhetoric. And then the next breath saying he doesn't do it. Doesn't do it. Doesn't do it at all. Guess who got receipts though. Let's read some of these. And you want to read them? Sure. Where do we start? Donald Trump and Maga Republicans are a threat to the very soul of this country. Trump is the greatest threat to our democracy. Trump is a genuine threat to this nation. He's a threat to our freedom. He's a threat to our democracy. He's literally a threat to everything America stands for. Trump is a threat to democracy. We cannot let him win. I'm a Madison, Wes Conston talking to folks about what's at stake in this election. Trump poses many threats in our country. The right to choose civil rights, voting rights, and America standing in the world. But the greatest threat he poses is to our democracy. If we lose that, we lose everything. You know what they're talking about when they say their democracy, right? Like we've talked about this on the show for years. They're talking about their communist Marxist plan. That's what they're talking about. And yes, he will destroy that. This is a constitutional republic. Okay, it's not mob rule. And we've gotten to mob rule over many, many, many, many years because of us not even understanding how this country's supposed to be running the first place. But that's neither here nor there. No, it's completely bullshit. This is due definitely. They did this. Now here's a monkey wrench. I didn't really see them playing. Like I mean, I felt like this was a car on the table that, you know, okay, sure, maybe they're trying to play it. But like they wouldn't play that, right? No, they're definitely playing. It was I ran, I ran's fault. You know, I ran was playing in the assassination attempt. We actually beeped up security because of it. You know, like they're trying to bring this shit and they're like this, this means anything. And it's just, well, I think I actually think that they're bringing that in because I think they're gonna move from just a single shooter trying to kill him to an act of terrorism trying to kill him. I don't think that this will be the only attempt on his life between now and then. It looks funny. You say that because the FBI and the DHS just released a potential update saying that there's, they warn of potential follow up and retaliatory attacks following attempted Trump assassination. Saying quote, the FBI and DHS remain concerned about the potential for follow on or retaliatory at acts of violence following this attack, particularly giving that individuals in some online communities have threatened, encouraged, or referenced acts of violence in response to the attempted assassination. Loan actors or DVEs, domestic violence extremist, operating in small cells likely will continue to view publicly accessible locations like political rallies and campaign events as attractive targets. It's interesting because I was talking obviously to a lot of my friends who you guys all know because they've either been on the show or you see me with them, but they all got shows and they're all, you know, we all talk, right? And what a better way to really gains sympathy with Americans than to assassinate Biden, okay? They wanna get rid of Biden very clearly. They're open about that now. To assassinate Biden and blame it on some sort of mega retaliatory attack. That's my thought process. I agree. Everybody else is saying that too. Because they'll set up, it makes perfect sense. Yeah. And all of that that could use it to bring in the heavy hand of comedy that's right behind it, right? Like what do we do with these people? That same rhetoric they have to have something that just allows that. Yeah, I could see that. I could see them legitimately doing some sort of mass terrorism act and blaming it on Iran. Remember, they want a big war. That's what they want. And they wanna get rid of Biden and they wanna get rid of Trump. So we gotta think of how they would do that. So I'm nervous. I think that they, I think, I think we're gonna see mass chaos between now and then. I don't think we're out of the woods, but I do think that they were counting on this being successful. Oh, no doubt. Listen, Trump was not supposed to be here, right? Yeah, that's right. Like there's no doubt about that. And dude, people who are like, oh, it's a false flag, it's just fake. Bro, you're a fucking idiot. I'm sorry. I don't like you. Trump was not supposed to be here. The dude, do you know how hard it would be to shoot someone's fucking ear off without killing them? That like dude, people sites. I see people saying that. They're like, oh, they shot him in the ear on purpose. You've never been around a fucking rifle. That is, that is, I don't know if there's anybody that could make that shot in the whole entire world no matter how fucking good they are. On purpose. Yes, that's what I'm saying. On a moving, dude, there's no way. Not only that, bro, he, all he had was a fucking hollow, I think he used the EOTEC on his rifle. Yeah, the EOTEC red dot, no mag. Like, yeah, no magnification. There's no scope on that. Yeah, I mean, 120, what was it? 120? 140. 140. I mean, with no mag, that's, that's a bench shot. That's a very, very hard shot to make if you're not on a bench. If you're not resting on a bench. Like, yeah, that's a difficult fucking shot. Yeah, you know, yeah. What was, what, I don't know what his rifle was, was zeroed in. Like, there was a lot of variables, ever, but like just in general, that's a tough shot to make. Yeah, but that guy also was a proficient shooter. The first thing that came out was, oh, he got rejected from the rifle team. Yeah, also he was in gun clubs. He was a, he was a gun nerd. He shot guns all the time. This guy was experienced. And how much more of shit do you have? Well, the last little thing, I was, I got a theory on this whole thing. I want to get it out once you're done with all of this. Well, the last little little tidbit here. This guy by the name of Mike Dillard. He posted this video to Instagram. Mike's been on the show, bro. Mike Dillard. Now with me. No, but before you. Oh, yeah, he's buddy of mine. Gotcha. Yeah. And he posted, he posted, he has a very interesting take on this because like you alluded to him in the beginning, there is something weird that happened here in about a week before the attempted assassination. Let's watch this video and I got, I got the receipts here. So there's a lot of people out there who've been wondering if the whole assassination attempt was an inside job, or if it was just the random acts of a crazy dude, well, we found out the answer today. It turns out the number of shares that were shorted on DJT his public company doubled the week before his assassination from 7 million shares to 15 million shares, which means there were definitely people in power in the know who were betting very large amounts of money that the stock price of DJT was going to tumble. So that means that it absolutely was an inside job and people knew exactly what was going to happen. Yeah. And I mean, even wise guys, they track stuff like this. They put this out on Twitter. Who knew the hit was coming, right? And it was absolutely shorted. Here is a five day look. So this is showing you just a couple of days, one or two days before the assassination. It shows the, the calamity. Let's go back. Let's look at it from a month view. And you can clearly see that actually about a week and half, almost two weeks before this, there's this gradual daily sell off of these stocks. People are dumping them. And the hopes was is that by Monday, Monday morning, waking up when the stock market's open up, everybody else is freaking the fuck out. Shits and chaos. And it tanks the fucking, takes the whole fucking company. And all the guys are shorted and make a fortune. Make a shit ton of money. Yeah. And the people who did not have that inside information were kind of screwed out of their money. Yeah. Right. The good news is obviously again Donald Trump survived. So the stock's doing just fine. But you put all of this together, Andy. What's the answer? We're all just conspiracy theorists. Andy, what do you got on all of this? Well, I mean, look, dude, listen, it's very obvious what happened here. If you pay attention to anything that's been going on for the last number of years, especially with the school shooting stuff, OK? These people always are the same kind of people. They're these manic, loner, weird people who have trouble fitting into society, who are then radicalized through online rhetoric and connections with people online. And our three-letter agencies groom these people. They start to talk to these people. They convince these people that they're a hero. And they make these people into these killers. And that's why these people have rifles. They can't afford and plans they shouldn't have. And they're allowed to get on top of buildings in the middle of a presidential speech that nobody should be able to allow to get on. Bro, the secret service was inside the building that he was on top of. And the reason that the secret service director, that woman, said that there wasn't people on the roof is because it was sloped too much. And it was dangerous when they have snipers on roofs with more of a slope. That was the least slope building in the whole thing. They got video of this guy an hour before. They had him on the glass on those dude's scope for 30 minutes before they shot him. There was no question at all. This guy was fucking groomed. He was allowed to be there. He was allowed to shoot. He was probably told that he was protected. And he went up there. They shot. He shot eight mother fucking times before they shot back. Okay, you can't tell me there wasn't some sort of inside job there. Now shooting eight times before they shot back, I looked at all the angles and I've watched all the videos on this. The guy was pretty concealed. Like if you were going to have a spot to shoot, that's what I'm saying. That was the most beneficial spot for him to be in to have that line and also be protected from the other people. So I bet you these people told him, hey, do this. We got you. You're going to be protected. And you know, they want him to be dead because they didn't want him to talk. So he was shot right afterwards. And dude, if we go back to, you know, MLK, if we go back to JFK, if we go back to Bobby King, all of these things are very similar. There are these people that come out of nowhere. This kid didn't even have social media, all right. He registered as a Republican, but donated to progressive causes, act blue. Okay. This guy was a 100% plant allowed to do this. This was an inside job. And the motherfuckers that shorted that stock, know, those are the people that knew about it. And I think all this is going to come out, dude. I don't think the secret service was allowed, as a general allowed it to happen. But I think there's people in the secret service that allowed it to happen. You know, for sure. Well, I think that's one of the things, you know, like for a fact, I'm not talking about the dudes that pull the triggers. I'm talking about the motherfuckers that make the rules. And they probably told these people, you know, they probably made a, I guarantee you, dude, there is a storyline here that is not being told because they are not allowed to tell it because they're being threatened. If you talk about this, you're going to be put in prison. That's what they're doing. Oh, no doubt. This one, you couldn't convince me this wasn't an inside job by the Democrats. And I won't even say Democrats, all right. I will say the cabal, okay? The Communist Deep State cabal, Biden, Hillary, Obama, and Co, all right. Klaus Schwab, all of these people, Soros, all of these people work together, okay? And my bet, my speculation is that this was 100% put in play by people like that. I don't know which ones or all of them, but the guy failed and now they're scrambling. And the reason I think what made me really think that this was 100% an inside job was the phone call that was made directly after it happened, okay? Biden called Trump right after it happened. And how do you think that phone call went? Trump knows everything. He was president of the United States. He has all the intel, all the data. He knows all the crimes. He hasn't spoken up about any of the stuff that Biden's been doing hardly at all, all right? I guarantee you that phone call went something like this. Hey, motherfucker, you fucking crossed the line. And now if you don't fucking stand down and you don't fucking quit now, I'm gonna do this and this and this and this and this and those things that he said were really fucking bad for him and everybody else. Guaranteed, Trump's not a bitch. He's not a pussy. You could say whatever you want about him, but he ain't those things. And I guarantee you, bro, he told that motherfucker, bro, I will fucking bear you. I will bury your fucking family. You and cuz dude, right after that, the media flipped, Biden flipped, they all started saying, we're praying for, we need to de-escalate the language. No political violence. We need no political violence. After years and years and years of Johnny Depp and Madonna and Maxine Waters and Biden and all these people talking all this shit about violence. Now we don't want any violence, okay? Now you have Biden sitting on TV set pulling down his ads comparing Trump to Hitler doing all of these things, okay? He did those things out of fear. That wasn't, that was not a, oh I know this is right, like, you know, all of a sudden it's thoughts and prayers for Trump after years and years and years of basically telling people to fucking kill him, okay? Bullshit. These people got caught, they got caught with their pants down. They wanted to fucking reel it in as quick as possible. That was the only move they panicked and it really put him in a bad spot because either one, they denounced violence and they say, you know, basically without saying it, that hey, we're full of shit about this guy. This guy's not a threat, this guy's not Hitler, this guy's not, so we denounced violence now, right? Or they embrace violence and they say, man, it sucks and then they expose themselves for who they are. So by them missing this shot, it really creates a big problem for their ability to appear to be authentic in any way, shape or form. Which, bro, people have woken up. I mean, I've seen hundreds and hundreds of videos of people who are like, dude, after that, I'm voting for Trump. I've always believed the media, I could tell they're lying. I'm voting for Trump. This is crazy, I'm voting for Trump. These are people who did not vote for him in 2020. Or okay, yeah. And dude, you know, my main take on this is this. They did this shit, they got caught, they were counting on it to be successful. Now it's not, and they don't have an ability to run a game plan or a campaign without trashing Trump. That's their whole thing because all of their policies are dog shit, every single one of them. So, yeah, man, and I think it is gonna come out. Like you said, it's not gonna come out. I think it is gonna come out. I think people in these agencies are understanding that we, they are starting to understand that we are occupied by foreign interests through pay for play schemes going all the way up to the top level with the president and trickling down into our agencies. And when Trump talks about the swamp, that's what he's talking about. So, I know that it matters who you vote for in the past or who, you know, you like or this dislike or whatever. I think we can all agree that anybody who tries to assassinate a president should be dealt with swiftly and harshly as an example. And it's gonna be interesting to see what happens and who they try to pin this on. But at the end of the day, they're gonna try to pin this on some low level like the head of secret service versus the people who called the play. And I could guarantee you, dude, I, 100%, dude, you would have to be mentally challenged putting it nicely to think this was anything but that. It was a fucking inside job. And it wasn't Trump doing the inside job to make Trump look good like the leftists are saying, you guys are insane. You know that's not the case, okay? You're just mad that you're the guy that you hate so much. And by the way, you've been lied to about that you hate so much didn't get his brains blown out in front of everybody. And think about what that says about these people as people. Do you think these people are gonna unite with you? Do you think these people are gonna come around? Do you think these people are gonna, you know, somehow logically be convinced that they're wrong? That's never gonna happen, dude. These people are totally gone. They're mentally ill. They've been completely brainwashed. And there's no coming back for a lot of them. And they are a minority. They're a small little minority, bro. It's like 1% of the fucking population. So I'm not worried about it. But these people are so convinced because they've had control of the social narrative for so long that they still have the power that it's like comical watching them get destroyed through their own actions finally. They're finally learning that people are not with you. They've never been with you. That's the thing. A lot of the social momentum that the left has had and that Marxist and communist had is manufactured on social media. It was very, it's not even real. And so these people believe that there's millions and millions of people that agree with them when in reality they're just crazy fucking useful idiots. Like I've been saying for years and years and years. And now they're finding out. Because after Trump gets his ears shot off, everybody's like, you know what? Fuck all these people. And so dude, I feel like the momentum has very much so changed now to where people are not gonna tolerate this leftist insane shit. Nearly as much as they have if at all. No, I agree man. These people are, these people are in for a rude awakening and honestly dude, I'm here for it. God's jumping on this conversation, down in the comments, let us know what you guys think. I mean, do you agree with that? With what I'm saying? 100%. I mean, that was the inside job. There's no doubt about it. Yeah, there's no doubt. Listen, and then this is one thing to understand too, man. Like we talk about these top down commands, right? Like sometimes there's gonna be commands which just come down like, hey, you know, you're gonna be doing this. You're gonna be positioning this, right? They have these things cause it's called a position meeting, right? Like ask me how I know, we do the same thing, right? Where, hey, you know, I know last detail you were working in this capacity, this detail you're doing this, right? Not only you have that aspect on it, but on top of that, there was also a lot of augmented agents there. Yeah. Which means that agents that are not added in the last moment. Yeah, these are, or. Hey, we need three more guys. Right, and you just send them in. Yeah. Everybody's been talking, she was augmented. Yeah, she's not a part of Trump's detail. She never has been. That's another discussion. What, sandwiches? Yes. Oh, I mean. Fat, short, squatty women should not be on, listen, we have to get back to meritocracy. That's a D.E.I. ship. That's it. It is. All right, listen, dude, there's lots of things that women are better than men at. I'll start with that. But there's a lot of things that men are better than women at. And fucking being violent and protecting people and shooting guns and doing that kind of work, police work, secret service work, field work, that is for fucking men. Okay, I'm not saying there aren't some women that are good at it. Because there are, but they're the exception. All right, did you see the two women, those two augmented agents legit fucking duck and hide when the shit started going? They ducked out and hid. All the men jumped on top. Easy. They didn't even think about it. It's a primal instinct of men to do that. Okay, we react under dangerous situations with automatic responses most of the time. It's a fucking, it's a primal innate thing. Women don't have that, dude. They have a different thing. They have different gifts. They're good at great, they're great at other things. But that woman, there's a, listen, there's a million women I know that are in shape, that are fucking, that train every day, that know how to shoot, that could do that job. But that's still 0.000000000, 1% compared to the men. And if there is going to be a woman on a detail like that, they should be able to beat the men at the fucking job. And that little short thumb bitch can't beat men doing shit. She might be able to beat them eating white castles. You know what I'm saying? Like for real, dude, that's what she might be able to do. Yeah, I mean, did you see your face? Like how fucking dude, she did not know what the fucking do. I've seen the clip, there's a clip of, then she couldn't even put her gun in her holster. Bro, I train fucking once a year and I could put my fucking gun in my holster. Yeah, there's not rounds on target. But the thing is, well, he can say, he can say that, but he knows that it's the opposite. It's actually true. That's right. He is at MSNBC. I'm lester whole. Sorry. Yeah. All right. No, but like, I actually seen a video of, what's your like to get beat by your own client? If fucking shoot it? They did not have. Yeah, I did. I have to. Like what's your like? All right, we'll be there tomorrow. Yeah, let's make it work. That's fine. All right. We're putting this on you too. We're live streaming a bit. Yeah, that's fine. There's no editing. Did you come on out? No, but there's actually a video, because she ended up going to the hospital. So there's a video I saw in the front of the fucking thing, not being able to do it again. Like what the fuck are you doing? Yeah. And she's standing in front of the fucking truck. Like she's all hard. Like dude, a lot of these, now I'm not, I want to say that I'm, listen, this is, this is not against her. I'm that's not who my anger frustration is towards. No, it's against the system for allowing it. For putting her in that. That's dude. Like she should have never been in the position. Yeah. Look, man, that shit can't run a fucking, dude, I can't run a mile. So I can't say shit. No, that's not a problem. Oh, man, it's just like, you got to be able to handle some shit, man. Like you got to, I can run a mile, but I'm just saying. Yeah, I could. Yeah, if I'm a sheet, but sheet, that, that, listen, yeah. I won't do it. That won't do, you know? Her face like, who, it like, what an unfortunate angle of her. Like, to that be the one photo that everybody's gonna remember you for forever. Do. And apparently she's a 10 year vet for Secret Service, you know, but like, I mean, either her or that, but like my point is that, you know, you take the positioning meetings they had, you take the augmentation, right? You know, you might just, like, you might get assigned, like you're not the one making those decisions of where you wanna be at, right? And so what I'm saying is, to me, this is no doubt this was an inside job. Somebody make those calls, somebody pulled certain people, hey, you need to go watch this side. Who do you think it was? It was the same mother fuckers been trying to sabotage him this whole time, bro. It's Pelosi, it's Biden, it's Obama, it's fucking Soros, it's all, if I'm betting, that's who I'm betting. Well, I think the thing is too, man, like how many of that speculative, I can't fucking prove that. Yeah, this show speculative. As long as we're guessing. Sure, but I'll say this, you know, and here's another aspect too that people don't think about too. There was, you know, they kept citing manpower issues, right? And the thing is, like, I mean, that's a real thing. I got burned out, Trump does a lot of these fucking events. Isn't it, now, here's some information. I mean, people don't understand this, right? But shouldn't they be switching out detail between events? Trump's team runs, like that's his team, right? Those guys are assigned to him because, and it's not like, you know, they don't get the full battle battle because he's not in the line of succession to presidency. But here's the thing, Trump runs. I mean, and his guys, his actual PSD team, they were running for a long time. Seven days without a day off, right? Like, sometimes that stuff happens. I think it's pretty interesting too. And this just to loose the fact that man, this was, this shit was planned out is, they picked a day when a lot of his main guys were off. In an event where there was no advance, at an event where, you had a lot of augmented agents who, you know, yeah, just put me wherever the hell you need me at, right? Like, this was the perfect storm. I think they created this. Listen, dude, to create the end of the day, here's the deal. This fall, a fucking lightsabering, noodle swinging, trash can, lid carrying, leftist, doesn't walk up to the building. That is the premiere building. You know, we want to shoot from where this guy is standing, the best place to shoot a target from, standing outside of it for an hour. Being observed for up to three hours, the rain having his mom call and report to the police that he's deranged and they need to find him. Having people in the crowd see him and them do nothing, okay? This does not happen. This does not happen. This is dude. Do you know how hard it is to actually do this if they were like doing what they're supposed to do? You cannot do it. He was allowed to do it. He was manipulated to do it. He was probably funded to do it, which is why we can't, Quantico can't get into his cell phone. Oh, but all these hackers on the internet can get into anybody's shit. The fuck outta here, dude. You're fucking Quantico. Call a fucking apple and say, break this bitch open. You don't think they can do that. They do that all the time. They're lying about everything that it's sloppy. And, you know, look, dude, I think the truth's gonna come out. And, you know, fuck dude, all the evidence that comes out about JFK says the CIA did it. So what are we gonna wait another 40 years or 50 years to find out? No, we're living in a different era now. What's reported on the news in 1963 has to be taken as truth because there's no back channels to communicate. What I saw on NBC is what the fuck we, what happened? And that's that. Can you believe that that happened? We don't have any way to question it, okay? The people who had a question, conspiracies back then had to like, they had to like go places and take notes and interview people. Now, social media sends everything in an instant. So they tried to pull an old play that can't be pulled during a time where everything's recorded and everything's observed. And news travels at the speed of sound, okay? The speed of light speed. It's fucking instant, dude. So when we think about that, I don't think that they're gonna be able to cover this up. I think there's people are gonna start blowing the whistle because they understand how serious it is and they understand that they fucked up and he's not dead and he's probably gonna be president, okay? That was, to me. So there's gonna be people who were like, told weird shit, right? Like their boss walks in and tells the guy's secret service, stand down, don't go on that fucking roof, okay? That guy is gonna come out and say this. Those guys are gonna come out and say this because they're gonna realize what they're a part of and they don't wanna be a part of it. If they're gonna lose, you see what I'm saying? Well, I say this to you, man. And I think this also alludes to the fact that they were not counting on Trump's survival. No. It's because all of these little questions we have if Trump was actually killed, had he actually died, right? The country would've been in chaos. Yeah, right now. And nobody would be asking any of these questions. Yeah. I think that's the difference, right? Well, I think if he was killed, I think people would've assumed, I think this is another mistake that the cabal is making. We would've assumed it's the memorabilia. That's right. Yeah. We would've assumed it's them. For sure. Like, dude, everybody in America, listen, dude. Which I, but I would say, I would say eight out of 10 Americans assume that it's the establishment to try to kill them. Yeah. No, dude, listen, we're under occupied rule. We have people in the government who have done things to America because other countries have paid them to do those things. These people are not our friend. They hate this country. They hate you. They hate everything about Donald Trump because he won't be scared and he won't stop. And dude, whether you like Trump or don't like Trump, or you think he's an asshole or you don't, I don't care, bro, America's America, man. And we can all have different opinions. But we have a group of people here who believe that their opinion is more important than anybody's to the point of, we will kill anybody that challenges it. And that is dangerous for everybody. It doesn't matter if you like Trump or not like Trump, or how you feel about conservative. This isn't even a conservative thing. And a lot of conservatives are out here being like, all these people vote for Trump. They're not even conservative. Get off your fucking high horse, bro. You guys are worse than the fucking left. If you don't go now instead of, if you don't read child porn to fucking kids of school, you're a bigot. Now it's if you don't go to church every day and women don't wear old-style dresses and men don't have 47 kids, they're not conservative enough and they don't belong over here. Man, you all are bunch of fucking morons. This is fucking freedom versus not freedom. And Trump is far from a pro-freedom candidate in my opinion based upon what he's actually executed upon. Now, when I say that, I'm gonna say that with an asterisk because every single president, they're very conservative in their first term and then they're more aggressive in their second term. And what I'm hoping, and I'm giving the benefit of the doubt, is that Trump will follow through on a lot of these things that he promised this time. And he may not. He may be a part of the establishment. We don't fucking know, dude. They could be playing us. They could be making us have so much sympathy for Donald Trump that he comes in and he says, hey, we're gonna deport all these people. We're gonna lock the country down and that's how they get the digital ID and all this shit going. I don't think that's the case, but there's a case that could be made for that. But at the end of the day, we have to think for ourselves and we have to use our minds in a way that says, what is the better choice right now? Well, right now, the better choice is Donald Trump in my opinion and most people's opinion. All right, regardless if you like him as a person, now I actually like him as a person. I think he's fucking hilarious. I think the shitty says a spot on. I understand why he kind of brags a little bit because nobody gives him any credit. Now with that being said, I think he's been a lot better as of recent in the last year or so, all right? But he's, I like him because he shares a similar personality that I would have. But that doesn't mean, that doesn't mean he's not part of this or that. Just saying I like him. But at the end of the day, we have to make a choice. And the choice is communism, Marxism, or moving towards a better America. Do I think Trump's gonna make America the greatest it could be? I don't know, man, like there's things that got to happen. Like taxes got to come down to 10% all in. There's things that have to happen here that I don't know if he's willing to do. Now if he does those things, I'll eat my words and say, fuck yeah bro, he's the best ever. But at the end of the day, we should be using his ability to come in and make the changes as a bridge to 28 where we can improve more and more and more, right? So if we're pro-freedom and we don't think Trump is pro-freedom enough, then we got four years to figure out a movement so we can get a little bit more towards where we wanna go. You see what I'm saying? Absolutely, man. So I just think we gotta think about this logically and we gotta think about this, you know, is he the perfect candidate for every issue? I don't know, it depends on if he follows through or not. You know, but if he follows through, I think he'll be the best president of ever. I mean, they're certainly shaping up that way. I think it's important for everybody just to think for themselves, dude. I think we gotta look at every single candidate individually and think for themselves. This idea of I'm part of this party, I'm part of that party, I'm part of this movement. That's how we get in these polarizing situations. Okay, is this guy qualified for the job? Is this person qualified? No, okay, don't vote for that person. See what I'm saying? Easy. Yeah. Guys, Andy, let's keep the screws moving. We got a hit line number two. R&T, we talked about just a little bit. We had the video in the beginning, my favorite human on the earth. Let's talk about some of the other developments that have been happening. We have a new VP pick. Yep. The first public in convention will be his national introduction as Trump's running mate. This is Article Ridge. Donald Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, will introduce himself to a national audience Wednesday night today, when this episode was recorded, as he addresses the Republican national convention. He's an Ohio senator. Now, he really came to light, I guess, with the train development in Ohio. I'm in East Palestine, right? That's when he really started to come to light. Nobody really heard of him before that, whatever. But since he's been picked, listen, I mean, I know there's a lot of here and there, but one of the biggest hits that people have been making on this guy, are these uncovered audio clips of his disdain for Donald Trump. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I have an interest in 10 years ago, exactly. Exactly. Can't change your mind. More information can't come out. I mean, listen, everybody at one point can say, yeah, I drink a little bit of the Kool-Aid. You know what I'm saying? Like it is what it is. But we are not in the same place as a country. We did not have the information we have now. We don't have a lot of things. But that's one thing that they've been hitting on. And just for those that have not yet seen what they're talking about, I have a clip here. This is just a little short clip that kind of shows what they're talking about. Let's listen to this. And I cannot stand, Trump, because I think he's a fraud. Well, I think he's a total fraud that is exploiting these people. I think he is a total fraud. That I agree with you on Trump, because I don't think that he's the person. I don't think he actually cares about folks. But I think that I'm going to vote for a third party, because I can't stomach Trump. I think that he's noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place. Oh, really? He was wrong about that. Completely wrong. And again, that was back in 2016, man. Well, I mean, you got to remember the climate back then. If you want to know the truth, I said that Trump was going to be present in 2015. I said on the MFCO project, Vaughan argue with me. And said, there's no fucking way. I'm like, all right. Yeah. That's very easy. Yeah. So look, man, back in 2016, Trump was an actor. You know, he was an actor. Right. So we're going to take this guy from the apprentice and we're going to make him present it. Like no one had ever seen this guy. Other than on the TV show and the cultural celebrity that had been made around him. So, you know, I mean, I could see where people would think that. For sure. And I'll say this, man, like, you know, I'm not going to say I was disappointed. I think it would have been really cool to see Rama Swamy on the stage. I think Rama Swamy should have been the pick. I agree, man. I would have liked to see that. I think Rama Swamy is more pro-freedom than any of the other potential candidates. Agreed. I've had a chance to really get to know him since he was on the show a year ago. Yeah. I know why he didn't pick him. I know why Trump didn't pick Rama Swamy. I think Trump didn't pick Rama Swamy because he's afraid he can show up by him. That's exactly why. Yeah. I much like, well, listen, Donald Trump is still down to Trump. But let's listen, dude. Let me tell you something about the Vague. Okay. In my, I've been a paid speaker for a long time and I'm very good. And I have a gift for it. I can walk up on stage without knowing what to say. And when I go on stage, it comes out really good. It's a gift. Okay, I don't have to really have, I don't have a plan. I don't rehearse. Now every, you know, 10 or so, they get a little, they get a little sketch. But my sketch is still, they do. But my sketch is still better than everybody else's. And I know, no disrespect. It's a gift. I can't help it. I, I guess I've practiced it for a long time. But to be able to walk up, connect with your audience, paint a vision that everybody can see clearly. And then back it with intelligent statements. That's a gift and Vague has it. Okay. And Trump does not have that. No, I have it. None of these other people have that gift. And it's a very, very, very powerful gift. Do you know what the most dangerous and most powerful weapon in the entire world is? It's this, right here, this microphone. Okay. And if you can master that, you could become the fucking master of the universe. And Vague has that gift. And my personal opinion is that he wasn't chosen because of that. That's how I saw it. Which is unfortunate because I think he's a much better pick. I don't know too much about Vance. But I, you know, maybe it's just because I know Vague and I like him. Yeah, I mean, like I think, but what he has is it's a gift. And there's not Obama has it. Obama has it. Okay. For sure. JFK had it. All right. I know what that's like because I have it too. You have it. Okay. And I know you guys listen to the podcast. I jump all over. But if you've ever seen me speak live, it's a completely different thing. And I don't think Trump wanted to be shown up by that. Now it's too much of the spotlight. Yeah. I think that the last night dude, his speech, he came out on RNC last night. It was straight fucking gas the whole time. It was fun. Dude, everybody else's speech was Cornball, old man, nerd shit. Many days. Yeah. The vape comes out and just sets the room on fucking fire with this curry. Curry. You know what I'm saying? What's that? What's that spice you guys use on a load? Is it curry? Yeah. I thought I'm on. Fucking the star of the East. Listen, I love a vape bro. I know. I know people, listen dude, not me. I've had a chance to get to know him. I like him a lot. I wish I actually text him and I said, I wish he would have picked you. I mean, and I listen, like I think there's, I think Eric Schmidt would have been a great pick. Yeah. Eric Schmidt would have been a great pick. Cause Eric Schmidt is a great speaker. He's, I don't, I wouldn't say that Eric is, Eric's not, doesn't have the celebrity that Vivek has yet. But Eric's a fucking bulldog. Who's doing it? He's not afraid of fucking anybody. No. And he is him and Andrew Bailey are doing so much of the important work right now. And, and, you know, had he chose him, I think that would have been a great choice just because he's a fucking doer. Yeah. But Vance, you know, Vance could be those things too. I just don't know enough about him. Yeah, for sure. And I'll say this to you about Vivek too, man. I think there's still some great things in store for you. Oh, dude, he's young, you know, I think. Yeah. I mean, it's gonna be Vivek for Sella in 24 or 28, dude. We're gonna run everybody over, you know, saying. I think I'd be for Sella Vivek, but, you know, I don't think that would work. No, yeah. I'll have to beat him on stage. Yeah. You have to. I'm coming for you, bro. Yeah. Yeah. No, but I thought, I think he's just, dude, he's on it, dude. Dude, he's cool. Yeah. Cool, man. And like, I mean, he has a little, he has his own little, you need a little swag, man, you know. But I, you know, I could see a cabinet position for him. You know, they're actually, I don't know if you've seen it. They're talking about having Vivek take the Senator's spot from Vance, because they're both from a lot. I think that'd be great. They're both from a lot. And they get to pick him, right? Right. Yeah, I think that'd be great. And so there's a possibility there. I think that's still too low on the total pool. I do too. I think he could be used a lot higher in that, in that admin. But we'll see. Yeah, vice president. We'll see, you know. But other things in the RNC, did you see that, uh, that, uh, dude got shot and killed? He was, uh, wild in the knife, a couple of blocks from there. That was interesting to see. Yeah, well. And outside of the mayonnaise also happened in outside. Apparently there was a lot of, uh, there's been a lot of protesters there. Um, and, and we're not talking about a little bit. They're, they're, they're, they're estimated. It was like 10,000. Anti-tron backed of this there. Yeah, I wonder how much they got paid. 10,000. Yeah. Starbucks carts. I don't know. Yeah, I mean, it's fucking something. Um, for sure. Um, you know, but, uh, did you see what really stole the show? Like, there was a lot of fucking mayonnaise there. I haven't been able to watch. I just said watch it. The RNC needs some serious, bro, like you guys need some serious, like cool and it up. Bro, like fuck. It's embarrassing. It reminded me, you know that video of Dana, the hip hop teacher. Yeah. That's what it reminded me. Yeah, dude. I'm Dana and I'm going to teach you about hip hop. Yeah. What? Yeah, one, two, uh, see my feet turn out like this. Yeah. I like this. Yeah. Yeah. That's what the RNC was, bro. Listen, that's, bro, there was no sauce. No, to be found other than the vein. It's like raising canes, man. Like it was, it was bad. I'll admit it, dude. Bro, I mean, like, I'm on a real note though. Like that's why a lot of people do. That's why they can't get the young people to get engaged. There's no sauce. They're not cool. Bro, there's no, you guys need some sauce, man. Listen, fix it. They need, it needs to be a fucking rock concert, bro. Like, it needs to be. What are the fuck's kid rock? No, bro, they need to be bringing out 50 cent doing many, man. If he would have walked out, I bet they're going to do it tomorrow. You think so? Yeah. Oh, he hasn't even spoke yet. That's true. Yeah, I bet they're going to do it. Oh, fuck, bro. Yeah. That would be, but I'm just saying, that would fix it. Yeah, but see, Trump has that, that aura, you know what I'm saying? Like he's a, dude, like, Trump's a boss, bro. No. You know what I'm saying? Like that do walks in the room. There's people to have that. He's got it. So why don't they fucking build it up some more? Like make this dude, let him use it, bro. Fucking Voltron, you know what I'm saying? Like the fucking Bull of Proofess, man. Yeah. He's being upside down, you know. You know what I'm saying? Now, what are the cool, like I will say this, one of the up lights. I know you're a dog lover. You have a bulldog, actually. Did you see Baby Dog? Baby Dog. Stole the show. So West Virginia governor, Jim Justice, which, that's a great name. Yeah. Like fuck, that's a great name. Is he, what is he? Democrat? No, he's at the RNC. Okay, he's a Republican, Republican governor, Jim Justice. He brought his fucking dog out with him when he went to go speak. This is dog. Oh, dude. A little bit baby dog. Dude, I want to pit that dog, man. Look at that baby. Like it reminds me of Charlie. Yeah, it doesn't like Charlie. She's smile, look at her. So fluffy. Dude, there ain't nothing better than Bulldogs, man. No. If you've never had a Bulldog, you don't even know, because it's like totally different than all the other dogs. I've had all the dogs and an English, like I didn't even want them, dude. Like, I didn't want them. I had German shepherds and rockwilers and American Bulldogs, which people don't know what American Bulldog is. They're big. They're like the size of a rockwilver. They're big. And then when my American Oscar passed away, Emily wanted to get an English Bulldog. And so I got her Otis as like a surprise and dude, within like three days, I was like totally so. And now it's like I could never not have at least two English Bulldogs. That's cool, bro. Because they're so freaking funny together. Yeah. They're so funny, dude. They're like little comedians. Everything they do is funny, bro. Me, me, me, my boy, man. Yeah. Otis loves DJ. But, uh, but yeah, I thought that was cool. Now, now you got that, that's the RNC. Look at that, baby. Her name's Baby Dog. Baby Dog. Oh, that's such a good name for her. And you know, he has that country accent. Baby Dog. Yeah. He's, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a VIP right there. He looks so soft. Yeah. Hey man, when I go out on the debate stage, you bring 20, 28, bring a, bring a child or one of my ducks. Yeah. Cause I have more ducks. But that's the RNC. You got the DNC coming up. And there is some weird chit that they're trying to pull with this DNC stuff. So let's, let's cover this just a little bit before we move on. DNC moves forward with Biden virtual roll call despite furious backlash from some Democrats. So the Democratic National Committee is moving ahead with this controversial plan to virtually nominate President Joe Biden ahead of the Democratic Convention in Chicago next month, ignoring this is CNN, by the way, ignoring the growing calls from some of the party's elected officials to ditch that strategy given the serious ongoing debate about whether the president should continue to seek a second term. And the trying to push it in very, very quick, like maybe August, first, August, second to officially nominate him well ahead of the actual convention, with the convention itself being this virtual thing, not just for Biden, but plenty of the delegates that are supposed to be there as well. So that's some interesting. Well, isn't there, isn't, isn't there a rule that if so right now while Biden is not the official nominee, if something were to happen to him, Kamala has to be the natural progression to maintain campaign for, right. However, and I could be wrong, but I believe that if they nominate Joe Biden and then he pulls out the Democrat convention gets to pick someone anybody that wants. So that would make sense as to why they're trying to push the nomination forward so that they can switch it out before the DNC. That's a meable shit. That's a meable shit. No matter who's complaining about it, let's check in with Biden because he just had a really, really bad NBC news interview. We share one of the clips from that interview with Lester Holt, but that wasn't it. Biden again, man in the scene now, a demented state where like, you know, angry people are kind of mean. I think just in general, there what mean angry people, no old people, you said angry people did I? Well, old people, old people are mean. Old people can get mean, bro, for no reason. Sometimes. Yeah, I think they, you know, they've, they've exhausted their give of fucks. Is that what it is? Dude, I'm telling you right now that's what my problem is. You're not all though. Yeah, but I've lived, I've worked, I've worked a full lifetime of hours. I've dealt with the full, if you add up all the hours, I've worked, I've worked a 70 year old life. So I've had enough, I've had enough interactions with people to be 70. That's why I fucking get pissed off so easy. Got it. And I'm like, and I'm fun give a shit. Yeah, got it. I got the old man I give a fuck halfway through my life. That's a beautiful thing. Well, yeah, Biden definitely got it. I mean, he actually got kind of nasty with Lester Holt on NBC. So let's, let's, let's dive into this a little bit. So we got two clips here. So the first one, Biden refused to commit to debating Trump before the next debate in September. And when pressed by Holt, whether he was anxious to get back on the horse, Biden snapped. I'm on the horse. Where have you been? Let's watch this clip. Mr. Trump has said he's giving you a chance to redeem yourself, basically the idea of engaging in another debate. We're going to have another debate. Yeah, you're going to have one of September that's on the books. Would you be open to doing one in the, you know, the next few weeks? I'm going to debate him when we agreed to debate. I'm going to debate him in September. But if, if the opportunity came up to do one between now and then, is there a sense of one and get back on the horse? I'm on the horse. Where are you, Ben? I've done 22 major events, that thousands of people, overwhelming crowds, a lot happening. I'm on the horse. What I'm doing is going out and demonstrating to American people. They'll have command of all my faculties that I don't need notes. I don't need telepros. I can go out and answer any questions at all. And I stood there when, when NATO was in touch. So they're friends. Well, you should be able to stand in for 12 hours or whatever the fuck it takes. I think it's interesting how the lowering of the bar has, has been introduced into the, into society, you know, like, for the president of the United States. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like when Joe Biden, when they did the debate, Joe Biden, you answered every question. You did so good. What is this? You're right. This is the president of the United States. Of course he's supposed to answer every question. And he's not supposed to answer every question. He's supposed to annihilate the guy on the other side, which he didn't do. Like, dude, this whole thing, I'm in command of my faculties. You're the president. What are we talking about? You're not supposed to shit your pants and forget where the fuck you are. Who shit my pants? Yeah. Like, the bar is like keeps getting progressively lower for the standard. It's sad to see that. Yeah, dude, we should have, we should have the smartest, brightest, most experienced, most knowledgeable people running this country. It's the most important thing to any of us. And then when he got pressed about his obvious signs of cognitive decline, he got angry again. Watch this. In your last TV interview, you were asked if you had watched the debate. Your answer was, I don't think so. No. Have you since seen it? I've seen pieces of it. I'm not much to hold debate. The reason I asked because I guess the question is, are you all on the same page? Are you seeing what they saw, which was moments of, frankly, that appeared to be, you appeared to be confused? Let's do look. Why don't you guys ever talk about the 18-28 lies he told? Where are you from this? Why in the press ever talk about that? 28 times. It's confirmed he lied in that debate. I had a bad, bad night. I wasn't feeling well at all. It meant I had been, without a big, I screwed up. But I just ask the question because the idea that you may or may not have seen what some of these other folks have seen, you're not on the same page. I have to see I was there. The question, but why in the press talk about all the lies he told? Why in the media about that? We have reported many of the issues that never had an end debate. No, you haven't. We'll provide you with it. He's not used to the press fucking even asking him anything. It's always been softball. He's been, dude, he's been protected for so long he's getting offended they're asking a factual question. Who the luto? First of all, welcome to the mother fucking show, bitch. Like you fucking, you guys have been so one sided and so unfair that this guy thinks he's entitled to being asked nothing, to being held accountable to nothing. This should give you insight to what these people think about themselves. How dare you ask me about something I did? What about him? Right. He can't even answer the question. And Trump can do all these things correct, bro. He can have the best economy. He could create all these jobs. He could do all these things to make our country better and he gets zero credit at all. I'm not saying he's perfect by any means because he's not. I have a lot of criticisms of him. They can remember the fuck out of him. Yes, but they don't give him any credit, which is what creates his persona of being like the mean tweets. If you don't have anybody telling the truth about you, you have to tell the truth about yourself. And remember, he will come out and do the pressures himself almost daily and they didn't like that. They didn't like that. He would go up there and handle these people. Yes. And then state what he actually did and they don't like that. But dude, they say, oh, look how arrogant he is. Look how cocky he is. Bro, nobody will tell the truth about him. Now he has to make those statements. It's what makes him appear to be cocky and mean or whatever they call him. I never thought he was mean. Now, here's the interesting thing. Last little piece on this poll comes out that says nearly two thirds of Democrats, one Biden step aside, right? Two thirds at 66%. Right? I'm not. Well, that's coming. I'm just confused. 66% of Democrats won't. So Andy, can you answer me while then this poll comes out of Trump Biden and it has Trump only at 51 to Biden at 49? Who the fuck is lying? Somebody's lying. I think they're lying. They're fucking lying. Did you see that meme of Trump with this thing on for my pillow? No. That picture. This is my pillow. The new mini pillow. Yeah. Fuck me. Dude, I'll tell you what, bro, when I saw that happen, I was fucking pissed. I was so pissed off. I'm just so sick of these people saying, doing, acting to the point where they think they can just kill people. Like, it should be an eye opening, a very eye opening. I think it is, too. I think people are, I think their eyes are open. I've seen so many people who didn't vote for Trump and didn't like Trump saying, I'm voting for Trump because it's very obvious that these other people are fucking insane. Yeah. Yeah, guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think of them being said a third and final headline, man. Let's get to headline number three. Headline number three. Adios, California. Elon Musk announces relocation of SpaceX and Twitter headquarters to Texas. I like Elon. I do. I know there were some questions about him before. If like, no, whether he's controlled, I like him. I fucking like him. He is the biggest influencer on the country on the planet. That's under the Bible, man. I like him. He handles the shit. So let's dive into this. So business inside of reports that on Tuesday, Elon Musk announced via Twitter that SpaceX would be relocating a tech quarters from Hawthorne, California to SpaceX, Starbucks, near Boca Chica, Village, Texas. Musk attributed this decision to laws in California that he described as, quote, attacking both families and companies. The specific legislation, Musk's reference, was a bill signed Monday by California governor Gavin Newsom. This new law prohibits forced disclosure rules in public kindergarten through 12 schools, effectively banning requirements for teachers to notify parents if a child changes their name, pronouns, or gender identity at school. California is the first state to outlaw such requirements as reported by the law's angelist times. Musk caught this legislation the last straw and stated, quote, because of this law, now here's a tweet, he says, because of this law, and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California to Starbucks, Texas. Now these were relocations follow a pattern established by Tesla, another of Musk's companies, which moved the tech quarters to Texas in 2021. Musk had also stated previously his intentions to move SpaceX business and corporation from Delaware to Texas as well. So what was Gavin's response? What was Newsom's response? Well, he had a four word repost. Is that the right word? Repost? Sure. So Elon Musk, after Billionaire decided to move his headquarters, he tweeted this out. So this was an original tweet from Donald Trump that's, and Gavin Newsom said, you bent the knee. I said, you bent the knee. So the, the, the, the tweet that he retweeted was from Donald Trump. It said, when Elon Musk came to the White House asking for me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it's electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash or rocket ships to nowhere, without which subsidies, he'd be worthless and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, drop to your knees and beg, and he would have done it. And then Gavin Newsom retweeted that and saying, you bent the knee to which Elon Musk replied, you never get off your knees. Yeah, except, except Gavin Newsom never gets off his knees to the cabal and fucking China, which is way worse. Way worse, am I opinion? You know, and listen, like, I mean, you know, you, you, you, Trump also, I mean, Musco's also donating like 45 million miles a month month. That is fucking insane. Yeah, well, now granted me only that's what these other guys do. He's recognizing that he's the only guy out here that could be the guy that has that kind of money to do that. I actually commend him, dude. I commend him for getting involved. He doesn't have to get involved. He's a fucking, he's from South Africa, bro. You know, I know he's American and I could definitely tell he's a patriot at this point in time. He's African American. Every, yeah, everybody, you know, I don't know. I get tired of everything and everybody is part of the part of the play type thing. You know what I'm saying? Like, we can't believe that that Elon Musk is like doing, you know, people are like, well, he does starlink and he does fucking brain implants and he does, you know, electric cars. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think he's an entrepreneur and I think he's brilliant. And I think before he understood what was actually happening in the world, he was still brilliant. And so he looked at all these things. He said there's opportunity here and it turns out he's doing okay with it. You know, well, I still don't think like the whole eco thing is part of his argument for making Tesla and stuff. I don't think that I've never seen anything. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's not like he's like, oh, I'm going to save the planet. I'm going to save this. Any of you turds by any cyber trucks and painting them black and shit and like, ran, y'all think you're fucking cool. You're still a nerd. Yeah. What? Side is cool. Do you buy cyber truck? Oh, see? He's a cool nerd. Yeah. I don't care what side. He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a above criticism. He built 7-11 on the fucking. Anybody that built 7-11 on the fucking moon, go with me. They're cool. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and listen, like, kids should not be in school doing over the fuck they want these teachers condoned and the shit and like, bro, that's insane. That's insane. That's, those are our kids, not your kids. That's communist shit. And not only, bro, the funny thing is is that over in China, yeah, they have the same attitude. Your kids are our kids except they teach them how to be fit. They teach a math. They teach them all kinds of skills they need. How to tell them their parents. They teach them how to shoot. Yeah. They teach them how to assemble weapons. Disassemble weapons. Okay. They teach them that they can be a girl. All right. So this whole thing, this ideology that is infected our country is done so to weaken our country. It's not done so to make it better. And anybody with a brain should be able to see that. Yeah. This is going to fuck California more financially than nothing. I think this, like, they might fall, bro. That's a shit ton of tax revenue coming from those two companies. California already heard it. I mean, the other thing is too is that like, when we talk about the progressive ideology, right, like, there seems to be a, I don't know, like a belief inside the Democrat party that the way for them to win is to be more and more and more progressive. And the funny thing is is I think if they replaced Biden with a more progressive candidate, they're really going to screw themselves because the tide and the culture has already been switching back the other way so much. That's why we're seeing people get fired for saying the things they're saying about Trump right now, which dude, you know, like, I have mixed feelings about because on one hand, I'm like, bro, we shouldn't be using cancel culture, but on the other hand, I'm like, we need to use it temporarily to balance shit back out. These motherfuckers need to know like, hey, you're dumb fucking with us. You know, funny, it's fun because they haven't figured it out yet. They're not. Yeah, no. But so I think, you know, Biden's in the Democrats are really in a tricky position here because they have a belief that they need a more progressive candidate, not less. And really dude, the way for them to win is to have a less progressive candidate. Like if they made RFK, they're fucking nominee, they win. You see what I'm saying? But I don't think they're going to do that. They want more progressive, more progressive, more progressive because it goes along with the global agenda. I still believe that it's going to be Michelle Obama. I agree. I still believe that. I don't know. Yeah. Big Mike. And she's going to come out and make a play for unity. You know, those Obama's are really good at talking shit. They don't have any problem saying exactly what you need to hear. Even in 2008, bro, I believed Obama. I was like, fuck, I didn't want him to win. I think he's going to be, I think he might be good. And then he came in and he fucking destroyed everything. Okay? Typical. So yeah. So. I didn't, I didn't laugh because it was funny. I laughed because I was confused. It was a mostly peaceful presidency. I didn't get it. That's why I laughed. It was a mostly peaceful president. But dude, that I don't think these people are in touch with the people, bro. It's like when you see Biden get upset at the, at even being questioned. Like these people have been living in such an elevated state that they are unaware that the tide has turned. You know, like when, when AOC goes out and talks this progressive shit, she gets booed. Like, and they keep wanting to move over that way. You know, had Joe Biden had moderate policies, bro, he'd be getting reelected right now. But people ain't with this progressive shit. And they're not with this woke shit. They don't like DEI and don't like ESG. They don't like politically correct. They love freedom and they don't want to be fucking taxed. And that's fucking reality, bro. We want to be Americans. We're fucking a special breed over here. We want to be Jean Short's Daisy Dukes, fucking American Flags, but why is there big trucks, tailgates, shotguns, fucking fast cars, cool movies, and fucking freedom, bro. That's what the fuck we want here. We don't fucking want none of this shit. And the people that wanted are so limited that nobody cares doesn't matter.
