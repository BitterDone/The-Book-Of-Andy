It's a dark day in our country's past And I think this day has been taken you know you have people on the left. They've compared you know January 6th to this day They've compared you know me like it's just dumb stuff and I mean it is important But I also want to want to bring in something too that I think is also important You know the the kind of signature tagline of this day is never forget and I think there's a lot of things That happens since that day and because of that day that people have actually forgotten You know one of those things being and I mean again, it's very important people don't forget this stuff But like the Patriot Act was brought in because of this day Which was supposed to be this temporary measure and you know use a bring down terrorism But we all know there's been exposed plenty of times this is being used to spy on on us That's why they have a thing called the domestic terrorist list So that they can use the Patriot Act against the United States America citizens and anybody who you know and like what makes a domestic terrorist Anybody that does not agree they they're a thing well now what it is now is is it's the Patriots of America that they consider domestic terrorist right Right and I think it's so fitting the Patriot Act, you know, but like it's being used against the Patriots actual fucking Patriot man So never forget then I think it's I mean even even I think I think there's a lot dude I think there's a lot of people forget I think people forget That we invaded a country and killed a million people over there who were innocent Because of the lies that the cabal came up with okay, what a year it wasn't just George Bush it was the cabal and Then on top of it what they did was they kept a synethgannis stand they kept us in the Middle East for like you said 20 years And people don't understand why they do that well They do that because that fuels the military industrial complex which boosts their Financial status and makes all kinds of money for people who are making these decisions while your kids and your dad and your brother And your sister and your moms and your daughters go to fight these wars that mean nothing Mean nothing and you wonder why the rest of the world hates us the rest of the world hates us because we're the Iron fist of the globalists and we have been for a very long time when there's a problem somewhere who do they send? Oh, they send the Americans and then they sell us this bill of goods that we're doing something to protect freedom of Protect your market democracy, which we aren't we're fighting battles for money for tyrants killing innocent people all over the world For not our benefit for their benefit and it's not okay, and I think Americans have woken up to it You know, I think it's very very important to recognize that the people who go to fight these battles those people are heroes They don't they're doing what they're told that doesn't take away from the the suffering or the the sacrifice or the things that they've done I honor those men and women At the highest respect level. I'm talking about the people at the very very top who organized this ridiculous shit and You know, then we have situations where you know They've used the the entire excuse of terrorism to lock down and Further the security state here in this country like you mentioned with the Patriot Act You know Say fucking groaked in the fucking airport to fly in this country. Yeah, when you know You could go down to the southern border and just walk across yeah with no strips. There's no x-rays and no nothing Yeah, you know, just dump shit like that man It's insane and I think the important thing is and again I mean we're talking about three thousand plus Americans were killed on this day that happened Nobody saying that did not happen of course that happened. I watched it fucking happened right? Yeah, the problem is and the where I get irritated is is that when you learn that our own government will use these situations to justify Tyranical fucking rule over its citizens. That's exactly what happened and you take that and there's like that is an Undisputable fucking fact The Patriot I mean, there's plenty of examples here, but the problem is I feel like it should make people wonder and question like okay If they can use Situations that happen, you know to further tyranical rule at one point does that cross over to they will create situations Oh further that that that happened many years ago Before 9-11 You know 9-11 was a manufactured strategy for sure And I get there's a lot of truth and I would not you're gonna tell me that fucking massage and the CIA didn't know this was fucking coming You what about the three trillion dollars disappeared the day before Donald people don't understand this braves 20 years old when this happened, okay? I was an adult Donald's Rumsfeld came out the day before 9-11 and was like oh, we're missing three trillion dollars next day 9-11 What happens no one talks about it ever again or the or the building itself didn't have fucking insurance on it for Years before and the dude the dude buys an insurance policy four months before and makes fucking five billion dollars Building number seven just collapses on its own nothing hit it nothing happened to it, okay? Like bro listen here's the real talk this yeah This was an act of terrorism, but it wasn't exactly the terrorists that they told us it was it was the terrorists who Understand what they were trying to do of putting our country into a total surveillance state moving us towards communism They abuse these adjustments and these rules that they made that were supposed to be temporary every single day against the United States American citizens It's wrong and it doesn't take away from the people who died and it doesn't take away from the heroic daxing It doesn't take away from you know the people who served during this time. They all believe they were doing the right thing But you know the people who orchestrated it They're the same people who run a shit now never forget me and here's the other thing I'll say to this too You know it does bother me how all these people will post you know on 4th of July they'll post something a memorial day They'll post something on 9-11 they'll post something You know and they'll say something like thank you for your sacrifice and this and that or whatever right But they won't fucking voice their opinion about anything going on in the world They won't say anything they will only do it when it's socially acceptable It's safe. Yeah, I'm when it's safe and they all know what's going on because They voice those opinions in private and the reason that we're here where we are is because people won't voice those opinions in public So you should think about that, you know when I think about when I see people that post on those days is like where where were you the rest of the time That's what I think and and and furthermore How many of these people who are saying oh never forget thank you for all your sacrifice, you know Memorial day and 4th of July and all this shit. How many of these people just live in like shit They're not honoring the sacrifice made it all right. It's all a bunch of fucking yippy happen Well, I mean all that you know inside secret to guys, you know It's all it's always safe to speak your fucking mind when you just fucking speak it Well, what people don't understand bro is that freedom is only freedom when you exercise it That's how you maintain it you don't maintain it because it's awarded to you by a government or a figure of the government or a law Freedom is only maintained to the amount that we exercise and if we don't exercise our freedom it naturally gets accroched upon and Becomes less and less free and so you know people have to understand that by staying quiet You're voluntarily giving up the ground to people who want to take our freedom away And if you would just speak up and tell the truth and say your opinion like you're supposed to you know as an American Americans have a reputation for being badass Staying for what they believe Yeah, live up to the reputation because that's the reason we stay free. We don't stay free because Some politician votes us or makes a supreme court decision. We stay free because we exercise the freedoms we have which is They made a lot of people afraid to do which is creating a situation where our freedom is being diminished every single day Yeah, guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments What you guys think where were you guys at 9 11 2000 one? That's no down in the comments with that being said let's get into our headlines remember if you want to see any of these Pictures articles links or videos go to Andy for seller.com We can find all of that stuff linked there for you. I was that being said headlight number one Gotta talk about it. We had a little sushi date last night. So yeah, yeah, that was nice. It was was you know good Got to share some chop sticks. Yeah Play some play some chopstick not not to be confused with tummy sticks Chopsticks different thing we watch the debate so Kamala and Trump they had their first debate maybe they're last I don't know Let's talk about it. There's a lot of interesting things happening here Before we get to our blood. Let's just let's just go through this a little bit I do want to say I think the first thing that I think people honestly kind of overlooking it And I think men when I show you this clip you guys will definitely understand the power play dynamic that happened But I don't think enough people are talking about it. I want to get you take on it And this happened within the first 10 seconds of the debate. It's when they walked out on the stage Walked out on the stage. Let's let's check this clip Let's watch this Kamala Harris something to be sure she have fun. Thank you. It's very very simple That's a man thing I like room in I think I'll just do what just happened there That was a massive power play. Yeah, she fed right into him loss Like he made her come to her he had a redirect I think I think that could be viewed in two different ways. I think that could I agree with you That's what was the play on his mind. I definitely think that but I also agree that I also think that people who are viewing that from another perspective could see that as she's being assertive Hmm, you see what I'm saying? Yeah, I'm just saying I mean, they can listen we listen dude all the women who vote for Kamala because just because she's a woman They love that because they said oh look. She's not afraid of him. She's she's asserting she's being assertive That's how they read that so just because you and I read it as yeah, what we did There's a there's a opposite side to read that too. I also think too. She's just sounded dumb like you don't like he knows your fucking name Yeah, well then another Kamala. Yeah another thing is is he didn't give his name because he said everybody knows who the fuck I am I just think there was some like like psychological power play for sure That's the first 10 seconds of course, but I mean, I don't think she necessarily came off as looking stupid there. Oh, I did Yeah, I know you also like, you know, I'm just telling you there's two ways to look at it. I get it. Yeah I'll just play yeah, no, but um, so you have that now before we get to the rest of this let's let's see what both sides had to say about the debate first Trump released a statement Trump's campaign released a statement on this um It reads president Trump delivered a masterful debate performance tonight prosecuting Kamala Harris as bismill record of failure that has hurt americans for the last four years quote We saw president trump lay out his bold vision of america and how he would continue to build upon the successes of his first term by super charging the economy securing the border and stopping crime from ravaging communities across the country And virtually Kamala's vision of america was a dark reminder of the oppressive big government policies of Joe Biden as she wants to continue high inflation a poorest border that allows criminals and terrorists to flood across and being soft on crime That is what Kamala represents the choice could not be more clear President Trump was the clear winner tonight and he will win for america when he returns to the White House Um, so that was a statement issued by president Trump's campaign Uh, let's see. I mean that you know whatever Let's see what Kamala had to say so this is from Kamala's campaign Kamala HQ on twitter Uh, was this or just a picture with a couple of headlines how Harris rattled Trump and dominated the debate Harris dominates his Trump gets defensive Kamala Harris dominates Donald Trump in debate Um, and that was it and I mean a picture of her doing the seal clap um now There was some definitely some funny points there um, I know I had some favorites. I know you had some favorites Um, I think my favorite one was when uh She tried to interrupt him because there was some mic issues where she didn't like get her mic cut off completely Um, but he had to check her and he said I'm talking now sound familiar pulling one of her verbatim plays as she did Um, in the 2020 debates um, that was one of my favorite ones, but what what what was one of your favorite parts comical wise of the debate They're eating the dogs They're eating the dogs. Oh, we said I said off fuck then I'm eating the dogs man. It's the ducks He doesn't even say ducks he didn't say cats though. Yeah, he did say cats. I think they're eating whatever they can get yeah now last night like say any night we uh You know had some sushi were watching the debates together um I Think very quickly we both kind of like at the same time I most got to this like She was way too prepared for this debate In my opinion All right, where and when I say prepare like I'm talking like we have plenty of evidence of this woman speaking in public Um, we got four years at least And every single time she is talked to and given any type of like question on the spot. It's nothing but word salad I didn't see that last night No, I didn't either I didn't see it and like I had a bunch of other friends too like I know hey, what's going on The first thing out of their mouths was dude. Do you think she was fat those fucking questions? Yeah, right now I woke up this morning and there was a bunch of uh, there was the interesting conspiracy theory um, I love conspiracies We're both loyal to the foil here Now I do think it's interesting now. I don't know if she was fat these questions ahead of time But there's also this conspiracy theory. I'm not sure if you've seen it This headline reads conspiracy rages among Trump supporters following presidential debate as viewers question Kamala Harris's earrings So apparently there's a company that has a Kickstarter page going called Nova H1 audio earrings Okay, this is a screenshot straight from that Kickstarter page. It is a pair of earrings Where Nova claims it's the first and only wireless earphones embedded in a pair of pearl earrings on a gold or silver silver-plated clip And they look exactly like the ones that Kamala Harris had on last night Now I'm not I don't know if she had a therepiece in I think it could be something very easy and simple is that she owes her Tiffany earrings That she just got you know the questions ahead of time and Trump did not Nonetheless, it was definitely a fucking three to one tag team play here on Trump. I think everybody can see that And there's evidence of that you know ABC news fact check Trump seven times they never fact check Kamala once Despite there were 21 plus false claims and hoaxes that Kamala Harris made during that debate We'll go through a couple of them here quickly The first one she brought up the very fine people bullshit narrative that has been debunk eight thousand times. Yeah The project 2025 hoax bullshit that the left loves to keep bringing up that is Trump's project 2025 Which that has been debunked countless of times um the false claims on the Trump trade deficit Harris claim the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit that was quote one of the highest We've ever seen in the history of America that is patently false the trade deficit climbed to around 653 billion and Trump's final year as president in part Because of depressed global demand for us goods and services and a US economy that recovered sooner than most other developed economies But the trade deficit never rose to the levels seen under former president George W. Bush or The trade deficit levels of the current administration. They actually have the highest trade deficit In the history of America right now Other things you know the dictator on day one the bloodbath thing they brought up Um, there was a claim she made also too about you know There was not one troop in any war zone that is inherently fucking false There are currently active duty us troops deployed in Iraq and Syria Who have been under frequent attack by Iran back militia forces over the past year alone Um, there's also thousands of active duty sailors Deploy to the Middle East who are facing attacks by drone strikes and missiles fire by Iran back Houthi forces in Yemen Um, just earlier this year three US soldiers were killed on the border of Syria by Iran back forces um, so that's inherently false Um, one of my favorite ones that she mentioned in the last one we noted in this article is that taking guns away Um, Harris claimed that she and her running mate Minnesota governor Tim walls are not taking anyone's guns Away that's false Harris has campaigned on banning AR-15s and other guns the democrats label assault weapons Just as recently as three weeks ago During their first campaign event together Harrison walls pushed For a ban on AR-15s and other guns she said it four or five days ago after the Shooting yeah, right exactly she tweeted it. Yeah, that's right She tweeted it Um, now you check the headlines and again, they're all over the place a little bit It was Donald Trump's night in the worst possible way, but here's an interesting thing the polls are now coming in From all over the place Reuters out of all places um, they had a focus group where undecided voters lean Trump two to one after the debate see span 75 to 25 going to Trump About who won the debate uh Wall Street silver a very very powerful uh twitter page Donald Trump to Harris 83 to 17 insider paper 59 to 35 leading report 90 to 10 newsmex 93 to six And if you need more evidence look at the stocks. I don't know if you saw that this morning Stocks plunge after presidential debate and higher core inflation Moment they opened up this morning Andy, what do you got on all of this? Well, you know, look dude um, I think there's a lot to this first of all Kamala Definitely was well prepared. Oh, she's whether or not she look dude. I'm a professional speaker I've been one for over a decade. I get paid a lot of money to speak I know how to speak and I'm very good at reading people Who know how to speak and evaluating their skill set and when you look at her answers She had those answers on every talking point down pat to the point where the emphasis Of the exact syllable of the exact word was literally perfect and she kept that perfect record of Delivery through the entire event entire time. Okay, so For my extensive experience as being a speaker a highly paid speaker I think I'm paid most more than almost fucking anybody Uh, and I'm definitely paid as much as these big politicians to speak okay I could tell you for sure that you cannot be that good without being Aware of what's coming so I don't know how they prepared I'm not gonna sit here and make accusations I don't think that earrings were a real thing because even if they were repeating what for her to say She was saying it the delivery was almost perfect flow was so good. Yeah, it was yeah, and it's not that's not something That you can do on the fly in a debate discussion that she's just not um, and I don't care how good you are I don't care how good you are this so In my opinion and my speculative opinion on this there was an unfair advantage With the preparation I also clearly see that there was an unfair advantage With the moderators and the way they were debating Trump along with her um That was that was obvious And I think the reason that we're seeing The polls favor Trump post this debate is because everybody has gotten wise to the fact Of how much they're willing to manipulate lie and cheat To create the desired outcome that they are looking to create and When she gets on there and she starts saying things like we're not gonna take guns when five days ago. She's saying let's take the guns Um, you know when she gets on there and they say all these things that sound moderate went from the last You know Fucking decade. She's said nothing, but super far left progressive shit complete opposite. Yes complete opposite of what she's saying I think all that does is bolster support for Donald Trump because people are looking at it and they're saying bro It's just more of the same shit like they're railroading this guy more and the more they persecute and the more that they Stack the cards against him and the more unfair they are The more they're opening up the eyes of the general public to see what's actually going on And they've actually started to create a martyr or an underdog out of Trump Which is the worst possible situation for them because in America people love Underdogs and even if you don't like Trump Even if he's not your kind of guy when you see someone just getting hammered and hammered and hammered and lied against and cheated against and unfair advantages and shot at and persecuted and all these things Eventually people who who even really don't care for Trump or like bro fuck this. This is fucked up That's how most Americans feel about like the Dallas Cowboys It's very equivalent sure So yeah, so I would take him a trophy for that one But the point of it is is that like dude they've created a martyr out of this dude And the more they throw at him the stronger he gets So while there's no There's no question in my mind that Kamala Harris performed better at the debate I think the fact of how they made her perform better Is not lost on the American people which is reflective of the polls that are being produced now and I think You know president Trump did a really good job Replying You know, it's very hard to debate against someone or being an argument with someone who's willing to flat out look you in the face And lie very confidently Um, and all of you have been in a situation like that before where you've been arguing with someone or there's three people and you're trying to make a case And the other person just straight up looks at you in the face and tells a blatant lie and says you know that that's the truth and it's totally made up And when you get in that situation That's a hard thing to compete against because for someone who's not aware of The actual data the actual statistics the actual situation if you were an uninformed viewer Of this debate it would appear that Kamala just destroyed him right, but I don't think that's the result I think the result is that It opened up people's eyes to the the excessive Uh, because there should be no bias, but the the extreme amount of bias from the media um You know like you and I are watching it right and like we know that the very fine people thing is a hoax We know that rushes a hoax We know like a lot of these things like like the one thing they tried to say is that Donald Trump left him with the worst economy ever And it's like bro You you fucking like they think people forgot that the Democrats and the media and everybody was Pressuring him to shut the country down and in fact when he turned the country back over The jobs were already recovered and so these people are trying to claim you know bounce back As growth and they're doing the same thing with their financial reporting with the reporting on interest rates with the reporting on job growth You know, we've seen a number of situations over the last three years where they've estimated job growth at X And then it comes out three months later in a very small segment on the back page of the internet that says oh It wasn't actually X it was actually one quarter of X right and so they're drastically over estimating the Statistics on the front end and then not telling people on the back end And so there's a lot of deception a lot of deception going on And if you don't familiar with it or you don't follow it Which a lot of people don't because they're so busy trying to survive We end up in a situation where she appears to be dominant But I think Americans bro at this point in time and I think even Democrats Are to the point where they know that these people are legit Marx's communist and they're willing to say Anything to get elected and that's what we're seeing Kamala do she's going up there She's saying things that are against what she used to believe and what she still believes and we had a Bernie Sanders Come on say that Bernie Sanders came out and fucking basically said yeah, dude She's just saying that because she wants to get elected and after she gets elected She's gonna go right back to the same shit and I think Americans understand that and and and the data that's coming out seems to suggest that they do yeah For sure, I think and one thing we said to bro like I don't think anybody That you know before the debate who was voting for Trump. I don't think any one of them. I think that's the bottom line after the debate Are not voting. Yeah, I think the bottom line is Nobody's changing their votes Now there might be some people who are independent who are now like fuck I got a vote for Trump because they're you know, and that's what we're seeing where we have two out of three or two to one on the independence but you know That's because these people are recognizing what's actually happening here the more that they try to deceive And I think it's good that they think they won the debate I think it's good that they think they did because that means there's less of a chance for some major fucking black swan disruption um But I don't think they're fooling anybody and You know, they did accomplish their goal and their goal was to create A believable scenario where the race is much closer than what it actually is and I think anybody who Watch that debate last night would be convinced that it's closer after watching that than what it is um So that I think that was their goal. I think the goal was to make it appear as if These two people are close So that they can fudge the gap cheap right yeah, I mean and me personally like You know even with just like how they're doing these debates now This is the first time in history that these debates have been Held in the format that they're being held. Yeah, I bro. I want to go back Not too far back, but I want to go back So we're like literally presidents with like these candidates would pop up in the middle of the fucking cities Fucking put pop up fucking pole. They listen to the fuck you do that. They can't the Democrats cannot have a live crowd Because she can't lie the way she's lying with a live crowd with real America. That's right because we peaked because like dude If you really want to do this how it should be Is you have a live crowd? Okay, you have one conservative moderator from let's say Fox you have one Democrat moderator from ABC whatever right. Yeah, 50% of the crowd The tickets are available for Trump 50% are available for Kamala. Okay, which she won't be able to fill And then you do you do the debate and there's no turning the microphones off It's a fucking debate back and forth And if that were the scenario, I mean dude Trump will crush this lady bro And and not only would Trump crush it the crowd would crush her Because when she started bringing up, you know The very fine people and what was the other one she that you said she had I mean it was a lot Yeah, a lot of these old Project 2025 the blood bath comment which was an economic focus comment You know like when she would say this in front of her crowd you would hear the crowd boo her So they can't do that because they they can't lie I can't risk confidently with the crowd standing right there. So that's what's happening and dude I don't think Trump should agree to do another debate where there isn't people there. Yeah, yeah, this this like you know closed off She's no bro. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how that went because I'm just telling you dude like because I don't know if they got the questions ahead of time But it my first thought was she's got these she's had these questions. So um I think that's gonna I honestly I think that may even come out within the next couple of weeks I could see that too. We're like oh someone blows a whistle and says hey, this is what actually No, it was a some fucking you know You know 52 gender fucking person working for ABC. Yeah accidentally. Yeah, sent the fucking question like yeah I can see that coming out and I would not be surprised yeah Because again like we've had we have too much evidence of this lady days before this fucking debate being a total airhead Right and saying saying Saying the opposite shit of what she's saying On the debate stage. I think she's just discrediting herself more than anything and I think the more She tries to win the moderate vote when everybody knows what she's really about and everybody's experienced what this woman's really about I think she's telling on herself. I don't think anybody's changing their vote Um away from Trump to vote for Kamala and and I don't think anybody who's hard said on Kamala is Gonna go vote for Trump But I do think that the libertarian type people and the independent people Are starting to realize the importance of their vote because I think what's happening there, bro Is they're watching her and they're like holy shit this lady saying anything she can to get elected What's she gonna do when she gets in right? You know what I mean right? So how can you have confidence in that? You can't you know, you know Yeah, man guys jumping on this conversation Let us know what you guys thought about the debate down in the comments Oh, that being said, let's go check some of these comments out Let's go cruise the comments this first comment Uh comes from herb j smith herb J smith herbie herbie good old herbster Good old dick twiz He says uh can you post links please and data to your non-factual data Yeah, we do that every show.

If like my life sucked and I was like, you know My shit was all fucked up. I wouldn't be thinking I was that smart would be saying that Whatever you guys think it is Yeah, man Guys 80 headline up to let's dive into this. So I mean while the baits that's obviously the big topic of the day There's other things that are happening in our country. I think we should be aware and privy of the second headline headline reads House GOP plans to advert government shutdown on life support as Johnson delays vote now This is an interesting one that comes in I've been monitoring this for a couple of days now We basically have about three weeks left before a potential government shutdown Now house speaker Mike Johnson Was forced to delay a house-wide vote on his plan to avert a partial government shutdown on Wednesday after a slew of GOP defections put the bill on life support within days of its rollout So Johnson's old reporters there would be no vote today on the measure a short-term extension of this year's government funding Called a continuing resolution or CR Combined with the measure to mandate a proof of citizenship requirement in the voter registration process All right, so understand this Continuing resolution this this ER that's in effect right now that they're trying to get it passed and approved Okay, it includes two things Government funding for the next six months where they finalize a budget on that And then making sure that people who are voting in this election that's coming up are actual American citizens That's it And it's being fucking stalled By people not just on the left because we call them out how we see them. They're fucking Republican People in our Congress supposed to be representative representing us that are now Defecting and not voting or voting in the against for this fucking bill to pass House leaders originally plan to hold the vote late on Wednesday afternoon though as early in the morning at least eight Republican lawmakers Signaled opposition conservative Opponents on Johnson's right flank who were largely against CRs in general believing them to be an extension of overboard Omnibus spending bills Which they oppose Accused House GOP leaders of trying to appease them with a messaging bill that would not ultimately be signed into law some GOP national security hawks were also worried Of the bills six month spending extension over its impact on military and other defense spending Pushing instead for a shorter spending patch into December Um now they have to reach an agreement by September 30th All right, they don't reach an agreement by September 30th. There's going to be a partial government shutdown um one source familiar with discussions told Fox News digital that they anticipate Johnson holding the vote next week Something the speaker also alluded to in his comments quote the American people demand and deserve that we do everything possible to secure the elections That's what we've been saying consistently Johnson said we're going to continue Uh to work on this the whip is going to do the hard work and bill consensus We're going to work through the weekend on that um and in a shot at the bills opponents on both sides Johnson said quote I want any member of congress in any party to explain to the American people while we should not ensure that only U.S. citizens are voting in U.S. elections So again, that's the big part of the bill They're trying to make it about oh, it shouldn't be a six month extension on the spending It should just be a three month extension They're fucking lying to you They're holding this up because they don't want to ensure that Americans and only Americans are voting in this election And it's on both sides former president Donald Trump had advocated for the six month CR Attached to the safeguarding American voting uh voter eligibility or the save act Advocated for that last month urging House Republicans to leverage a shutdown weeks before election day to get it past It periods of changes to in somewhat this week urging GOP lawmakers to vote against the CR unless they were insured Uh of a non-citizen voting crackdown um now with all of that going on Again, we have at least conservatively 12 million Illegal migrants in this country We showed yesterday that just in one state alone there was over 144,000 uh voters voters and air quotes Um that are voting without ID That's just in one state We got 11 million to 12 million With people with no ID. Uh-huh. These things are trying to happen in plenty of states Not just swing states was blue states states that potentially could even be read by now who knows right And there's this weird Passion that our people in government have about not trying to ensure that why why would that be right? And they're doing everything they care to try to protect these migrants from you know headlines like this Republican spread baseless slurs about cadding and eating migrants in Ohio City Right not to mention the shit that's happened in morora My fucker. I got videos that people are sending me from the fucking streets of these mother fuckers put in oranges on pigeons and eating them Can we show that yeah you fucking show that yeah, I mean, and like and that's the thing It's like they but they keep pushing this nonsense like snopes even has his v- of this picture of a dude walking down the street with a fucking goose A dead goose in his hand There's no evidence Haitian immigrants are eating ducks geese or pets in springfield right or that it's unfounded like you said And we have people sending us we have people sending us fucking videos of this shit, okay Sending us videos. This is a really exclusive check this video clip out this happened in Dallas. Yeah check this out This woman is marinating a pigeon with a fucking orange while it's alive Oh That is a video that a listener took Okay Why in the world What are American government? Want people who are not American citizens to have a say in the direction of our country It's bad enough that people who are American citizens that don't pay taxes have a say in the direction of our country Do you use their American do we really think that like like real talk do these people really believe That we as American citizens are going to accept An election That is decided by people who have been imported from third world countries who are not American citizens Do you think that the American citizens are going to accept that I do not And they shouldn't and we shouldn't the fact that these elite Fucks are bringing in people who are not citizens who are draining our tax dollars That's your tax dollars my tax dollars that we Pay off the backs of our hard work for these people to come in and then vote for more of our tax dollars to go to them The American citizens should not tolerate this at all Every single Senator or congressman that opposes voter ID or the elections being Exclusively for American citizens should be removed from government by arrest By arrest our Military should arrest every single politician at national and state and county level that believes That not American citizens should have the right to vote in any level of election in this country The fact that they are willing to accept that shows their treasonous nature and That they have zero of our interests in mind and only their interests because the only reason that they would want these people to vote Is so that they can maintain power and the reason they want to maintain power is because they want to keep the gravy train That is their career that is their business when they're ill equipped to do anything else for a living intact And they also want to protect themselves from prosecution of the crimes that they have already committed Which are plentiful, all right? so Any one of these people who is saying that illegal immigrants or non citizens should vote our literal treasonous traders to the United States of America and should be treated as such Just disgusting man. I mean, I do you really want people who fucking you know Put fucking oranges listen listen dude this this that it's not about until the American citizen Stams the fuck up and says none of these motherfuckers should be able to vote in our country And be serious about it and start taking its fucking serious like I'm talking about going to the polling station And make sure that nobody that is clearly a fucking illegal from somewhere else shows up to vote by force Okay, until American citizens do that these people are gonna continue to pray on every single passive American citizen That exists which is most of us most of you won't even speak up Okay, much less go to a voting book booth or a voting pole center and make sure that there's not a line of 4,000 fucking immigrants there to vote Okay, this is our country. We don't allow people from other countries to vote go to fucking Russia as a non-Russian citizen Try to vote in their fucking elections to see what happens to you go go anywhere and try to do that They will fucking arrest you if not put you to death Okay, this is the only country in the world where they do this and they've convinced you that it's somewhat normal It is not normal. It is highly treasonous and these people should be treated as the traders that they are 100% man guys jumping on this conversation I just know what you guys think down in the comments and stay up to date With more information about the government shut down Um and later episodes, but with that being said let's get to our third and final headline At number three This is uh, this is what I wanted to wait on a little bit You know, it's it's very important. You don't jump on Uh headlines and events that happen you want to give it some time for more information and facts to come out Um, so let's talk about this one Uh, Mrs. Sound of the police Tyree kill says he could have handled his traffic stop better But he still wants the officer fired So let's dive into this little bit. There's some interest in people jumping in on this conversation Um, Miami dolphins wide receiver Tyree kill acknowledged Wednesday that he could have handled himself better in the initial moments of a weekend traffic stop Now left him handcuffed and pulled out of his car by police officers near the team stadium He'll also set now he wants one of the officers involved in the incident dismissed from the police force Uh, he'll say he wishes he did some things quote a bit differently Uh, on Sunday morning including leaving the window of his car down when officers instructed him to do so He wrote up the window instead He isn't an escalated quickly from there quote I will say I could have been better he'll said I could have let down my window in that instant But the thing about me is I don't want attention. I don't want to be Cameras out phones on you in that moment, but at the end of the day, I'm human. I've got to follow rules I've got to do what everyone else would do Now here's the facts of the case All right, he was driving an estimated 60 miles per hour and 40 mile per hour zone All right Um, he had no idea to keep that reputation up fast man in the NFL bro. It's true. You know, um, it'd be fast everything This is true. I'm just glad the car wasn't stolen Um, he had no what what what what he mean. That sound racist.

I think it's important. Let's watch the whole thing All right And then I got a very interesting person to jump in on this conversation. So let's check the body cam footage out This is from Miami-Dade Police Department here's the clam uh, here is the body cam footage the hey oh hey Keepomondon repair our I can't you out of the car.

That's a clip. Now there's a lot there. There is a lot there. There's a lot there. You wanna do our thoughts so you wanna see who had something to say about this? Now we can see what they say and then we'll, you know, we'll chime in. An interesting person commented on this. Headline reads, dolphins Tyree Kill not blameless an incident with police officers. ESPN Stephen A Smith says, he jumped in on the council. Stephen A Smith's getting more reasonable. Like, like, like, I used to really, like, he was a very much so a huge race bader for a long, long time. He still is from time to time, but I'm getting more, I liked the new Stephen A where he's kind of like evaluating what the fuck is up and like, you know, not always making it that way. Yeah, for sure. ESPN star Stephen A Smith suggested that Miami Dolphin star Tyree Kill wasn't excused from blam during the situation when police officers in Florida that led to his detention. Now we just saw the body cam. Now, Stephen A Smith gave his opinion on the situation saying, neither police officers involved nor heel are immune from blameless. Check this clip out. But when it comes to Tyree Kill, we also can't let him completely off the hook based on the statement that was made by the by the police department in Florida. They said, quote unquote, he was cooperative. We have a responsibility on this show in any kind of platform that we have to make sure we're doing what we can to save lives, to make sure that we're doing what we can to ensure that somehow, some way you get to live another day and fight that battle. We know how wrong they were. The police were excessive. No excuses. They should be ashamed in themselves the way they acted. They just went overboard, totally true. Especially when it came to Kalea's camp as well, who did nothing and put his arms up. He was not, he was no threat whatsoever, okay? They told him to step back, he stepped back. He let them know that was his friend, another team agent who Smith comes in there. He's by his car, he's on the phone, he's clearly not posing any threat. The police officers were definitely agitated, they were wrong. Here's the problem. We all came on the air seeing the initial footage in complete unadulterated support for Tyree Kill. You pull over. They tell you to roll down your window. What's the first thing Shannon just talked about? The first thing they do when they pull us over, they pull me over. All my windows are down. My hands on the stairwell, that is not what Tyree Kill. Bro, I do that. Tyree Kill had his window up. The officer bangs on, you know, knocks on his window. He didn't bang on his window, he knocked on his window. You hesitate to pull it down. The first thing you say is, don't bang on my window like that. Don't bang on my window like that. Don't bang on my window like that. He asked you for your driver's license. You hesitated to give him your driver's license. You said in the post game conference, hey y'all, what if I wasn't Tyree Kill? What if you weren't Tyree Kill? What would have happened to you if somebody that wasn't Tyree Kill kept the windows rolled up, hesitated to roll it down. No, Shannon. Didn't give you the license immediately when you asked for it, and then hesitated to get out the car when they told you to get out the car. See, we gotta be responsible. And the point that I'm trying to make is this, in no way should the officers be excused for what they did. I totally agree with you, Dom, every syllable, you two, Shannon, every syllable. But I also am saying, Yo Tyreek, Yo bro, you didn't deserve that. I'm not implying that you did. But the police officers do have the power. When they pull up on you, and they tell you to roll down that window, and they tell you to give you your driver's license, and they tell you to get out that car. That's what you gotta do. Yeah, I don't. I mean, look dude, you know, that he's, I agree with everything he said. Bro, you're in a tentative car listening through the fucking window. Well, I mean listen, bro, you used to be a cop. What do you think? Yeah, it's fucking dangerous, man. Like, I can show you 15 clips right now with police officers walking up to a fucking car with a window up, and guess what happens? The dude starts fucking shooting out the fucking car. I can show you 15 clips, right? I can show you clips where the window's down, and they do that, right? And so like, I mean, they're not like dude, follow fucking directions. Like you have to comply. And like this whole idea that like, you know, you're gonna try to make these arguments and try to go pat the cops. That's not the place to do it. That's not the place to do it. You do that shit in court. You get, you can afford a good fucking lawyer. Get a fucking good lawyer. Take care of that shit in court. Yeah, but you're being a fucking asshole, bro. You're being a fucking asshole. And honestly, like, you know, people wanna say the cops escalated. Yeah, I mean, potentially the one cop who like put, yeah, for sure. But that could have been way fucking worse. It could have been way worse. That could have been an officer involved. Shoot you can. Oh, for sure. Like it could have been way worse. Listen man, I applaud the restraint there because it could have been way worse. All right. So I agree with everything you're saying. I agree with everything Stephen A saying, which is super rare. I think Stephen A makes good points, but he's, he's, look dude. I think with Stephen A just said, there is gonna help save other black men's lives. Okay, because there is a cultural difference between how white people behave with the police and how black people behave with the police. And black people like to say, well, if they like to look at a situation and they say, well, if that guy was black, he'd be this and this and this. But that guy don't act like y'all act when you get pulled over. Okay, and I'm just being real. There's a narrative, there's an idea that we could do whatever they look at. Listen, man, stereotypes or stereotypes because there's truth in the stereotype. All right. And when you're a black man and you're driving a fucking awesome McLaren by the way, fuck it, 720s. That's nice. Tint it out, pimps fuck. That's a shit. Okay, and you're speeding through the neighborhood and you're not wearing a seat belt. And the first thing you start doing when they come up to the window is mowling off and all this shit, you're asking for trouble. And quite honestly, dude, I agree with you. I think he could have gotten way worse because of the window rolling up thing. Dude, that's a dangerous situation. Dude, for sure. We just covered that one more that guy was reaching for the fucking Draco in between his legs. Right. So, you know, here's my take on what happened here. Tyreex, very wealthy guy. He is very famous. He's used to doing whatever the fuck he wants. Okay, because when you're rich and famous, people do treat you differently. And they kind of let you like, you kind of do whatever the fuck you want. And, you know, when it comes to the police, you don't get to do whatever you want. And sometimes I think people who are used to getting guesses don't like to be told what to do when police are telling them what to do, including me. I will say that those police officers, you could tell they lost their temper. You could tell they escalated the one guy in particular, with a tattooed hands, the guy that pulled him out of the car, and then put him in a neck restraint when he was standing on the sidewalk, not being a threat. That guy deserves some sort of repercussions for his actions. I don't know that he needs to be fired. But yeah, dude, I mean, I think both parties are to blame here, but if we're gonna blame one party more than the other, it's Tyreex. Because bro, you act like an asshole. You let that rich and famous ego shit carry into a place where it's not tolerated and shouldn't be tolerated. Okay, you go into a restaurant, they see the nice table, that's one thing. You're speeding through a residential zone, fuck, it's 60 miles an hour and 40, and a $300,000 McLaren, and those cops are making a fucking 85 grand a year. They already don't like you bro, you know what I'm saying? So, you know, I think it's important, you know, like when I get pulled, I've been pulled over a million times, dude, and you know, the last time I got pulled over, I think we talked about it on the show. I was speeding by a lot. I was driving a lot for Ari, and I fucking rolled and went both windows down. I got my gun on my seat. First thing I say, I got my hands on the steering wheel, I say, hey bro, right over there is my carry gun, you know. We, listen, we need to do a better job communicating with the police that they are not in danger. And if you do that, whenever you get pulled over, you deal with the police, you're gonna have good interactions with the police most of the time. They don't wanna have conflict, they don't wanna have fights, they don't wanna go home, bro. They don't wanna chase nobody, they don't wanna shoot nobody. Are there people who are assholes for sure? But even the way that guy reacted, the reason that he reacted that way is because this guy, Tyreeq, is making a dangerous situation of something that shouldn't be. And he's getting pissed because he's like, dude, what the fuck are you doing? And I know they all know who the fuck he is, he just gave him a license, right? So, you know, look bro, these, I think Steve and A gave a really a very responsible response, and it's very good for black Americans, because he speaks to a lot of black Americans, to especially black men. Like bro, you guys can't let your mouth and your ego get you in trouble with these people, dude, if you just make sure that you understand that when a police officer pulls you over, he's already scared, he's already nervous, he's already like, fuck, and you say, oh, well that's because I'm black, well yeah, because the crime data is fucking, you represent 12% of the population, actually black male, 6%, 5%, you commit over 50% of the violent crimes, so they're just understanding the data, they understand that like, dude, and you say, well they're profiling, no shit, no shit. I mean, even to that though bro, like that McLaren's black to fuck out, they don't know who the fuck. No, no, no, my point is, is that like, dude, like when people try to say shit like, oh well, they just treated me that way, cause I'm black, well that might be true sometimes, because of the way that they've been treated before by black men, so like we have to realize that, like if we ever want this problem to resolve itself, there has to be respect on both sides, and if black men want to stop being singled out by the police, then they got to start treating the police a different way than they've been treating them. And dude, you know, like dude, like it's like touching the stove, like you touch the stove, it burns you, you touch the stove, it burns you, you touch the stove, it burns you, and then someone walks in and says, hey touch that stove, you're gonna be like, I'm a fucking touch in that stove, right? Like, you know what I mean? Instead of we say it's the stove's fault. Yeah, dude, that's what I'm saying man, and it's, look, there's just so much bullshit in the world right now, we don't need either one of those things. We don't need a white or a black or any citizen making a cop feel endangered, and we don't need cops overreacting. And for that situation to heal, there's gonna have to be a respect that is established for the police, because like Steve and I said, and his monologue there, they have the power, they have the authority in that situation. And whether you think it's right or it's wrong, it's the truth, and they can take your life, they can take your fucking life. So legally, so like dude, we have to acknowledge whether or not we think that's okay or we don't okay, it's the reality of the situation. And when you roll your window up and create a situation, like bro, have that been at nighttime? Oh man. No, listen, have that been at nighttime, that same situation nighttime, he probably would have got shot. He probably would have got shot. Bro, how much easier would the situation have been? The fact that he didn't get shot, or worse, is likely because it was 10 o'clock in the morning. How much easier would that situation have been? You got pulled over. Oh man, listen guys, I'm sorry, I was speeding a little bit. I'm trying to get some more game. Yeah. You're gonna try to go ball out of the game. It would have been, it probably would have, they probably would have said, oh, Mr. Hill, shit dude, let's drive you down there. You fucking to scorch you down there bro. You know what I'm saying? It's so important man, you gotta control what you can control and you can control what you be in the fucking asshole. I mean, dude, look, I've dealt with cops that are fucking total fucks. For sure. But I will say, it's one out of every 100. And it's usually because they just got done doing some fucked up shit with some other thing. All right, so we're seeing some fucked up. Yeah, bro. And like, dude, you guys can say, well, that's because you're not black. Well, maybe that's true, because you know, see white people fucking having the same problems, the black people have with the cops. Well, on the other hand of that, though, I think there's that not true. Well, I think the difference is, no, we did that definitely happens. White people get fucked up by the cops all the time. The difference is the response from the community, which is also Steven and Smith, that's a cultural difference. He pointed around. He's a listen, we all jumped on the fucking side of Tyree. Yeah, like no, bro, we're fucking whatever, you know, when fucking, you know, Kevin or Jake, you know what I'm saying? It's as peep by the cops. We here's what we listen to. There's no headline. It's a fundamental cultural difference between black community and white community. And it goes like this. When white community, when, when, Jake, call him Jake, like Jake. Listen, dude, I got people, I got people I know and people I'm related to have done some really stupid ass shit, like criminal shit. When they do that shit, I don't automatically, my judgment is not to automatically be like, oh, dude, he got fucked by the police. My automatic responses, well, why the fuck did you do that? You dumbass. You're all condemned to do. Right. So the, and most of white cultures that way, and black culture, it's the opposite. And they say, why are they picking on whoever, right? Why is the stove hot? Yes. And dude, turn the stove on. And dude, we have to come to a realization that just because someone is a certain race or an, and dude, black communities do this inside their own neighborhoods too. They know who the criminals are. They know who's causing the problem, but they won't say shit because they're black. And bro, that doesn't solve anything, man. So there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of issues that we got to solve. And in this situation, I think it was, I think it was a little bit of him being rich and famous and getting his way to do whatever he wants. And I think it was a little bit of cops losing their cool. And I think both parties are to blame. And I think they should probably shake hands and say, hey, I fucked up. And the cops should admit his wrong too. Yeah. But you know, on the bigger scale here, I sure would like to see the black community learn something from this and the white community, which is make cops feel safe. Yeah, I think that's super important. Yeah. Jumping on this conversation, down in the comments, let us know what you guys think. With that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, thumbs up. I mean, do you agree that that's the case in the cultural differences? 1000% bro. Why do you think that is? I mean, I think there's a few things. You got to be real about this, who, bro? Like, I mean, this didn't start becoming a real true issue. This cop black part, like it didn't happen till Michael Brown. 2014. That's right. That's when the shit started fucking exaggerating. And so like, once we made martyrs out of people who were absolutely in the fucking wrong, yeah, it gave this false sense of confidence that, hey, we can do whatever the fuck we want. And that's not the case. Yeah. And white people, you know, I'm not saying that they don't try to do whatever the fuck they want. But when they do, they get fucked up. Yeah. I mean, the statistical data is there. Black, white people are just as more likely to get shot. If not more, actually, then black people are, right? There's no fucking t-shirts made of them. There's no, there's no, you know, pre-school pictures that are posted on fucking national headlines. It doesn't happen. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? There's a false sense of confidence that the black... Which goes into the identity politics, race, baiting, division, shit, of the bigger scale. You know, so like there's this false sense of confidence that the black community has when it comes to law enforcement, that like, listen, you do stupid shit, you're gonna win stupid prizes. That's the end of it, man. And like to your point, I think we all have a responsibility, especially knowing the climate that law enforcement is in, right now, brother fighting with their hands, handcuffed behind the backs. So it's like, why make a situation worse than it has to be? Do you remember that time, like, fuck, before we were on YouTube? Like, this is probably back in 2020. It was 2020, because it was when George Floyd happened. And you and I were watching that video, and it showed the cops go by, and the little black kid hid from the cops. Do you remember that? He hid behind the Jeep. And someone had said, well, this is what white privilege looks like white kids don't have to do that. That's not true. Like when I was a kid, we hid from the cops too. We saw the cops go by, we were throwing rocks at something, we fucking, you know what I mean? No? Like, remember I duck when I hear sirens? Like, it has nothing to do with it. So I get nervous when I see a police officer behind me. And I'm perfectly capable of handling whatever comes my way. But guess what? You should be nervous, because you should, I mean, you shouldn't be nervous, I should say. But just don't do dumb shit. Listen, I think the police community has a role in this too, man. Like, you guys can't just go around fucking forcing your shit on everybody like you're the goddamn fucking Gestapo. Jumping on this conversation down in the comments, let us know what you guys think, but that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, thumbs up or dumb as fuck this. We're bringing headline in, an article video, something like that, we talk about it. And I'll get one of those two options. So with that being said, I thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reach.

So you weren't allowed to wear a t-shirt? No, I wasn't allowed to do that. No, I'm gonna send what this is. That's $283. I have to check. What's that? That is after tax. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
