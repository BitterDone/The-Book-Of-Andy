we can listen I have faith all right all right we're gonna try yeah man what's going on with you though man not dude yeah just chillin mm-hmm Tuesday Tuesday day here yeah I get ready to start my rap career yeah yeah we know and my tech company that thing that that thing's gonna be awesome now as we say yeah my second life my my tenth life you know that was sitting next their next to Elon yeah the Elon is a very peculiar peculiar yeah yeah he's interesting man yeah big thinker no boundaries yeah dude it's very rare you run into someone who could think without any guide rails you know what I mean yeah well he's very emotional about it too like that's a crazy thing but like it's it's so crazy like just the autism spectrum by itself you know like it's so wide do is he really you think he really is no for sure does he say is yeah yeah yeah I don't know me autism's like you know it's like that that uncle at the like the cookout you know I'm saying like you know touch them a little bit you know I'm saying it touched them a little bit yeah the autism touched them autism's like don't go at the cookout your uncle touch you test them a little bit no dude I don't think it's like that at all I actually I actually think Elon is the is my favorite entrepreneur and I'll tell you why because when you look at the big on well be said look I have way more respect for the little guy who's grinding it out because that that is a hundred times harder than what he's doing it just this okay and I've worked with the biggest some of the biggest companies in the world and it's a lot different one you can just say hey do that and you don't have to worry about right in the check for it or whatever right so it gets done yeah and there you go you lost the bet oh yeah so uh so yeah man so uh it's a different game yeah you know what I'm saying so we end up in a situation where they can just write checks attract the biggest talent but like when you're running a small business that's not the case man you got to grind it out you got to bootstrap it you got to cultivate people and build people and you're dealing with people that can't work for the bigger companies uh that get you know what I'm saying like Elon's and you know the beginning is always the hardest it just is and uh what's that does he um well we all got something bro apparently I got Tourette's who said that me no it's a pretty to have stuff now you can't make fun of me because I got Tourette's I'm in a protected class right yeah right see how that works yeah so anyway um I like Elon because when no for real dude when you look at like the biggest entrepreneurs on his level you know they they don't they've taken they took something and evolved it they took something and evolved it and went like when you know you look at e-commerce it came from business right and like when I look at Elon I don't I see him like thinking outside the box completely so outside the yeah right and I think that's cool man not for sure it's hard to think that way highly respectable yeah um yeah uh what else we got um oh okay uh this uh let's uh start to pick up some traction um oh yeah we can give it PG what's the where's the weirdest place you've ever had in the course we talking about like what's the weirdest place oh no like weird is dude I couldn't tell you how about a porta-poddy no all right well this couple did and uh you got flipped over on them well that's gross how could you even do that with that smell bro that's what dude is nasty yeah and it's like like like I'm gonna preface this right you know I'm saying because the porta-poddy like everybody knows what porta-poddy looks like oh I could smell it right now just get the blue shit in there yeah you know it's gross and the shit in there yeah you know now like dude that's gross dude they did it and uh there's a clip check it out oh my god no somebody tipped it over yeah he's mad I don't know I got a video on it was me I got a video on it's got all the paper oh bro imagine what that guy smells like oh my goodness I don't know they were having sex oh they were doing it I mean I mean I that's the reason there's no way that little dude's put enough enough horsepower behind that to to straighten that thing over there it wasn't a handicap stall that's a little guy you're gonna have enough leverage but my thing is like okay like I you gotta get it on situation dictate you know but damn a porta-poddy though lady like come on guys like if it would have been like one of those nice ones I can understand that's cool it's just gross dude you don't be fun that's nasty shit dude that's nasty shit I kill someone over that that would cost me prison I'm not playing man thinking the guy you know it got in his mouth bro it's everywhere man that is bad oh this so bad it's nasty all right moving on you know just thought that was interesting man yeah a lot of stuff to cover let's get into our crews guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can check them out there you can also come watch us on the tube and check out all the videos here that being said let's get to our first set don't forget about the nsco project coming up you're saying coming soon also I'm quite a few projects getting ready to launch you do I've you know I've been in the lab like they say like they say yeah they say yeah they're working working man but yeah let's get into our first set head to the White House um trump met with uh Canada's prime minister um and of course in trump fashion before the dude even gets there he's talking talk shit oh look at Canada uh trump jabs this is CNN by the way trump jabs candid a moments before welcoming prime minister to White House um so trump put put out a truth literally like minutes before this guy's motorcade showed up um saying quote I look forward to meeting the new prime minister of Canada mark corny I want uh I very much want to work with him but cannot understand one simple truth wise america subsidizing Canada by $200 billion a year in addition to giving them free military protection and many other things trump wrote in a uh truth social post now this guy mark corny we've talked about them on the show um briefly uh he uses the guy that you know has close relationships or ties with the lame maxwell right remember those pictures came out yep um I believe he's a banker um he uh had an office uh governor of the bank of england for seven years um liberal party of Canada um but yeah they met a lot of things happen in that meeting um you know there's been some uh fighting between us forces and houties over in the in the middle east um apparently there's now like a ceasefire those are one of the things that came out of the meeting let's check this clip out uh we had some very good news last night the houties have announced that they are not where they've been announced to us at least that they don't want to fight anymore they just don't want to fight and uh we will honor that and we will uh we will stop the bombings and they have capitulated but more importantly they uh we will take their word they say they will not be blowing up ships anymore and that's what the purpose of what we were doing so that's just news we just found out about that hmm so uh I think it's very very positive they were they were not going out a lot of ships going uh as you know uh sailing beautifully down the various seas uh it wasn't just a canal it was a lot of other places and uh I will accept their word and we are going to stop the bombing of the houties uh effective immediately and Marco you'll let everybody know that yeah that's one of things came out the meeting other things happened in the meeting too uh read this trump trump offers blunt three word response after corny says canada is not for sale so this this dude is wild bro trump is wild all right like he he's he's witty he's with it and uh there was an interesting exchange um on Tuesday when trump again said uh that he wanted candid to become america's 51st state um but uh mark corny obviously being new in office has to protect this position given them saying um let's check this exchange out well if if i may um as you know from real estate there are some places that are never for sale it's true uh we're sitting in one right now you know bucking and ballast as you visited as well that's true uh and um having met with the owners of candid over the course of the campaign uh last several months uh it's it's not for sale won't be for sale uh ever uh but the opportunity is in the partnership and uh and and what we can build together and we have done that in the past and part of that as the president just said is with respect to our own secured uh and my government is committed for a step change in our investment in Canadian security and our partnership and i'll say this as well uh that the president has uh revitalized international security revitalized NATO uh and us playing our full weight uh in NATO and that will be part and they have they have what i must say Canada is stepping up the military uh participation because uh mark know you know they were low and now they're stepping it up and that's a very important thing but never say never never say never let's get back to that hoody thing where the hoody's actually blowing up ships or was this somebody making it seem like the hoodies were blowing up ships no maybe that's something we should look into yeah i mean it i don't know i know nobody knows i don't know we know what they tell us we know what they say what's that i mean we just know what they say you know we see the videos and should have them blowing it up have us blowing them up but i mean yeah i mean it's i don't know i'd time for me to believe like you know you have to say okay we're you know they're they're guerilla force you know small malicious small arms but then they're able to fucking do all this devastation but at the same you're like i it's hard point being fair point for a question where do you get the missiles yeah yeah that's what i'm saying dude like these aren't fucking guerilla fighters bro like and if they are then how do they get the missiles is a good question it's a good question well i mean it was just like dude what did uh when Biden was in office he like unfroze six billion dollars to Iran and that money directly flow back right back to the people were fighting but nobody questions that like no that's fine oh it's because war's good for business that's always good for business now speaking of business what a better business plan than to send your citizens sons and daughters to die and uh while you make a whole bunch of money right and your stocks go up and you get kickbacks and you get to embezzle money out of the tax dollars paid to go to the war efforts right quote unquote war efforts for those of you on audio yeah pretty good business plan man pretty good now oh and then by the way we can eliminate the the strongest uh most trained male element of the population patriotic you know we can get rid of some of those no resistance yeah yeah yeah because if they don't if they don't fight over there they'll be fighting over here yeah yeah that makes sense makes sense but speaking of business right i mean America's a business right whether people like to admit it or not and it should be ran like a business now the tariffs things have been a big big talk um and there's some shit shaking up globally right now so you know one of the biggest things was the tariffs we put on china right like that's been a big one of the biggest proponents i guess is that 147 percent i believe right now to china um china has not been involved in any trade talks with the us right now secretary Bennett or beset sorry um he says that he believes that uh quote so i expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged as well as non-tariff barriers currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investments saying that he thinks by the end of the week that's something uh could be happening with some of the largest trading partners and it's so crazy because right after he put out this it has to exactly now it's crazy though that because just as this was being put out um there's some news coming out of china right now that they have massive protests going on oh with their labor force oh oh oh it's almost let's let's throw that let's just throw that right in there it's my beta yeah let's just throw that what that's somebody said this was gonna happen hmm hmm I think it was this guy yeah yeah but as of today the Chinese one falls to lowest levels since 2007 after trump tariffs kicked in so how long they're gonna write that out it's working yeah how long they're gonna write that out bro it's working if zichi pang doesn't come around there will be a revolution in china because of this so it is what it is or there'll be an actual hot war between the united states and china yeah protest erupting china after furious workers demand back pay as trump's tariffs on import imports jolt economy um so right now at the moment just with the tariffs have been put on this estimated at about 16 million chinese workers are out of the jobs right now 16 million right and they're pissed you know like they're pissed like they you know they're having a hard time you know getting the cats and shit back like I mean like bro it's it's rough you know i'm saying out of stir fried jirbal they write out you know i'm saying like listen shit's getting it's getting it's getting it's getting it's getting tough um and you know they I guess they have like they don't really have unions over there right like labor unions and stuff like we do um because it's a communist country right um but they do have some industry group representatives um that there's a wang zing you know he represents about two thousand different chinese merchants um said that everybody's extremely anxious um about the uh the trade deal and you know like they're they're fucking in the streets protesting right now and uh so that's not good man what we got on this uh listen uh everybody hates i told you so but i can't help it all these dumbasses out here on the internet arguing about all this stuff and i say what i say i say i say hey this is what's going to happen and here we are well how long ago was that i don't know i mean that was weeks make sure we throw a date up there on that clip in weeks there was weeks i mean it was literally the it's almost like i know a thing or two because uh i see the thing or two what we do is math man yeah but some people can't do it well i probably shouldn't be talking about math but yeah like i mean i get it well i'm not the i mean look man here we are it's so hard being right in front of everybody all the time like let's be real dude everybody out there on the internet all these fucking influencers they're all way late right and then they get the credit because they're talking about it while it's going on but me on the other hand i talk about it a year in advance or six months in advance and everybody's like oh he's fucking crazy right tell me you're gonna protest dude why would they do that think about getting punished because you're smart fuck yeah man it's just wild dude i'm just gonna have to start playing dumber you know what i'm saying nobody gives me credit man dude listen it's crazy so so what's the next step out of this what do you see what do you force it depends uh they're gonna have to crack dude because here's the deal what what's going on here causes revolution and is you know when you have a guy who has massive ego like poop air over there you know uh he oh he hates that man the he fucking hates that man what poop air people call him that if fuck yeah brother put up stickers are winning the poo and shit around well i mean that's what he looks like he does so you know when he's got a problem on his hands because he likes to walk around acting like he's like the emperor and uh you know is untouchable and he walks around with that smug look on his face and people like that have massive egos he's not doing this for the wellness of the people of China he's doing this because his ego is out of control and he wants to beat trump and you never win when you let your ego lead it's it's never a winning strategy fucking ever so what's going to happen here is he's going to crack and give in which will have him lose respect or he's not going to crack it's going to get worse for his citizens and there will be massive civil unrest what he should have done is like a man sit down with trump behind closed doors and be like look dude neither one of us want this this is going to make us both look stupid let's figure this out what's fair as fair and let's make it look like we're heroes not like we're dumbass those can be winners that's right yeah but you know too late for that though uh well you know no i don't think so i think they could do that now but i mean um there will become a time where it is too late and that line is crossed and uh you know if you've got civil unrest now and that continues for a few more weeks and people can't eat um you're gonna have massive massive massive problems so i mean think about 16 million people protesting bro that's a lot that's a shit yeah bro that's a lot and uh that's not that's not black lives matter protests this is like that's it's going to get way bigger so he can't afford to have that man because he can't afford in the world's eyes especially when he's trying to recalibrate uh you know the world order the killing of all his own citizens he can't do that you know which well that's the other piece of it too that people don't recognize either we're with trying to be in a communist state we're like the amount of information that gets out of there that we actually like there we do get it's probably late you know i'm saying they're probably already burning shit down we just can't see it yet yeah i don't know you know um because i mean they keep that shit locked tight well i mean dude look some of my close friends are are from china i talked to these dudes on a daily basis um and you know they they don't really agree with their from they they're here and they don't they fucking hate china yeah right you know i'm saying and uh i mean they're proud of their culture but you know the way the government's run it's the same thing as us it's government yeah yeah yeah fucking it's right and it's the same thing as every country right that's what people lose sight in you know and then they they make us hate the culture and the people so that we can get engaged in the fights that these little dick leaders have you know and it's just not we got to be smarter than that you know you don't think the chinese people are just like us you don't think they just want to be left alone and and get some money and not be fucking poor and you know i'm saying just have a good life i do think they do want to eat cats uh well dude i mean we joke we joke you know i mean fuck they make fun of us you know they walk around doing your shit yeah like this you know like it's all good though like we can make fun of each other i think the shit's funny yeah like bro the videos that they make or funny as fuck you know like i see a whole bunch on a tip-tack and like they're trying these probably yeah rip yeah but make a fun of americans it's funny because it's true it's funny yeah but like you know we can make fun of you too yeah for sure you know i turned left now but no dude it's all good most people are hoping to listen people are the same people are the same in general like there are some places where they are not the same but chinese people are very intelligent they have a lot of common sense they're tactical thinkers they're logical thinkers and they're very similar to americans um in a lot of ways and they're very different in a lot of ways you know um they i think they have a lot you know their civilization so much older than ours they have a deep love for their culture um and our culture is new by comparison so we don't have and you know by the way uh they don't have somebody over there trying to literally dismantle it you know they haven't let the world economic forum and all these sorrows type people come bro that's one thing i like about uh poo bear is he will literally just kill those dudes and that's how it should be Trump should be doing the same yeah he protect yeah he protects the nation yes yeah for sure yeah bro Trump's Trump's uh in that sense Trump needs to take a page out of his book a little bit

That's cuz you're rich We're doing all right, you know But I was sitting in my fucking family room. This was a couple of weeks ago. You got that white privilege yet Well, I was sitting there, bro, and I heard a fucking beep And like I don't know why but like I immediately was like no You got a travel response This is a good guy. I started ripping up the fucking house, bro and tearing the fuck come find out It was in our basement like in our little utility room and wasn't even on the ceiling. I can't ever figure out where the fuck it's got I freaked the fuck out, but I thought about to lose it all Bam, I'm not belonging They finally found out I was terrified. What is that? I don't know, bro. What is that bro? You know, I've heard it's like gunshots and ambulances You know, I'm saying like there's like you just get numb to it after a while. It's like it's like living next to like a high traffic road It's like a baby. You know here that's like playing a white noise for a baby, you know, I'm saying like it's soothing like they hear that fucking beep It's soothing to them. It's like I'm to them. Yeah Oh, bro, that's not my side. That's the other side like I'm not I changed my battery. Sorry That's all I'm gonna say I don't get it. I don't I don't that's one thing. I don't get well. It is very unique Yeah, well she sucks, you know guys jumping on this combo man. Let us know down in the comments. What she does look at that? Look how big her mouth is You know saying like that just looks annoying bro What Oh no What You're her what? We have ghost fucking ghost beeps in your ear All right, yep Hmm Next next section Oh All right, man That's my three next section Oh, man Yeah, line number three man. All right Conspiracy theory time What crawls out the abyss Oh, head line number three. All right, conspiracies, okay, um, you know over the last few months a lot of classified documents have been getting unclassified and released the public not enough Um, you know, but a lot of them have been coming from the CIA. Okay, a lot of these CIA files We've covered like the uh the remote viewing stuff that came out about like the arc of the covenant and all of that now There's some new documents that just got released from the CIA um, but allegedly Expose the exact locations of three alien bases Um, and two are on earth Have you have you seen this yet? No, okay, all right, it was a little weird. Let's dive into it. All right Secret CIA documents have sensationally claimed that aliens could be operating hidden bases right here on earth including deep under the sea and inside of remote mountain ranges Now the explosive files recently declassified through the US Freedom of Information Act suggest ET Might not just be out there in space, but already living among us in top secret locations around the globe among the supposed locations are Mount Hayes and Alaska mount Perredito in Spain and various underwater sites off the coast of Puerto Rico and near the Bahamas one report titled Description of personnel associated ET bases sites Mount Hayes as the main base used by the aliens in the Alaska region. So I mean here's the document Apparently this was from another remote viewing process. I believe it's where it came out of um But yeah, like we're read it quickly here So far have run into three types of entities associated with bases of various locations within the solar system Titan base all personnel observed at this base on 20 November 1986 appeared to be no different than native earthlings There were two male technician types sitting at a control panel of some kind Behind them stood in the track to female with brown shoulder length hair wearing a pale green lab coat or smock She appeared to be in some sort of supervisory role Mount Hayes There appeared to be two types of entities associated with this site two entities located outside the structure were accomplishing some sort of routine task unable to make contact with them Or gain information and any sort Inside the structure were two entities one sitting at some sort of circular console with a round screen like object The other was busy doing something in the background the entity at the console appeared to be human informed But lacked definitive facial features He seemed friendly enough and invited me to observe his actions at the console Um, and in South America slash Africa there appeared to be two Types of entities associated with this site also the first had a very large round shaped head on a slim slender neck So they're saying they can't tell if it's South America Africa right. Okay. I got it Very unhuman and appearance almost robot like unable to make any contact with this being the other entity was almost human Like an appearance his face was devoid of any hair his complexion was very pale facial features were very Indistinct with exception of a sharp slender nose This entity seemed friendly enough and appeared to be aware of my presence um Dude Is there more now? I mean that that's the end of the report Just got released But yeah, I mean, it's also interesting because around those same locations Um, it's also been home to strange electro magnetic activity and bizarre UFO sightings with witnesses Yeah, man, I mean what about the bermuda triangle down there. There's that's another location. Yeah, it's another location There's I think up there at by the Mount Hayes. There's a bunch of airplanes that go missing up there too. I thought yeah Yeah, so I don't know about the Spain one or the African one, but I've heard about both those things. Yeah Do it listen I don't know I wonder what they do with the people they take Well, that's the other thing too like I think they they actually said Another report. I tried to pull it up couldn't verify but I did see something saying that like they like apparently kill a bunch of humans every year Really they're like and like it's just understood by the government it happens and it's cool That sucks. Yeah, the fucking sucks. Why do you that? I don't know. I don't know I don't know personally though because I don't they have the instructions on remote viewing It's probably the same reason that Fauci kills a bunch of animals and shit beagles and shit. Yeah Just uh, you know, just to experiment. Yeah, I don't know Um, but they have the instructions like the the instructions on like how to actually remote like do the remote viewing thing They be classified that we should try it I think you got to have like a certain set of skills to do that. What do you mean? No, I think it's like Psychic ability type thing. Oh really? Yeah, but I know it's real dude because like they've solved crimes and stuff with it with it Yeah, yeah, like that's an actual technique that they've used to solve missing purses cases a bunch of different times. Hmm So Yeah, man, it's uh look, you know, I don't think we know I think we are completely left in a dark man about most shit That's what I think I think we don't know anything. I mean you can't tell me as complex as life is and as big as the universe is that we were born to Basically grow up and have a job and die, you know, that's not I mean, dude if you really think about what what we do in our lifetime We exist to we exist as slave labor to our own government All right, and the leaders of the world because every single human being in every single civilized country is required to pay taxes they had the dynamic yeah, and It's not about who pays the most or who doesn't but You know, we're told Grow up work hard and you can have a nice life which is true But I don't believe that they tell us anything near What the actual truth is and I think you know the reason that we have a situation where They're putting chemicals in the water and they're putting Trails chemtrails in the sky and they're putting people allowing them to put chemicals in the food and I really think all of this is about covering what human potential actually is and I think uh I think we've been lied to about history. I think we've been lied to about What our potential is I think we've been lied to about we're pretty much anything that means anything Because look how they convince people to live, you know They've convinced a large portion of the population That the most pleasure that they're going to get out of life is what they eat right and You eat to survive. It's not it's not a pleasure mechanism, right? And then they do the same thing with sex, you know, and then They propagate these things That keep us in a very shallow and meaningless existence comparatively to what it could be and what it probably is but they don't want to tell us because If they tell us they lose power over us Which cost them I think something more than just you know what we perceive to be power for them So I think there's a lot of secrets. I think there's a lot of things that we aren't told about ourselves. I think there's a lot of Things that we are capable of that we're not told we're capable of And to be completely honest, dude. I've experienced a lot of these things in my life, you know I do you know and I don't care what anybody says. I don't care I've seen some of these guys get on the internet and say there's the law of attraction is bullshit And this and that and this it's not bullshit. I know firsthand. It's not. I know it's not Do you have to work? Yeah, you do but I mean what I've visualized in my head for my life Has literally been exactly what my life has turned out to be you know when I was in when I was in Exiting high school. I mean all the things I thought about becoming I've become and I'm not old You know what I mean? And I thought about them obsessively and I didn't have You know an inheritance or or somebody give me money or and and and honestly dude like I made every mistake and I believe that you know because I try to do the right things and the best that I can And I continue to see that vision in my head I I think I've developed some sort of power to attract things into my life and dude You've seen it when you've been with me. How are you know? You know like I'll talk about something and literally two seconds later It'll fucking happen like that like that time Jim Edmonds came in the Escalade. Yeah, bro. We were working out in the gym And we were just getting here. Yeah, it was when the new the new escalade came out not the 25 But that it was a few years ago 22 23. Yeah, and I said man, you see the new escalade. They're cool. I'm thinking I'll buy him one literally. That's what I said We were over there in the fucking Smith machine rock. I remember exactly where we were Not what two minutes later Jim Edmonds comes in who trains here sometimes good buddy of ours and he says uh Hey, man, I got it. I got a I got a new escalade because that's how I remember they were impossible to get Couldn't get him because I got a new escalade actually ordered to them because they were so hard to get He's like I got one out front you want to look at I'm thinking about selling it Like two minutes later. Yeah, and I mean how many times have you been with me where I said Hey, this you know, just whatever I said and then literally within fucking minutes it's happened It happens and I believe that the the Mother get happens to everybody. They just write it off as coincident Yeah, I think I think they don't pay attention to it I think that people create their own realities and they discount their ability to create their own realities And so they're creating their reality by default without realizing it You know, we see so many people that live a miserable life But then you talk to them and you listen to them talk and what do they talk like they talk like a miserable person And they expect the worst and they say things like hey when you say hey, how's it going and they say real sarcastically all living the dream and they have this Thought track in this talk track that continues to attract negativity into their life over and over and over again And I firmly believe this is why those people can never break out of that cycle And I don't think it's focus focus. I think there's metaphysical quantum physical realities And then we have people who will say well that goes against what God is well actually it doesn't because God created the universe and within the universe there is a set of rules and set of law just like there is gravity and there is air and there is sunlight There are laws in the universe that I believe we are unaware of and a lot of people who are very You know very literal about the bible can't think outside of it right like well if God created everything and the Sun and the stars and the moon and the universe Then it stands to reason that he created the laws within the universe and that also stands to reason that we were meant to utilize those laws for our own progress and goodness and You know, I believe that and dude I don't just believe it like I believe it like it's fact because I've seen it. I've witnessed it. I've experienced it. I've used it and I think a lot of people just don't Don't understand like that we're we're living in a literal slave state We are we are cultivated to be unintelligent beings unmotivated beings unhealthy beings poor beings We are intentionally tossed into a situation and leveraged into laborious lives in one way or the other You know, and if you think about that it ties into you know how they don't teach us about personal finance how they don't You know, they they sling a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of debt on you to go to college right That forces you to get into the game and earn tax revenue Right and then we and then we think about like what they propagate in terms of like you know Putting 400 pound people on the front of health magazines is saying it's health Well, why would they do that? There's only one reason they would do that because they want to convince people not to Actually get better because someone who's big and fat and unhealthy Takes more medicine which drives revenue. They eat more food which drives revenue They consume more of the streaming which drives revenue and leverages their propaganda And so when we think about how this all fits together. I mean in my mind I can see it very clearly Uh, and the only way for us as humans to to break out of this is to do everything the opposite Of what they want us to do right? If they want us to be fat then we can't be fat. We got to be fit if they want us to hate each other We can't hate each other. We got a unite if they want us to be poor We have to do everything we can not to be poor if they want us to eat their food so that we get sick We got to eat healthy food so we don't get sick and the reason they want us sick is so they can make the money on the pharmaceuticals So like dude You know, and then think about on top of it the victim culture that's propagated these days You know everybody's broken everybody's trauma like bro the therapist industries the biggest fucking scam in the world Okay, they convince people that they're broken and They never really provide a real solution for them And they convince them that you know, you've got to heal for your entire life. Healing isn't a lifetime process It's a stop. It's a bump. It's a thing that you go through and then you go out and live your life And we have predatory therapists that make people think that they're broken when they're just experiencing What is called life right life's fucking hard man. They're shit that happens to all of us It happens to every one of us in here every single one of us all of us and I've heard them all because I know you guys All of you have really fucking hard stories at some point or another and if we were to ask every listener every listener has a hard story That's called fucking life man and we so we my whole point in this not to get too off track is that we live in a system That is cultivated for us to never figure out that we are much more capable and much more powerful Than what they actually tell us we are and why would they do that? Well the only reason they would do that is for control So I mean for me it's very easy to see what's going on But to get everybody else to see it. It's like it's all another thing now dude It's it's they think you're crazy But like am I crazy because I'm pretty sure I'm doing all the shit that most people want to fucking do And I'm pretty sure I've done it. I mean I was there 10 years ago at 35 years old So I don't know like who's crazy see what I'm saying So that's what scares me about this whole thing too, but like I mean just full circle Jake here Um That fucking but that what was it thing the other thing that CIA did the project blue beam or something like yeah You know, I'm saying like yeah, so like people don't know what project blue beam is like project blue beam is an official CIA narrative that is designed to simulate a World-changing event That is designed to snap people in line and unite people into a globalist Earthlings versus somebody else, right? So how if you were a globalist and you had Ideas of one world government What would be the way that you would get everybody unite you would create a fake alienation Which would cause humanity to unite and then force a globalist unity, right? And so that's what project blue beams about it's about simulating a fake alien invasion It does seem like the last four years. There's more and more and more and more and more coming out about it Uh, and you know, it's so funny because it's sort of like the boy who cried wolf like we've heard so much shit And there's so much bullshit that's happened Like when they drop that story like oh aliens are real because remember like they just dropped that a couple years ago No one even cared right people are like okay But the blue beam involves like actual fuck like holograph. Yes, yes, so it's like Well and dude the perfect fall, you know, I'm saying like and and dude like The meeting we had last week about the thing we're working on Uh, that technology's real. There's real technology that can make you guys have seen it. You seem to pop on stage You see Michael Jackson performance a hologram like it's it looks real people are saving their holograms now for like their kids Like I see grandparents. Yeah, so so so dude they can do it Very very well and there's lots of technology that does it in different ways, but um You know, and then the other the other idea for the for the uniting of humanity was to stimulate the Um, the second coming of Jesus Christ. So that's also part of project blue beam Uh, that's like option to create a yeah to create a biblical You know a biblical event that causes people to basically like all come together um, so Yeah, but that's real thing dude. I'm like to prop it up. It's like, you know, all right Well, we gotta get them like okay. Just tell them we got some bases and shit somewhere Oh, yeah, I mean dude. It's listen. Who knows. I mean, I don't I don't I mean, it would be I think it would be absurd to think That If we live in the universe that they say they do Okay, which we don't know you don't fucking know I don't know none of you know And by the way, they just did that shit with the Amazon girls I mean the you know the girls that went to space or quit space like that was fake that's fucking fake man you know like The the capsule comes down and it's perfectly unscathed and painted white and all this shit like in these forces on the experience At least make it look real. Yeah, right? Okay But You know, I just I don't know man. I think I don't know what's gonna happen in that regard But I think they are very nervous about losing control because I think a lot of people are waking up I mean do listen If I heard me talking right now five years ago, I'd be like that dude was fucking insane He's fucking insane like it for real. So imagine where we were five six years ago To where we are now and if we heard us talking now back then what we would think You see what I'm saying right right like bro like look at Alex Jones, okay People love to hate on Alex Jones, but the truth of the matter is this he is right Way, way, way, way, way more than he is wrong and people don't listen to him because you know He's got that thing I got to that crazy delivery right like he he sounds crazy. There's no crazy Yeah, but he isn't he's just so far ahead of everybody that it sounds crazy. It's the same thing for us. Yeah, and um You know Is he wrong about some things? I mean Yeah, but it's rare. I think the other part is just still to be to be determined. Yeah I don't know bro. I just think that I Think we're in a weird time and I think people like they they created the internet Social media came around the information got Too quick to where they can't cap it and they're losing control and there's people waking up to what's going on every single day Uh, to the point where what are they gonna do now? So one of the only things they can do is is to create Either total destructive events like 9-11 Or you know create even bigger, you know events such as you know an alien invasion or You know starting a world war like whatever it is dude like I think they they want it COVID to be that too Oh for sure, you know, I'm saying for sure like more than just the compliance check that was supposed to be everybody unites around this fucking correct You know virus. Well, that's why they attacked everybody so bad when you stepped out of line You know and just wait, you know, you know, it's gonna be funny though with this alien shit They're gonna have groups trying to protect the aliens Alien It's gonna happen. Yeah, you're not wrong. Bro, they're saying people rights There's just a lot of people that are that are just I mean they're They're so Well, it's a lot of jasmine crocodile topic. No bro. That's not what I'm saying. It's like they're so It's oppression. I mean, that's what it is. It's not oppression in the terms of What most people to speak about it to be you know most people talk about like racial So you know oppression. It's just It's a question that you can't really see you know, I'm saying and that your talk to think is normal like dude Like like like think about slaves that grew up in in that environment. Yeah, they don't Understand anything different. Mm-hmm. So it's easy to control them And that's that's what we are that's that's what we are as people we are We think it's normal to pay you know more of what we earn to the government than what we get to keep You know because it's painted up red, white and blue and that's right. That's right. Yeah, and uh, you know We think that's normal. We've born into it in fact, you know for a long time if you even go back to Some of the old MFCO episodes. I've said on those episodes, you know, it's a patriot it's patriotic to pay your taxes Yeah, but it's fucking not you know, I'm saying that vlogging much. It's not it's not at all. Yeah, it's not at all It's not patriotic because Patriotic would be they were doing something good for us with it They were taking care of our country. They're not taking care of our country They're destroying our country and they're giving the money away and they're stealing it's no longer patriotic to pay any tax Patriotic would be to fucking overthrow the government at this point in time. That's reality patriotic and and you know um You know and that brings us to another point like you know, you have trump and it's very hard I want to say this. I like Donald Trump. I like his family. I think he's funny. I know he's very smart but It's hard to tell where he is because We've been told a lot of shit that hasn't happened yet We've been told that he was gonna come in and all these things were gonna happen that haven't happened And they'll say well the judges won't allow it. Well then do something about the judges You know like our system is corrupted and part of me thinks that Donald thinks that you know, we're going to be able to um Restore integrity to the system and he doesn't want to completely go around it because he doesn't want to break it But brother, it's already broke And the reason that we voted for you is to come in and swing a hammer and get all these fucks out of here And the reason you're approval ratings not where it was or where it should be is because all the things that you said aren't happening Yeah, you know, we expected you to legitimately Bring in the military and round these motherfuckers up and get them the fuck out of our country fast You're not doing that. We also expect to be told the truth and have a full declass That's not happening. We're still being lied to it seems like business is usual and you're losing the people's trust Because things aren't happening, you know, you talked about Um, and then he goes on TV yesterday or the day before and says oh, we're gonna reopen out could stress and really do that's just another play How they play, you know, we got this what about look over there. Yep, I'm a trash. Yeah, I like it's It dude it's starting to feel like to say and I like to give Trump the benefit of the doubt dude And then maybe it's just because I feel like he might be our only hope to to save shit without it going to violence fully crumbling. Yeah Um Because like dude like if I'm in the office right now and I'm legitimately me and I care about this country and I'm not tiptoeing around people that are never gonna light me anyway like he's never gonna win the media over you're never gonna win these these fucking NPCs with you know rainbow hair over you're never gonna win them over what the fuck are you doing Like bro drop the hammer, you know, I'm saying fix the shit do the thing do what you said tell us the truth Bring the trust back like we'll never gonna trust the government or trust anything again And and here's the real dangerous part about it is that People don't really understand what we're dealing with we're dealing with Bolshevism and Marxism and the Bolshevik revolution killed you know 10 times as many people that allegedly died in in the the German Holocaust So at least it's 60 to a hundred million people But people ignore that and then they ignore what happened in Cambodia with Polpa And then they ignore what happened with Mao and then they ignore what happened in Rwanda They don't talk about any of these other things, but they talk about that one You see what I'm saying? So there's a reason for that and it's not because of anything else other than it creates an event And this is not me saying it didn't happen. This is me saying they use it to protect themselves from criticisms And we can't even talk about the our own fucking Americans that died in more words you know, but But well listen my dad's dad died in that Like this thing is it's home to me. You know my dad's father Is biological father was there on d day and he fought on d day and fucking survived And then he died legit on December 6 six months later and fucking shot Okay, never met my dad was my grandma was pregnant with my dad Never saw my dad grow up never saw my brother grow play professional baseball never saw me and fucking sell And and you know Chris and the guys build these things we built Right that that young man didn't get he gave his whole life for what You know, I'm saying like for what some shit we can't even talk about that's right and broke that ain't right man And I take that shit personally, you know, that's my fucking blood. I didn't grow up with a fucking grandpa because of that You know, I'm saying like are all you guys out there with your grandpa memories. I don't have that shit like that You know, so I Just think that I just think that Trump has a responsibility to do what the fuck he says he's gonna do and tell us the truth about what's actually going on and stop appeasing these people They're never gonna like them anyway and if he is who he says he is then why then why is he why is he tiptoe in around You know what I'm saying? Yeah, like what are you what are you trying to do? Bro listen if these people get back in office They're gonna kill tens of millions of people for real and those people are gonna be us It's not gonna be those rainbow head those those those people are are useful idiots They're using them to get in power and take control and like dude if that's what scares me Like I feel like this is not gonna get solved like where where are the rules of In-person voting and paper about where's that where's that executive order? Where are those things maybe sign it? I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong, but like I don't I would have remembered that I think or You know, did he do that? Not the stay back. I don't think it's all the way through yet So, you know like but I don't know man like You know we're sitting here talking about these judges saying oh they want to put they want to give illegal's trials Well those aren't American citizens So like why why don't you just arrest all these corrupt judges who were put in place by people like George Soros And fund it. We're like why is soros still running around? Why is his son still running around? How are they now like why are all these people who were putting all these big Monies behind these things that are destructive to our culture in our cities that keep our cities in this impoverished Crime-ridden state why why are why are we tolerating that and why and Trump Trump knows that so what the fuck is going on? You know what I mean? Like and I understand you know, there's things. I don't know and there's things that we don't know and You know like I said, I'm usually pretty far ahead both of us are But that's how I feel right now and you know, I also think That we as people need to get a lot fucking smarter. Okay, like we're all biting the bait on this Carmelo Anthony versus uh Shiloh Hendrix shit Do you guys not understand that Things like this happen every day that there's white people that do bad shit every day There's black people that do bad shit every day and they've propagated these events To create more racial division just when everybody was starting to get along Do you think that's a coincidence? Like we have to be smarter. We have to understand that they want white if white and black people start getting along bro Everybody's fucked That's the key to their whole thing and like we I see all these people on the internet, you know Who are who are openly becoming Like a year ago everybody's starting to come together and now all of a sudden it's back to you know Like it's but I they will say this far less people are biting on it than they did in 2020 right But we just got to be smart dude like they can't have us united. They can't have us fit They can't have us financially free. They can't have us, you know Healthy they can't have us intelligent. They can't have us Any of this shit because the minute that all happens They're fucked and that's why I talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion, you know people say well What can I do is an individual well actually as an individual is exactly what the fuck you should be doing to solve the problem But like you know, it's it's like everybody bro. It sounds good to talk about but Doing it's a different thing because it's hard, you know And then and then we wonder why we have this Why we have this depression anxiety epidemic That all of a sudden came on when social media really came around well It's because you all pretend to be something that you actually aren't you put out fucking images of yourself that aren't you You pretend to be something that isn't you and then when you have to go home at night and look in the mirror You feel like a fraud and you feel like a frog cuz you are Right and and that creates depression that creates anxiety that creates all kinds of mental issues and it comes from not actually being who you present yourself to be and You know that takes work and that takes courage and that that's not something that you can just buy and So I don't know like I'm rambling now, but like to me in my mind this shit all fits together perfectly, you know and Yeah, I mean look if we want to fix shit It's up to every single individual to take responsibility for their part and that that's a that's that's That takes work Real and actually ties in perfectly to our last segment of the show guys as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck Um personal excellence man. You gotta go to Florida for this one. No, Florida has a lot of interesting things I love Florida. They got a lot of Florida man.
