you had this one I don't have that one yeah yeah so you got to graduate okay so this we started with that one and now there's a few people to have that one so I had to elevate my games to separate yourself that's right I get it yeah I get it 100% yeah so my uncle John who is pretty much like my second dad you know he he used to uh he used to have the saying that he used to always tell us and he'd say here there's only thing you need to know uh I'm it and you ain't that's pretty good yeah I mean listen that's that's a good like that so that was this that was just saying growing up yeah so I heard I got it and you don't it's nine and nine and nine and that another one that's my dad's okay yeah that's a good story yeah sweet man uh well I mean it is Q&A I guess I'm good ones for you all right that's not to be determined yeah well uh let's let's dive into this man uh question number one it's on everybody's mind um I've seen this question quite a bit um Andy you know Andy they say if it's really win uh Andy if and win covid pops back up how exactly do we go about not complying with these masks or anything else in the narrative I go to to a university and I'm not sure how I can go along with it if mask are reinstated I'm sure many people are wondering about this uh for their work too we need your input well I mean I started to give my input on this in 2020 y'all didn't listen and half of y'all you know who listened to my personal development content started making fun of me and talk a shit and saying that I'm lost my mother fucking mind when I told you not to wear the mask the first time okay now a lot of you came back and you're like oh Andy you were actually right I'm sorry okay fair enough um but I've already told you what needs to be done and I've already told you how to handle it you have to decide whether or not you have the fucking balls to actually do it and by the way it's not that difficult real real simple let me show you how take some practice all right you should prefer to be like sir put your mask on okay all you say it takes a little practice all right but it's I don't get it right the first time every time right no yeah it's only the first one too like the first one's only like the hardest one you'll ever have is the first one DJ I do not understand how hard this is for you people to fucking do how do you not have enough fuck you in your blood to look someone in the eye and say no like that's that's a big problem that's not just that's not just COVID that's right that's gonna be a big problem in your life a big problem in most of your all's life is that you lack the ability to say no to the shit you want to say no to okay and what does it do it sucks you into relationships you don't want to be in it sucks you into careers you don't want to be in it sucks you into having to go to dinner with people you don't want to go to dinner with it sucks you into all kinds of stuff you don't want to do because you lack the simple ability to look someone in the face and say fucking no it's really simple dude their reaction after you say no is not your responsibility it doesn't matter whatever they think they can think you don't need to carry the burden of how you saying no to someone makes them feel okay no is a complete sentence you don't need to explain it but if you'd like to explain it there's a whole bunch of research on the internet and there's three years worth of podcasts where you can cite specific examples and medical experts that talk about how this shit does it work okay I mean the fact that you're even asking the question the fact that you're even bro this is you you're being a coward you know it's wrong you know it's not what we should be doing but you go along with it anyway and because everybody went along with it the first time now we're in this situation and by this situation I don't mean them pulling COVID again now you have mass migration at the border now you have unfathomable crimeways now you have your money not going as far as it could go you have all these different situations our tax dollars being sent to Ukraine the demoralization of America the removal of American customs and rules and value systems and the propagation of child sex changes and all this shit it all started with you not being able to say no the first time when the evidence was extremely clear but you didn't want to stand up against the propaganda okay this is called having a fucking backbone all right and if you really honestly like this is real shit if you want to know why I'm me and you ain't me why I've built the shit I've built and you have it it's because I'm not a fucking pussy it's not simple I've been on the internet since the fucking shit started telling y'all what to say and what to do and how to handle it and you're still asking me it's say fucking no do you think that that's the reason why it's so hard for people to say no it's like they're they're more concerned with the reaction from yes the other person yes right or is it that or is it also could it just be the lack of awareness or understanding of why they're saying no you know I'm saying that too that maybe they haven't actually looked into the real science behind it right you know what I'm saying right maybe they haven't actually looked for the solution maybe they haven't actually looked to the formula but not being able to say no is a fundamental skill set that you must have to be successful in life and a lot of you guys are being tested right now and it shows that you don't have what it takes you can never become this successful kick ass wealthy individual without that of capacity like it's a necessary skill like it dude do you I mean look you're around me 24 hours a day how easy do I say no you say no the easiest out of anybody I fucking look at people I go no and I keep walking I don't even think about it and like do you think I do you think I agonize over their feelings about me saying no no no I mean but that's the does it intentionally don't even explain it because I want them to sit there and think about why the fuck I said no yeah yeah and like I think the thing is too though it's like people have to realize like I think it comes from having the ability to protect yourself right because nobody's gonna care about you like you care about you and so like you have to be able to stand up for yourself and just say no whatever it is listen man people died for this country my grandfather was 20 fucking years old and he was shot he never met his own fucking kids okay you can't say no to some fucking blue hair progressive dumbass who's screaming at you about a fucking mask bro these people are like malnourished weak little plebs and like you guys look at them and you you're fucking coward and you think that like we're something like if you coward in that situation what makes you think you have what it takes to do anything relevant life anything like you're being tested and you're failing the test yeah and like I think too like what's the worst that's gonna happen when you tell somebody know especially when it comes to this masher they tell you oh you can't shop here okay no the worst that's gonna happen is um that you're gonna leave and you're gonna fucking be a big have a big smile in a sense of self accomplishment because you stood up for what you actually believed in your heart yeah every time you every time listen dude every time every time that you guys go along with something you don't actually believe to be true you're chipping away at your own self confidence in your own self belief in your own authenticity every single time that you tell someone something that you don't mean or you go along with something that you don't want to go along with and you be untrue to yourself you chip away at your own identity little by little by little by little and it leaves you ending up as a shell of a human being that is just floating through the wind at the at the will of other people and then you wonder why you're depressed or you have anxiety or you feel like you're a loser or you feel like you know you don't have what it takes because you don't have what it takes because it takes a very simple a very basic amount of staying true to yourself to just say no when you mean no and say yes when you mean yes and stand by those things like this is basic shit and like dude you know as far as the masculine goes like you guys go along with it again we're gonna lose the country that's it you know I see all these people talking about all this stuff on the internet about you know this time we're not gonna do it you know you said that last time but then I saw you all in airplanes where masks and I saw you all you know oh yeah but that's on an airplane that's required right dude you have to understand the level of commitment this actually takes this takes a level of commitment to massively inconvenience yourself to stand true to what it is you believe when I tore my shoulder two years ago okay on September 15th two years ago in 21 I knew it was torn you knew it was torn everybody in the mother fucking gym knew it was torn because you can hear it okay I couldn't lift my arm over my head all right do you know what I couldn't do because it was torn and and because the mass shit was going on you know what I couldn't do I couldn't get you in my eye okay so you know when I finally got an MRI December I torn in September now keep in mind my physicality and my conditioning is extremely important to me it's the most important thing in my life it's what everything is built upon okay and I waited 90 days until I found a doctor that I actually knew from grade school who was willing to let me into his facility to get an MRI and then do the surgery he happened to be a very awesome surgeon all right that's the level of inconvenience that you have to deal with to stand by what the fuck you believe yeah it takes that dude I think two men like I had fun with this shit I used to fuck people like that walkway pass so you're gonna put your mask on I'll be able to I'm a protest man you know I'm like the shit is free I just give them the look of fucking death I agree yeah I got that too yeah I call it my angry black man face yeah I know the mind just says you're gonna die okay don't fucking talk to me yeah right right and it works a serious towel you get called yeah look man it's really shit because here's the thing man it is gonna be coming back it's gotta come you have to be good temperatures you think is a good you have to be willing to stand on what you believe to the level of physical violence that's where we need to be that's where the country needs to be no no one is going to do this there no one's going to force you to do anything and you are willing to do whatever the fuck it takes go to jail fight doesn't matter to resist it that's the level of commitment to real shit man guys Andy question number two Andy I am a college athlete trying to earn a spot on a really talented team my question is regarding enjoying the process and comparison to over focusing on the end goal I am really hard to myself and a bad day easily impacts my mindsets in regards to my future what should the balance be between enjoying where I'm at and where I want to eventually go especially for someone who desires so much of life look here's here's a fundamental reality of driven human beings driven human beings are going to always feel like they're behind they're gonna always feel like they're not doing good enough they're gonna always feel like they're not far enough they're all gonna always feel like you're losing look winning this is how it feels 90% of the time you're gonna feel like you're getting your balls kicked in all right 8% of the time you're gonna be confused and you're frustrated 2% of the time you actually win and those moments come and go and then you're back in the 90% and that's the reality of a winner's life people don't understand that they think it's all about cruising around in a cool car having a free and happy and easy and go lucky life and that's not reality because true winners are built for the fucking fight they're built for the battle they don't find peace and joy and happiness in the win they find what they're looking for in the fight and so if you're a high driven ambitious individual and you're looking around and you think everybody else is like live in their you know free and easy life that's because that's what they're showing you on the internet but I can assure you that anybody who's built anything real anybody who's built anything significant all right these people live in a constant state of frustration and aggravation because they're so driven and they go so hard and they're so impatient that it actually wills the result in the reality all right there's no high level competitor that exists in the world out here that doesn't feel that way if they tell you that they're lying all right or they're not very good so like dude you know there's a fundamental misunderstanding about this enjoy where you are and be hungry for the next thing like bro I don't feel like that's the truth the truth is uh you know and people will judge this you know people who are not ambitious and who who are wired different they judge this they said well fuck that's no way to live well it's no way to live for you because you're not wired for it all right some people aren't wired to live like that in fact most people aren't in fact it's less than 1% of the actual population that's why the 1% is the 1% all right so you have to understand if you're out there building something whether it be an athletic career uh a professional career uh physique a business whatever it is you're building you're gonna spend most of your time feeling frustrated you're gonna feel most of the time like you're losing you're gonna feel like most of the time you're getting your ass kicked and then so good stuff's gonna happen all right but then after the good stuff happens you're gonna automatically flip your brain over to what's next all right and then the process starts over again and we can observe this in championship caliber people look at Kobe Bryant all right look at Michael Jordan all right look at fucking Nick Saban look at Bill Bella check these people win championships and on the interview podium they're saying well what do you think and they're like cool we did a good job we did what we were supposed to do and what well what are you gonna do and they're like well I'm gonna be in the gym mall six a.m you know what I'm saying yeah right like like dude this is the mindset of a true winner like there's this fallacy out here that people without it actually end up winning it's just not true it's just not true you're saying that if you if you're listening right now and you have that mentality you got to ride mentality that's where you supposed that is how it's supposed to go yeah yeah that is exactly what I'm saying I love that I want to ask you to because you know when when you know I've heard from friends I know you've heard it from people too it's like you know oh well you know you gotta be happy where you are you know can we talk a little bit about that like if we're really being honest are you really happy with where you are who I'm saying like for people who say that shit oh you know I tell you I'm not yeah I'm not even fucking close do you think I'm close no do you think I would come in here and work the way I fucking work care of the way I care if I thought I was where I wanted to be yeah mother fucker I worked this whole fucking entire time just to build a platform to launch mother fucking rocket like this has been all of this that I've done so far has been just to build the foundational structure for me to do what I actually want to do okay so like I think that's the truth from those people too they're just not they're not aware of that though they don't put that together no dude you can't expect people to understand that because people would look at my life from the outside and they would say god dude this guy's got it all but it's not about getting it all like I've had it all had it all for a long time that's not that's not the point it's about winning it's about being the best it's about doing something other people can't do or having done or don't have the balls to do it's a different game see people who think it's about money and success and cars and houses they they get it confused because that shit's cool I like that shit that's part of my life but that's not why I do this has nothing to do with it actually I don't really give a fuck in fact I drive home to probably one of the coolest houses in the whole country maybe even the whole world with one of the coolest car collections in the world for sure and one of the coolest headquarters of one of the coolest companies that exists on the fucking planet every single day that's my life and I'm highly dissatisfied with it okay not because that's deep man yeah not not because I want more but because I recognize that I'm not even close to the best I'm not close like dude yeah I have provided income create jobs have done on the ship but like bro there's so many people there's so much better than me and have done so much more than me and that's the game I've chosen to play and I've dedicated my life to it and I intend to fucking win it yeah and how many more jobs can you create how many more yeah no that's real man bro listen there's a big idealistic fallacy in the world right now about what winning actually takes and what it actually looks like and it gets spoiled by all these dumbasses on the internet who they pretend to be who I actually really am right okay and they they they go out and they try to make this storyline up about themselves to sell some fucking bullshit to you guys and then you know like dude look at it look at thumbnails like let's be real dude there's thumbnails on the internet on on YouTube where there's like these kids no one's ever fucking heard of in their entire life and it's like this kid and he's interviewing this guy and it's like how so and so has a hundred million dollar car collection and then you go look at his cars and it's a fucking G wagon a wrapped Bentley and some fucking bullshit hurricane like bro they're lying to you they're making they're they're lying to you and they have you guys hooked into this fake entrepreneur life where they parked the fucking Rolls Royce out in front of the private jet and they act like that's the life you live that is not the life you live do I drive my Rolls Royce to a private jet fuck yeah do you know how much time that actually isn't my life one fucking millisecond of my fucking life the rest of the time I'm out here getting my ass beat okay work pounding my fucking face into the wall so that I can inch this motherfucker morph down the track and all this overnight success that you guys see from the social media super stars that shits the anomaly that's an anomaly bro you ain't Mr. Beast you ain't Logan Paul or Jake Paul you're fucking you and I'm me I come from a regular place right down the fucking road okay I don't have you know yeah I've got a decent social media following but I don't have that no you know I'm saying like bro I've grinded this motherfucker out and you can too but you got to realize that they ain't gonna be happy and ain't gonna be fun and ain't gonna be fast and ain't gonna be easy and it's not gonna be quick you're not gonna get it for $997 and fuck course like bro it's gonna cost you everything you got and that's if you're smart I love it I don't know I don't know how to convince these kids of the shit like you guys are out here secret blueprint so to make my kids millionaires by the time they're fucking three right like the fuck out of here for ways to get rich in 2023 yeah with it with a picture of a La Ferrari from some motherfucker and ain't even his car bro I drive a La Ferrari to work three days a week do I fucking that that's a bad ass La Ferrari too I can't fit into it though oh and by the way I take that motherfucker home and I train it out for one of the 40 other fucking cars I got but do you see me standing in front of them saying hey by my course no I come on here and tell you the real shit for fucking free because it ain't that complicated it's real simple you're gonna have to work and it's gonna take a long time it's gonna be hard as fuck you're gonna have to have an open mind you're gonna have to be used to getting kicked in the balls because that's how you're gonna spend most of your life you're gonna have to grit it out you're gonna have to fight you're gonna have to argue you're gonna have to be uncomfortable you're gonna have to say no a whole fucking lot like dude you're gonna have to have a chip on your shoulder you're gonna have to be willing to say fuck you to a whole lot of people like dude this what this takes is beyond what the internet comprehends that's real talk and I don't think anybody out there is more qualified to fucking tell that to me that's that's real all right so love I do I don't it's frustrating to me because ever since I started to stop the MFCO project I've seen this emergence of like an ungodly amount of these like these fake internet people that you never fucking heard of you know like it's disheartening dude it's really disheartening to me and the reason I get pissed off about it is because I actually understand what the fuck it takes and because people are getting fooled by a lot of this flash shit right on the internet this quick easy fast you know shit they people think there's something wrong with them when it doesn't go that way doesn't work out right so like you have all these young kids who have the ability and they have the the potential all of you do by the way all of you do all of you have the potential but then they see these stories and then they go out and try and it doesn't go the way they want right they make a video and it gets fucking 10 10 views right they they wrote I my first day in business I won customer and he was my friend he bought seven dollar product product for me the second day in business nobody came in the third day in business so $22 it took me eight months to have a day over two hundred dollars now remember this is before the internet you guys have the amazing you guys have the most amazing tools available to you so it's not gonna take you like that but it is gonna be hard and it is gonna take a lot and it it bothers me because like dude when I like like I meet these young men and women they want to be successful that are hungry are we right they have what it takes and then they watch these assholes on the internet and then it doesn't happen fast enough and then they think it's there it's a problem with them but this used to be the weight loss industry right like until the internet came around and really made people wise up the weight loss industry was very similar to this right every every week it was a new pill every week it was a new powder every week it was a new this and I was fat okay I spent most of my life fat as fuck all right and you know what I did I bought every single one of those things about every single pill I bought every single powder and none of the shit fucking worked and you know what I did after it didn't work I'm like well fuck it I must be my genetics I just can't do it blah blah blah you know what I'm saying like dude how many people does that actually ruin and take them out of the game forever yeah and not just weight loss exactly bro I listen I watch my mom do this I watch my mom do this growing up she bought every single diet pill every single quick fix every single thing and nothing ever worked and she blamed herself she blamed herself like it was her fault like do you know what that does to someone's like brain in the thought process about themselves like it ruins them dude and eventually she figured it out and she lost a hundred something pounds she's doing fucking great very proud of her but my point is is that a lot of people never come back around and it's the same for their business ideals and they're same for their business goals like dude there's so many people out here that have all the potential in the world to become the next great entrepreneur or build the next great brand and they're getting confused by motherfuckers that aren't who the fuck they say they are who haven't actually built anything who haven't actually done anything and it's making them give up on themselves and that's why I hate this shit so much yeah like you guys should be looking and learning from people who have actually built shit you should be able to buy their products you should be able to talk to their employees you should be able to see their companies like physically like those people are teaching you shit it's probably worth listening to but it ain't worth listening to some 22 year old fuckhead who's trying to sell you some bullshit and that's real talk dude that's real shit man it bothers me from an ethical standpoint to my fucking soul okay it's ruining people's careers how many of these kids give up and never go back to it and they could dude how many great ideas die because the person was misled about what the process is actually like they're on recipe like dude how many curious to diseases don't exist because people were demoralized before they even went down the path how many great businesses how many iconic brands how many massive movements are never born because people look at these fake fucks and then figure out like and then somehow believe him and then blame themselves when their methods don't work and quit it's wrong yeah that's why that's so pissed about it dude you see that culture dying uh do you see that culture dying like dying off that that I mean look dude a lot of these people are getting called out day after day some of them are even getting killed you know like we're at a point now where you know there there's been a number of crypto people and scam artists getting fucking murdered in the last six months because bro they're fucking with people's lives and there's this there's this like flip it mentality about like you know amounts of money like 40 grand 50 grand right like these fucking scammers are out here taking 30 40 50 grand from people and because they you know they don't think that's a lot of money they don't realize like dude that like you know how hard it is for the average person they get 30 fucking grand bro it's damn near a possible most people never do it and these fucking kids are out here fucking stealing this shit from people ruining their lives I don't know if it's gonna die there's always been fucking snake oil on scam but I think the internet does a great job at sniffing them out yeah at least there's some at least there's some accountability to it you know but like bro you know that's what I do it's just it's just one part that's a big part of why it's a big part of why I got out of the personal development shit so hard because I got so tired of that shit you know I would go to these events and I'd be surrounded by you know we're some really good people but there's always some fucking snakes there too and I can't fucking stand it yeah because it's so easy for you just oh yeah bro because look dude I've done what these people want to do so it's easy for me standing on the fucking top of the hill looking down on the hill and who's pretending to be on the top of the hill it's not as easy for someone who's never built anything to recognize the fake shit yeah that's real guys Andy our third and final question Andy question number three and I've been running a small auto glass shop by myself for the past seven years I just recently hired my first two employees and after having a five star 200 plus reviews on Google I just got my first one star review between the story of what my guys told me in the pictures as well as what the customers claiming as far as the damage on the vehicle what kind of response should I be leaving on this one star review I stand by my team and I believe their story I don't really know how to respond to this review how do you how would you respond in a situation like that or how have you well look unfortunately the behavior of the internet can be unreasonable at times especially from customers all right so how this started out like back you know around 2009 10 when the internet first really social media really started getting going right people started getting savvy to like leaving reviews and stuff like that when you got a one star review you know it was it was horrible like because nobody really understood that people would abuse that system right but here we are 13 years later 14 years later and most people can recognize a one star review when it's bullshit all right so first of all like let that give you some peace yeah you know don't did you did you get like what was your first one star review like do you remember that that that's I mean look man you know because of the way I'm built in my the way I talk and how I am I get a lot of hate anyway right a lot of people just don't like me because they see me on here and they assume I'm some angry fuck when in reality bro I'm actually pretty easy going I just get angry on here all right like it's true though yeah you know and by the way we got some cool content coming out you know I'm getting back into making content again actually look at for some people if you guys are high quality editors I'm gonna have a little contest for you guys coming out shortly but I'm gonna start making content again because people you know perceive me in a way that I don't think is truly who I actually am I can do it justice no I don't think so you know but you know there were so many of them bro that like I you know like I can remember the first time I had someone like kind of hit me on the internet and I had never had to have before maybe sick and then my stomach hurt like made me freak the fuck out you know and dude that's okay because you should care a lot about your business you should care when people are dissatisfied it should make you upset if you actually give a shit when people are dissatisfied with the work that you do and so for but but you know keep in mind people understand when people are just being assholes all right so if that's what's going on it's probably pretty obvious to people but how I would handle this situation is I would make sure that you I would I would call the customer I would have a talk with them I wouldn't you know say hey take this down or anything like that I would say look what do we do to make this right what can we do to to to make it right and whatever they said that they need to have done as long as it's like within reason and they're not just like taking advantage of you because some people will take advantage of their own people there's a lot of them and and unfortunately it's a cultural thing in society right now where people don't understand that these small businesses employ people these businesses like dude I'm very I'm very I'm very very very tolerant and slow to blast a company on the internet because I understand what's actually at stake you know like when I see these things happen to bud light or I see these things happen to like the liberty safe thing that's happening right now growing hurt it it's fucking hurts me bad because like although I agree with the reason that people are upset I understand that there's hundreds of people thousands of people in those organizations that that think the same way as the people who are upset you know and those those are the people that suffer because I know that because of the I'm in that situation right I apply that to a small business that's dude and it's way worse and like dude you know so I have a lot of patience when it comes for calling businesses out because I understand what it takes to build a business and employ people and I wish people had more of that I wish people thought a little bit more right but sometimes you know people fuck up I got a car I got a car brand right now that's about to get fucking destroyed okay this fucking with me yeah and I'm not going to say anything yet but I will tell the story for the rest of my life if they don't fucking get it right soon but the point is here how do you handle it you handle it by doing everything you can to make it right and understanding a fundamental reality about customers customers that complain that are loud about complaining will actually be your customers that will be loud about how you fix the problem too if you actually go fix it those same ones yes so like you have a massive opportunity with a disc rental customer to turn them into an advocate by just solving the problem and taking care of them the right way now if it's unreasonable sometimes you just got to eat the one star review and wipe your hands of that customer sometimes customers do have to be fired sometimes people you know there's a thing like so we have this thing uh first form where our products are guaranteed by 110% money back guarantee okay well it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when we actually because we actually do we do fucking actually do that that people's try to take advantage of it you know okay so we have a little system here right that shows how what people have bought what people have returned and blah blah blah and once they cross that line they're fired as a customer they're not even allowed to buy from us anymore so you know that's that's what I can stand is yeah there's times to fire customers but most of the time um the customer is right and it's your job and you should recognize the ability uh and the opportunity to turn that customer into an advocate and create a situation where they're out there spreading positive word of mouth about you that's what happens in 99% of cases most people are good most customers that are pissed off are just defiably pissed off okay so I'm talking about a very small amount of of ship bags uh and then you know but I would handle that person as if they were acting in good faith until you knew for sure that they weren't weren't um how would I handle it publicly uh I would probably just get on the one star review and explain the situation as if you were explaining it for the world to read not for that person to read you see what I'm saying because if that person is so hell bet on ruining your shit and you go on there and explain what happened from the beginning to the end most reasonable people are gonna say look at this business owner taking the time to go on there and actually communicate with this customer and try to solve this problem and this person is still being an asshole yeah and that's how I'd handle it yeah but try to flip that caring if you can huh try to flip the caring yeah yeah for sure well dude they're valuable assets they're because it's already loud yes that's where people fail to understand like these people who are mad at you um these people who are disgruntled with you these people who are frustrated with you when you when you when you switch it the script on them and you actually solve the problem they usually become in my experience have become our biggest fans you know people who are allowed or allowed whether they're happy or not so there's an opportunity there for everybody if you handle it right and plus furthermore you know if one customer has a problem with this thing it's probably a good opportunity for you to to kind of look at your systems and say okay uh we need to fix this so this doesn't happen again yeah and be legitimate about it you know the days of the days of sweeping customers under the rug are over you you can't afford to do it now not with these right here no because everybody's an influencer to do every single human being is an influencer and every single human being can tell everybody anything they need to tell them in the click of a button that didn't exist 30 years ago 20 years ago that wasn't a thing all right so businesses back then and a lot of these businesses run the same way notice them all right the companies who that when you call them you can't get someone on the phone all right or you can't get you you you go to their website you can't find a way to actually contact them you can't talk to a person in their building all right are you call here you're talking to a mother fucker that works here right you're not talking to someone uh you know making moon slurpees hey i got to keep it real man you're talking to a fucking American right over there in St. Louis Missouri you know what I'm saying real shit though yeah who who actually gives a fuck because this is their career you know what I'm saying like do support those companies by the way it's hard to do business that way it costs a lot more money to do it that way yeah that's my pitch yeah well guys and that was three yeah that's good pay the fee case closed closed
