And so we got plenty of time. We'll get there. Yeah, Sam, but let's just get it going, man. Let's get it going. I think we should start this episode off with an OG segment. We've done it before. People liked it. It's 90 seconds of liberal insanity. Sounds good to me. Here we go. We love America. We love America. The red, white and blue America is everyone's home. Even Mrs. Tina's home. Break it down, Hannah. Tina, Tina, you're sexy. Yes. I, I, I, I, even more than that. Everyone is beautiful in the red, white, blue country. America, oh America, America is home. Break it down, Becca. America is beautiful. America is home. Where we stand, where we are all gorgeous in our home. Now only we, but I'm a rentina is beautiful in the red, white, blue America. America is home. That's not real. That is real. That is real. That is real. That is real is American pie. That's AI. That's AI. That's AI. That's AI. No, I don't think AI could do that. I don't think it would do that. Violet in terms of conditions. That's for sure, bro. I'm sorry, sir. You're fucking insane. Yeah, okay, do it. Oh, fuck, man. That's where we are. That is, that's the state of the union, man, 90 seconds. Did you notice how these, how these people are now trying to pretend as if they're patriots? They love America, don't they? Yeah. Isn't it like, yeah, that's weird. Like last year, they were burning the flag. And then kneeling, it put all games. Right. And now all of a sudden, they're the patriots. They love it. And everybody else is the traitors. Got it. That is weird. That is weird. It is weird. Bro, that's the city we talked about the other day. Actually got a chance to see it after we talked about it on the show. The city and which one? That's the city and that they tried to do last weekend. There was like nine people that showed up on the steps. Yeah. Yeah. Bro, that Jeffries dude was talking about how, you know, he was using general grants quote, you know, there are, there are, but two parties, you know, traitors and patriots and like, well, what the fuck are you talking about? You're the traitors. Like you always have been. You guys were burning flags. Last year, like three days ago. Yeah. The burning cities down. Like now, like what are you, what's going on here? That's weird. Super weird. It's weird, man. I don't know. Like is it like a marketing technique? Like you're trying to like project yourself to be like, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like what is going on? They couldn't recite the pledge of allegiance. I know. They can't recite it. They can't recite it. Come on, hairs couldn't do it. She couldn't do it. Like, yeah, it is weird, man. It is weird. Um, I don't know. I don't know what that is. Yeah. Well, painful. It is definitely painful to see. I'm going to appreciate their breakdowns. I don't fucking. Oh, that's how white people get bad name, bro. We shouldn't even allow people. That should be the shit they censor off the internet. Now, I want to say that some of you guys can dance. Like some of you guys got it. You know what I'm saying? Like there's the rhythm in there. You know what I'm saying? Like I give credit. You know what I'm saying? To some. Yeah. Most. Most. You shouldn't. Jesus shouldn't try it. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 90 seconds of liberal insanity, guys. There you go. Let us know what you think. Down in the comments, man, with that being said, let's get into our crews. We got a lot of stuff to cover, man. It's, uh, we're going to be, this is a global episode. Okay. Um, we got a lot of stuff to cover. Guys, if you want to see these articles, bitches, links, videos, go to Andy for cellular.com. You guys can check them all out there. Um, and I'm also going to try to behave myself. This episode. Okay. No, uh, no, no, no racism. Okay. That means extra racism. I'm going to behave myself this episode of promise. All right. Or at least for the first segment. Headline number one. Let's dive into it. Um, we got a debunk, some myths that were going around. Um, this was a wild headline for some reason. There was a lot of talks in the White House today. Mike Walsh, Walsh was getting fired from the National Security Advisor position. Um, and I mean, dude, everybody was covering the Fox News, CNN, right? Trump's National Security Advisor, Mike Walsh, expected to depart administration sources, say, um, NBC jumped on the bandwagon and they were all trying to link this, uh, that signal chat leak bullshit that was going on. Um, but everybody was covering it just a quick debunk because, you know, it only took a couple of hours of, you know, everybody, you know, going crazy and losing their minds about this. Um, that Trump finally cleared the air with a, uh, truth. Um, he posted this out around one o'clock today saying, quote, I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Walsh to be the next United States ambassador to the United Nations from Assamina, uniform on the battlefield in Congress and as my national security advisor, Mike Walsh has worked hard to put on nation's interests. First, I know he will do the same and this new role. In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as national security advisor while continuing a strong leadership at the State Department together. We will continue to fight tirelessly to make America and the world safe again. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Um, but it just goes into one of those things, man, of like all these people that like, the, the media, I guess itself, they keep like, I guess they feel like they're protected because all they have to do is just say sources without actually, I was just thinking that like what is that? I was just thinking when you were reading that, I'm like, I guess we can say anything we want as long as we say sources or insiders, right? Like in your, in your safe, yeah, you know, it's just call it fucking journalism. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, what is that? It, it's a way for them to lie and propagate without having to be responsible for it. I do think I can't reveal my sources. Yeah. Right. Right. I have to protect my sources. Yeah. Um, you mean you made it up. Well, I mean, because they got called out, I want to say it was Wall Street Journal, uh, they got called out because they did the same exact thing with Tesla and Elon Musk saying, like, oh, Tesla is looking for new, you know, uh, border directors and, you know, new, new position. They're going to be ousting Elon and like both of them, the company and Elon both came out like, that's full of shit. Yeah. Like, that's out like the smartest fucking dude in the world. Yeah. I mean, like, like, makes sense, makes perfect fucking sense. But I don't know what, like, dude, that's so annoying to see. I know you guys see it, but it's like, that's not journalism. No, it's not fucking. It's dude. It's propaganda. It's intentional, disruptive propaganda. Yeah. And that, this is what they do. They listen, you don't have to have the facts right anymore to publish it, which is totally wrong. You know, like, how many lives do they destroy by doing this? Dude, well, Trump, I tried to find a video. There was a video going around of like an interview that Trump did with ABC, I think. And they got a question like, oh, but there's no, like, there's no investigations and no referrals. It's like, Trump's like, how do you know that? Oh, I mean, you know, like, how do you know that? Like, you're not, you wouldn't even, you're not even like legally supposed to know that. Like, how would you know that there's not, or there is, and Trump called them out on a, like, it's just annoying. It's whatever. Let's talk about, let's transition this a little bit to some, some judges. That's going to be headline one. We got to talk about some judges that deserve to be imprisoned. So, hold on. So was this tweet today? Yeah. This was today. This was today. So they did this whole like rattle up like it was a whole media. So they made it seem like he was being fired when you're in reality. For the shit. Correct. For in reality, he was being promoted, promoted to him. Yeah. It's the highest post of the country. I mean, as far as ambassadors go, for sure. Just dumb shit, you know, dumb shit, just spell em myths, man. But yeah, let's transition this a little bit. I'm going to talk about some judges because they got a couple of headlines here that are are, they're wild, man. They're wild. So this first one here, judge orders suspect behind fire bombing of Missouri Tesla released from federal custody. Let's dive into this a little bit. US magistrate Judge Jessica Hedges agreed that Owen McIntyre, who is 19, a student at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, should be released after McIntyre's lawyers argued he be released noting that quote, he has no criminal record and that he has quote, strong ties to his community in Missouri, the same community he chites a burned out. McIntyre's lawyers also argued that he be released noting his quote, medical and mental health needs. McIntyre has reportedly been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD. Depression and gender dysphoria according to court records. Let's check this clip out. Bria and John, the government wanted Owen McIntyre to spend the time before trial behind bars, but the judge in Boston sided with the defense in this cage, which cited multiple medical issues facing the 19 year old, including autism spectrum disorder, gender dysphoria and ADHD. McIntyre's attorney argued the team should be released citing serious and ongoing medical needs and treatments that could not or would not be provided while in federal detention. The defense filing says McIntyre is being treated for depression and since March has been receiving gender affirming care that care would likely be interrupted or terminated in federal custody. Well, don't look like he's getting treated outside of fucking jail. So now we can blow shit up and we could say we're depressed and have autism, which has become a virtue signal. You go on TikTok right now, dude. There's all these, it's a new thing, man. There's all these women who are fucking 30 years old who are saying, oh, I just got diagnosed with autism. I never knew it. That's what's wrong with me. And then they're making videos of them doing stupid ass shit, pretending that they have autism, which is insulting to people who actually have it or deal with family members who actually have it. It's insane. So we're going to virtue signal autism, like it's like the new fucking thing. They all want to have disabilities. Bro, they all want to be in a protected class because they can't be in a protected class anymore with this trans shit or whatever else. They're choosing to act like they're, they have autism. And so regardless of all that, whether you have autism or not or depression or not or any of this other shit, that excuses you from committing violent fucking crime offenses. Bro, get the fuck out of here. This is bullshit. So basically any of us that get caught doing anything, all we have to say is that we're retarded. I didn't know because I'm an idiot. Wait, wait, grenade. Boom, wait, wait, I'm a target. Bro, what the fuck are we talking about here? Oh, wait, wait, I do have a, did you hear there's another word that came back? No, Dyke. Dyke, I didn't know that went away. Yeah, went away for a little bit. It was like a little hermit for a minute. But I didn't know that was considered an offensive term because it was what it was. That's what I'm saying. It's back. So yeah, I'm a target. I'm like, no, don't mock me up. It never went anywhere. But like dude, and you know, that's not okay. Okay. So clearly if we have people with mental disabilities or depression or anxiety, so, so they're dangerous. So should we remove all of those people from the fucking, should we put them all into mental institutions because they're going to do violent things? Like we're setting, we're, it's a dangerous precedent. Yeah, but it doesn't matter because nobody's ever held accountable unless it's like the set, you know, unless it's convenient for the political agenda. The rule of law has been so watered down and bent so hard to, to judge as personal agendas that the only people that are held accountable are people that don't align with them politically or socially. And so like, you know, I don't know, this is, this is absurd. That person should be in jail. And if they have autism and they have all these things, I think that's a case for them if they're going to be violent to actually be detained because they're clearly a threat to the people around them. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's not like they were getting the help outside. They're blowing shit up. It's like a fucking lock them up. Like, yeah, it's crazy to me. It's crazy to me. I'm just a sick of this shit, dude. Like I'm sick of the, I'm, here's what I'm sick of in society. I'm sick of people making excuses, pretending like they have medical issues that are, you know, made up, all right? Well, I'm not saying depression is made up. I'm not saying autism is made up. I'm saying people make them up to get out of shit. And they say, I have this. So I'm not accountable for that. Well, that's not okay. And dude, we have this situation in society where everybody can get away with anything as long as they say mental health. My mental health was suffering. And they almost like leverage it against you. Like, oh, I got fired because my, my employer didn't understand I was dealing with mental health. Well, motherfucker, you're hired to do a job and you can't do it. That's it. I don't, your mental health does not play into reality, but apparently it does. Or at least they're trying to make it. Yeah, I don't, I don't do my, I couldn't do my job because I'm struggling with mental health. Well, fuck dude, I don't know what to tell you. Grow the fuck up. Well, that's what I had to do. That's what everybody else had to do. That's the other piece of it. And like the reason, and I firmly, I truly genuinely firmly believe this in my being that like a lot of the stuff we're seeing, man, like even like you take depression, right? Like, I know it's a real thing. But I think when you start pilling the shit back, it's because people aren't doing anything. Of course, they don't have a purpose. They're not achieving anything. They're not doing anything. They're bored. They're sitting in front of their TV. They game. They eat she food. When you're going to have some fucking problem, too, when you make your life, Uber convenient and remove the purpose and remove the work and remove everything that gives you self-worth and self-value, you are naturally going to feel irrelevant and you are going to feel depressed. And you are going to feel that way because you know that you are not doing exactly what you should be doing. And this is no secret. Humans need purpose. And when we take this away, this is the danger of technology. All right? We are trying to create, and we mean society. It's really they. Okay. They're creating a society that is Uber convenient. Okay. I have instant food. I have instant entertainment. Now I'm going to have universal basic income because, hey, I can do everything for me. So basically, these people should just sit at home and do nothing. Like what the fuck are they going to do? Well, they're going to sit at home. They're going to play video games. They're going to live in this virtual world, none of which are what we as humans are designed to do. And they wonder why they feel like shit. You know, like, and dude, but regardless, that does not excuse someone from committing crimes. You know, I, I, I plead insanity. I murdered an entire family. Well, that doesn't matter. You still murder an entire family. You're going to fucking jail. Like that's how this should be. We need to stop sympathizing with people for whatever happened to them in the past or whatever trauma they had or whatever it's fucking bullshit, bro. Like we have all these therapists and all these victim culture people out here selling the idea of mental health and trauma and healing as if it's a permanent stop, right? As if you're supposed to be healing your entire life. Roe healing is a temporary thing. And that's another, in other words, you know what it's called? Get the fuck over it. Right, whatever you got to do to feel better so that you can move forward. It's not a place for you to stop your life and, and, and dwell, which is what a lot of these people do. And a lot of these therapists convince these people that they're perpetually broken and they create a cycle of brokenness for these people so that they can make a fucking profit. Like if you're a monetary income dependent on people being sick, what motivation do you have to actually fucking heal them? You know what I'm saying? Right. This is all bullshit. And then we have, we have society excusing these people for the things that they do. Okay. Well, I know what I can say now if I ever get in trouble. You know, that's where I'm saying it, right? Nice to have my good pulled-off speech. Sorry, man, I'm retarded. I, I don't know what to tell you. You can't get me a ticket. You don't right. Otherwise, you're a bigot. You know, right? You're a retartist. Yeah. That's right. You hate retarded, you hate me. You hate me. You know what I'm saying? You can't get me a fucking ticket. I'm just saying, man. Oh, man, what a time to be alive, man. What a time to be alive. Another thing that won't suit you all. What? Show, tell me the fucking lie. No, no, no, no, lie. But another thing that can get you off of being held accountable, is not being a US citizen at all. And how do you even pose to be here? All right? And your Committee goal. Sure. Are we holding accountable? Yeah. Literally, nope. Why people? That's right. Well, why people will warp for the raisins and potato salad. Travis County judge. That's a fair argument. That's a fair argument. I think that deserves an real punishment, just saying. Travis County judge slashes bond from $1.2 million to $7,000 for foreign trucker who killed five including a baby and fiery Austin crash dude this is this is fucking insane man. Bro it's like that guy that guy that guy ran over police officer here and say look at us. Yeah that was illegal and he was drunk. Got off. Get off. You know what I mean. Yeah you either say you're retarded or just say you're not from here and don't speak English like and you're good. You're good man. This is a little bit because this is so this actually happened a while ago. When this act like initially happened so a Travis County judge on Tuesday slashed the bond for Solomon Wacalli out of a for a national 18 wheel drive 18 wheeler driver from 1.2 million down to a jaw dropping $7,000 despite his role in a tragic crash that left five people dead including a child and a baby the deadly pile up occurred last month on interstate 35 in North Austin involving 17 vehicles and 17 people resulting in a fiery devastation and multiple injuries victims and their families are now pursuing more than 150 million dollars in damages. But for the Travis County judicial system the perpetrator gets a wrist slap and a ticket to walk free under laughable conditions. So Wakanda Arara who was initially charged with five counts of intoxification and manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault allegedly failed a field sobriety test. What's the difference between intoxification and intoxication? Is there a difference? I don't know. I mean you said intoxification. I made a rid of Rome and then you said intoxication. I just didn't know if there's a difference. I think I don't think intoxifications are worth. That's the joke. I was just didn't know. I'm glad I know now that I have no problem being held accountable. All right. I'm one of the few right now. That's your white hat. That's your white hat. So most people got like you know you got God and devil on the show. His mind's just like white DJ black DJ. You want back and forth? You know what I'm saying? Still it. No, just say borrow. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? That's my life man. That's my life. That's my life. Oh man. It's a constant battle isn't it? Dude, this is hard. It's hard man. See my eyes like you know man is racist and my potato salad. Put all the in there. Too much pepper. No, it's dense. It's dense. Don't fucking dance. Oh, fuck me. Oh man. Yeah. But he felt a spriggy test. He felt to do it I believe. Officers citing classic symptoms of central nervous system, depressed and used bloodshot eyes, mumbled speech and swaying. However, subsequent testing we've had no drugs or alcohol in his bloodstream. So it might have just been low IQ is what it sounds like. Intoxication charges are stimming from what prosecutors are arguing is sleeplessness. So is what they claim. They also claim antidepressants might be to blame. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. But this is his condition as bond agreement now. So $7,000. Dude, what are we doing? What are we doing? So we just say whatever we want. It's because of this. Oh, it's because my dad spent me when I was fucking three because my dad didn't. Yeah, well, it's because I was on an antidepressants. It's because I cut my dick off. Yeah, because I had an energy drink $5 a day. Like, what the fuck can we not, you know, like what? So we just blame these things on anything now. This is insane. It's wild, bro. It's wild. Oh, dude, you know, I'm sorry. I'm not fucking wrecked the car. I'm on an antidepressants. Who's that guy? That's the little conga guy. Oh, shocking. Yeah, man. It's sick, man. It's sick. Dude, I'm just tired of this lack of personal responsibility and accountability based upon these bullshit stories that people tell everyone. Like I act like an asshole. Oh, sorry. I'm bipolar. You know, I wrecked my car. Oh, man, it's the antidepressants. I was having a bad day. Like there's no accountability now. People get to make up anything they want to escape accountability. It's fucking insane. Oh, I fire bomb the Tesla. Oh, it's because I have gender this more of you. I didn't think that you had gender this more. If I thought you were a woman, what the fuck is it? You know what I'm saying? I thought you knew. I thought you knew since you were born, you were a woman on the inside. I didn't know you had confusion about it. Yeah. Right? So what is it? At least we're in a family admitting that. No, dude. It's the first women in space. Oh, really? What's a woman? Oh, well, dude, I'm just tired of the convenient application of whatever anyone feels like to push any narrative and escape any accountability. It's absurd. And it only works for protected classes. It does not work for anyone who is not in a protected class, like, which is me. You know, like, dude, real talk. Like if I did that, what would happen to me? If I did either one of those things, what would be, what would it be all over the fucking news? Right. Nationalists. That's right. And if yourself fucking kills 75 people when it's fucking none, right? It'll be totally alive. Like, and it'll be based on sources. You know, dude, it's insane. Yeah. It's wild. Dude, I'm just going to claim gender dysmorphia now. Anything that happens to me, sorry, dude. I'm confused. Yeah. It was not you. That's right. It was. That's white. Yeah. I'm white and intoxicated. That's what it is. There we go. I'm white and intoxicated. Gender dysmorphia. We're talking about it. We're talking about it. You can't prosecute me for anything. The laws do not apply. Sir, I need some proof. Just dance. You know what I'm saying? Oh, man, we live in a fucking strange place, bro. What a time, man. We have to, like in real talk, I know we're talking a lot of shit and making jokes, but like, dude, we as citizens have to start demanding accountability for all people. If the laws only apply selectively, then the laws do not matter. Period. We will never have civility or structure or rule of law in society with selective application. We won't have a high trust society. We'll have exactly what we have, which honestly, I think all of us are getting pretty fucking tired of. Yeah. Tell us if you are tired of it. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. I'm about this topic. Would that being said, let's go check out some of your thoughts and opinions. As we create all there are going to be is people talking about how good DJ is. Oh, bullshit. We already know how this is going to go. You want to bet? First comment, what do you think? I don't know. DJ is the funniest. No, man. His first comment, bro, listen. Oh, wait, hold on. Before we get into this, I got a fucking bone to pick. Uh-oh. I put a poll up on my story that said who wins 100 Andy and DJs or gorilla and 65% said Andy and DJ, which clearly they're intelligent, but apparently 35% of you are in a protected class. Because there's no fucking way. No, there's no chance. There's no way. And first of all, 100 Andy and DJs is actually 200 people, technically. So we would definitely win. Mathematically dumbasses. Yeah. And I'm not a botanist, so I think the math works out. Okay. Yep. Let's cruise some comments, man. Okay. What? This first one, man, uh, AZ Flyboard Rental.

Fucking say you got called unchain Just fucking broken chains man, you know, I'm saying to be sick. I'm listen. I'm doing it. I know you are. I'm fucking do it Headline number two though, man. We got the global. Let's go to there is some tensions All right, the waters are murky. Where okay? India India and Pakistan I said I'm gonna be good this episode. See nothing is it true? Or a water's murky no comment I took Z for riding R8 today. Did you? That was amazing. Yeah, I try to let him drive. He wouldn't do it Now I don't want to mess up your car. It's been a long time since I've driven a stick shift. Well, I mean, it's a good time to learn bro One of my favorite cars though. Yeah, we ripped it You did yeah Yeah, that was a funny. Yes, you're hearing in the building. Yes, that's a loud car And people heard it in different parts of the building inside. That's awesome. Yeah Yeah, well, let's go let's let's go check on our buddy. We got some different over there in India We got great friends in India. I like India All right, um and listen, India is ready to fucking make the moves. You know what I'm saying this comes out Pakistan claims It has credible intelligence India will strike within 36 hours strike Pakistan Yes, listen this this is getting heated all right is getting real all right there. There's some real stuff going on So tensions between India and Pakistan has have escalated further After a top Pakistani official claimed early Wednesday to have credible intelligence that new Delhi will carry out a military action against Islamabad within the next two days the claim came as both the United States and China urged restraint so What happened? What I did see a video I I'll tell you what I saw yeah, what what what happened like what got these two country because there's always been tension Ziam alright like like yes They've always aren't they aren't you guys like cousins No, I'm being serious like same kind of people right Pakistan was A part of India before they declared independence. Yeah, and it was basically that happened because of religion differences like how here in America we are Majorly divided because of democratic and republican values over there the division is geared because of religion And that's one of the driving factors of the main two political parties that Quote and quote rule the country and that's Islam and in Hindi right Hindu Hinduism yeah Yeah But they there's always been tensions there right the water has always been murky Um I don't know if it's always been It's always been murky for a long time for thousands of years maybe but not for that But we go far enough back. I'm sure it was nice at one point. Yes calm and clean I mean not clean not clean. I didn't mean say clean What what got what what's the new tensions about okay because this is actually really fucked up Story of what what happened there was a terrorist attack in India okay dozens Killed as gum and master couturist in Kashmir beauty spot Um and dude it's so crazy like there was a there was a clip of a guy on his zip line. So like I guess it's like a park Right and there was a guy doing a zip line and he's like videotape in himself And like as he's going by completely oblivious. So what's happening underneath like there was a fucking massacre underneath him 26 people were killed At least 26 the dozens other injured there was reports of like their gunman were going around having people pull down their pants To verify if they were like like Hindu or Muslim because Muslims circumsides circumsides themselves And Hindus do not and it's like they were targeting Hindus Um, so a racist terrorist attack And so that's kind of what really kicked it up in India immediately went to blaming and saying that the the attackers had some sort of connection to Pakistan all right And so then The minister of defense from Pakistan came out with this clip this video. Let's check this out Pakistan Has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out Military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours On the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the pehal government incident Indian self-assumed Hewbhristic role of judge jury and executioner in the region is reckless and vehemently rejected Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge We have always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world Being a responsible state Pakistan openheartedly offered a credible Transparent and independent investigation by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth Unfortunately Rather than pursuing the path of reason India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation Which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond evasion of credible investigation Is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India's real motives Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives is unfortunate and deplorable Pakistan re-itrates that any such military Adventureism by India would be responded to a surely and decisively The international community must remain alive to the reality that the owners of escalatory spiral And its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie within India The nation re-itrates its resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs Pakistan Zindabad Pakistan's in the bank Oh wow great Do you know listen is wild and there's been like so this was over a mass shooting. Yeah, when did that was a terrorist attack April 20th April 23rd. I believe actually. Do you have the video of the Zip line thing? No, no I April 22nd is when is when it happened. I thought this was Would you have more on this? Yeah, I mean like I mean, it's been it's been it's been getting heated right there's there's a like there's sources saying That along some of the borders shots have already been starting to get exchanged between both sides That was an interview Let's check this clip out real quick Born you Pakistanis to death Go on read it on yeah, you will not be given the grave. I'm you will be given fire I'm going to burn you to the ground We're going to burn you to ashes if you have to high give you my word I Yeah, but why don't they just fight? So the guy on the left I'm trying to loosely translate he's saying that you don't deserve to Read the air on this earth and we will not only Nuke you will fire you and just remove your existence. Yeah, you will get no grave. Yeah That's what he's trying to say but yeah, this is Sometimes this is how the debates on new shells that that's how they go. I like this No, they get super fiery. Yeah, this is how it should be. Yeah, fuck you. Yeah And then you make the leaders fight That's how that's how it should be instead of sending all of us that Fuck we got to do with this shit, right? Like you guys send your I mean, I'm sure in every country You know, they send their regular people to go fight these things because these motherfuckers can't get over their dick measuring These dudes should fight exactly Well, I mean like I said do I think how many people die because of the egos of these leaders. Yeah There's nothing strategic to gain here This is fucking ego shit and we're gonna sit well you gotta send your fucking your your your your fuck So not only that there is same everywhere. It's been the same for thousand years correct And not only that there is a very strong undertone of extreme Extremism because of religion Yeah, that's the amplifies it. That's the main undertone factor between the problem within us What's the conflict in religion? I understand they're too different, but like Like so we we can't tolerate other religions. No, it's not that actually so I'll tell you it's the basically the same thing everywhere Like how here if you go out and talk to common people they're all cool. Yeah regardless of very Yeah, it's these guys same same everywhere It's the political agenda and the things in the news and the main thing is because muslims eat beef And in Hindu religion the cow is considered a sacred animal is often tied of very high religious importance to a lot of gods Okay, and there are some states in India where eating beef is illegal. Okay, so that's the main undertone So let's have a thousand year feud over fucking stakes exactly I would and I know you would What's up? I'm sorry. Yeah, you're not you're not Hindu. Yeah, it's fine No, but the but how we we get it done here it's the same thing over there The people in the leading positions and the politics know this and they gear it purposefully. Yeah, yeah, that's that's what it is It's so basically so basically India said the Pakistan try to redeem some shit India's like do not redeem You know what I'm saying That's a terrible joke And And Pakistan is like we didn't redeem shit, but we will redeem if we got to you know, I hear what I think So we're gonna send all our men to die over a mother fucking cow That's that How's that make sense? Yeah, I mean listen, it does it but both sides are heated right now. I know okay I saw a very I saw it almost I saw it almost go down bro Well listen, they've been pumping out fucking like military propaganda videos and stuff from both sides. Yeah I got I got an example of both sides. Yeah for the show for context. So this is what came out of Pakistan Let's check this clip Oh So well, there's no secret as to why the United States kicks the fuck out everybody show me your war face I Was fucking bad at the isn't what the fucking butt back in the All right, all right, so that was Pakistan this this this is serious shit. Oh, bro. Listen India responded They ain't fucking India does not fuck around India responded with this We see you Oh Oh, that's just laughs bro. I'm sorry for India They got better use it I'm fine with India bro We're gonna have a good time too India's in the bag and Indian people have a good time bro. They know how to fuck a party Even when they're killing people. Yeah, I'm with it I'm with it. I saw a video of how this was gonna go down though Did you see this video? I saw a third video. Yeah, let me say it to me. Yeah, let's put it here. All right. This is the one I saw You This is death to this bitch You want to run in? Fuck you Oh, yeah, this one too India is ready to redeem man That's because shit right there. See that just that dance Bro, you know what I feel bad for You know because here's the real here's the like real shit real quick for like two seconds, man So like if they if these two countries really go to war like blow it all out who I really feel bad for Is like the fucking you know the granny's and shit that we're told that like the IRS is coming to fucking lock him up If they didn't send the 399 on a Walmart gift cart and they're just waiting for their fucking sentencing now you know I'm saying because You know Kyle is not calling them back to tell them you know I'm saying cuz he's busy fighting you know in the war Is this how this goes? Yeah, but this the section in the video is the one that's super bad, but yeah, it's how it goes What do you mean like it's not it's better than this usually way better than this. Okay, so this is this is we just caught him on a bad day Yeah, no They took the worst section of the whole performance and that's the I thought it was pretty good So they just dance battle it out. It's not dances like marching, but super exaggerated and what they stop at each other and shit Yeah, so it's like cock fighting. Yeah, kind of yeah, I kind of like how they do shit over there Oh, I'm trying to find you a picture Like Americans who go over to live Yeah, I would like to get in on that dance battle Yeah, you and I should dance battle Okay That's the power move. Oh look like here it is so they have like a whole stadium right right there where they do this uh It's like a whole stadium over there. I don't know how you blow this up a little bit There should be a stadium. It's awesome I've been there right. Yeah, it is yeah, like you went there watches. Yes. Was it cool? Yeah, it's called the Yeah, a lot from both sides really so there are seedings on both sides and there's a big door So it's like just like that. So it's like you're American football Yeah, like you guys were the gyrosis shit cheer. Yeah, yeah, and then you paint their faces and stuff You fucking tell the other team fuck you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you guys eat the hamburgers? One-size-sour hamburgers the other side serves, you know country burgers. Yeah, right, right, right you guys are getting going to get a lot of spam calls now Oh, we're not going to be busy fighting man like that's what we're gonna get a lot of spam calls Yeah, man, listen, it's getting crazy over there. So it's about to pop off dude. It should's getting real. Yeah These guys look pretty tactical though. Yeah, it's nice low. Okay, they got yeah, you know I mean looking good and fighting good is probably two different things isn't it? It's true That's true. Yeah, so I mean, I don't know we'll keep you guys monitored as always Um of uh, this year's stick to dance battling just I say you have one big dance battle. Yeah, yeah, that's how we should solve things here winner gets the cow But the one side don't want the cow. Oh, I get it now. Yeah, they want to save the cow exactly got it exactly Okay, exactly. I think that's fair. I think that's fair guys jump it on this kind of so if India loses No hamburgers. No hamburgers. But if they win Pakistan's got to eat hamburgers. We know the other way around. No, you guys eat burgers, right? Well, yeah, no, he's not he's not hamburgers technically pork. No, what it's it's beef. It's beef. It's beef I don't know that yeah, all right. I thought it was my make sense that it would be called hamburger, but no hamburger. Yeah, wait How the fuck is he gonna know he's from fucking India bro. Yeah, I'm illiterate It makes sense. I can I get what you're saying it does me. Okay. Yeah in that context Okay, but no hamburgers you generally made with ground beef I learned you been over there making it home with him, huh I learned something new today At least hamburgers are different I'm never gonna make battles Oh shit man, that's great. Oh McDonald's has a veggie burger back in India Brothers, we don't get here. It's the only place that does it in it. I'm not sure about other countries But it's because they have a large Hindu population. We don't get it here in America. Yeah Thank God Go be good man Guys jump in on this conversation man, let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said a third and final headline headline number three we got we got Michelle in the mix Michelle Obama is in the podcast today. She is pissing some people off Um among other things Michelle Obama Blast Trump's immigration crackdown. It keeps me up at night So this is getting some heat She's been labeled a hypocrite Among other things former first lady Michelle Obama said president Donald Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown is striking fear Into people of color in America Obama made the comments during an appearance with her brother Craig Robinson on Mondays episode Let's get let's stop this right now Let's point this out. They generalize all people of color so they can hope to rally the troops against this right like There's lots and lots of black people in fact most of them to the tune of 70 to 80 percent do not want these migrants here Okay, so like I love how they lump that yeah, they try to create it like it's it's this or that you're either team Pock or your team whitey, you know, I'm saying like dude like dude. I'm so fucking tired of these Obama people like all they do is stir the race pot over and over and over and over again with no standing Okay, you have no moral you weren't literally the highest office of this country Okay You were president and first lady of the United States and all they fucking talk about is racial oppression Get the fuck out of here. Okay, I am tired of doing it. I'll do the sick This is like that, you know the metaphor like you know the answer the jar They shake the shit out of that jar You know why because they are fucking enemies of America. They are not they do not give a fuck about unity They've understood for a very long time that the way to continue to pull the cloak over people's eyes is to stir racial divide so that Pocks and whiteies will argue amongst each other and not notice how much they are taking from us Which is pretty much everything at this point our freedoms our rights our tax dollars You know our safety pretty much everything So before we even continue down this road Fuck you. Okay, Michelle Obama You are full of shit Everybody knows you're full of shit and your time in the sun is fucking over Okay, I know that when you were president or in first lady And you were getting you know on the cover of all the magazines and you were the darling of the universe I know that's probably hard to come back to reality and realize that it was all propaganda And everybody was lying to you. Okay, cuz you aren't but We are tired in this country of being propagated white people and black people and against each other we're fucking tired of it Okay, so fuck off um, but yes, she went on she went on jshadys podcast and You know had some things to say about Trump's immigration policies. She was saying some shit about the safety. Mm-hmm Okay, go ahead. Yeah, let's wait for it. I'm getting ahead of myself cuz I'm fucking irritates. Let's watch the clip. Let's check it out Couldn't be we couldn't walk around saying valedictorian straight a student uh, you know speaks Excellent has excellent diction if you give them a chance, you know We knew very early on that that no one was gonna see beyond the color of our skin at an early age Uh, and and that could get you in stop Do you know why no one sees past the color of your skin cuz it's all you fucking talk about That's why Up real people out in the real world don't give a fuck about the color of people's fucking skin We know I don't give a fuck do you give a fuck do you and we all have different shades of fucking skin and pretty much All I know all the white motherfuckers I know is contrary to what people believe they don't give a fuck either Fuck dude. I'm tired of hearing it shut the fuck up. You were first lady of the motherfucking United States No one gives a fuck and I'm tired of her preaching the way she preaches with her nose pointed down at everybody else Like you're some sort of fucking moral authority on anything. You've never done a mother fucking thing You were fucking elected off of race you ruined the fucking country and that's the reality of it You would think you just leave it shut the fuck up Yeah, I can go get your fucking started this podcast and nobody listens to because you don't have a fake media propping up all the shit Fuck dude Fuck off. I'm dude. I'm so tired of their fucking faces and their smugness. They're so fucking smug They don't give a fuck about black people if they gave a fuck about black people They would actually hold the black people that are causing all the violence and crime accountable They wouldn't give them excuses because of the color of their skin We couldn't be straight A stew. I'm pretty sure there's lots of fucking Very successful black people that did very good in school and they won valedictorian I mean there's a whole much fucking whole much of them Okay, like Fuck dude. We got our own fucking. We got black schools. We don't have fucking white schools. We got black schools We got black television. We have white television You see what I'm saying like dude It's you the fucking cares. It's you that rides that shit because you benefit from it because all they can and dude It's they don't have a policy Their goal is to destroy America and destroy its culture and that's the real goal These people are communist those were the first two fuckers that actually got into power about it They do not give a fuck about black people at all and they fucking hate white people So it's dude. I'm tired of hearing it Anyway, let's continue so I can roaster some more each Uh and and that could get you in trouble Yeah, I mean when you talk about that fear I'm sure that fear has been tested across your life In so many different places and I wonder what would you say has been the most hardest recent test Of that fear because it's not one of those fears that you kind of get over in it Just goes away. It kind of shows it's had in many different ways. I imagine well in this current climate for me It's you know What's happening to immigrants? You know, so it's it's not the fear For myself anymore. I drive around in a four-car motorcade with a police test court I'm Michelle Obama. I do still worry about my daughters in the world even though they are somewhat recognizable So my fears are for what I know is happening out there in streets all over the city And now that we have leadership what's happening in the streets in this city Oh, what is happening? Oh migrants are coming into black neighborhoods and committing more crime and taking more resources that were meant for American citizens Not black people American citizens, okay Black Americans are American citizens and you fuckers have allowed all of these people to come in from all over the world And they are not the productive members and the brain surgeons and the fucking Engineers standing members of society these are single military age males who are coming in to To buy your own admission your people's neighborhoods and fucking them up even more Okay, so they don't get the resources. They don't get the protection the migrants who take it all the funds that are meant for black Americans in and their neighborhoods and That's what's happening and they're committing all kinds of crimes like pro So let's be real about what's happening in the streets, Michelle I know I know you roll around in a motorcade so do I but uh Just so you know that's what the fuck is actually happening I fucking dude She's up there with Hillary Clinton for me bro. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh Let's hear some more bullshit Is sort of indiscriminately determining who belongs and who doesn't and we know that those decisions aren't being made with courts and with due process and You know that that it's being made It's really easy who's making the decision the decision is very black and white It is American citizens as a first non-citizens Okay, and non-citizens do not have the rights of citizens Therefore do not get court dates and you think you would know that if you were first lady of the United States and a fucking Scholar like you pretend to be they want them to have rights. They want them to know they want they want the court They want them to get held up in the courts so that they are here for the longest period of time So that they get to fucking vote in 2028. That's all this is Please continue. I won't interrupt anymore. It's being made like this cop that pulled my brother over when he was 12 You don't look like somebody stop that belongs. I lie Why the fuck is your brother getting pulled over when he was 12 right right you can't drive in this country till you're 16 mother fucker out of you think you know that too What are you there my wait wait wait wait so your brother was pulled over you know driving around your house and the cops Oh, you don't belong here, but wait.

How do you feel standing on the bus stop? How do you how do you feel comfortable going to work going to school When you know, well, they don't feel comfortable because you guys fucking let all these criminals in and they're fucking terrified They're gonna get shot by someone who doesn't even belong in this country and on top of that You're the ones that allowed them in your party your people your policies You're fucking bullshit lies that you try to convince everybody that it's about diversity and all this shit No, it's about ruining the culture of the United States and making it harder and harder and harder and harder and harder For the regular American citizens black or white to get by Okay, that's Like she's not thinking any of this not only that Andy not only that let's go back to get old barri Obama because the thing is He he has deported 30 times more Immigrants than Trump had that's unfortunate So if anything Trump needs to be taking your guys as fucking playbook your health with the point of more Yeah, why Trump should hire Obama as the fucking uh and hope make more with homin Yeah, like I have how they did it shit Well, they can do things they can do whatever they want no one says anything otherwise if you say something guess what fucking racist Fuck dude, I'm so fucking tired of this shit I'm so tired of being told as a white person that all white people are racist and there's so much racism and they're this and that and this and this and this and this and this and this and this I'm fucking over it I'm fucking over it Okay, the real talk is white people can't even fucking voice a an opinion about black crime without being called race Oh, you pointed out the crime data. You're a fucking racist. Okay. Oh you think this kid and fucking Texas deserves to go to fucking prison It's because you hate black people, right? This is a fucking weapon that they've they've worn out and and sucks that they've worn it out too because There are actually cases of racism and now we can't identify them because fucking these people call everything fucking racist Yeah, they they've thrown out the sympathy drug and by the way the real racism here is is that White people can't say shit black people say whatever fuck they want do whatever they want that's the fucking truth Okay, that's for truth All right, and dude, I'm not I think it's wrong either way the only thing she said that whole thing Was that you know good people and bad people Like and she didn't even have context to it like that's all it is bro. It's good people and bad people and If you're afraid for people that you drive up and down the street foreign shit, just remember you're the one that caused the fear You're the one that fucking did this shit you did it She's a piece of shit terrible pieces shit and but but to that point I don't think it might not be she no more listen. I've said it I've said it And now we get to hear from the horse's mouth. No, that's bullshit Andy. That's out of context Andy. No, it's I saw it I saw the whole clip I just play it.

I call it how I see it What's right is right what's wrong is wrong I saw the whole internet say this they're saying oh, you know like she's admitting that she's a dude No, she's not she's saying That he's a black man. You know, why does she say that because he's got to see her dick to believe it? No Yes, like dude, I know it's a joke so you want to see Michelle Obama's dick No, I don't But I'm saying I don't believe that she's we my joke and my say shit listen I don't believe that I think it's bullshit Do you really don't know? No, okay, let me actually this so you look at the difference between her and her brother It's big fucking difference how they look not to me Same same Same same They're dick they come on you know I think they look very alike she has just made her look feminine If you take that person on the right make the person thin A lot of hair she does Exactly the same that's just my opinion same. So look I don't I don't We might joke about it. I don't actually believe it. I don't think it's right to fucking be serious about it Because I you know, okay, so let me let me actually this but here's the point the point is is that That that comment was taken out of context and I don't like contributing to things like that or say going along with things like that because I think it discredits I think it discredits people go with that just like the left when they do crazy ass shit in line Listen, I get that I can definitely understand that Do you think have you seen all the shit on like a manual my crones That's a dude, okay All right, I want Candice to do a fucking deep dive on her. I think Candice like somebody has to I think Candice would have if she believed that Candice goes after the truth And that's why a lot of people don't like it. I think Candice does a very good job of remaining Unbiased I think she says the truth. I think she's fearless And I'm very thankful for her presence and culture because it's it's very real and it's very authentic And I think if Candice thought that she was a man she would already be all over That's my opinion. I just think I think the thing is bro is that like you can't touch that You know what I'm saying like there No, no, what I'm saying is not afraid to go after it. No, no, that's not what I'm saying What I'm saying is though anybody that does or tries to bro like I mean that's you're like that's like fucking with Hillary Clinton You know, I'm saying like that's up there on what you do you remember Joan Rivers? I did okay So that Joan Rivers was also a comedian she was but she was also dead after she said this Miss Rivers, how are you? You made you made a ton of news officiating the wedding in New York yesterday Is this like a is this like a new cottage career move for you? Okay, I should do very well because I don't charge and do you think that the country will see the first the United States will see the first gate president or the first woman president With Obama. So let's just calm down got it No, Michelle is a trend. I'm sorry. She's a what? A transgender. We all know oh my gosh I know I know I really look bro. I don't know Barack's brother Barack's brother Malico bomber black man Michelle or black man person being interviewed he believes it No, he always stirs it up. I listen. I'm not gonna. That's whatever you guys could think whatever you want I think what I want. I'm not I'm not legitimately buying into that. Yeah until I have Look man Everything can be edited right now voices videos And I've seen all the videos and I've seen all you know her dancing on Ellen and I see nice shit big swinger Yeah, I mean like dude that can all be made up and I just I don't know. I mean that's my that's my position on it and maybe I'm wrong and if but until I'm proven wrong I say what I think and that's what I think I respect that 80 I Respect it. I mean it is what it is man. I don't know dude like I don't know Obama does seem gay a lot of time No, I'm not saying that to be funny He he he's got a gay vibe to lunge on this it's yeah, you know, and he's but here's what I know. I don't care if he's gay by the way But I don't like Is this tone that these two motherfuckers use with everybody? This like holier than thou like stoic like I'm I'm the moral authority in you or like fuck off Fucker you bro. You were a civic fucking servant who got elected to fucking Senate because you were black and you ran on being black at the beginning of Running on being black started like this identity politics shit like let's be real bro Obama didn't fucking win the presidency because he was a great politician He was a good oratory. He's one of the best speakers. It's ever existed his policies were fucking trash all shit Yeah, and he got elected because he ran on a lie that he didn't even believe himself which was Change and hope and unity and the reason he got elected is because he's a tremendous liar That's it. Yeah, he's named it speaker. Yeah, and they're good at shaming and leveraging people to feel like I'm not racist I voted for Obama because I'm not racist You know, look at her face right there like these people always make these fucking these faces and shit like it's like it's smugness. I just can't stand smugness Who the fuck are you dude? I'm really scared for people of color What the fuck you talking about bro black Americans are scared as fuck they got fucking all these gangs and all this cartel shit and all these things coming in their neighborhood Soaking up all the funds that you motherfuckers promised them that would help their neighborhoods like no black people aren't afraid They're fucking pissed off right yeah, I mean They can't like I mean yeah, I mean these people come in they're still in all the persons and shit that they're supposed to be stealing like I mean it Fucks up a lot dude. It's a problem being serious the ecosystem. I'm being serious look dude Black people should fucking legitimately hate Obama's Because Because of what they've done in their communities if they really knew and like really looked at if they look if they pissed if they checked out of the idea of identity politics And that I got to stick with people because they're the same tone as me right they would not like the Obama's no now that's the truth That's real the Obama's have been more damaging to the culture of the United States specifically The urban areas of the cities Which are more populated by black people than white people Which they've destroyed and they've caused more damage to the black community than anybody else in the history of the fucking country That's the facts dude. No, it's very yeah So you know, I think don't definitely have a lot of them dude what you know what it is dude They think that there's so much smarter and so much more cunning and so they think nobody can see Their play Like I hate to break it to you Michelle and Barack, but you ain't the only smart motherfucker's out here smart people can see through your shit you know and I'm just tired of it dude and I'm tired of them talking about this race shit Like bro, we need to get past this idea That but like America was founded on a fucking ideal, okay and And It's not a race of people it is a culture and People who abide by that culture buy into that culture are welcome here no matter what color they are If they come legally, but when they come illegally and they bring their crimes and their way of life from other places They're not welcoming like we're not we're not having you shit in the middle of street buddy You know, I'm saying like we're not having you rape 12-year-old girls because that's what you fucking do where to fuck you from Like fuck you and and and if you want to know what they're really afraid of they're really afraid of their daughters being gang raped like Happens every single fucking day over and over and over again in Europe all over the place And they can't say anything about it because it's against the law if they say shit about it They go to fucking prison. Well, guess what we could still talk up and if we talk up and we fucking And this shit maybe those people over there will be able to speak up, but Americans better be quit They you guys better quit being afraid of being told your racist for fucking speaking the facts. Yeah Well, I mean the truth is too, bro like I mean, and this is how you know it's coming from a really evil place with these people specifically It's like you know if you really if you truly wanted America to be less racist and you really want Racism to end in America. Maybe the first place you would start is like stop telling more than half the country that they're fucking racist Yeah, that'd be a good place. Well, yeah, cuz I'm saying I'm real dude like it's creating the racism you say Exist and it's creating the division and it's creating like real fucking tension, but that's what they want That's how you know they don't really care bro You're a hundred percent right As a white man I've been called racist for the last 20 fucking years For breathing the mother fucking air in existing Okay, eventually people get tired of that All right, and people who are less aware and less knowledgeable and less like understanding of what the play they're trying to run are probably are becoming Legitimately more racist. Mm-hmm. No, that's what I'm saying. It's not it's not like heard Taking that Like I'm aware of what they're doing so like I can stop myself and be like bro. This is fucking what they're trying to do But like when you take Somebody who may not be as aware of understanding how evil these people are and how accounting they are or just didn't get the job because You know, they would beat out from the D-ass shit or they got fired because they needed in getting to the No, they got fired because they were they were even though they were better than the other people because they need to fit a race quota Exactly that's gonna make people feel a certain way is gonna create The monster that they're saying exists that doesn't it doesn't it doesn't you know not not dude. Yeah, but I mean Listen, I've been I've not seen anybody in my lifetime is done more damage to American culture than those two for sure Without a doubt yeah, and I think and then they're fucking they're like proud of it And then they act like they're not doing it.
