cleaning for my life oh which side are you are which side are you all you should say how afraid of Trump I am can you wrap up please yes apartment of government efficiency you just remember it is the department of government evil what is the problem with those what is the problem I speak as both the B and the T in the LGBT I do not want to be in your email inboxes I do not want my creativity writing distracts like Kendrick normally I would say good evening but through the chair I will only impart my sour grapes you have no other choice but to get violent and fight face up look at him let

man how about this I don't have anything do you have anything I got nothing man I got do speaks for itself you know it used to be very difficult to put these shows together now it's automatic all right well that's cool I can just pay you half as much brand new segment guys that's no down the comments no good way to start the show there's first of all it's a bunch of white people making up like a southern hymn about stealing my people money yes I'm stealing people's fucking money like bro oh man I still like you we were talking about this in a lunchroom over there who who could actually have a problem with what's happening right now there's only two categories well there's three categories one you're either making money from it okay which all of these people definitely are they're telling on themselves and they have to tell on themselves because if they don't fight for it they're gonna go jail anyway so they got nothing to lose right that's why you see these people saying violence and all this shit which I hope they do I hope you do I hope we've been waiting that's all I'm gonna say do it Maxine secondly you don't pay taxes at all completely on the fact yes so you're totally you're seeing all your benefits cut you're seeing all your free ride cut you you don't understand and don't care that other people who work very hard have to take way less money because you won't do shit all right and then thirdly it's just dumb motherfuckers and idiot right so you're either getting the money you're not getting the money anymore which you don't deserve or you're so fucking stupid it there's nothing's gonna help you know so those are three people that would be against it that's it you couldn't be against any other way yeah man that's pretty accurate yeah I mean that's I mean you know if you if you work for one of these agencies that's fine but the truth of the matter is is that where was your guy's urgency to do a good job two months ago right every government building every government agency that that I've ever dealt with and I think that most people deal with is a huge pain in the ass because people don't care it's multi levels of unneeded bullshit you know it and and dude it's it's time to fucking fix it and hold the people accountable that have been doing this so let's let's fuck tron okay please don't tell my children you've done way worse than that yeah trust me you're you're good yeah man guys let us know what you guys think brand new segment 90 seconds of liberal insanity man yeah uh with that being said we got a lot of stuff to cover as we are as we just mentioned which side are you on which side you are which side are you on please let us deal you shit please don't say anything or you're racist fuck uh guys if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to andy for sellah.com you guys can find them all linked there with that being said headline number one I just I have to keep bringing these clips in of trump just crushing these people because it's funny one um but I just miss it I don't think I'm ever gonna like not miss it anymore like I can't get enough of it uh Caitlin Con Collins from CNN she got it first um she tried to speak out of the tur and trump had to let her know that she was speaking out of tur this headline reads trump hushes CNN's Caitlin Collins at White House we have an act you to speak let's check this one out mr. president you won the White House and part because of high inflation if your tariffs make prices go up as you just speak yet please right right where we just talking about this like if you did we just talk about this on a show how these people have no respect and they've been they've been uh you know let loose for so long and done so much disrespectful stuff that they don't know where the boundaries are didn't we no yeah we just talked about this is she learning yet she well she's one of the main perpetrators of it you know like imagine you're sitting in the like the respect for the presidency has been so deluded because well because of Joe Biden yeah for sure and how much of a joke they made out of it i mean dude do you remember that video they had that trans dude with the long fingernails running through the White House and shit yeah with jensock and everybody thought it was so cute what do you guys think now right you know i'm saying right but these people have no respect they i love it and i think it should be hard sure i'm super trump is a gentleman a lot in a lot of ways bro like very noble when it comes for sure yeah yeah but he's gonna handle you yeah that's right and in an effective way oh yeah i don't think i think if he was a little bit meaner it would it wouldn't stick the way that it does like i think he's got a lot smarter and how he responds and he understands like okay well if i just handle this like how how could anyone watching that be like trump was in the wrong there yeah right like he's signing a fucking executive order in the oval office you are privileged to even be there to witness it and you think it's your turn to talk in the middle of them signing it like who the fuck do you think you are you're not the main character you're some dumb lady on the news that nobody respects bro that's why that is why that's why that's why well it's funny because after that happened you know then you know they open it up for commentary and questions from the press corps and he he put the put the nail in a coffin trump rose seeing in kateland colons during press conference gets last from other reporters no credibility check this out and this should have been done by Biden years ago this should have never been allowed to happen i know he's a friend of yours he's a friend of CNN that's why nobody wants to see an end anymore because he had no no credibility he's right listen i love the dude i don't care what i can't get enough i mean look dude do i agree with all those policies and everything he's doing i sort of i wish he would have done this the first time i like where things were going i think there's a lot more to do i don't like the gazet thing but i'm starting to believe that the gazet thing is a threat to get the other countries to handle this i think he's a very smart dude i think he's one of the smartest businessmen probably ever um it's very strategic man dude people don't even understand how strategic the guy is this is like five like think about how fast he's going now they plan this for the last two years bro they're gonna come in and just go fast last four years i've been planning this yeah yeah and and and dude by going fast he's created a situation where the media can't keep up they can't brainwash people the way that they were because things are happening so fast the use in their tactics actually yeah 100% think about it bro because like for a while there was like something was happening every three fucking days yeah we're on like our bases now yeah it's awesome it's fucking great dude i get home every day and i'm like let's see what this dude did today you know like i'm just wait i mean dude we're getting to the point where like real things look like they might happen now whether they do or not but when i say real things i mean like the disloat the the dissolving of of income tax oh we got a little bit of that okay i'm here later all right but let's get to some other and dude people you know some people uh i've gotten some pushback on why i'm i talk about the tax so much well guys that's what affects us the most yeah you know that's why i bring it up so much because it's the biggest immediate impact that we could have for the american citizen and financial relief immediately yeah you know it's a big bit big i got a lot to say about that yeah we got a little bit on that later yeah but a couple of other things have been happening again in these couple of days since we've been gone um to see gathered confirmed yeah director of national intelligence she had a vote 52 to 48 she is now the uh the director of national intelligence um you got uh rfk jr here you got confirmed hhs secretary 52 to 48 in a vote um miche mccannol of course being the only republican because he's one of the guys that been stealing money he's in he's in the he's in the rhinos man listen to him that guy is that that's not mccannol is not a republican he's a democrat yeah he well he's fucked up right now too you see him fucking a little charred in the boot and a fucking yeah um did you see you uh did you get a chance to see rfk's uh speech in the in the oval office no i got a couple of seconds of a clip here um he he spoke for about ten fifteen minutes or so this is just a small clip but i mean it was absolutely amazing got to watch the whole thing if you got haven't seen it go make sure you check it out but here's a clip of uh rfk uh right after he was sworn in i'll check this out 20 years i've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that god would put me in a position where i can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country on August 23rd of last year god sent me president trump and he gave me he's now given me he's kept every promise that he's made to me he's kept his word in every accountant gone way beyond it i'm so grateful to you mr. president a lot of people told me that i couldn't trust president trump i better get it in writing and we did a handshake and everything that he told me he was gonna do he has done and uh i'm so grateful to him and i've told you before i genuinely believe that you are a pivotal historical figure and you are gonna transform this country at a time when we see all of the indiscient democracy now in tatters in our country we see the rise the military industrial complex the rise of totalitarianism these attacks on our constitution and this breathtaking epidemic that is disabling our people i think this is gonna be a very historic year for the world but yeah his speech was really really nice um one more uh i agree with them by the way oh for sure yeah i mean look there is two paths that the country can go down at this point in time and it is very crucial that we picked the right one and we were going towards communism or we're gonna go towards reformation or uh you know revitalization of what this country was meant to be and what i really like about what's going on here is that a lot of these agencies you know when a system exists any system uh company a government uh an organization of any kind there's going to be people who figure out a way to cut the corners and cheat the system it's inevitable even in business you know when you have a small business and you have like a comp plan or even a big business and you have a comp plan you have to frequently change the comp plans because people figure out how to like game the system and not do things the way they were supposed to do them and when we look at our government right now our government is a 250 year old system that has grown and expanded beyond the boundaries of what it was intended to be and over the years we have attracted more and more and more people who have used that system to enrich themselves and now it's become this living breathing organism where as we've discussed many times on the show the citizens exist to serve the government instead of the government existing to serve the citizens and if Trump is able to take these organizations and these departments and these agencies and either remove them or shrink them to the appropriate size uh etc you know using new systems new technologies um eliminating the waste completely eliminating the illegal funneling of tax dollars to to these politicians and their causes if he's able to do that he will have saved the the country you know because the only other way that it could have went is violence and the way things were you know I don't know how well that would have ended up for patriotic Americans but after seeing how many people have the same beliefs that like you and I have and a lot of those listening right now have America first we're proud of this country we care about this country you know they were hiding that from us dude they were keeping us from knowing how many other people felt the way that we did and they did this through censorship they did this through propping up of these crazy narratives you know a big USAID bombshell that we talked about on the last show was they were using this money to create and fund media outlets that were pushing communist propaganda i mean the only the only way out of that would be violence and that's it and um that would have taken decades to restore maybe you know maybe not because they made it seem like there was lots of them and few of us when in reality it's mostly us and very few of them and we figure that out now and we need to make sure that we keep the energy and the attitude that we have now of you know hey uh how about this fuck you okay because we can't allow our good hearts and our empathy to allow these people to creep in because they've shown their true colors now their true colors are not i want to be just like everybody else the true colors are you're going to treat me in a superior way and um we're going to make all these laws that make it illegal for you to live the way you want to live right it becomes a uh uh we're a situation where the tail is wagging the dog and i agree with rfk here like if he if Trump does what he says he's going to do which so far it seems very likely to me um you know he will go not only a historical figure he will go down as the dude who saved this country yeah and then the general you know the people who come after him will need to carry that torch the proper direction keep going with it and so when i look at you know this from you know a 10,000 foot view what i see is him moving very fast so that we can experience what America looks like when it's set up the right way so that it gives us you know next uh 2028 there's no question what we're voting for right i don't know there's a lot that's there's a lot to be said but ultimately politics is downstream of culture and it feels like culture has flipped to the point where you know when people do this crazy shit we're just laughing at him now we're not feeling sorry for him we're not going to have empathy for the criminals we don't have empathy for you know these people standing in front of that courtroom saying i'm sorry you are afraid i'm defending my life bro listen the only reason you've ever caught any heat for anything that you are is because you get on tiktok and you force other people to use your pronouns and give you special treatment if you just ran around the fucking in your life and just mind your own business you're not gonna no one cares nobody gives no one gives a fuck bro the world's weird anyway right like no one care like if even at this maybe in 1980s if you saw someone walking now with blue hair you'd be like no i'm saying you would look at him be like oh that's weird yeah but like now like we were in Austin we saw kinds of it's always different people you know like dude and you just you're just it's what it is no one cares yeah and so you know like i don't know if you caught that whole courtroom scene but that woman with the blue hair said if you don't make accommodations for trans people it's gonna get very uncomfortable for okay all right do it cool do it and it'll give the it'll give people the reasoning to do what they really want to do which is not dealing with you shit at all yeah that's the truth 100% I mean I think there's one final piece of people need bro people need to understand the fucking place yeah oh your point zero four of one percent of the population and you're threatening everybody else that those days are over bro yeah I think there's one key piece here you know of Trump's kind of like plan that has to get put in and we're one step closer to it uh send it approved uh a Senate panel approve uh cash Mattel to move towards a full Senate vote um this was a big massive step um and I truly believe I'm because like you talk about you know you can put down all the laws there has to be an enforcement right you can put down all of the search warrants and the rest one there has to be an enforcement aspect of it that's what the the that's how important cash Mattel is in this in this ecosystem that happens I believe Tuesday yeah the full Senate vote yeah so they just did the the the Senate panel vote um where he he uh believe you got the vote 12 to 10 right listen I don't think they can stop it now no I mean that well that's the thing I mean it's so far I thought the only person we would have issues with I we talked about this in a locker room the other week was was Gabbert right because they moved into a closed panel closed session voting right why did they do that well I thought it was for two reasons either one it was because it was gonna be some some Republicans that voted no um or what I believe actually happened this appears to be the way there was actually Democrats to vote yes right because it could have gone so they're wanting to protect those people exactly they didn't want it you know what I'm saying they're they were well dude I believe that there are I don't I bought I bought dude listen there's there's there's there's multiple categories of people not everybody falls into this republican Democrat I certainly don't know I mean uh contrary to what the internet says how hard hard to believe yeah but you know there there are you know there are far left communist and they are a real group and they have become very popular and powerful uh you know behind the scenes you know they don't go around saying we're communist either then there's leftists who think they're communist then there's uh you know uh regular Democrats then there's libertarians then there's Republicans then there's far right you know people and dude but dude but the one of the problems is and like these people have radicalized all these other people against them because for years and years and years if you didn't go along with the communist progressive shit what they call you right when they call you far right yeah right all right so now everybody who's not with them is just like fucking I guess we're far right which creates a dangerous scenario because some of the far right idea do come across as racist and do come across as you know like there's there's dangerous things that can come from that and we talked about this years ago where the pendulum swings back so far the bad things happen to the other side but like dude when the other side shows their cars that they fucking hate you and they want to kill you that radicalizes everyone and so now these people because they've attacked and attacked attack attack they don't realize like you're you're this big of the pop you're a fucking speck of dust in the population and you've called everybody else racist you're in bigots you know uh white supremacist colonizers uh everything you've called them everything terrorists you put them on lists everything they say it doesn't agree is far right alt right and now there's a problem because everybody against everybody's radicalized against those people there's very little there's very little room at this point now for empathy for any of that and the reason that there ever was is because it was propagated so heavy that people felt like there was far more people that actually agree with those people than then there actually was and so a lot of these people they require it and they minded their own business and they kept their mouth shut which is fine but they don't like it once you take it to them right most people just want to be left alone most people just want to do their own thing they want to go out they want to live a nice life they want to try to make a couple bucks they don't want to be fucked with but when you take that to them dude you know and dude this is what I'm seeing man like I'm seeing the radicalization of pretty much everybody that's not on that yeah and maybe that's just normal maybe that's just what norm that's gonna be what it was yeah normal commonsense and you mother fuckers are crazy right which I think is more likely for sure but I think I mean dude cash getting in I think like I think it does go down next Tuesday I think he's gonna drop the Epstein list the first day first day I mean that was one of his big like yeah pivotal things that he was like he fucking knows everything about that bro what do you think of this though like what do you think it this is something that I was thinking about like all the things that are happening that they're they're quote unquote making happen aren't those all things that we should have had in the first place so like part of me is like yeah I'm glad it's happening and part of me like it's not that big of a deal and it makes me feel like we're getting thrown bunch of bones right like like bro the border should have never been open right okay these immigrants should have never fucking migrants should have never been here all right taxes should never be this high bureaucracy shouldn't be the way it is you know crime shouldn't be tolerated you know all of these things that they're doing are all things that should have been that way the whole time right and so part of me is like should we really be that excited about it you know like and why and then that makes me wonder like it's like you got to this is there something else yeah is there something else that they're gonna do that counteracts all of this and they're giving us all of this because they're gonna do this right right and dude so I just you know after the last and this is no disrespect to Trump or any because dude you know all my friends most of my friends know Trump or work with them and it's no disrespect to those guys or anything it's just like I I think most Americans are we walking into a trap I think most Americans have had their trust violated so hard that it's hard to trust anything at least that's where I'm at yeah and so like I have to take a day by day and say okay well that looks good that looks good that looks good and I'm not you know I'm not the kind of person that's just like I'm on this team like you know what I mean yeah no I get it so so I want it I sometimes like when he came out with that Gaza shit and he's like I'm gonna go to Gaza and do this I was kind of like is that the is that the trade that we're getting for all this other shit to calm that down you know what I'm saying but then but then I'm like it seems like he's doing the Gaza thing to force the other Arab countries surrounding that to come up with a solution because they don't fucking don't want us there so I don't know man I think it's a wait and see yeah I think I agree I would say if you were asking me like what's the trust level I mean I to me it's like 90% I 90% think they're gonna do the right shit yeah but there is a chance that maybe they're you know what I mean yeah no I mean it makes sense you don't want one I don't think it's smart for anybody to put all of the eggs in one basket right because it's a day like no matter and I'm good he does it ain't gonna fix your fucking shit whole life that's right you know I'm saying so like you still gotta do some shit on your own a lot of you shit on your own all of them pretty much but we have we have to fight but he's making the soil fucking fertile which is important man and it is and you know I think that he's gonna get us just to that line and the rest is up to us you know I think he can only make that soils we still got a fucking plant well of course that's all you can ask that's all we can ask well all that is the in natural order see what's happening here is we are returning to natural order natural order is survival of the fittest it is the most skilled win and that is true in every environment whether it be nature whether it be sports whether it be business whether it just be life bro we people love to say well I'm not in a competition with anyone well then you're gonna lose that's just as simple as that because you are and we are in a natural order and the fucking best the biggest the baddest the most skilled they're gonna get the most and the people who are are gonna get the least and that's that that's the way it works so we what's happening is all this do good or good-hearted shit that people wanted but isn't practical is going away and we're returning to a natural order of meritocracy and strength and ranking and you know skills and that's gonna be really hard for a lot of people because and I talked about this on MFCO back in 2015 there's an entire generation and a half of people that you know maybe even two generations of people at least at least 20 years what what's a generation 20 years okay so a tire of generation of people at least one that they were getting fucking 15th place trophies dude like they don't understand that when you get out in the real world bro nobody's doing anything for you so when we try to make everything equal it makes everything completely unequal because you have the producer class producing everything and then once people figure out that they don't have to produce they can just take they get they lose their ambition to do anything and so we we have a problem because we have a lot of those people and those people are gonna have a really hard time getting engaged in the game when they've already been taught a different set of rules their entire lives like when I grew up dude I and dude and I don't use the term luck very much but I was very lucky to grow up with parents that taught me that you either win or you're fucking lose and that's it and if you lost you better go practice you know what I'm saying right you get better I feel so extremely fortunate for having those lessons taught to me because now that I'm a grown man I realize that not many people get those lessons talked to them that's simple lesson and we're gonna have a problem with that group of people there's gonna be a lot of angry people and they're gonna be angry at the people like you and me and and everybody that has a common sense mind when in reality they should be angry at the very people that they voted for for lying to them and and disabling them and giving them disadvantages in life like think of the school system here right now okay we we are the out of the 40 nations that are ranked we are number 40 and we spend the most money in our school system part people okay so if we're last and we're spending the most money what does that tell you about our education system it's ineffective at at the least okay why would they do that we we have the resources for the best we have the resources to teach our kids we did it for all forever they did it to intentionally weaken our country and so when we think about what like you brought up the the foil or the soil right what our personal responsibility is to this country right like a lot of people think you got to run for office to be effective that's not even true the most effective actual change of this country comes from the individual and the standards that they hold in their day to day life and so that's why we say personal excellence is ultimate rebellion because if we the people don't take that role serious then the country can't be great if we don't have great individuals how can the country be great it just can't you know and so I'm excited for that to come back around which clearly it is but I'm concerned about the people who you know for 20 years were taught that that was not the way it is those people are gonna have a hard time dude you know well I mean they're not either have to fucking shit or get off the pot I mean because I mean that's the thing like that's the other the flip side of this is that I think we're gonna you guys have video I say you yeah yeah okay I want to talk about that when we show that video yeah but I mean I think that's the other piece of it too though it's like you know this is a great opportunity for those people though right like I think the ability to get in the game put some work in and actually be able to sow some great fruit like well dude you know why we have such a problem with fucking mental health and depression dude not doing anything that's right and we are built to create build and and become and contribute as human beings and when we are relegated to just being a consumer of data food you know entertainment scrolling all this shit we don't have a sense of accomplishment or pride or contribution that makes us mentally healthy as human beings and so as I've said on the show and I think Trump said it in his speech I said it first but he said it in his speech he said we don't have a depression problem here we have a problem that you guys are lacking purpose and that's the reality and so like dude when we when we think about like the problems that we have bro you know there's people out there that you know they they talk about how bad they have it and bro they're getting you know whatever food they want it comes to their house in an hour you know what I'm saying they're talking on a $1,500 phone they got a laptop that's too grand like dude we have lost all perspective of hardship at a real level most of the people in this country okay now there are people that have extreme hardships but the reason those people have extreme hardships is because our government created that intentionally so we've got to fix that but it just we have to realize dude like there's so much fucking opportunity in this country and there's so much opportunity in people's own individual lives that if we don't at least pursue our own potential as humans dude we're gonna be unhappy it's just reality you're gonna you're gonna feel empty you're gonna feel like you don't matter you're gonna feel like nobody cares about you because guess what you're not doing anything relevant for people to give a fuck about and dude you know your mom and your dad might have told you that you're a special little flower and everybody's gonna love you and this and that they told me that shit too because they love me right but the reality is the world don't give a shit about you bro the world does not fucking care and you have to understand that you are valued yes you will be valued on the quality of individual that you are to your close friends and family media circle outside of that your value will be based upon what you create build contribute to or become as an individual and that's that and people people want to be valued you know we've gotten to the point now where people want to be valued about who they have sex with right that doesn't make sense and so like this culture correction that's happening it's very important that we all participate in it and understand that we're only gonna get as good as you get as an individual and that's why we should all try to be the best that we can in all areas 100 percent man 100 percent so yeah well we'll stay tuned on the cash like to hopefully he gets you know I don't see no reason why he wouldn't get in so we'll see we'll keep eye on that but as all of that stuff's going on we got more uh government waste to expose here a little bit this came out that the Department of Health and Human Services splurged more than 22 billion dollars on grants for migrants including cash for cars home loans and startups um so this is just you know I mean this stuff has been coming under underabbling and it's so funny to see the left it erupt him out you know transparency and accountability and you know all of these things and so I think today actually a launch doge put uh has an official website now and they're putting up in real time receipts an actual fucking proof of where this stuff was going um and this is some of the stuff that came out um you know we're we're not talking like a little bit of money I mean you had migrants illegal migrants people are not supposed to be in this country uh just for crossing illegally into this country we're giving out $15,000 business loans small business loans loans to repair credit history up to $1500 cultural orientation um emergency housing support uh the Medicaid that people said didn't happen it wasn't happening that's all been been uh been been been unraveled and what's even crazier about this is that out of that $22 billion ten of that was in one year and just so happened to be the year where we had the most amount of migrants crossing our border illegally um it all correlates together um so you had that come out but an even bigger story also came out um this headline reads why is this not making headlines over 2.7 trillion and fraudulent US government payments discovered carolina levitt response let's check this clip out for a second earlier the subcommittee had headed by chairman marzia tailing green hurt and her staff uh discovered 2.7 trillion dollars in improper payments to Medicare Medicaid overseas the people who should not have gotten it some of this room might have missed that press conference elaborate on what the president is thinking at this point well again that's another example there's a very long list of the fraud waste and abuse that doge is identifying on a daily basis uh Elon musk also talked about yesterday about social security payments that are going out the door for people who are no longer with us unfortunately i would say that is certainly uh fraud there's also a lot of contracts they've identified that just as a hypothetical example are a million bucks but only 500,000 went out the door so where's the rest of that cash um and so that's the thing those are the things that doge is working on every single day and i would just remind everybody in this room this is what president trump campaigned on doing he's delivering on a promise that's seven 70 million people wanted bro did you see the search results for the search results in dc for lawyers and then offshore banking went through the roof erase yeah how to move money yeah it's all like through the roof listen man she said she said oh a million bucks and 500,000 went out the door where the other five hundred thousand dollar it went to people like Elizabeth Warren who had nothing when she came in it's not worth 70 million dollars or people like Pelosi who's worth nine figures uh or or you know really any of these people who came in just like Elon said and like we've said for fucking years earning nothing and then walking out with eight nine ten figures of net worth libraries and museums in their name right you know um and it's not you know like you know there was dead people on this list when he's been sent to you but here's another conversation that nobody wants to have there's a lot of americans in this country uh that are also as you said it's one of those three people that are benefiting off of the the tax paying citizens right like it's a lot of them yeah it's a lot of them here's a clip i want to bring in um of a woman uh who just got told that that's going to be ending now let's check the slip out i got a dhs letter in the mail this morning and i just now opened it and somebody reported me to the state of Michigan because i'm making money on tiktok and eight and i drive a 2024 BMW they have cut my boot stands from almost 4,000 a month down to eighty eight dollars a month they are telling me if i want a review that i have to sell my car so you're telling me if you were on welfare boot stamps cash assistance section eight you can't drive a nice car they are forcing me to sell my brand new BMW or i lose almost four thousand dollars in boot teams now only that they have taken my cash assistance totally away they are telling me that section eight will no longer be paying in 95 percent of my rent only ten percent of my rent so i will have to pay a little over four hundred dollars a month now instead of sixty dollars they cannot and looks like the doge got youtube bro that's the problem that i'm talking about okay remember when we talked about a minute ago about people gaming the system that that is a culture there's there is there is millions of people that understand how to do what she's talking about is that real oh bro it's absolutely real look dude it's up 60 bucks for rent oh fuck yeah four thousand dollars in food stamps it's absolutely real bro that we're paying for man and that fucking little piece of white trash thinks that she is entitled to drive a brand new BMW you're a food stamps dude this is the this is what i'm talking about these people they will not be able to adjust to to this so like what what's gonna happen to them you see what i'm saying i mean listen i mean welcome the reality i have zero empathy i don't either you know like like and i'll be real well motherfucker we've been paying for that that's the reason why 50 to 70 percent of our fucking money and everybody's like who's told it what about all the tax that you pay outside your income tax genius okay there's lots of other taxes what we're paying more than half our money to the government so people like that can drive a brand new BMW and pay 60 bucks for her rent and have four thousand dollars with the food stamps i would like to pay four thousand dollars worth of fucking how many kids does this person probably got a lot yeah like 17 I mean i'll say this well like and i and i can say this like if i was BMW broad repo that shit just for the brand association like what that two plus one driving my car they can't even fit them in the kid huh they can't even fit them in the kids in it uh but not i mean dude like listen i grew up on on food stamps right like i i live in the section a department you know growing up right but like we needed it that dude i'm not saying there's not any one is an important distinction like like yeah there are people in the store i know a lot of people who at times in their lives have relied on on assistance i get it and i think everybody in america understands that yeah for sure like i think everybody who works says okay there's times where i haven't been able to get by all right and yes that's a very it is something that i think out of the purpose of civility and having a good society like i said we take care of people right okay but there needs to be real limits for sure bro it's not meant to be this permanent crunch no there should be a certain amount of months out of your life that you qualify for it you should have to pass drug tests you shouldn't be able to buy certain things with it like there should be a more stringent uh you know enforcement of of us of standards when it comes to how this is well first yeah because people abuse it too much and like if you think she's not doing drugs and drinking every day she has to do shit and she's driving a brand new BMW you can money off tiktok it's like i mean where's the you're supposed to be struggling you know i'm saying it's like what do you do it you know but like i mean that's why i asked if it was real because it could somebody be it's real it's somebody that fucking stupid again on tiktok and say that oh yeah oh yeah bro it happens all the time do like a night i've never you know i used to i remember and like you know it is what it is i've i've seen people like i mean even now shit like we're not when we live downtown bro go to grocery store and you see in these fucking people come in and like you know this was 2021 even and people are still doing it like they're loading up their fucking carts with crab legs and fucking you know and then swiping that fucking blue card i would like a blue seat you know i'm saying i'm gonna see true not true that is a culture that is taught i'm for sure it's in learned this family teaches that family this friend teaches that friend and then they all figure out how to game the system for sure a true or not true that's absolutely okay i wasn't taught that yeah growing up you know what i was taught if you want shit you better fucking work yeah and that is two distinct cultural uh ways of thinking that we have to mesh into the the main one which is bro yes this is america the land of opportunity you could do anything you want what you have to do it and it's going to be hard and you're going to have to put in time and effort now i will say our tax system and our financial system has become so oppressive that it makes it very difficult to do that should be much easier to do that and it would be if people like that woman weren't just straight up fucking the rest of us stealing dude it's theft yeah i'm sorry it's theft it is um you know and uh but you know so i mean it's stuff like that that i'm gonna get this lady i've got her name but she's got a fucking great account it's funny it's funny yeah um you know but it's it's stuff like that you know and like you know to your point it's it's the propaganda that you know they they they they they're gonna get on you for even trying to call it out or expose it um or maybe just you know fun fun things to uh to to actively socially engineer um the the consumers yeah you know this this how long this is a thing that came out Thomas Thompson Reuters a far left propaganda on receives funding from the US Department of Defense for active social engineering defense large scale social deception that's right nine million bucks not many that's just a tip of it dude there was a bunch of organizations that this is all going to come out bro it's it's it's there if you dig into it but it's all gonna come out more and more and more they did this with COVID mm-hmm worldwide globally so you want to know who was who paid for fucking COVID bullshit you and me paid for it and then but you know to fit it wrap up this headline or the section i should say DJ why should we be having any social engineering at all we should i mean that sounds like some guinea pig yeah you know so so we pay taxes to be experimented on socially right for the and we pay for it for the benefit of other people to make money what does that sound like to you sounds like a trees into me yeah it sounds like tyranny for sure the mission yeah and and uh you know it was the greatest wealth transfer in the history of fucking mankind all think about all the restaurants and small businesses and 68% of small businesses are done well i i i don't know is that true yeah i mean that's a lot my close to what my point is is that these people used our money to create an operation then end up closing a number of small businesses at least temporarily and shoveling trillions of fucking dollars into their businesses it's insane dude it's insane and it is the epitome of evil because it's not just greedy it's extremely damaging to everybody that's not part of their game dude it's just fucked up shit man it's super fucked up now to wrap up this first section i want to bring this in because i now waited on this to make sure that you know i had you know we crossed our teeth and died out of our eyes and it's a legit thing um we're gonna start with here uh trump confirms doge will audit IRS all right um so just yesterday uh the day before the show was recorded uh president donald trump confirmed that the department of government efficiency would be auditing the internal revenue service after it was reported that dodge staffer doge staffers uh we're going into the headquarters of the agency earlier this week during the press conference in the oval office trump was asked about their presence at the IRS building and if uh the agency would be closed let's check see what he had to say was the first day the doge workers arrived today gavin clagger and others arrived today at the IRS do you expect to close the IRS or what are you expecting no i don't expect to put but i think so i think that the internal revenue service will be looked at like everybody it's just about everybody's gonna be looked at so it's uh they're doing a hell of a job it's an amazing job they're doing and you know that force is building these i call it the force of super geniuses but it's building and you know they go up and they talk to some of the people about certain deals and the people get all tongue tied they can't talk because these people get it they're very smart people we need smart people when he said they're doing a great job he was referring to musk and doge correct not the IRS yeah um but yeah so i mean they're in there they they've arrived at the IRS and uh they are starting to peel back some stuff that i mean i get us i d that was the start and that was one percent we got a lot more to get through um but i want to bring this in again like i wanted to make sure t's were crossed eyes or i you know the eyes were dotted i want to introduce you guys to hr 25 fair tax act of 2025 this is a brand new bill that has just been introduced um you want to read the headline to promote freedom fairness and economic opportunity by repealing income tax and other taxes abolishing the IRS and enacting a national sales tax to be administered primarily by the states and it's got a bunch of co authors yeah bunch of co authors um and it's it's in there uh subtitle a of the internal revenue code of 1986 relating to income taxes self-employment taxes is going to be repealed uh payroll taxes will be repealed a state and give taxes will be repealed i mean it's laying out quite a bit of stuff in this they should be should be it all should be um now of course this is just a bill is just getting started it has to be voted on and stuff like that um and then goes to the president for for approval but with how fast that Trump's moving there's a high chance that this thing is going to get pushed through pretty quickly i mean well look uh he they're gonna have to and i'll tell you why because there there there's going to be short term pain because of the tariffs okay the tariffs are going to go in there's going to be products that are not made in america there's still going to be bought by consumers here which the price is going to go up that's going to create a situation where some prices go up and he's going to have to answer for that his answer for that is to eliminate the tax on the bottom that's what balances it out correct so and then after the tariffs and everything gets settled because what'll happen is over time the united states will either make those products here and we support those companies that make those products here or they will figure out how to get a zero percent tariff because they won't you know we will use our leverage against theirs right so there's there's going to be a transition period so when you say it has to happen very quick it does if he's good play if he plans on doing what he says with the tariffs it has to happen quick yeah yeah so i mean we could be weeks weeks away could be yeah you know i'm saying because i'm like and i'm not an attorney all these guys should need to be that bro no it shouldn't listen we should get for what is happening with the fraud and the way that money has been stolen we should never pay tax again at least the people who have been paying tax in our lifetime in our lifetime yeah we should get some sort of refund back for the last 15 or 20 years of what we've put in yeah because it was clearly stolen so that's how you take all of those people that were still in that money you seize all of their financial assets and dump it back in the pool redistribute it 100 percent distribute the wealth yeah 100 percent which is what they're crying for last year distribute the wealth in the last 20 years you know make them pay their fair share that's right yeah guys jumping on this conversation that's what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's go cruise some of these quickly we got some good comments down in the chat this first one comes from Liz shy okay you know part of me kind of wanted to put this you know make this this that might be racist but we'll see we'll take a look Liz shy says shut up bro they're just proud of their roots people that help build this country sorry friends but I don't want to cut yards or clean toilets they're not taking our jobs they're doing what we don't do time out the immigrants hmm so about the immigrants so you're asking me is it racist or not is that racist so you guys tell me that's pretty racist fuck bro they're so explicit with it dude they don't understand they're so dumb they don't even understand racist they are so inherent yeah leave them alone let them pick our fruits I don't want to do that shit oh fuck all right Liz all right shit dude it's hot out there oh man this next comment comes from at Marvin soldier uh 6884 he says people out here in Canada are really scared of becoming the 51st state I live in Quebec where 90% of people speak primarily French and my neighbor she started learning English and listening to American TV shows is getting funny out there you know what that's cool you guys just still speak French they do that shit down New Orleans a little bit yeah a little Creole I mean I don't think Canada has much of a choice I really don't like and I think I think most Canadians when they stop and think about it you know they're proud of their culture Canadians are proud people which they should be I can't it's an awesome place but there's also people like you know they kind of they kind of would be like a Texas you know how Texas is like its own thing kind of its own thing yeah like you go to Texas it has Texas culture you know right like you go to Florida they got Florida culture just I have to be Kyle Puncher holes in drywall this fucking monster and you're gonna crack it off yes yeah all right you go to California they got it's like the real thing nobody wants to go there anymore but but Canada you guys have a beautiful culture bro you could be the biggest state that's fucking cool bigger than Alaska probably the most beautiful state that's pretty cool you know I don't know what else is cool yeah maple syrup yeah you guys syrup pretty good like dude I think the people are nice they're they're courteous they're common sense people for the most part they're very passive which is why they've allowed themselves to get into this situation um you guys I mean I think it's a good thing probably if America conquer this fucking game in 2025 it's not conquering it's got oh that'd be conquering bro no I think the only people they don't want to do it are like legitimately like the people that are also still in from them yes like bro you don't think that the people in Canada are looking down here right now for the most part and be like fuck I don't look that bad this is awesome it's awesome hey keep more of our money yeah yeah bro they can they see they get tax pretty much running commercials uh like national commercials about we're your neighbor to the north and we love you and we're you're gonna love us back did you see them right yeah they just started coming on yeah and they're like we've always been here for you we're all we always will be no matter what happens it actually is like that it's like the uncertainty in the world like now yeah right bro listen nobody's trying to fuck you guys up like we're trying to create an alliance yeah will be cool yeah all right we'll see we'll see what happens um we got one final comment from you uh or for you this is from uh at Kyle I see him 1991 he says uh you said it three years ago damn near to the date I'm quote if you're someone who wants to win now is the time to put your foot on the gas because the pendulum will swing back so fucking glad I'll listen to you back then dude dude remember everybody who was pro america before it was cool to be pro america I told you guys this is gonna happen I told you when he was gonna come back in style natural order was gonna come back pro america companies were gonna come back the pride in this flag in this country was gonna come back patriotic Americans to come back and guess where we are and everybody said dude no way blah blah blah it's not gonna happen hope what's going on well you know here we are so you know and I'm happy that we're here but it does seem like a lot of people have forgotten a lot of the people who were there before everybody else you know what I mean for over school yeah like I see you know and but that's just the that's the product of you know not kissing the rings yeah you know 100 percent I don't I'm just here to report what I see yeah guys we appreciate you for being real ass fans uh with that being said we are we are the first fucking people that were saying that period no doubt years ahead of everybody else no doubt so yeah let's keep this cruise movement we got headline number two uh we'll keep this cruise moving now let's talk about international we what's happening hey we don't have to hurry through it Saturday man what else they got to do that's true we got time yeah all right um you guys just gonna fuck off anyway right might as well fuck off with us yeah right it's true it's true I want my night city for you guys yeah me too yeah I actually got this from you actually it looks good it's like 101 baby yeah that's 101 that is 101 I told you but that but I thought I was playing it now it's 101 I'm sorry I had to kind of hard didn't I just birthday it is right there so that's just one yeah it's just birthday mister lover 36 more how are you 31 I am that's young yeah that's old to you I mean he's my ancient how are you all right we got a bunch we got a bunch of adults I got my dirty 30 this year no shit you yeah 30 30 all right yeah where you let's go to Vegas no no no no come on man we can we redo the NASCAR scene no I can't I can't do Vegas bro yeah not anymore no no fuck no fuck no way we gotta go somewhere not there okay all right we'll plan on it guys tell us where we should go not we let's we don't we can't go to awesome again I just not a little gay down there I like Vegas it's just it doesn't like me back got you but we recreate the hangover down there that'd be great yeah I'm not number two guys have not up to let hell break out Trump demands Hamas free all hostages by Saturday noon or deals off and Israel can fight so this is a little you know to your appointment I think a lot of this stuff is very strategic and I think it's more like it's the threat that makes people move right are we saw this with tariffs on Canada and Mexico right like 25% you know tariffs on Mexico then all of a sudden we got Mexico actually pulling apart and doing what they're supposed to be doing preventing this fucking invasion so with Canada same thing I think to your point it's it's the threat of action that creates you know exactly what he wants to happen is I mean it's it's well here look just like all these politicians for so many years have been fleecing the system that these same politicians and this is this is why it legitimately it should be treated as treason okay these people should either serve jail or be executed for what they've done because what they've done is not only steal our money and oppress our citizens for their own benefit they have also allowed other countries to take advantage of us off of our hard work and our tax dollars so that they can make more money the government is not a money-making operation for individuals these people should be there to serve they should be doing it really for free in my opinion it should be illegal to get a kickback or a any kind of gifts at all like we need people that want to serve the people and do the best for the people and I think we have one now that is just saying hey this fuckery is over broke you're not doing this anymore and these countries know how bad they've been screwing the Americans for a long time and so they fall right back in line right now you think they're you think they're not aware but they know they're fucking us yeah oh they know 100% I mean and if shit the last four years while the United States was declining everybody else was doing fucking great yeah because that's where all of a fucking shit was going yeah um yeah so we gave it ultimatum this was back on Monday of this week he gave an ultimatum to Hamas about these prisoner hostage exchanges and releases and Hamas said no all right well then Trump Trump set this well I would say this and I'm gonna let that because that's Israel's decision but as far as I'm concerned if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 o'clock I think it's an appropriate time I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out I'd say they ought to be returned by 12 o'clock on Saturday and if they're not returned all of them not in drips and drabs not two and one and three and four and two uh Saturday at 12 o'clock and after that I would say uh all hell is gonna break out yeah one it's a hard decision to make it is like I mean so they back down they back down yeah you know and they agree to resume the releasing of not just Israeli hostages there are some Americans over there as well and then they they've you know I have since resumed their releases so you got that going on other things happening I mean you got anything else on the on the like I think I just think that's I think that's a big balls move like you know like you know that's a difficult decision that a leader has to make you know hey if you fuckers don't give us everybody back we're gonna take care of business but in that taking care of business it probably means those hostages aren't gonna make it either you know right so it's it's a loose-lose situation for everybody um but you know at the end of the day people look out for themselves and if I think that these guys are smart enough to understand it will be scorched earth if they don't do what Trump says whether you agree or don't agree whatever whichever side you think you support 100% or didn't he sent he sent uh one of the fucking guys of ISIS he sent them like a picture of his house oh yeah you know what I mean listen he's notorious for doing shit like that you know um but you got that going on other things you know we talked about you played around with candid a little bit right um there's you know we also had some talks about you know Trump wants to get Greenland um well now uh they have countered his offer um have you seen this there's now a petition calling for Denmark to buy California and it secures more than 230,000 signatures let's trade yeah yeah I mean who really wants California the people in California don't even want California I mean can we can they just take the people like no we're gonna rest we're gonna mess up two beautiful places yeah I mean fuck I mean it's it's picking up a lot of steam bro California people uh think most California people think like we think too but they're systems are just so corrupt that they can't get ahead yeah that's what it is yeah yeah I mean uh they they put out a uh it's a real real petition has been then put out right now it's got 233,000 uh people sign up let's buy California from Trump Denmark's next big adventure uh saying let's I mean fuck dude Denmark Danish people are sweet yeah they're cool yeah so fucking they can come in and like they're a little more progressive I think they know how to handle these weirdos yeah you know I'm saying they'll do what they got to do they come over here to good looking people don't they have armpit here like the Denmark the women don't shave over there what I've heard he's talking about I heard that somewhere Denmark's like these people are beautiful people bro yeah but they don't shave like the women talk to them women don't shave that's not true that's not true where the fuck you get that online I'm gonna take it to California yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but yeah so that's going on um other international news happening uh Trump threatens a 100% tariff on dead bricks group if they play games with the dollar he's been hammering these guys out oh I mean we have the most leverage for the biggest consumers of all of their goods uh baller shit and so I mean I mean and and it's very interesting again like he puts out the threat when people get the fucking line that's exactly what happened check this clip up is the fast you have spoken against bricks India's bottle bricks oh stop do you want to dismantle when did you go to the White House bro you didn't record yesterday you know shit dude he's our White House press secretary all right yeah I got it I read for the show he's got our relay of credentials of the White House press pass yeah I was at seeing Trump good very orange but good yeah he could he couldn't understand a word you fucking said uh yeah yeah yeah yeah this is Trump's response on bricks the fast you have spoken against bricks India's bottle bricks do you want to dismantle bricks or you want to you want to be passed yeah but bricks is was put there for a bad purpose and uh most of those people don't want they don't even want to talk about it now they're afraid to talk about it because I told them if if they want to play games with the dollar then they're going to be hit with a 100 percent tariff the day they mentioned that they want to do it and they will come back and say we beg you we beg you not to do this bricks is dead since I mentioned that bricks died the minute I mentioned that and I know I remember what Obama and Biden in particular I guess he said that oh they have us over a barrel they don't have us over a barrel we have them over a barrel in bricks for the play games those countries won't trade with us we won't trade with them and if any trading gets through it'll be a hundred percent tariff at least on your account you know what when they hear that what do you think they're going to do they're going to say look what happened to bricks they didn't want to talk about they don't they don't even want to admit that they were a member of bricks that's what's happened dude he's first of all this just shows you how bad the treasonous acts of the Biden administration were they were getting paid and this will come out it's what I've been saying for four years now they were getting paid money under the table and it wasn't just 19 20 million dollars we're going to find out it was hundreds of millions of dollars if not billions and billions of dollars we just haven't found it yet you know and this is all speculation by the way and but I'm right okay those motherfuckers were taking money to hand our economy over so a planner yes to these bricks nations a hundred percent and we're gonna find out dude yeah I mean well the best thing a Trump could do now like real talk the best thing he could do is start building fucking gallows legitimately building gallows because everybody will come out and tell the truth oh fuck yeah bro he starts fucking shopping steaks on the front bro bro I'm gonna tell you right now that we're me there'd be dudes out there right now with hammers and nails put together gallows and I would be telling them well the people who don't come clean this is what we're gonna do with them oh fuck and everybody will come out and tell the truth and there would be 10 or 12 main characters that would have to eat the shit and it is what it is you make an example out of them yeah fuck well yeah and then we since I had it and he tried to ask a question this is how that turned out do you think that should continue here in the US as well you're gonna have to go louder mr. president people in that would be welcoming your decision to exercise the hubbubana to I can't understand the word you say bro he ain't lying cuz you understand sorry I could you understand no dude I'll tell you what man the more I'm starting to like this dude way more yes dude like way way way more what did you see so I mean that he's standing right next to the prime minister I still gonna call him out and he does goofy shit you know if he but like dude it's so cool watching someone who is a competent leader lead lead like it like we watched a bunch of fucking morons like imbosils for the last four years like think Kamala Harris bro oh fuck and then compare her to what we see from JD Vance right now think Biden didn't even answer one fucking question himself for four years okay he went through oop aloopa and all these other people and this dude will answer anything anywhere anytime off his head he knows the data he knows the stats he knows what's going like it's just so it's refreshing dude it's refreshing yeah and whether you agree with everything he says or not it's just awesome to have a leader yeah for sure I mean again he's using the threat of our leverage and our strength as a country the little that we do have left it's still fucking a lot left they just made us think that we didn't it's true but he's standing right there next to the prime minister of india prime minister moody and I just thought this was funny because again you threatened the brick stuff 100% tariffs and then India was it on it yeah they were yeah I mean they're the eye yeah right and you see how they react to real leadership when there's a real competent leader in office check this clip out are going an expression from america our vision for a developed india is to make india great again or mega what did you say when america and india work together that is when maga when it's maga plus mega it becomes mega mega mega partnership ha ha ha ha it does make earth green again we're gonna have some magazines in this mall you know what I'm saying we are good low you know well they should let me come translate then shit bro I fucking kill it that's great bro you know what I think it's great it's great do you guys like this guy moody oh yeah really is it cool really really it seems like it oh yeah and india doesn't have the rule that america has that you're gonna only have two turn limits for a president I think he has been the prime minister for the last 12 years or so and people like him he's popular like him with the big majority and he's pretty funny too as it seems like a good dude he's pretty fun like a smart grandpa oh yeah yeah yeah yeah other little last international news so jadey vans you just brought him up actually he's been killing it as VP he's on his world tour right now going and getting shit in line he went over to munic in germany and there is a global security conference going on now the date this conference is happening today they're a munic in munic units of my favorite cities yeah and it's happening right now as we speak I believe they're probably finishing up right now but just yesterday dude I don't know if you saw this yesterday there was a mass another mass terrorist attack in germany in munic in munic a car driver in munic plows into crowd a day before vans and world leaders gather for security conference at least 28 people including children were injured when the car drove through they found the guy he was an afghan asylum seeker 24 year old oh you mean like the motherfuckers do that shit here exactly exactly but the they have this of the conference still goes on I thought they probably would have shut it down I postponed it delayed it but no I went on and jadey vans got in there bro and he's fucking ruling the stage over there ruling it he's a stud dude dude he's awesome he's awesome and he's literally calling everybody out on their bullshit and gave about a 15 20 minute speech part of that you know he said quote the threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia it's not china it's not another external actor he said in the dress at the munic security conference he says quote for years we've been told that everything we fund and support is in the name of our shared democratic values everything from our Ukraine policy to digital censorship is built as a defense of democracy but when we see european courts canceling elections and senior officials threatening to cancel others we ought to ask whether we're holding ourselves to an appropriately high standard check this clip out and I believe deeply that there is no security if you are afraid of the voices the opinions and the conscience that guide your very own people europe faces many challenges but the crisis this continent faces right now the crisis I believe we all face together is one of our own making if you're running in fear of your own voters there is nothing America can do for you nor for that matter is there anything that you can do for the American people who elected me and elected president trump you need democratic mandates to accomplish anything of value in the coming years have we learned nothing that thin mandates produce unstable results but there is so much of value that can be accomplished with the kind of democratic mandate that I think will come from being more responsive to the voices of your citizens if you're going to enjoy competitive economies if you're going to enjoy affordable energy and secure supply chains then you need mandates to govern because you have to make difficult choices to enjoy all of these things and of course we know that very well in America you cannot win a democratic mandate by censoring your opponents or putting them in jail whether that's the leader of the opposition a humble Christian fraying in her own home or a journalist trying to report the news nor can you win one by disregarding your basic electorate on questions like who gets to be a part of our shared society before you comment anything on that I just want to point out to you earlier point how coherent well put such a nice gentleman image is not stuttering not making stupid word puzzles yeah presents such a nice image of America to everybody else I totally agree dude it's no different than building a brand how how you represent yourself is going to be what people perceive I agree dude like it's it's night and day it's it's it's opposite ends of the of the spectrum no pun intended one of the yeah no shit no shit one of the things I used to be really getting pissed at was when my friends back home used to make fun of America as a whole because of Joe Biden and Kamala yeah well I mean it's pretty easy to make fun of them it's we make fun of them too exactly yeah and I think that that's the image of America exactly they think everybody in America is like that because our leaders represent us of course so when this happens it makes me happy as a naturalized citizen that we are representing a strong image of the country and you're not speaking like a second grader yeah dude well remember there's an intentional reason they did that right they had to make the rest of the world believe that our country was a bunch of imbosol dumbasses in order for them to get what they were trying to do which was basically the conquering of America culturally and eventually you know actually physically yeah so so dude what Vance is saying here is very important because what he's saying without saying it is hey you motherfuckers we're not going to work with you we're not going to support you we're not giving you anything until you stop this coming as shit that's what the fuck is that I took from it bro yeah he's put them on notice yes that's what he said in a very professional way which I could host to him yeah I can't say things that way and apparently Trump can't either we just start a really eff translation of all this speech is easier to understand yeah well I mean that's what he's saying he's saying very stern very confidently like look uh we're not with the shit we know what you guys were doing Trump said it when he was talking about bricks the reason that he said bricks was formed for evil reason that nobody wants to talk about and what he's talking about there is making America a communist country that was on the same level global in the globalist sphere as all the other third world second world places that you know exist in this country are in the world so when we think about like what they these two are actually saying as they're putting the world on notice like hey we know the deal see the Americans listen the American citizen on average has been made to struggle so hard that they it's impossible for them to keep up with what's actually happening in the news okay in government geopolitical you know situations that that's intentional okay they know that if they keep us fighting they keep us arguing over race they keep us arguing over gender they keep us arguing over sexuality they keep us financially oppressed they know that they can get away handing our country over to everybody else that enriches themselves they don't give a shit the people who are representing the last administration are the opposite of patriotic Americans they are self serving they are greedy they have no qualms about oppressing their fellow citizens at all and making their lives harder for them to have a better life okay in my opinion that deserves that sentence punishment for real because these people take a oath to serve and part of the privilege of that oath is to be in control of our financial resources and the decisions that are made in the interests of the American person and when you go in there and you make decisions that are the opposite meaning you sold us out down the river that is treason all right and I'm hoping that this job gets finished because like I say people don't stop things until there is harsh accountability for those things if they happen again and you know it's nice to see him professionally articulate what we've been saying for a long time which is you know the shit needs to stop yeah I'm glad to know but see here's the thing the other thing he said brother is that we fund this if you noticed he said at the very beginning of first sense we fund these things that are supposed to do these things for the good of all of us and we are not funding those things and what we are funding that we've just started to find out through doge is a framework of media that comes from through proxy like George Soros right the USAID gives his organization x $260 million dollars he spends at $260 million on destabilizing through cultural destabilization demolization through the media right but then there's a whole bunch of people that do that and that's global so they're getting money from our government to propagate a message that has allowed mass migration that has allowed the deterioration of family values of Christianity of really anything other than you know straight up anarchy everything goes vi-mar republic shit from the 1930s Germany which is communist all right so he's basically saying very simply fuck you commies come get some and you ain't getting shit from us ever again until you stop this crazy shit yeah 100% man yeah this this could i'm just i think not but it could depending on how aggressive the european people are going to be uh to reject the the communist ideals right i don't know where they are you know like i know some people that live in europe and they're like yeah dude you know they're very liberal because they don't really have a democracy per se yeah but do these people are tax like crazy yeah it's just they're like 10 years down the road and it makes me wonder like do the european people still have it in them to even want anything else and that's going to be a situation too so i don't know man it's going to be interesting to see uh but i appreciate just like you said z-shon that we have strong leadership that is least going to stand up for us yeah 100% man guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think uh with that being so let's get to our third and final headline we got headlined number three um you know it is valentine's day technically it was yesterday technically what i mean today i'm here with you now yeah and what will you will you be my uh will you be mine no okay but the white house tried it too uh white house trolls illegal migrants with valentine's day card featuring trump and homie roses are red violets are blue come here illegally and we'll deport you the white house posted that from the white house all right so now we're getting we're getting somewhere dude we're getting somewhere they probably saw your post and copied it that's what it was my bad they do it first you know it wasn't they usually do things after i say they should do that yep fix DJ's credit yeah why don't you guys here's what i want this is what i want next okay since i know you know you guys down there you're listening they look all good here's what we want next though i represent the people now here all right this is what the people want they want their debt white clean credit card debt bank debt all right these motherfucking bankers have been fucking with us for 70 80 years 100 years okay always we bail them out all the time we bail them out and when we get a bailout it's seven hundred dollars you know for crisis management and wildfires or hurricanes it's bullshit all right how about this how about to re if we're going to reset everything let's reset the debt how about people get get a break on their mortgages and break on their fucking credit cards and the debt gets wiped from these banks and then we can use more debt okay we can start it over but now we're in a situation where you're gonna have a booming economy and you're gonna like how about this fuck the banks this time instead of the people i like that i like that and i like that let me know we'll see i'm on board that uh but yeah a lot of that probably give me shot and all the shit i say that's the one to get me really shot yeah but i don't care like dude it's real bro bro no shit all the time the people get fucked and these banks just get more and more and more and more every time that there should be a correction or at least don't we know because they they take our money and they fucking lose it and they get more of our money just a different way listen dude this is debt enslavement it's intentional it if we're gonna have freedom we need a we need a new system dude we're like real talk i hope that Trump can do this peacefully but at the end of the day dude we need no tax we need to be subsidizing the revenue in many different ways other than income tax the people have been indebted for a hundred years all right that needs to be clean too and then we'll talk then when that situation happens we're true financial freedom happens in this country we we'll see a boom of all booms in terms of like when he talks about the golden age you want a real golden age eliminating income tax and people's debt see what the fuck happens yeah yeah but on this talk about migrants we got to check in with it there's a lot has been happening let's go up to New York first you got borders are time homin meets with blue city leader for crackdown on criminal aliens so time homin just met with air guy air Adams mayor from New York City to discuss collaboration between federal authorities and the NYPD and cracking down on known criminal aliens in the big apple especially members of Venezuela's trend air agua source soul fox news the visit comes shortly after federal authorities dropped a corruption case against Adams kicked off under the Biden Harris administration which the mayor had alleged was political retaliation for his opposition to an open border policy they sent hundreds of thousands of illegals to New York Adams has denied breaking the law and met with Trump at Mar-a-Loggo last month so they met together tried to come up with some type of plan to to work together right now but here's the thing okay and you know he's saying that now he's willing to cooperate with ice on civil enforcement but everybody's pounced on him now everybody I mean it's a full-scale media attack to the point you got governor Kathy Hawkeye doesn't rule out removing Eric Adams from office trying to say that this is a quid pro quo deal going on between the Trump administration and Eric Adams so she just made a statement last night saying that she wouldn't they wouldn't rule out removing Eric Adams from office after these allegations emerged that the feds would drop their criminal case against Adams in exchange for him helping president trump crackdown on legal immigration and they used a video from an interview that the two did on Fox News check this clip if he doesn't come through I'll be back in your city and we will be sitting on the couch I'll be in his office up his butt saying where the hell is the agreement we came to so that right there they're saying that's the evidence for quid pro quo all right now left's pretty racist they're racist yes I want you to I want to show you this picture if you guys are listening to audio you got to come see this picture on YouTube a white liberal care and put this out are you serious I love how these these these these upper racist middle upper middle class white brunchers think it's okay to like they talk about being anti racist and being an ally and all the shit but as soon as a black person doesn't agree with them they're they they're full racist barrage comes out bro yeah yeah so not just new I will come back to New York in a second but let's go down to Dallas real quick did you see this Dallas police won't join ice deportation rates in terms of chief tells immigrant meetings the Dallas police department all right dpd has begun hosting a series of outreach meetings to inform immigrant communities that the agency will not take part in any deportation rates or arrests currently being carried out by the Trump administration at least five meetings are taking place now with the first kicking off on Wednesday and the remainder running through February 20th according to the dpd Facebook page on Wednesday the interim chief Michael I go attempted to massage fears running through local immigrant communities that the force will assist in immigration and customs enforcement and its deportation efforts which have ramped up under the Trump administration quote the Dallas police department is not assisting any federal agency on detaining people that are either documented or undocumented in the city of Dallas I go said to attendees that familiar about the inter national nassio not nassio nassio now church in Dallas per CBS news ego who has been interim chief of police in zottobar told the Spanish speaking parishioners that is department will not turn in or report anyone here illegally who calls 911 for help or is pulled over for traffic violations he says continues to say quote I need you guys to continue to call the police not be afraid to come out of your homes to go to work to send our kids to school said uh you go you also put out a tweet um yesterday saying quote there's no room for fear in our community I am meeting with stakeholders across Dallas to reassure them that we're here to serve and protect all Dallas residents and are committed to enforcing city ordinances and state laws um okay okay well I mean first of all just because you're not assisting federal agencies doesn't mean that it will happen that's the first thing um but you know I think like anything there's nuance to everything and um you know when we think about like Dallas and Houston and you know Arizona and New Mexico you know there's lots of illegal people from Mexico who who have been coming here for years or or families live here there's probably a lot of police officers on that department have members of their family living here you know undocumented or illegally so personally I have always felt that Mexico and America you know it was kind of an unspoken deal we're like you know people know that there's a lot of Mexican people living here but the Mexican people don't come here and start a much shit right right so it's a it's a delicate situation because I don't think many people really want our Mexican friends kicked out how they're cool I think people don't want these these uh military age males that came here at the number of 15 to 20 million over the last four years yeah so and from what I've understood and when I've been told they are targeting those people right um bad ones yes yeah so so like dude you know and and dude if you think about how how fearful it would be to be someone who uh was from Mexico and maybe didn't have proper papers but it's been living here and contributing and being a good citizen for 20 years what do you do with those people yeah and how do you handle that and so you know I think as you get further south where family members have been you know there's lots of police officers that have family members that aren't here you know what I mean there's fucking family bro I think there's going to be more resistance in those agencies to do these things yeah and so I think you know maybe maybe there needs to be some more clarity on who we're going after and what we're doing and not just straight up hey everybody who's not here you know you can't just turn the lights on my guy everybody out yeah yeah it's and plus dude you gotta think about what that would do to the economy you know well you know so there there's nuance here and I'm not sure where the line is I don't have the answer but there is a line and I probably believe and you know I'm sure there's some people on the Dallas Police Department that disagree with this sure there's some that agree with it yeah so I think it's just a the further south you get it's more of a nuanced situation because a lot of these people have been really good to America and they've been contributing citizens and they're friendly and they're fun and they bring good culture that we all enjoy and so you know what where's the line yeah and I think that's an important question I think that I mean how do you guys feel about that being like when you talk about you know people who have been here for a long time you know who contribute yeah well man on top of that to like had our immigration system you know not be filled with bureaucracy and take seven eight ten years maybe a lot of people have come to the process right like I mean you know there there's an argument for sure to be made there right well unfortunately I think the way that I see this going because I mean ultimately you gotta remember this too a lot of you know especially these big agencies they get a lot of their funding from the government from the federal government right and so I mean you can't you can say okay yeah we're not helping but guess what the federal government could also say okay well you know that grant that we just gave your police department you know yeah okay that's getting cool yeah well that's all good what they'll do that's what they'll that that's gonna be the you know I see that being a very easy you know I'm saying so again like we have to make sure one we're being very very clear on who we're going after I don't care that you know Jose is going to see his his abuela cool I want you know wine or fucking the dudes from Haiti or whoever wherever they're trying to eat our fun cats that are that are ruining American life yes 100% if that's who we're going after let's get them out yeah I think everybody agrees with that no empathy yeah they gotta go they gotta go but we do we do need to have a conversation on okay well like I mean what do we do with the people who have been here for years who have been contributed I don't even think they're looking at both of us have friends like that yeah they're not even look but like that that those conversations that bridge we're not even at that point yet because we're still trying to get the people who are when I'm actually destroying this when I'm when I say fucking to port him I'm not talking about that's about a row I'm not talking about the guys who have been here contributing who have jobs and create and do good things and don't fuck with people I'm talking about people that have come here for nefarious reasons and there's a lot of them there's a lot you know you don't come here you know with just yourself and no kids and no family in this and say oh I'm seeking asylum yeah no no that we gotta get those people out for sure I think anybody who's come over in the last five six years you know gone yeah I mean that's a good yeah for sure for sure like if you've been here past that okay we can talk we have a special program for you to expect your citizenship right you know what I mean right right I think that'd be fair yeah I can be fair because then what you could do is like you know let's say do gets caught up right let's say in Dallas uh gag gets pulled over for speeding right speeding not a real crime oh you're not here legally how long have you been here well I've been here since 2010 what do you do this is what I do and as long as it's not harmful and he's you know not as a productive violent person or crime person or this or that so okay we got you now now you have to go complete this program or in this amount of time you gotta go yeah you see what I'm gonna be fake there's there's there's solutions here we just have to figure out what they are yeah I think when we get rid of all of this government race that that has been happening it'll be easier to do that for sure you know um because that that process does need to be fun but like bro like my my buddies who I know who have family that's not here legally which I know some they're great people they're people that I actually care about a lot and I they contribute to my life and people's lives in our community and but do the the media does not help with this though right because the media pushes the propaganda that like that's who they're going that that's not who they're going after right now that from what I understand I agree you know I'm saying but it's like you know but you're getting that every single day from CNN yeah I'd be so terrified to do we don't really know who they're getting and who they're not getting because as we just found out from USAID a lot of this news is fucking paid for by the government's propaganda and if we only think that that's paid for on one side I think that would be an ignorant assumption I think we have to understand that there is what you know there's always three sides to the story there's the right side the left side and in the middle side right and it's not two sides to a coin there's the edge too and that's where usually the truth is and so I don't know what's happening yeah and I don't think I don't I don't take the chief is like being a dick about this I don't think he's trying to calm very tensions yeah yeah well but I want to show I think if you were afraid to go to the store yeah you've been here for 15 years you've raised your kids here your kids are citizens and you're afraid to go to fucking grocery store because if you get caught you're gonna go back and lose your family right you see what I'm saying no that's what I get it I get it I just I don't believe that that's the case but there definitely needs to be more clarity around what's happening 100% there needs to get a there needs to be a program in place where those people cannot continue to exist here illegally and then there is a very clear line that is set in motion from this point on that says you either are you aren't right and that allows us to have a very clean policy when you're like yeah when you're like revival of the country bro now like I don't think you go you know I don't think he had any ego when he was doing this I don't think it was like a big dick move that he was trying to push or say fuck the government right it doesn't seem that way doesn't seem that way but I do want to go to somebody who I believe is doing that let's go to a OC yeah AOC's offices office advises my grints on how to avoid deportations and a live webinar she's gonna get arrested for this dude I'm gonna laugh dude I'm sharing tips like do not open your door um and guess we paid for it we did we're paying for it yeah we're paying for it um it was shit like this we paid for her whole campaign the the way that her campaign was structured she was receiving the funding from these organizations that USAID was paying so they went out and found this communist woman who believes all this crazy shit and they put her in office on your money and my money you see yeah and to me this is a little bit different she's insane dude dude this is different and then a chief say hey we're we're not gonna assist you ain't got to worry about getting put this is don't open your door yeah these are things you know I'm saying like like this is a little bit different this is insane hey don't listen to the caps when they tell you to get out of the car and put your hands up you know what happens in those situations never be people get fucking shot not good so when you're telling what she doesn't even think about this now like she's telling them to essentially put themselves in a very dangerous position they could get them killed yeah and then when they get killed she's gonna say look what ice is doing ice is killing those people right not not the the pamphlet from your life seminar right for my opinion bro anybody that gets killed she's responsible for that's on her hands you know and well homin had had a clap back on this I'm saying quote maybe AOC is going to be in trouble now and he acts the DOJ to consider if New York lawmaker is impede it to illegal alien crackdown and apparently allegedly I've not been able to confirm this but I believe he actually sent the DOJ all of this and then might there's a pitch and directly to Pam Bondy might be might be my recent charges or so we'll see but you know she clap back to it I'm AOC did in a tweet saying maybe quote maybe she's going to be in trouble now into which she said maybe he can learn to read the constitution would be a good place to start well you know first of all let her get arrested you know like these people you know like she had a fake arrest last time remember she let's get a real arrested yeah I just don't get to do some beauty ass on the ground I mean she's endangering people she's definitely impeding what is going on which is illegal I think it was very foolish of her to do and I think under these circumstances there's a very good chance that people aren't going to tolerate her shit anymore no not at all man not at all yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us go down in the comments what you guys think how that being said let's get me bro she's become a clown oh she's clowned herself the last I don't even believe she's been fairly elected I don't believe that the election system in New York or California are even legitimate at all I believe they are completely compromised I believe that most of the people in her district I believe do not like her yeah we've said we had a video where she got destroyed in her own meetings bro so how did they keep getting elected then and that was four years ago I know people do not like her bro the only people that like her are just hardcore you know bought in you know they're they're part of the team you know they're not they're not coming off of that so you know I mean this is another example of these people being allowed to do and say like how many people have we seen in the last week of from their side legitimately stand on podiums and call for violence and if we even suggested that we were put on a list and we we were arrested and FBI showed up in her house that was two months ago and now these people feel stuck listen we treat them the way they treat us and this shit of like because they've shown that when they get in power and they get control and they get any leverage they're willing to use it against American people how many people were put on this domestic terrorism list or no fly list to see Gabbert was on a fucking no fly list and now she's the director of national intelligence that's what I'm saying so dude like the I think these people are fucked basically and I think I think ALC's fuck too I think they're all fucked yeah and dude it's just telling on themselves of this bro no shit and the best thing they could do is shut the fuck up but they can't they can't help it's not even that smart no to do that dude and uh there's gonna be fun to watch it is it's fun be fun to watch it's fun to watch people get the karma that that they've created and uh you know you know I mean dude look I think about it like this like this is something that I that bothers me okay so we're paying taxes and USAIDs taking those taxes and then distributing them to different organizations some of which many of which have been used to propagate how many is propaganda gay propaganda trans propaganda do kids and now we have this is one thing that they've done but now we have all of these kids who were propagated on our tax dollars to have transitional surgeries and take hormones that are gonna have their lives completely ruined because of this and if you don't believe me you just go look at detransition removing and see about it okay there's lots and lots of these kids that are saying hey I was manipulated I was pushed I was I was told these things and these things just weren't true and now I cut off my breasts or I cut off my penis or you understand like these people's lives have been legitimately ruined by the propaganda that people like her push and we pay for it and that I don't I'm not okay paying for that I'm also not okay paying for marbles to get inserted into dogs rectums and then then be shocked so that we can find out what happens when the dog shits the marble out okay or all this other crazy shit that they've been doing like these people are evil as fuck we have an infestation of evil motherfuckers who have gotten into our system and done crazy shit with our money that we work hard for that they've steal and they steal it and say if you don't pay it you go to fucking jail but then we ask where it is and it's you you don't have a right to ask us where it is no we have every right to ask where it is and if you don't show us we're gonna put you on a fucking stake you know about that we're gonna put you on the list I'm just saying dude like there needs to be a revival of this kind of mentality to get this right real talk yeah because we have this chance to realign and revive America and put it into the common sense place I do believe that America should be great for all people I think you should feel safe if you are gay or if you are trans that's how you decide to live your life I think there you know it doesn't matter what race you are you guys should be everybody should be treating each other are the content of the character all the ideals of what this country supposed to be it should be it just hasn't been and we have a chance to create that and we the people need to be very loud and very aggressive and very insistent that those changes be made and people that have propagated this harmful shit should be dealt with the the companies that lied and stole our money and you know did cultural social engineering deception like we talked about earlier in the show yep those people should be hung okay because we've had our reality stolen from us we've had we've had our lives deliberately made harder both financially and culturally how many of these race situations would have been happening if people weren't being paid to propagate those things you see what I'm saying like dude we we have all this cultural animosity that's been going on for 20 years that is funded by our dollars that have been siphoned off by people that quite honestly wanted to destroy this country for their own benefit and and we need accountability and people need to understand you're not going to ever do that again I think this is the biggest story in the history of our country and maybe one of the biggest stories in the history of civilization because of where this would have went had they succeeded in creating what they wanted to do here in America and dude I it's got to be fixed and it's got to be people and to fix things people have to be held accountable yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said a final segment of the show you got thumbs up or dumb as fuckers we're bringing bring something in we talk about it to get one of those two options now mr. Andy I know that we have you know you have your opinions and your perspective on AI in the use of it I think you know I think I quote you know net negative overall potentially yeah there's some good use for it there it's very few and far between I want to bring this in okay this is artificial intelligence that brought historical figures back to life okay for those of you guys on audio come over to you to check this out thumbs up we're demonstrating we're AI and historical figures hello don't we see here coming to your patria infinite mango and grandma I'm gonna startle. And I'm gonna seam a man until I get satisfied. I can arrange a low. See, see, you don't see why. You can do a Tesla. And you will dog me around. King toy. That was a little bit of a hit. Do you see these adjustments? I think that's pretty cool. Wow, yeah. I think that's cool. I think there's a lot of cool things that it can do. But that doesn't require AI. People can program that. There's a cool AI page where, and I can't remember what it's called, but I just started following it. Where it shows people waking up in the morning and then it says, oh, you wake up as a blacksmith in the 1400s. Or you wake up as a gladiator. And I thought it was interesting. Somebody said it to me. I thought it was cool. Because when you watch this, because it looks real, it's pretty cool. It shows the person waking up and then it shows like their legs, right? And like, you can tell the top POV. Yes. Yes. And people don't understand, like when I watched it, the first thing that I thought was like, holy shit, like these were some tough motherfuckers. Like they're sleeping on the hay. They're sleeping right next to it. Like I think people have certainly lost, and even I'm guilty of it, lost perspective of how hard it has been to get to this point. And I thought that was cool about AI. And I think there is some cool applications for AI. Unfortunately, I don't think that, I don't know where it's going to go, dude. It makes me nervous. When we see AI, and then we see what's happening with robots, and this is like, you know, there's something the musk is doing that I don't necessarily agree with. Remember, like I said earlier, when we remove the purpose of human beings, they're automatically going to be depressed, anxious, have a lesser quality of life. So we have to remember these things, as we start to include these things. And we also have to remember that if AI becomes autonomous, we could see shit like the terminator. But things like this that are fun, I mean, it's cool. Yeah, but, you know, I think when you can throw a prompt into a search engine basically, and it can print you a research paper and fucking three seconds, we're going to have a problem. Because like, now we're going to have situations where people don't know how to spell or do math. There won't be any authenticity anymore. There definitely won't be authenticity. But your existence will become, and the guys who are about AI, they like to, they think this is okay. They say things like, well, it frees human beings to just think big and have big dreams. And then, hey, I do the work. Well, the problem is, is that you have to learn to think big. You don't just think big and dream big, and the way that you learn to think big and dream big is by understanding the parameters of what is potentially possible. So if you don't know how things actually work, spelling math, basic shit, then you really don't have the capacity to think about what's possible at all. So we have to go through an education process and not an indoctrination process, like school is now, an education process, literature, historical philosophy, math. These things create our ability to think and the way we have it now, what also creates the ability to think is having the time to think, being bored, right? Bored, right? Bored is something that we have lost because what do you do now when you're bored? You go right to your phone, right? And all the ideas and goals and dreams and things that I've thought of in my personal life did not come to me when I was scrolling on my cell phone. It came to me before that. Like all of the shit that you guys see that that I've been a part of, those were ideas pre-social media that have materialized. And what I get concerned with is that if we don't have people learning the basic skills for real and they're just good at prompting things, okay, well then how can they really think about anything if the rest of their time is consumed with social interaction on their cell phone? Right? Right? The problem is we need more people thinking big. Yeah, that's right. And their idea to sell AI is, well this will free up the thinkers to think, okay, one out of a million people has the idea to really dream big without the framework of what I just said. Most people can't think outside of a framework. That's why most people don't become ultra successful. Like Elon Musk, most people don't go home and say, I'm gonna go to fucking Mars. Or I'm gonna create an electric car company. Or I'm gonna create a payment system that's never exist. Elon has the ability to think out the box. But what do most people call them? They call them autistic. Or they call them, you know, they think something wrong with them. Because to them, there is something wrong with them because they can't do that. And most people can only think within a framework. So if we don't give them a framework to think within, what actually can they think of? Does that make sense? Makes perfect sense. So, dude, we have to fucking, we have to realize that these technologies, the internet, social media, AI, take away from the human experience as a whole. Really, they just remove it. And these are important discussions to be had. And then when you throw AI in, like I said, with robotics, who's to say that AI doesn't decide one day just like we see in the movies? Fuck, we don't need these motherfuckers anymore. They're just destroying the earth. And all of a sudden, now we gotta fight all these fucking robots that we made. I mean, bro, it's, you know, we could a little bit see some real weird shit, like human extermination in our life because of this technology. And, you know, it's gonna be interesting. Yeah. I mean, like, dude, the idea sounds great, right? Like, hey, man, we're all gonna get a fucking $20,000 robot do anything we want. And I think if you, I think if that were true right now, I think all of us would be like, that'd be fucking cool, right? Like, fuck, dude, this guy could do this and that and this and do all these things. But, you know, I want to hand some robot. I bet you want one of the big old shlong on it. Big old robot shlong. Bro, these robots would be banging your chicks, bro. Yeah. You know, they could fucking go as long as they want. Go forever. Right. We're gonna have problems. Yeah. I don't know if this is a good thing, man. Yeah, that's right. You're gonna come home for work. Wow, I got it. Come on. You're gonna come home with people, people, not you. People are gonna come home for work and they're fucking Tesla robots gonna be boning their chick. You're gonna be calling Elon, be like, you're on. What the fuck? And cuddles with no problems. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna have to think this one back. Yeah, bro. Yeah. All right. Well, historical figures. Historical figures. I mean, that's cool. That's pretty fucking cool. Well, you know, it would be really cool. And I think they have this at some places. But where the historical figures are actually like teaching the shit that they fucking did. Oh, yeah. That's cool. You know, that's a different way of learning. You know, and that's that's the argument for AI, right? Like, there's all kinds of new ways to learn and experience and use it. Where are the limits going to be? I guess it's the information there. You know, like the internet, in my opinion, was just let free to go. And it really fucked a lot of shit up, dude. People don't remember this because they're not old enough to remember it. But like, you know, there's a lot of companies that exist because they didn't have to pay tax on internet sales for the first 10, 15 years in business. Okay. And then you give a tax break where they don't have to collect sales tax. You're automatically giving them an 8 to 12% advantage on their margin, which means they can sell 8 to 12% cheaper than a brick and mortar store. And in the beginning, internet still to this day does not employ as many people that were employed at brick and mortar retail or brick and mortar stores across the country. So was that good for the people of America? Right. You know, you see more stores closing, right? It wasn't. It was terrible for it. And we've seen companies come out, i.e. Amazon's and these other big brands that have capitalized on that and become the biggest brands in the world. And now we're dealing with a mega monopoly where little or retailers who employ more people can't win. So is that good for America? Right. You see what I'm saying? So we, those are things that I've seen from the internet, you know, like social media, for example, you know, the fact that kids that are 12 years old or 10 years old, get bullied online by other kids and like shit in high school, like they give all the crazy shit that happened to you in high school. And now it's like public square shit on the internet. Dude, that's not cool. You know what I'm saying? Like it's really in a lot of ways robbed the youth from our human experience. And I just think that with AI, you know, instead of us making the same mistake again and just throwing it out there, I think there should be some real conversations about where the limits are. But then the problem becomes, well, what do these guys use it for? China is using it for this. Well, then we got to use it for that. And so then we end up in this, you know, so it's just a very, it's a very complicated issue in my opinion. Yeah, 100%. Man, 100%. I think Augustus was my favorite. I don't know why. Not for no gay shit. I'm just like being real. Yeah. Have you ever seen that thing where they compare Baron Trump to Alexander the Great on the coin? No. They show him a side profile and then Alexander the Great on the profile. No. Oh, he looks just like him, doesn't it? It's crazy. Yeah. Well, guys, that's what you guys think. Yeah. Guys, maybe it's all I got. All right, guys, that's your special Saturday edition. We've enjoyed our time together. Thank you very much. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. Yeah.
