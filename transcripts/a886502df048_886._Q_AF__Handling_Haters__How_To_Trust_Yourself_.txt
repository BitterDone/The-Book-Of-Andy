Hey, what's going on? How are you? I'm doing good. How are you? Good, man sitting here with your cousin I'm gonna just start this up. I'm just start this off. Okay, uh, you're probably screwed Because you're related to DJ. All right, so I don't know if I'll be able to help you but I'll do my best. Yeah. Yeah, we'll try So what can we help you with, dude? So uh My question was uh, how can I let uh, how can I not let what people say like My mind and it's sad like you just like feel like motivate me to like keep going. Okay. We're kind of stuff like what are you getting at? I really just forced like just like people talking in sports like You're always told not to like let it get to you, but sometimes it really does like in the game In the game outside of the game just all around what what's sport? Uh, baseball. Okay. So you guys talk a shit in baseball, huh? So all right, so here's the deal first of all Anybody that's played baseball knows that talking shit is a real art So my first suggestion would be to get really good at it Um, right. Yeah, but dude real that's a real that's a real question man and uh, you know lots of people struggle with this in all different areas of their life and Some people never get over dude the reality is is that most people Never do what they really want to do in life because they are afraid of what other people are gonna say and You're you're you're calling in and asking this question at a perfect time in your life because you're getting into a phase Where people aren't gonna be very nice all the time like it's gonna be hard and people are gonna be assholes And that's just reality of of the world and so You have to understand that A lot of times when we imagine these things these these things that people say to us Um, we're building them up in our own minds, okay? And I've done this before I'm not above this. This is something I've had to work on my whole life Um, and I'll tell you what I did and how I got over it, but First thing is to become a little more aware Are people and this is rhetorical for you just ask yourself Are people actually saying these things or am I Thinking they might say these things and because they might say these things I'm not doing what it is that I should or could or would be doing otherwise. So Right the first thing is to audit how bad it really is okay like like is this real or is this shit that I'm making up Secondly, and this and I'm reason I'm bringing this up is because most people struggle with that Most people do not have haters. They don't have people that's talked this shit They had one guy on the internet or one person in their family or you know a few people that they knew Say a couple you know out of pocket things and they've stuck to them because dude We don't like to hear these things bro. Like we don't it doesn't feel good and I don't care who you are like I never feels good and We have to understand that's just a part of life all right. There's people out there that are just fucking assholes Okay, so It does get worse, but but here's the thing it never is what we think it is It's like when we deal with people who are like oh man all these people talk of shit motherfucker They're not talking shit that you have one guy to set some shit. Yeah, everybody else thinks you're cool And you're torturing yourself over what this one person said or these two people said Your whole life and now it's costing you everything in the future you see what I'm saying So we got to be aware that that's that's why most people fail in life dude. It really is They are their own worst enemy. They imagine these things that people might say Which makes them ironically their own biggest hater all right, so That is a side and you should always remember this cult because most people lose in life because they can't get past that They don't see the reality of How bad it is now the second part is who gives a fuck okay? Who fucking cares You're gonna be dead one day. I'm gonna be dead one day all these guys are gonna be dead It doesn't fucking matter. I dude. I had so many people in my life talk so much shit to me About my business in the early days when I was broke and I was living in the back of my store And I we couldn't get anywhere things weren't happening. I had so many people bro tell me You know, hey man, uh, you know when you're gonna stop messing around that with that little store and get a real job When you when you're gonna start taking life serious? Hey, do you still got that little vitamin shop? You know like I had that shit for years dude and The truth of the matter is is like now. I'm like holy shit, bro I'm so thankful that I did not listen to any of them Okay, cuz now look right you know what I'm saying like dude. I have achieved You know more. I mean I ain't stopping. I'm just getting started But the reality is I've achieved more than I ever thought I would achieve and I'm only 40 45 years old Okay, so So and that comes from not listening to these motherfuckers to say this shit to you dude. So like you It's third another point to think about is a lot of these people aren't on the same path. They don't want what you want So their opinions are fucking irrelevant um But to answer your question all right the way I've gotten through this It is just and it you know a lot of people don't get this but Every championship person I know understands this You take what they say and you fucking use it You take what they say and when it makes you mad You automatically go do something to get better all right. So for you in baseball what position you play Uh second base okay, so Every time you think about what these motherfuckers said You go out and you start taking ground balls or you go out and you do your hitting Are you go out and do something that is going to move you forward And that is how you properly use negative energy a lot of people just get mad and they get bitter but Champion people use it and they and due to the point of where sometimes when you get really really good You got to make it up. Okay, there's a famous story about Michael Jordan Uh where He went out on the court and started talking to one of the dudes. He's like hey, man I fucking hurt what you said about me The guys like what are you talking about? See that shit and he's like yeah, you're gonna say that now we're on the court man Fuck you. I'm gonna and then duty right he just runs the dude over. Yeah, so like Wow, yeah, bro. So like it's it's you have To learn how to use the negative energy bro because here's the deal In life You're gonna get two kinds of energy you're gonna get encouragement and then you're gonna get discouragement You're gonna get negative energy brother and and and you're not gonna want to hear this but the truth the matter is 80% of the energy you're gonna get is probably negative for a very long time until you become so undeniable That nobody wants to say that shit. All right, because they look stupid That doesn't come for years down the road So right now where you're at you're gonna have to take everything that they said And you're gonna have to get up off the couch or go put your fucking spikes on and get your glove Get some ground balls do some hitting practice You know, uh, I would encourage you to start learning some you know reading and learning about business and entrepreneurship and Things that will help you professionally pass that even if you go play pro you're gonna want to know what to do pass that But just do something productive work out go for a run something that makes you better because that's What every sit bro. I've met some really fucking champion level people. I mean the best of the best of the best Outside of Michael Jordan. I've probably met most of them um And and unfortunately enough to have conversations with them and they all think like that every single one of them And you'll have these people out in the world to say don't focus on the negative focus on the positive Well, if that's true, then you're only gonna use 30 20 to 30% of the available energy to move forward Okay, and I can tell you this like when someone tells me how good I am Sure doesn't fucking motivate me very much like when someone says hey man, uh, you're Congratulations on all the success like I don't I don't get the fuck up and do any work any harder and so I want more But when school yeah, when someone says hey Fuck you and you fat fuck guess what I do I go to fucking gym, you know, I'm saying it like so Yeah, so dude you just gotta learn how to utilize that negative energy because bro We're gonna get way more of it and like DJ said it gets worse And if you don't have the ability to leverage it or you laugh it off too easy Because a lot of people say I'll just laugh it off who cares no dude Take that shit in get fucking pissed about it and then go do the thing That's gonna make you better. That's where most people miss it They get real pissed, but then they sit there and they soak That doesn't do you any good man The best workouts I've ever had the best ideas I've ever had the hardest I've ever worked is when I felt disrespected All right So dude swallow that shit and let it simmer and let it piss you off and then go do your shit bro Right, I'm talking like right then. I don't mean like dude if it's 11 o'clock at night And someone's like hey fuck you Bro go for a fucking 10 minute run You know, I'm saying like dude if you can seriously discipline yourself enough To move forward every time someone says some negative shit Do you know how fucking good you become you become great Because the energy is just much more available than it is the positive So what do you I mean what do you think bro does that make sense? Yes Okay, what what kind of cheer they say into you dude? Just like just like giving me crap about like one time and Uh transfer schools like all this stuff man Just swallow that shit down and work out work and bro and it all work out sir All right All right, man, you have any more issues with that you call back in I'll pull up Now bro, this is part of growing up you know, I'm saying like dude, you know part of the reason that I'm where I'm at life is because everybody Fucking bullied me when I was young bro. That's the truth. I was bullied. I was made fun of I was called a fat fuck I was told I was no good. I had a guidance counselor in high school Tell me that there's no fucking way that I was gonna ever be successful actually what he told me was I tried to go to I wanted to go to Notre Dame uh and I wanted to go to Notre Dame or the University of Texas and His exact words to me were Andy those schools aren't for people like you You're you're a community you're a community college person And he fucking told me that straight to my face and dude to this day I fucking think about it You know what I'm saying? So Like these things that people say that like pierce your fucking heart Are the most valuable things that anybody will ever say to you and your entire life But you won't realize it until you've you've gone down the journey of where you want to go all right, so one day Cole you're gonna be in a position and You know, maybe it's in baseball Maybe it's a professional career Just being a successful human and you're gonna say man, I'm glad all those motherfuckers said that shit to me You know, I'm saying like you're gonna like you know like I have a list, bro And like I sometimes I think about like literally sending them a thank you card Now be it serious. Yeah, yeah, man because I wouldn't yeah I wouldn't dude and I've learned to be appreciative Of those people Because of the fuel that they gave me and Right yeah, dude. It's it's hard to see when you're in it, but once you use it you'll start to understand All right, Cole go get it done man All right, you're so much to talk to me all right brother. We'll see you All right, y'all are good boys. All right, you too Yeah, man, that's hard as a young dude stuff. Yeah, I'm especially do kids kids now and they mean it's fuck. It's different I know there's savage bro. It's so different. What you gotta go home and see it on the internet that right right? There's no it's not off, you know, it used to be is just at school. No, actually goes home with you like it's everywhere Bro, you just gotta learn to sell or really yeah, okay, all right. We'll see watch this. Yeah, that's right Fuckin see. I love it, man. Well guys, let's get to our second question. Got a ride in here guys any question number two Hey Andy I always ask everyone Everyone else for their opinions whether it's my friends co-workers or just strangers online. I weigh every Perspective but my own. I think I'm afraid that if I really trusted myself and got it wrong I'd have no one else to blame But what if I'm the only one I need to trust What would change if I finally did how do you learn to trust yourself when it comes to perspectives first of all Look dude Don't be asking your fucking friends who aren't doing the same shit that you're doing advice You don't take financial advice from a fucking poor person. You don't take You know fitness advice from a four hundred pound dude who's never worked out You this is common sense your fucking friends and probably most of your family is not doing or on the same path that you are on all right The nature of you writing into the show Tells me that you want more nobody that doesn't want more listens to this show Okay, that's why so many people complain about it All right, it is a small percentage of people That want to do better in life and you are in that group and if you are trying to get validation or ask opinions from people who are not on that path you are constantly inviting Sandbag comments to pull you off track all right, they're gonna instill doubt They're going to make you question things. They're gonna discourage you They're gonna say things that make you feel a certain way that you shouldn't feel all right And it's hard to get past this because in your mind These are the people who should care about you the most all right So you have to understand dude real simple you cannot take advice When it comes to your path from anybody that hasn't been down the road or is on the same path It's a completely different life than everybody else all this shit you see on the internet about balance and All this victimhood shit and all this oh Trauma shit and you need therapy bro. That's for everybody else Okay, you're a builder you're a creator You're an achiever and you know that in your heart, which is why you're asking the question So you are paralyzed by people who aren't even on the same path You have to understand that stop asking people Who aren't even in the same fucking stratosphere about what they want in life What you should be doing they're gonna give you advice about what they do This should be obvious to you Okay, and all that does is confuse you and paralyze you and cause you to eventually doubt enough To where you give up and you say fuck it. I'm it's not for me everybody around me tells tells me it's not for me everybody says I'm not smart enough or I'm not good enough or I'm not humble enough or I need to be like this or I need to do that or are you sure Listen stop doing that you are torturing yourself by asking them anything All right If you want to be an average motherfucker that lives an average life that doesn't really want it to ask them what you should do Because whenever they say bro if you follow it you just go be like them. That's the truth. That's the truth Okay Now so the point of listening to yourself The reason that you don't trust yourself is because you haven't ever built the confidence to trust yourself I bet without looking at your life You have a major problem with execution and you have a major problem with follow through I can tell by the nature of your question because if you were executing and if you were following through You would have developed confidence in yourself to make the decisions that you want to make Without anybody else's opinion when you have built yourself into a resilient strong badass Mentally fucking hard motherfucker You do not need other people's opinions on things you only ask them when they know more than you which is a smart thing to do by the way all right So we have to work with you on building your confidence building yourself esteem building your grit building your fortitude Following through All right, and dude by the way, I've developed an entire program that helps you train this in yourself It's called 75 hard and live hard You get it for free at episode 208 I'm sure you've heard of it because the whole world's heard of it. All right, you need to live on that fucking lifestyle That is the truth you need to get on live hard I would recommend every entrepreneur do it because it sharpens you Throughout the entire year it keeps you high performing it keeps you mentally clear And it allows you to operate at the highest level and by the way it gives you the confidence That you could trust yourself because you've just shown yourself that you can do all these hard things that other people can't even fathom So you don't look to other people's validation anymore because you know you're stronger than them all right, so If you want to trust yourself you've got to give yourself reasons to trust yourself and you haven't done that yet all right so go out live on the program Understand that the more you listen to people who aren't doing shit the more likely you are to fall in the line with them and not do shit either all right and then start seeking the advice of people who are further down the road Or have done what it is that you want to do and only listen to them. Don't listen to anybody else. So That's pretty much it bro like You got to understand dude the ability to trust yourself comes from situations where you may decisions On your own you follow through and it worked out that is a muscle that you have to train bro You it's a perishable skill if you don't train that within yourself It's gonna come and go sometimes you're gonna have confidence sometimes you won't sometimes you'll feel good sometimes You won't sometimes you'll be able to trust yourself sometimes you won't and dude you'll go up and down They'll drive you fucking crazy You need to become the kind of person that can trust themselves that can follow through on their word that can do what they say They're gonna do and that is something that you have to intentionally train It is not something that people are born with it's something that you have to build through repetition Just like playing the guitar or just like doing anything that requires practice Okay, a lot of people they play the guitar and they don't play for three or four years and guess what they suck All right, if you take a shower today and you don't take one for the next week You don't get to go back and say well I took a shower at one time. Don't work like that It's the same thing with your discipline. It's the same thing with your confidence. It's the same thing with yourself to believe It's you have to train them All right, and once you start to train them you will have more trust and faith in yourself So stop listening to people who aren't on the same path. They're poisoning your mind They're instilling doubt. They're making you question things and eventually they'll make you question it so much that you will give up And you will join them and then you will spend the rest of your life being regretful of Not doing what it is you wanted to do I want to add says this is gonna be a real conversation and I don't I don't think anybody talks about this How do you handle the resentment when you finally learn that when you were asking them for their opinion They told you go left and you didn't like just how wrong they they were How do you handle that resentment? I mean look dude. Well, it depends if they do it intentionally or did they or they just they just don't know because they're not on the path like It does matter intent intent does matter because some people will try to help you but they don't know Right, they have no business trying to help you right They don't they and they they're not aware enough and the person asking is not aware enough to say uh This guy's life fucking sucks. You know, I'm saying like might not be right. Yeah So we have to we have to not give value to our friends and family To skills that they do not possess they do not possess At all and they might want to help you, but they can't help you That's like someone who can't swim Being asked to swim out in the middle of the lake and save a drowning person You can't do it you might want to but you can't all right And so if it's like that there really isn't resentment you just say hey they they're they love me They're they gave me what they thought was good advice and it was framed because that's what they believe And that's why you don't ask them. All right, and in that case, there's no resentment It's just hey, uh, we're on different paths. It's a good hearted person You know, we can hang out the barbecues and have to be cool friends, but I'm not gonna ask him Shit, you know what I mean, right, right. I mean, there's plenty of People out there that you can remain friends with and just not ask their advice or when they give it just say hey man You know real talk. I don't give a fuck you know, I'm saying right uh, so But then there is people that will try to pull you off track and you'll realize it down the road Especially with like people you date all right, you'll realize that Uh And dude, it's just realizing that those people don't give a fuck about you they give a fuck about them And and dude that you don't you don't have to resent them. He just let him go bro. Yeah, just let it go resentment Each you up. It doesn't do anything to them. It doesn't fix the situation. It's not productive You just accept things for what they are and they are what they are. I love that dude. Yeah, I love it Hey guys, let's get you out third and final question. We got another call. All right, let's do it All right guys our third and final question. We got another call in uh, this is hunter. Let's give hunter a call Hello, it's Hunter. Hey, what's up, Hunter What's going on? Scary there. What's up, Hunter? How you doing, bro? No, what's up, man? So what we got what you got for us today, bro? Where are you at? You sound like you're in like uh, you know, Alabama No, no, no line up. I got a family in the car. We're going to see the new Lilo and stitch movie. All right. All right. So the family's there, huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, I got you in my earbud because you never know, you know, what can happen on one of the That's probably a good idea. Well, what can you help you with, bro? Well, if you if you don't mind, like I'd like to maybe give you a little synopsis of like My family's business in my situation and then read the questions. You got a little understanding So we've been in business for 15 years. Uh, we've got a hard dealership right outside of Raleigh North Carolina that my dad started with like a motorcycle and a tractor out of his garage Sold those bought his first car sold that car about two more now. We've got two locations with 150 units Over the last 15 years. He's built a pretty pretty successful business in our area That our community trust and you know, we do we do things the right way as you should um The question that I've got relates to the culture of our business. So he um, I'll just read it to you um So My question was how can I shift the culture of a small family business When the majority of the employees are old established Tires or not only lazy but can be active dancers within the company Um, my dad has made all of these hires and now it's kind of stepped away from the day to day as more hands-off in the company Okay, well, what's your role in the company? So I run um, so we have two three locations I run one of the core lots um And I have I've like kind of revamped all of my employees and Established like my own culture within my store um The other two locations are all hires that have really been with them since day one and the majority of them are great, but there are a couple Um, that I think You know, he obviously wants to see the good and his people that he hired um and kind of and doesn't see how they behave on the day to day Right So we've got some You know just some some bad apples in the group that know that since he was they were hired by him almost have like the hidden immunietal And there's nothing that I can really do To manage those employees because they know that he hired them and I can't fire them Okay, and those employees work inside your store No, no, I've got I don't have any of the old employees at my location, but So we have like an auto shop that all of our cars go through so we were and a detailed shop at the other store So we work closely with all locations But my store independently does not have any of the okay on the old established hires and how's your store perform next to the other stores Great um, I mean we they have about three to four times the inventory that I do Um, and I I mean I hang right with them every month in terms of sales So they have four times the product three to four times the product and I typically you know and Maybe a small percentage behind what they sell okay with maybe more than half less than happy inventory. Okay All right, so is your dad planning on like like getting completely out to where you're going to be able to run things at any time soon So that's that's where it's weird is like see every week like he's gone four or five days a week Um, when he stops in the store, it's only for maybe 10 or 15 minutes. Okay, but he's very adamant about keeping his His people why do you think that is? Why do you think that is well? Yeah, so he's got a very good heart, right And and this people are loyal to him yep um and But I've heard you say time and time again that you know, just because you show up for work You may be loyal in terms of like being on time and doing what you but they're just they just do what they're supposed to do Um as an employee, but they are loyal right they've been with him for 10 or 12 years um But since he stepped away from the company like I don't think that How old are these people? Um probably like late 40s early 50s. Oh, okay, and what is your ideal outcome for for what are you are you trying to grow the company try to open up more stores What do you what are you trying to do? Yeah, so right now um We're just kind of coasting with what we've got um, we've got a lot of rooms to grow um We could probably double our inventory between the two stores The current locations, but I think the 10-year plan would be you know open affected or third or fourth retail location Um and grow outwards in that in that manner, okay All right, man, so here's a deal Your dad is loyal to these people because they helped him build what he has, okay, and sure this is a A comment rate, you know, I have a number of people That have helped me grow my companies that I would do literally anything for And some of them are still here and some of them aren't And they're if you're a good person Like you say your dad is you know when I ask you that question. I was pretty sure what the answer was going to be uh You know you feel a very deep sense of gratitude And you tend to give sometimes passes to people that uh, you wouldn't another another situations and Right how I would address this issue, okay, because here's the truth you already know what's got to happen There's only two things that can happen here one they can get on board two they can get the fuck out all right and They're probably not going to get on board at 50 years old. I just got to be real. They've already accepted their lifestyle They've already like They've you know most people at 50 are not ambitious. They've decided hey man. This is just what my life's gonna be And so to get those People to to execute at a higher level than what they've been used to is probably uh It's going to be very difficult probably um Now there's going to be exceptions right but Probably not okay, so the other thing So the other situation is you know, okay, you got to get rid of them Your dad doesn't want to get rid of them because they're 50 years old and he's thinking like well What are they going to do? It's going to fuck them up So when it is that when he's to happen here uh before the culture even gets addressed You have to have a conversation with your dad, okay, and you have to say hey look dad I know that you built this business. It's you what you've done is amazing I want to take the business to the next level So that I can be proud of what I've done with my life. I don't want to just sit here in the store and run a store I want to take what you've done and I want to take it to the next level which I'm sure at one point in time is what you also wanted And then I would say yeah, I would say look at my grandkids I'm trying to provide or look at your grandkids. I'm trying to provide the best opportunity for them And the reason you're going to say it like that is because you want him to expand his thinking outside of Just himself or you okay, and if you say hey, I'm trying to set something up for them That he's going to see that differently all right, so you have this conversation with him And you say look There's always so much I can do with Steve and Larry and Bob, okay, they're fucking up everything that I got going on They can you have to talk to them they can either work and get on board with me Or we're going to have to get rid of him because it's going to hurt our family man And you have to have a real conversation with him and you got to say like hey dad I know you have a good heart I know you care about these people, but you care about those grandkids more than you care about those people All right, and you got to start putting pressure on him to understand that that like this is bigger than him And it is this isn't this isn't manipulation. This is just a like a negotiation To get him to realize like hey man because he's probably not realizing it He's probably thinking like oh everything's good. I got to you know, I can go to fishing I can go do my thing and everything's fine But what he what he doesn't realize like you said is what goes on when he's not there all right So sure that conversation has to happen and it has to happen in a real serious way like hey like hey dad Can you can we get together like or can we meet here and I need to talk to you about something that's It's real important. I just don't want to bring it up casually like set an official meeting with him so that there's weight To the conversation all right And then yeah, then we can start addressing the culture Okay, because until you get the cancer out of your you're you're correct in your assessment Until you get the cancer out of your company You can't get people aligned because and I'm gonna explain this you already know this but I'm gonna explain this for the listeners When hunter tries to change the culture What's happening here is he's being undermined by people who have been there longer Who are older than him who are who know the way it really is This is how we've always done it and so hunters walking in the room saying hey guys This is what I want to do. This is what we want to do This is this and the minute he walks out of the room He's getting undermined by these people who Truly don't give a fuck and and and we might sit here and say oh they they really do care no They don't because if they really cared they'd get on board with them if they really cared They would do what is gonna be best for the company and if they were really loyal to your dad bro They would work their fucking asses off and gratitude for the opportunity if they've been provided that's the truth Okay, so this this guilt this guilt that your dad has is wrong. It's misplaced Okay, if they were loyal They would fucking be they would be doing everything they can to grow that business because it would also serve them to grow it as well But like I said they're 50 years old They've accepted where they are they're ambitious. They don't want to work any harder and Every place has people like that But the minute they start undermining and the minute they start sabotage they got to go bro. They got to go so Yeah, so you know that's that has to be addressed before We address the culture all right now once you get all that addressed There's some formalization that you can do inside your company And do listen culture is a that's a weak long boot camp, okay, and I actually I'm gonna start doing something like that soon but In a short time we have What you have to do is you have to set some standards And you have I'll give you a couple pieces of of what the what this will take to fix it all right one You got to define what the vision is all right. What's the vision of what you're trying to do Once you define that you have to make the vision work for them, okay? They have to understand What are they gonna get out of the vision? They have to believe that they can get it out of that vision and And so you have to set basically a very clear goal for what they are going to get out of growing the company Number two, you got to develop a really a real mission statement not some bullshit that you put on the wall that says we We hear at you know At hunter cardio ship we stand for integrity. No, I'm not talking about that I'm talking about some real shit that you guys live by all right Then three you have to set core values for the company and these core values you could pick like six to ten of them And these have to become the guide rails for how you audit your performance your decision And you have to teach your employees to audit themselves against those same values meaning if the value says Accept responsibility or go the extra mile they should be able to look at that list and say Am I doing that and I going the extra mile Am I taking responsibility for the things that go wrong And use that and teach them as a framework how to stay within that guide rail and the third part or the fourth part here Is going to be Speak in that language meaning When you make a correction when you have to you know Let's say have a meeting with someone or talk to them about something or you're making a correction about something You're going to want instead of saying hey that was wrong. Don't do that again. You're going to say hey What core value do you think that violates here and you make them go up and down and tell you and then you say okay What do you think you should have done and you make them go up and down and tell you all right and you start communicating and correcting Along these core values and I guess the sixth thing Fuck out on how many numbers is that five or six whatever the next thing is you need to hire and fire by those core values So if you have and you've already figured this part out if you have people that aren't a fit They got to go no matter what it doesn't matter how good they sell it doesn't matter or what it doesn't matter They have to fucking go because those people will always poison the culture so Those are some quick things that you can do dude and oh and here's another one Instead of making do you guys have like awards and shit that you do Yeah, yeah, we've got some like bonus programs and what are they and what are they based upon how much you sell Ah, it just depends on the position, but yeah, okay, we it's based off sales. Yeah, all right, so take take That metric Having it based off sales and make your awards based on the core values, okay Meaning gotcha you know like who who did who had the coolest go the extra mile story for the dealership who had the you know like Start making the the rewards based around the value system that you that you have inside your company And that will correct the behavior because they won't because like dude as you know as a salesperson You know sales At the cost of Anything is not actually a good way to run your business because it feels salesy and people don't come back And then you get a bad reputation so over selling Is probably one of the worst things you could do in any business. So You want to you want to shift the idea from selling To actually serving and helping Through these core values and when you do that, bro You end up in a situation where people are providing the best possible Outcome for your customers because ultimately the best marketing that you have I don't know anything about your business, but it's word of mouth. They're gonna say hey I went down to fuck it. I went down to hunter the guys were awesome. I would never go anywhere else Yes, and that's not the guy. I mean in the community. We've got I mean on Google We've got a 4.9 star. I mean we yeah, we over 50% of our business from word of mouth. Yeah Um, I get you might as fast because quick and follow up. Yeah So because I'm not a let's say you have two options to deal with the cancer, right? You can if you can cut it out immediately Which is not an option for me. I'm kind of left as acting as almost like a chemo, right? And so these people have been left kind of put on my plate where I have to deal with them But throwing them out cutting them out is not an option So how how can I deal with these people and and almost make like how can I make these people more effective When they're not my hire they don't do what I say and they know that they've found like An immunity where there's nothing that I can do Per say right just like there's no respect for me You want to know the truth? They don't you want to know the truth? You fucking can't Can't do it You can't do it. You'll lose. So it's either get rid of them right or you're gonna lose That's it our get rid of them you're gonna stay where you're at So that's why I said you need to talk to your dad you're gonna have to have a Confrontational discussion with your dad because I've been doing this for 26 years I'm probably one of the biggest experts in the world on culture and I can promise you I couldn't do what you're asking for you to do there's no other work. I couldn't fucking do it We've uh We've this has been a discussion for who knows probably last couple years And I've been sending the episodes the show and hey look what he said the cancer you got to get rid of it And so my sharing the show and not being a hoe I've been really sending these episodes to him to say look man. This guy's built, you know Astronomical thing He's not just making it up and know there's no example where the cancer stays in the business It can't happen. There's only two options They can either get on board and respect your father who gave them a career and work at the standard that needs to be done Or they have to go and that's it and and and dude this undermining shit And okay, if you're saying oh well, I need to make it better right away I have looked dude. I know how I would handle it like But I probably can't say it on there. Okay. I'll real talk Yeah, like real talk dude like you're not gonna fucking undermine me now when I'm paying your mother fucking bills It's not happening bro. So Uh, that's that's total disrespect Total disrespect. So at a bare minimum That has to stop, but it's still not gonna fix what you're trying to fix if you want to fix a little bit today I go sit down with them. I say man. I get you've been here for 55 years Whatever the fuck they've been here and I'd say I I get that and I get that how old are you? 26 I get that I'm only 26 and you think I'm like some young dude doesn't know shit But I'm gonna tell you right now between me and you I'm gonna get my fucking way And if you fuck the minute I get it if you don't fucking stop what you're doing You're gonna be to fucking out of here and I'd fucking tell that right to their fucking face. I pull them outside I'd say hey, let me talk to you for a second And I'd have a real son. That's exactly what I would say. I'd say hey look here Bob I know you're 50 years old and you don't give a fuck about your life But you see those kids over there I give a fuck about them and my dad gave you a fucking opportunity to build a career to do these things And you're every time I walk out of the meeting you're telling these guys this and this and this That's gonna fucking stop because there's gonna be a day real soon where I'm running shit And you're gonna have a fucking job and I would make that really clear dude And if they you know that I would say just like that That'll get you a little bit of time. Yeah, that'll buy you some time. Yeah, but it won't fix it Right. Yeah, I probably need to sit down as a company, right and address the issues No, with all of us together in the room. Well, I mean, yeah, I would do yeah It's not three discussed and probably get on the same page. That's that's passive bro. Okay You get first of all you can't hold the whole company accountable for the actions of a few Because the ones that are really try the ones that are really trying hard will be discouraged by that They'll say fuck dude. Okay, Hunter's not seeing what I like all the shit. I do like they didn't even appreciate it So it has to be in private right? Right Okay, bro, I'll come do it. Fuck those guys My name sounds like a plan dude listen do it Otherwise, you're gonna be stuck in the same system forever And dude you're gonna be failing your own family bro that what Fuck those guys, okay? If they don't want to get on board and your dad feels bad You need to get your dad to understand. They're not respecting what he's what he's done for them Right Yep, well, that's what I'll do first thing tomorrow morning. I brother Movie with my family right now. Yeah, I do it now, but I get it but listen man. I'm listen You will be glad you did this it will change it will get you in a position where you can grow and you can do your thing And it'll probably happen a lot faster than 10 years dude So All right, bro, sounds good man. Well, thank you guys. I appreciate it. You're welcome hunter. See bro Yeah, I'm a good one. Bye Yeah That's a hard combo to have man. It is if you never had it. Yeah, that's a guy. It is if you never had I don't listen man That's That's real shit those guys aren't respecting his dad for what they did for him And now they're saying back in this guy You know and his family and what he's trying to do because he's only 26 and they don't want to listen to him He's out here trying to build a career You know the truth of the matter is if his dad won't fucking allow him to do that. He should go do his own thing Because he's always gonna be handicapped By his dad's inability to recognize what is true You know, I'm saying and then his dad has to fucking see like man. I'm hurt my own family by keeping These guys here. Yeah, and he does have a heart. He's gonna see that and he'll get in line Maybe I mean maybe yeah, you know, I understand how his dad feels bro. Yeah, but Listen, there's a time when loyalty expires. There's an expiration to loyalty. It does not last forever Okay, just as trade off and yes, yeah, right right. Fuck man. I was thinking too bad like even just on the the the cancer conversation But like even having the conversation, you know Yeah, they might get a line for a little bit. Yeah, it's a band-aid Like a little bit listen man at 50 years old you are who the fuck you are. You know, I'm saying. Yeah, man, fuck Well guys, Andy that was three. All right. All right guys.
