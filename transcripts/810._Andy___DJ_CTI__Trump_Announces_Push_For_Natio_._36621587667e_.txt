Yeah, I know you do fuck, bro Uh Guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures headlines articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com You guys can find them all linked there Um, with that being said, let's get into our first headline headline number one. Let's uh do a little uh up-to-date recap But what's happening with uh president elect Donald Trump There's some interesting things um some pretty awesome things I think so let's let's just dive into a little bit of these The first one we got is uh President elect Trump announces push for national concealed carry reciprocity Uh, he's been like rolling out a bunch of these plans that I mean they're pretty fucking sweet um over the weekend Uh president elect Donald Trump announced a push for national concealed carry reciprocity a move Which would make the concealed permit of any one state valid in the other 49 on sunday dawn trump junior postage instagram quote Boom my father just announced concealed carry reciprocity the second amendment will stay and remain protected Um, here's a video of him announcing that check this clip out Seventh I will protect the right of self-defense everywhere it is under siege And I will sign concealed carry reciprocity your second amendment does not end at the state line Yeah, so I mean there's that I think that's pretty fucking cool Um, but there's been plans for a lot of other stuff too um This is a AP Associate of press push this article out uh trump on day one begin deportation push part in jane You wear your six rioters and make his criminal cases vanish Um, I thought this was kind of interesting because you know Uh, his criminal cases they're vanishing not because of trump Like making them vanish they're vanishing because the prosecutors are realizing like okay The the gags over let us drop out all these fucking cases um But uh, you know, and they're saying they they bring up this rhetoric again You know that trump's gonna be a dictator on day one saying that it's his own statements Um, all of that good stuff Um, but I want to really kind of focus in on this mass deportation thing real quick um entered the chat got time home in um This guy's awesome, okay now you guys may remember this guy he had an epic showdown With a OC a couple of years ago um, I got the clip here. Let's watch this real quick hero tolerance was interpreted as the policy that separated children from there if I get arrested for d.o I didn't I have a young child in a car. I'm gonna be separated I'm also police officer in New York and I arrested a father for domestic violence. I separated that Mr. Holman with all to respect Legal asylis are not charged with any crime When you're in the country of legal is violation eight United States code 1325 seeking asylum is legal if you want to stick asylum You go to the port of entry do the legal way The attorney general the United States has made that clear. Okay Mr. Chair the the memo is um is submitted to the record for review Uh, I The story here right well trump just made uh, he just put this man in charge of deportation. Yeah um And it's fucking awesome. Yeah, he seems like a pretty hard dude and that's what it's gonna take to do that bro He listen he has Massive cahoney's yeah, we've talked about this for a long time, you know if he's actually gonna pull this deportation Like he says he's going to which needs to be done unfortunately It's gonna not be a pretty thing. It's gonna be very hard for people to watch and and Even people that are for it are not gonna enjoy seeing it. It's not gonna be fun It's not gonna be nice. It's not gonna be friendly and you have to remember that these people are military age males They come from other countries and a lot of these people that come here alone They're not here to seek asylum for their families. They're not here to uh, you know They're here to take your shit. I mean, I don't know how to say it any other way than that But they come here with no fucking women. Where are they gonna get their women to reproduce from? I said this five four five years ago. Mm-hmm. Okay. Look What happens in Europe? Look at the the migrant rapes and the migrant sexual crimes that happen in Europe and look at the ones that are starting to happen here They're starting to tell us about yeah, and what's interesting is it is the left Women like a OC advocating for this when it's actually the thing that's putting her and people that she cares about in danger That makes no sense I don't think she understands anything about reality. I don't think she's ever witnessed anything very ugly I think she's probably had a lot of privilege because she's an attractive female and she has no fucking idea what These people are actually about and this guy that she's arguing with on this microphone is actually trying to keep her and people like her safe Okay, but it's gonna be an ugly it's gonna be an ugly process It's not gonna be fun to watch and people are gonna have to remember that It is what it is man. Yeah, I think I think they're you know again I'm not in the room when Trump's making these decisions, right But I would like to to to assume if I if I could guess You know the whole reason because you got to think about I mean he has he took his transition team private Right, he's not using government agencies to help with that transition team He's putting people in these positions. That's all closeted on his own dime that he's doing This was one of the first people he announced and kind of put out there that hey, this is who's gonna be handling this right And my belief is that you know, he put time out there first Is because we got what two and a half months before he's actually in office before these things actually happen He has to start desensitizing Americans to that reality now this is not gonna be pretty yeah, and it's gonna be fucking hard correct You know what I'm saying? I think it's a perfect play that that Trump's doing listen man It's it is it is not gonna be fun to watch dude. No, you know people think that it's gonna be but there's there's a level of Over-espected that we have for human beings um That you know pulls it all all of our heartstrings and says yeah, but dude Remember these people coming across remember six months ago. We have Venezuelan gang members going on literal tiktok in the internet talking about everybody come here. It's wide open. They don't arrest you blah blah blah. We have gangs taking over literal towns All over the country, okay, and Colorado up in Chicago, you know, these little areas of towns so to speak um, and it's a very bad thing and it takes someone who's hardened like this man to execute what needs to happen Yeah, unfortunately, you know these people set it up these people that these uh, you know these communists who have been in power for a long fucking time not just the last four years They've been in power for 20 years outside of the four that Trump was in And in fact they were still in power then Because they wouldn't allow Trump to do anything um So it is what it is dude. I mean, this is the kind of guy it takes to do that job Uh, and I hope he does it completely. Yeah, he went on 60 minutes. This was uh his take because I mean people have been trying to push back on him a little bit Let's check out his reaction on this We have seen one estimate that says it would cost 88 billion dollars to deport a million people a year I don't know if it's accurate or not Is that what American taxpayers should expect? What price do you put on national security? Is that worth it? Is there a way to carry out mass deportation without separating families? Of course there's The families can be deported together I'm fucking loving I mean the guys are realist bro Uh, and not only is he a realist man like you know, they say he's been getting pushed back and uh Fox News actually had him on I believe yesterday Uh, and you know, they're calling him the new borders are now time homing um and uh he had this to say when they ask him Like I mean do you care about public opinion? Do you care what like I mean? And again, this is somebody who I feel like that's what you need in that position, bro It's like he's not he's not cold-hearted He just cares more about American people and I think that's important. Let's check this clip out I'm really encouraged by what you're saying because I think the toughest part of your job Isn't isn't the deportation it's dealing with the propaganda from the other side saying that what you're doing is not It is not compassionate that it's it's not humanitarian and what are you planning? I'm glad you mentioned the third the three hundred thousand children that are missing But how are you going to deal with those kinds of attacks even though you know that this open border has led to sex trafficking of children and and an exponential increase of child labor illegal child labor I Frankly, I don't care what people think about me Especially on the left Again, I you know when you have a historic crisis a crisis is because what they need to know When you when you have a crisis is putting the overwhelms of Bourbon chill where the majority of bourgeois are no longer on patrol They're making sandwiches you're changing diapers and making baby form or they make a house for runs and making airport runs When you take most of border traces off the border of the other humanitarian crisis That's when a fat malt comes across the killer quarter million Americans That's what a sex trafficking is increased 600 percent that's what we know is suspected terrorists across this country They've had a record of people on terrorist wastes that been arrested as son of border That's why you have over two million Godaways how many of them came from countries contrainter? So I don't care where anybody's opinions like illegal migration when you create a crisis this big all these other bad things happen That's we have to secure the border. I don't care for you public in a Democrat or independent State border security is national security. We should all be on the same side of that Yeah, now people The left you know obviously they've been having the meltdowns. Um, let's check in with a few of them I got two of them here for you. I love your take on. Let's check out this first lady. Um, who goes by uh trans loving mama Well, it's happening the family wants to know what I'm doing for the holidays Um, I'm gonna be here with my dogs and my daughter who is of childbearing age and now has to get an IUD at 17 years old And I'm gonna be here with my son who is a political target and that should really tell you all you need to know About why I'm not gonna be hanging out with y'all For the holidays so fuck off choke on your turkey. Bye First of all, I'm sure they're very upset that you're not showing up at holidays to lecture them and be little of them and talk about shit that you have no idea of anything about And judge everybody for their extremist beliefs and you lack the awareness To actually look in the mirror and realize that it's fucking you You're the problem, okay, and your daughter who's 17 and has to get an IUD maybe you should teach her to close your fucking legs Okay, secondly your son who is a political tart. Why is your son a political target? What does that mean? I don't know. Does that mean he's gay? Does that mean he's trans? What does that mean? Okay, like As far as I know, I don't see people who are gay getting attacked and this is all fake rhetoric dude It's all fake shit and these people bought in to a line of manipulation from the media That has now affected their judgment permanently And quite honestly, dude the media should be held responsible for all the brainwashing they've done you know But whatever dude at the end of the day Like imagine making your Instagram or your tic-tac handle trans loving mama Like you're such a virtue signaler and you want all these people to love you so much That you make it your identity on the internet like that's a mental illness in itself Then you have to cater to a certain group of people to get your validation And then you come on the internet and be like, so it's happening Well, you know what you couldn't have seen that it was coming after you've jammed this shit down everybody's throat You know what I find interesting dude is all these people that keep talking all this shit about These people that didn't vote for them that can't even look in the mirror and like say oh fuck Maybe they didn't vote for us because We're crazy you know what I'm saying and dude the the one particular Demographic that shifted the most do you know which one it was? Was it latinos? No, it was white men They moved 30% from Democrat to Republican Which is shocking to me because I couldn't imagine that calling them Nazis and racist and white devils and saying that they're the problem in society For the last 15 years and that they're responsible for things that they're a quote-unquote Ancestors did 300 fucking years ago. I can't imagine how that's not an effective strategy to get people to go along with what you think I mean I'm shocked. I'm shocked that didn't work You know, and now these people instead of saying fuck we shouldn't have done that because it won it's not true Two we're just saying it to try push an agenda Instead of just saying like fuck dude That was wrong. We shouldn't have done that Instead they're doubling down tripling down and saying see see we told you So all this is going to do is shrink them into a relevance more and more and more They are a dying culture. They are dead on the fucking vine. They just haven't fallen to the ground yet And the people like this The people that I've been talking about on the show for years and years and years dude that are gonna have a legit mental catastrophe Trying to come to terms with reality versus what they think reality is Right where they want it to be what they think it is because they watch the same things over and over and over and over again They mostly these people don't even know someone that voted Republican And so now when they find out their dad or their brother or this or that they're going fucking insane They don't they feel like everybody was with me Everybody agrees with me because these are the people that show up at Thanksgiving and they start lecturing everybody and telling everybody the way it is And standing on their moral high horse You can't even teach your own daughter not to fuck around You're worried about getting her in iud Which she's 17 how about teacher to be selective about who she has sex with how about teaching her some moral standards How about not promoting casual sex as the norm for 17 year old girls right how about that right where's those conversations Yeah, they're not happening with her now because she's a fucking trans love and mama I love trans we don't talk about that in this house. Yeah, yeah, let me tell you yeah Mm-hmm It's weird. I want to check it with another person the tab in some issues here Tam Tammy and Bobby Tammy and Bob Tammy and Bobby and Bobby this two people Okay Okay, so this is one person Tammy and Bobby Okay, good morning. It is November 7th Thursday and And got my lipstick on today. So I'm a little bit more together We're putting this plan together um I cannot live in a country that voted for Trump. I cannot spend another four years under that man And so we have made the decision That we are leaving We have put in a plan together our plan is to go back to Australia and by back That is where obviously Tam and our daughter Jordan was from Um, I'm working on immigration paperwork for spousal visa. I'll probably end up going over on a tourist visa initially because the spousal visa takes a while I'll probably have to leave at some point and go to like Vietnam or Moriah And then come back to Australia waiting for the paperwork to go through But we're getting quotes on selling the house. We're getting ready I'm getting quotes on moving boxes to Australia. We're getting quotes on moving our dog and cat to Australia and We are in the process of selling everything Um, I'm hoping to be out of here by mid-January So that's the news We've buckled up. We've made a decision We are not spending any more time in America with under Donald Trump There's just no way and I feel bad and sorry for all the women and all the members of the queer community that are still here um And what life would be like under that person? So um take care of yourselves well bye To both of y'all Tim and I Tim and Bobby one person yeah, I'm aware I'm also aware of how the person talked about where we're getting marriage visas a spousal visa then I'm getting all the boxes and I'm shipping my dogs and cats and I'm moving on my shit And then by the way, I'm in the process of selling all my shit like which is it and why are you still here? You're Fuck fucking leave Bro fucking leave dude. What is it about the what is it about this is about like It's it's a it is a it's a left Thing what they only do this People on the right don't do this people in the center don't do this Why do the left think That they can come on your page or go in your comments or go in your DMs and impose their fucking will onto you and lecture you Why is that? Okay, these people have done this for so long and now people are just telling them to eat shit and they can't figure out why they can't win You get it's you it's the way you guys behave and by the way normal people that move they just fucking move They don't make a fucking tick talk about it Talking about all the details no one feels sorry for you dude you you show up at the ice skating rink or at the mom people are scared They hold their kids tighter because you Seen like a fucking pedophile bro.

Why is it that this like fetish thing has made its way into like culture Like I'm a lipstick on a particular day. I just I but I just want I just I would love to see a trans person From the left That's actually convincing You know like There's plenty there's plenty of regular trans people do like I say you that video Do I send you that video that that trans drag queen saying Keep your fucking kids away from our fucking clubs and keep your kids away from our fucking yeah our shit That's really I don't that's that's exactly right No, obviously like I just want one that's in like a good disguise Well, you gotta go to Thailand for that Nothing I want one like you know I'm saying like yeah, I would like to see one That's like convincing I heard a funny story about a dude fucking a trans chick this weekend you did I did but I can't say who it is Because it's someone who's pretty famous on Twitter Who's a conservative I'm not gonna say it dude because it was fucking it was fucking the most absurd thing I've ever seen you can't say the story or you can say the name Well, so let's do the story Well Apparently this dude who's a big fucking like Big voice for let's say the conservative movement. Okay, went to Thailand and fuck the trans Chick lady boy. Yes, not knowing that it was a trans dude Whatever the fuck you know which one you are okay, it's a fucking dude dressed up and as a girl lady boy. Yes And he didn't know it until they were like naked and then he just did it anyway. No, yeah Yeah, man, it's true story apparently lights on I don't fucking know man. I just heard the story and I was definitely like what the fuck Well, that's commitment like you you that's a decision. That's not like a Oh Man, that's rough. I mean that's rough Yeah, well, yeah Well, but other people have been worried too. Yeah, listen If you want to leave leave that just go you leave like if you want to leave listen Here's the truth all these people who have been saying Hitler and fucking He's gonna put us in this and that in this and they're still here They're lying you're full shit. Yeah, cuz if you really believe that you would fucking leave You would have been gone. Yeah been gone November 6th you would have been out. Yeah, yeah They're liars, bro. Well other people who are freaking out. I want to bring this up here quickly too Apparently this headline from Fox News federal employees feeling dread experiencing PTSD Overtrump returned to the White House Per report so federal employees who lived through the first Trump administration Say they are experiencing PTSD over the president elect's return to the White House according to a new report During an appearance on CNN news central national correspondent René Marsh Said federal employees are quote scared and anxious about the possibility Trump will conduct mass firings Early into a second term quote. We are in a dystopian hellscape That is from a federal employee via text message last night And that is the mindset of many of the two million federal workers anticipating Donald Trump's return to office Marsh said Trump on the campaign trail said he would reinstate schedule F a 2020 executive order that would make tens of thousands of federal workers at will employees and thus Easier to remove so even though you're freaking out. I think it's fucking great bring in Tom Homan. Is that him? That's him. That's old. Holy shit dude That's hilarious That guy looks like a real American bro. Yeah, I mean that you I mean bro You don't really get any more American than that maybe Bert Reynolds maybe yeah, that's given some Bert Reynolds by it is bro Hey, listen, I like what that dude has to say a lot of people think he's a br- that's that guy is a fucking old enough to know Reality he understands that not everybody's good. He understands that not everybody's coming to your house for the barbecue He understands that sometimes you got to do hard things that people don't agree with in order to Protect and serve the greater good and there's all these people in this country like we have talked about for many years Who have never experienced anything real in terms of very bad shit Even the people who think they're experiencing bad are a million times better off than people in other parts of the world and so we have A bunch of spoiled people who don't have to deal with criminal elements or the reality of criminals or the savagery of criminals Or the understanding that there are no moral laws amongst these types of people men who are Trying to survive a man who is in a position trying to survive will fucking do anything to survive Okay, to survive they got to reproduce. Where are they going to reproduce if they're not bringing any women over? They answer should be obvious, okay very soon But because people think that everybody's like them and everybody has a good heart and everybody believes that you know people are good They don't fucking understand it and this man has seen enough in his life to understand that these are things that we have to deal with Okay, that's called being a realist We need people like that. We need a lot of people like that in fact That's the man's job in society the man's job in society is to recognize things For what they are for the truth Address them however it need to be addressed to protect everybody else And that's what he's doing and people don't like it because they're they're in this little bubble Called the United States of America where no one starves and everybody's fucking overweight because they They have too much Abundance and not enough like hardship. That's the truth You know people say oh the fucking you know, it's so hard here hard compared to what Compared to who compared to where okay, and when we lose that perspective we end up in a bubble where we don't realize That there are people that will take your shit. They will take your shit. They will take your house They will take your wife. They will take your life They do not fucking care and so I am thankful that men like this still exist who are old school hard and mother fuckers That are gonna say hey, I don't give a fuck what you guys say about me. I'm gonna do this job Even if you hate me for doing it because it's gonna protect your kids I love that guy. I don't even fucking know him. He's fucking awesome man guys jump it on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments But that being said, let's go cruise some of these.

There is An equal and opposite reaction for every action taken and for the last 20 years You and people like you and other people have jammed these things down our throat People like me we've called ourselves patriots. We understand that everybody fits under the American flag It doesn't matter if they're trans. It doesn't matter if they're gay. It doesn't matter if they're black white yellow red brown Who gives a fuck everybody under that flag? Like people like you came along and you started jamming this other flag down our throat and then like 50 more flags And we couldn't keep up. It was confusing and alpha bits and shit. Yeah, so Who started the game? I'm pretty sure that before you people like you came along We were all doing pretty well But you guys came along and you wanted to segregate yourselves and all these little communities and these protected classes and you wanted to Victimize yourselves and get special treatment because you belong to these protected classes No, it's just still America We're all gonna fucking survive. We're all gonna get together. We're all gonna be good under that flag And if you don't want to be a part of that you could fucking move The fuck out of here, okay? How about that second of second ball We do we do leave immigrants along we do not leave illegal migrants alone that come in and get 13,000 dollars on their ebt card when our own veterans are starving on the streets We do not leave illegal migrants alone when they come in and they start committing crime at a mass scale Specifically sexual crimes against women. We do not leave those people along We deport them back to where they came from and if you would like I'm sure we could arrange a seat on one of those planes for you fat Chad My new the extra seatbelt. Yeah, next tender So at least uh, you know, I am listening to my own rhetoric and now you want to be left alone because you are the minority And you are realizing that you're the minority But when when when you thought you were the majority and by the way you've always been the minority When you thought you were the majority you swung this heavy hammer of compliance on everybody Everybody do what we say or you're a bigot you're a racist you're a transphobia you're a homophobic and white people are the problem No, motherfucker People like you were the problem because you came in and you pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed Thinking that you were the majority and come to find out like we've been saying for many years you were the minority And now you're getting pushed back. So that's what's happening blame yourself Listen to your own rhetoric and hopefully people will have enough common sense to where we won't push back so hard that we can't come together to move forward as Americans But I can't guarantee that because I don't speak for everybody. I don't lead everybody I want common sense. I want everybody to be under that flag. I want everybody to be proud of that flag unless you're Fucking with kids or causing crimes or rape and women or doing fucked up shit, which a lot of those people are So who's the dipshit Chad Well, second is next one. This is from Tyler Tyler Tyler Tyler F is outside Tyler F is outside Hmm Tyler F is outside. I mean, do you have anything to say to fat Chad? It Looks like he's got a sweet man bun.

Yeah, it's like a bowl Like an upside down bowl Oh His culture has a boring though probably has a cook cook ring too That whatever man. Yeah, Chad a lot of these people are having problems understanding that they're the minority now Well, I think they feel the pressure. They they they know what's coming. Well, you shouldn't have fucked up That's what I'm like, I think I was on the internet. I don't know five years ago saying the backlash here's gonna be pretty hard Hopefully people will have common sense. Hopefully we won't have what we've had in other situations where this has happened where it like You know communist in certain countries at certain points in time in history have been dragged out of their homes and dragged out of their club Their their jobs and beaten Okay, and that's where communist get when they've been defeated in culture Okay, it's not a ju-thing. It's not a fucking race thing to communist thing So I'd be real careful and I hope people do have some restraint But I'm sure nobody here would miss you if you decided to join your illegal friends wherever the fuck they're going Yeah, I'm sure they'd love to take you Chad Yeah, and by the way, I'm not a mega dipshit asshole I'm not loyal to fucking Trump.

Let's check out this next one Tyler F is outside. He says uh What's this people on the left aren't acting like complete psychopaths and cult members after losing an election like we do There must be some grand conspiracy at play go outside touch grass and take your meds little buddy What? What's he talking about People on the left aren't acting like complete psychopaths and cult members have you have you been on the internet until last week have you met Chad?

Yeah, they're shaving their heads and complete meltdowns that are unnecessary And if we're being honest That's the media's fault the media is to blame for that the media should be sued for the things that they've done They've made there are people In 2024 that are driving around in their cars with masks on They freak out if they go into public and people aren't wearing masks In three four years later after this happened, okay, we have people Who because they lost an election that they had no awareness Of the social shift that they were creating by their obnoxious behavior are now not talking to their families and saying my family's dead to me I'm gonna spit on their graves was one of the tweets. I saw My brother and my dad are dead to me. I'm gonna spit on their graves Over a fucking election Yeah, okay, and who's the psychopaths? Okay, and and you know you throw jay Look what you did during j6 we didn't do anything during j6 nobody brought guns I could promise you we have a real revolution that be fucking guns.

I have three fucking armored vehicles If we were trying to take over the country they'd all three be there With every gun I got and all the people I know and everybody else that knows of it We'd all be there with our shit. That's what the fuck we would do So to say oh, you know you're a cult member you're this or that no I'm just a reasonable American it believes in the Constitution which none of you guys think seems to matter Yeah, no, so touch some grass take your meds little buddy Okay This last comment is from at lando g1775 So great story says uh At target the other day with my family walked in with the first form drink Leaving the store a worker told me I had to pay for it I told her I brought it in with uh, I brought it in and she was making a scene after arguing another co-worker Uh, came and scanned it until they're surprised it didn't ring up Workers hold her they don't sell them at their store. I looked at her and said quote Well, you're fucking should that'd be the only thing worth stealing in here and started out of that That's funny dear By the way you guys are always asking how to support go right into your store like uh lando did here And tell them to carry our shit and uh, you know buy it where you can That's a big help to us. So when you guys say hey, how can I support get yourself some of this first form energy Post it on the internet say I got this here and then tag whoever doesn't have it say fuck you And you're fucking should yeah guys we appreciate you guys seriously for being real-est fans Thank you guys for liking commenting subscribing make sure you guys hit that bell notification on youtube Stay up to date with the latest episodes from rlaf Let me ask you something. Yeah, how could you really look at both sides of what's going on and and say that the right Is the mentally unhidged side? Yeah, I mean there's definitely some fucking wacky do we got some way over there. Yeah, but I mean like bro their entire fucking Beliefs yeah, yeah, and it's a product of the neat the media being completely Irresponsible with their manipulation. Yeah, they've altered these people's reality so far They're gonna have a trouble coping with it. Yeah, it's it's all I get me even just trying to do it like unemotionally like all right What what good policies ideas values are over there? I Can't find one one Can't find it No, I don't need it like dude. I don't understand how these people can How they can like simp for fucking migration like what bro This ain't your country like you're not the ones you didn't fucking make up the rules here We've been living amongst the rules for 250 fucking years Okay, the Constitution says this you don't get to just make up new rules All right, and these people don't protect our country. They don't give a shit This country's not meant for everybody in the world to come to illegally now if they want to come through the actual Real process cool But a lot of those people don't make it through the process because they're criminals or they have bad history of other things You know who knows they get weeded out through the system. That's the point of the system. Yeah It's it's okay. I mean we can argue even with the immigration should we can argue like okay the legal immigration route Like it takes too long. Yeah, like there's no reason like it should take fucking seven years You know, I'm saying like and we can follow by the way let's charge these guys thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars And then let's just go ahead and put 13 grand on these people's ebds right that's what I'm saying like I mean We could like there's things that can be fixed for sure You know, I'm saying but like there's no reason I have to go to a fucking airport and take my shoes off and get cup check by a fucking TSA agent When you got people walking right across the fucking southern board and no problem. Yeah, like it's unreal Yeah, it's unreal Let's get into our second headline guys second headline Got some interest in things on the horizon. Let's talk about them Hello number two reads Biden stumbles multiple times needs a cyst from jail as he struggles to walk on sandy Delaware Beach All right, now this is interesting. Okay, um because there's a chain of events that happened shortly after this video went viral Let's talk about it So President Biden stumbled multiple times and even needed an assist from first lady Jill Biden as he trudged through the sand And there is Delaware Beach house Sunday according to footage of the moment The outgoing commander in chief who's 81 was seemed repeatedly losing his balance as he navigated the unstable sand and roboath beach on Sunday afternoon nearly a week after vice president Kamala Harris lost to former and now future president Donald Trump As at one point As Biden struggled through the deep and uneven sand the first lady took hold of his arm to keep him steady The video captured by C-SPAN showed um now. Let's uh, let's let's check this video out I mean man he's an old man Sands hard to walk in bro. You probably never been on it before You been on the sand. I've been I've been on the sand. How about you look the same as that? Nope I got great balance actually I don't fall No, I believe he does. He's quick on his feet He's been quick on his feet when I needed him Fuck dude remember that time that fucking dude can't grab me. Yeah, I got you bro. Yeah, I got you He jay was over there doing a fucking Dion dance Like you got one Anyway, but uh, man, it's old man. It happens. You know, I get it. That's fine. You know I know tyrant, but yeah, traitor, but I mean it's old man Uh, but there was an interesting thing that happened after that guy posted Um, I would like uh To show the chat Jamal Simmons this guy Okay, he is uh Kamala Harris's uh farmer communications director Okay, uh, um, and now he's saying Biden should step down. Oh, is that what he says and let Harris finish his turn Um, and so yeah, he went on and he actually doubled down on this went to CNN talked about it even more Um, but it started with this tweet. Um, he says Uh, Joe Biden has been amazing But he should fulfill one last promise to be transitional Biden should resign and make Kamala Harris the first woman president It turned tables on trump keep Kamala from presiding over j6 Uh, make it easier for next woman to run hashtag trail blaze podcast No First of all, let me what woman wants Kamala Harris to be the first woman Okay, how about we have Tulsi Gabbert as the first one Someone who's an actual intelligent badass veteran patriot of this country. How about that? No, let's take away that opportunity that is potentially coming down the road And give it to this person who's never done a fucking thing never got a vote to even be in the position that she's in That yeah, that's really great for women. Let's celebrate women with that How would you women who listen to the show feel about that would you rather her be given some sort of participation trophy Or would you rather wait a little bit and have it be someone who is completely exceptional and deserving of the position Undeniable. Yes, this fucking beat it out. Yeah, it's it's insane the whole comment is reflective of these people's misguided views Of the world it goes back to what that guy said about identity politics and cruise the comments that is you guys People think that there is some sort of award for being the first there is no award for being the first unless you finish the race first or you are the best or you win On an equal playing field. They're gonna say take everybody else out the race correct Moving everybody out of the race and be like oh, she's first That is not a win in fact if I was a woman I'd be insulted by the suggestion of this yeah One more than anything. Well, that's the interesting thing. So I've been looking into this I haven't seen a lot of women actually like you know jump on this wagon here. It's been a bunch of simp dudes actually Like this guy. Well, dude. This is the same. They're these people are all the same DJ. Yeah, they they fucking virtue signal further They said down when they pee They got their pants. Listen dude. This this goes so much deeper than that This is misguided understanding of men and women dynamics, okay These guys think that by simping like this it somehow makes them more attractive to women It somehow makes them desirable or intelligent or and that's not reality, bro Like women don't respect simp shit like this. They don't they don't respect it women Watch strong leadership women Value strong leadership whether it comes from a woman or a man, right? Okay, it doesn't matter If a woman or a man is president of the United States in my opinion as long as they deserve it and they're the best option Okay, Kamala Harris is undeniably not the best option for fucking anybody I wouldn't let her run my company for a single fucking day Which is evident by her raising a billion dollars and ending up 20 million and fucking death I got that for you But there's another Andy that disagrees with you. Andy does he yeah, Andy's a fucking idiot Andy Ostrowey. Yeah, story I 1,000 percent agree with what Jamal Simmons just said on CNN that hashtag Biden should immediately resign and allow hashtag Kamala Harris to become the 47th president Let's at least allow America to finally have a woman in the Oval Office even if only yes for two and a half Yes, so respectful of women She is too ahead of it's only for two and a half months Andy you really love women you really care about women right, you know, right? Like dude, this is such absurd shit. It's it's not man It's no difference than the blatant racism these people spew. They're not even aware they spew it Okay, what's more for women? Hey, let's give her this position because at least we'll have her for two and a half months and we can say She's the first woman or Hey, let's vote for a truly badass woman to come in and wreck shit and run the country and win And we can all get behind her. What's what's more pro woman? You see what I'm saying? These motherfuckers don't even know what they're saying. They're a bunch of fucking no nut having morons That think that they're somehow going to be more attractive or be more accepted by these people for being honestly like just Total weak cowardly low-team men. That's that's reality dude like Nobody in the right mind who actually respects women Things that Kamala Harris is a great example of women leadership. Yeah, dude. It's sad. Let me actually though like real shit Okay, because I've been looking at these these headlines and like let's just start to become a talking narrative now It's not gonna happen Joe Biden fucking hates Kamala brother. That's my point. You think Joe Biden is gonna give her a fuck Joe Biden in my opinion very likely voted for Trump I'm even if it meant his own demise because he is a trader. He has sold the country down the drain He's taken a bunch of money from different countries. That's all proven. It doesn't change the fact But he's so old. I don't think he gives a fuck and I think he hates her so much that he's like fuck you And by the way Obama hates her too Obama hasn't returned a phone call from her since after since the election ended They haven't had one correspondence Kamala Harris's campaign is reached out consistently and they have not replied or responded and guess who Joe Biden's best fucking friend is Obama they fucking hate her because she ruined their good deal Obama Clinton Biden that's the cabal okay Those people are the international group of traders that all work together. They're a uniparty George Bush is in there too She ruined that for them. They fucking hate her. There's not a chance in the world that Joe Biden is doing that. Yeah, it's not happening all right Well, let's talk about Kamala a little bit more because there's some interesting Some interesting things is happening. You did mention that she's about 20 million in debt Um, yeah, let's let her run the country. I think that's great. Yeah, you go from a billion dollars exactly how they've been running it Yeah, I go from a billion dollars in the plus To oh and 20 to oh and 20. Yeah, she could not run a single company of mine not not the big ones not the small ones She could not run them. Yeah, she couldn't run a single fucking retail store of ours. Bro one of our retail stores. She couldn't run For one fucking day. Yeah, no, dude. It's crazy now. There's something interesting that's happened I would like everybody to just be aware of That's going on right now with the Kamala Harris Campaign. I'm not sure if you saw this But apparently according to at blue They are now transitioning whatever money that they do have left to go towards a recount to go towards a recount Yeah, that's a lie That's a lie. They don't intend to recount that's all that that's just the angle that they could pick to try and raise more money So what they're trying to do is create a narrative that appeals to these psychos that are freaking the Fuck out where they'll go drain their bank accounts hoping that there's some sort of you know chance that Trump will get into office It's just another thing fear mongering play for her to steal money so that she can get herself out of the hole and honestly if you donate to that You're getting what you deserve because it ain't gonna happen. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a straight up scavenger move Okay, yeah, I mean, that makes complete sense man You know, but like how else is she gonna get people donate to it? Yeah I'm just think it through yeah How 20 million dollars lot of fucking mind that's a shit ton of money. Okay, a billion dollars Is a shit ton of money 20 million is too and she don't have it. Yeah, okay so When we sit here and we say oh man, she's 20 million in the hole Well, she's 20 million in the hole and she don't have 20 million You know, I'm saying her the fucking brother of of uh of her husband is a billionaire. Yeah, why is he not paying? the 20 million You know, I'm saying this and there's a lot of questions I have Um, I want to show you this real quick. This is from Justin Blinson on Twitter um, we kind of just did an overall outline of both campaign spending right yeah So if we go to Trump's campaign Okay, Trump raised for his 2024 campaign election series 381.54 million dollars, okay He spent 345.42 million dollars and out of all of that money only 10.4 million dollars will spend on staff Okay, you go to Kamala's campaign she raised over a billion dollars Mind you she was only running for president for how many months like four five Yeah, four four months so in four months she raised a billion dollars and spent and spent every fucking penny Plus some yeah plus 20 million now what was interesting to me Let's just dive into this because I think this is great, okay, so she spent the saying that she spent 1.37 billion Okay, but she raised one billion spent 1.37 billion Where did that money go to okay? Let's talk about the first half of this billion. I guess um It's now come out. It's unniable right she had all of these celebrity endorsements right she had all these fucking concerts They were all paid for yeah, they were all but they defied these people didn't come in there for free That's right right. Well, don't you remember we telling you that these were just paid influencer campaigns? That's all that was didn't I say that about a hundred times Um, the other interest they she spent six figures Rebuilding an entire set of a fucking podcast Like this set here when she went on call it that that's a fake set like they built that just Just so she could how that's that cost six figures Who the fuck built it You know, Sam I mean I'll be honest with ars is way better. I don't think it costs ars is way better and I know it didn't cost six figures Anyway, I mean it's just uh, well, it is what it is um You know these people don't give a fuck they run around and this is what they do with your money What you got to understand they run around they don't question the price they see it as unlimited money Money's no object money's no problem. They don't count it. They don't care. Yeah, you know Abillion dollars dude all these people that fucking campaign for her for that money they It's very short-sighted because on the back end they ruined their reputation They ruined their ability to make endorsements in the future Yeah, I'm saying yeah, I mean Just a billion dollars though, bro No, it's also saying yeah, Trump didn't pay Rogan to go on fucking Rogan show he didn't pay Elon Actually spending money for on him. Yeah You don't sound like that just goes to show you where the true horse power is that man You're having to buy all of these fucking endorsements and you still lost listen man It's it's a rough. It's a rough thing for a lot of these people to understand that They have been lied to Manipulated cheated by technology fake technology bot systems algorithms To believe that they are the majority and we in the common person Has been manipulated to think the opposite that we are all alone that culture has passed us by And that we think old-fashioned and nobody else agrees with us and they've used that same manipulation to make us think that So they've empowered them and they've squashed our patriotism our belief our culture and these people are now realizing Well, we realized a long time ago where we walk around in the public and we're like who the fuck Is with this shit who are these people where is this Except they walk around thinking that everybody's with them you see what I'm saying so they're realizing a very hard lesson right now That they've been their beliefs and their culture and their their belief system is a lie and it's been perpetrated on them maliciously for a cause and then a lot of them haven't figured that out yet a lot of them still haven't figured out that They are the useful idiots of communism Like if you can't figure out what the fuck's going on right now you need to figure this out If you went along with all this shit that was popular on the left side of the aisle for the last 10 years And you thought that that was Legitimately the way it was and you figured that you know, we were going down this progressive path Where you know, we make up our own rules and it's not the truth. It's my truth and everything's a matter of perspective And there is no real facts and you know truth everything is up for debate Those people have been completely manipulating completely lied to and they're gonna have a hard time understanding How to come out of that like how do you come out of that? How do you how do you come out of and this is why I think the media should be held accountable for what they did They lied to people so much they manipulated people so much that they have created this mental illness where people cannot see the reality of the world And it's dangerous dude because now we have You know people melting down not talking to their families not able to function society These people are legitimately scared. They're not they're not at a point now where they're like, oh, I'm right They're fucking terrified. It's not fake. Yeah, it's not fake that they're terrified. They're terrified Why should they be terrified? What if people like us ever done to them What if regular American people ever done to them nothing? But they've been lied to over and over and over to where now they believe that you know, we're gonna be riding on horseback and fucking Scalping them or something. I don't fucking know what they think But it's wild man. It's crazy dude. I want to I have empathy for them. I have empathy for them. I do No, I have empathy because they are the victims of a trillion dollar propaganda machine and that's not okay You know where they where they say hey, we don't want to unite with you. Fuck you. You're evil We don't think they're evil. We just think that they're not informed that they don't understand what's actually going on They believe we are evil Okay, and that's a big problem because if they actually believe that there's gonna be no uniting with them whatsoever So where how do we solve that problem? Well the media has to be held accountable publicly and there has to be a truth and reconciliation publicly about what the facts are and what they aren't because there's been so much lying That people don't know what's true and what's not true And that's fucked up dude. Yeah, because now we have families destroyed Now we have people literally terrified that so go to things giving you and that people You know, they're patriotic Americans or domestic terrorists or they're gonna, you know Burn you at the stake or some crazy shit. Did you see that case about that dude who killed his whole fucking family? He killed his family and his His I guess he had an ex-wife that had a kid with him And then a wife that had two kids with him and then he killed himself So he killed two five six people Because he believed and I read his fucking tweets He believed that religious zealots From the conservative side we're going to burn him at the stake That's where he fucking believed where did he come up with that He came up with that from the media's relentless propagation of this absurd Shit that isn't true and it's costing people their lives. It's costing people their families People are shooting and committing crimes because of this What about all the mass shootings that have happened over the last four or five years who committed those right? It wasn't Republicans. It wasn't well-adjusted people most of these people were of trans ideology They they have been manipulated to believe that people are out to get them and they're gonna kill them And they're gonna put them in jail Bro when all we're asking is hey, just don't go to school and read books in your drag outfit Don't give kids the you know Johnny sucks his first dick book when they're fucking five years old That's all we're asking stay to fuck away from the fucking kids In fact, there wasn't a problem at all with it until the last four or five years where the kids Shit started getting mixed in with it And if we're gonna blame someone we should put blame into the people who wouldn't call out the pedophilia Aspect of the trans community Yeah, okay, because there's a lot of pedophiles that hide in that community by their own admission There is plenty of trans people and plenty of gay people who are like hey these fucking sick pedophiles are trying to hide under our umbrella And we're not with that and they understand that it makes it dangerous for them So let's really examine what's going on here and how it was created it wasn't created By us I didn't do it you didn't do it Trump didn't do it Who did it? Oh the media and what ideology? As the media been spewing this entire time communist Okay, so we have a big problem here that is going to be very hard to reconcile socially Because these people are unwilling to admit that they are the fucking issue just like whenever we're watching these people melt down And you know like I said earlier in the show 30% of white men Went over to the Republican side well Yeah, because you call him the fucking devil and you say that they're responsible for slavery And you say that they're racist just for being white and Whiteness is the problem and you say that for fucking the last six seven years and you expect them to vote for you Yeah, like bro, that's not a effective strategy Well, you tell black people that they you know they're too dumb to get you get out of the computers and use computers They're actually they're gonna say fuck off and then 25% of them leave the Democrat you know I mean what do you expect? Well, dude, I mean that's their strategy and it's ineffective and you know These these people still haven't figured it out yet because now they're online you got joy read online saying that the problem with The reason Kamala lost the election was because of the racism that black people have or the race like Bro, they're just hammering down and hammering down and hammering down more which shows you how fucking stupid the talking heads actually are Like you're gonna lose you already lost. It's not coming back. You're not gonna revive this social movement This social movement of woeckness is fucking over dude your credibility for propagating it is over It's over Okay, and that's evidence by who won with what form of media the traditional MSM is fucking over dude. It's done It's over The people who are gonna give the news are gonna be people like myself people like Rogan and you know that The hundred other great podcasts out there that bring this shit to your face every single fucking day That's who's gonna be the news now and you did it to yourselves. So Look off. Yeah Um Real quick. I want I want to I want to dive into this a little bit because I thought this was interesting So back back to this analysis of campaign spending right trump only spent 10.4 million dollars on staff. Yeah Come a little spent 582.5 Million dollars on staff in four months. Yeah What's that tell you how is that possible? It's not possible. So what's it tell you Well, I think it tells me some stuff. Yeah, I think it's I let's dive into it. Yeah, let's dive into it I think I went to I found this place. This was interesting the real numbers tracking crowd sizes at presidential rallies, right? I mean, this is more of a left-leaning source where they try to say by the way Kamala Harris's staff You just so we're clear They tried to say That Kamala Harris's average crowd size her average rallies was 13,000 Okay, that was her average crowdsets. You know what they tried to say trump trump's average crowd size was like 5,000 Well, again, I swear to God. It's what I got but Over half a billion dollars in four months on your staff What makes somebody staff? What makes someone staff is it a W2 is a 1099? You know and it reminded me of of this that came out not too long ago I'm not sure if you've seen this clip. Let's check this out where they say that Per GPS tracking Okay, 5,000 and three mobile devices that Kamala Harris's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina Okay, on Thursday afternoon Out of those 3600 came from the Georgia mainly Atlanta, Georgia area Okay, here this description. We're gonna get to some data from the Kamala rally 5,000 and three mobile devices that Kamala Harris's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday afternoon It appears over 3600 came from Georgia mainly Atlanta, Georgia and approximately 720 from Savannah, Georgia So that's a North Carolina rally with almost 80% of the attendees being from Georgia After you do the math, that's only 600 or so local people from North Carolina that attended That's that's all who shows up and you're planning to what get 80 something million votes again Something ain't right and then all these people come from buses and it's kind of weird because at the Trump events You don't really have like organized buses like that people just kind of show up and talk on their own But at the Kamala rally there's just these lines of buses at every event which is weird and a lot of the people are also the same People that attend multiple rallies can you read those tweets? Any of the same ones from previous event because this guy's tracking the cell phones I guess and he says 90% have been to three plus rallies 54% were even at Arizona and Nevada rallies so that's all the same so you so you have that right and just for the hell of it I looked up some flight prices right and the average flight Uh from Atlanta, Georgia to Charlotte North Carolina averages about a $230 Okay You added in these buses that they've been taken like this clip here Kamala Harris is in New Hampshire It kind of became news this week no details north Hampton, New Hampshire At a brewery north Hampton and yet I'm getting and it's a New Hampshire event north Hampton happens to be in New Hampshire We're getting listener calls iWitness accounts that buses on route one are coming in from Massachusetts Uh full of Massachusetts People one would presume going to the event Sue Paula door one of our listeners witnessing this on route one this morning good morning Sue So you have these buses that are coming in all right now you take the again the average crowds as they're staying 13,000 Times that by the average flight ticket you know 230 bucks on the round trip It very quickly adds up to half a billion fucking dollars I mean she did multiple fucking rallies. I mean even just seven where she quoted she had 30,000 people in attendance I know for a fact this is true You know how I know know how you know yeah you guys don't know how I know but I have eyes and ears I should say it like this our show has an army of eyes and ears who may or may not be In the government mm-hmm who don't like what's going on? Yeah To listen to us but not illegally They're legally listening And we may have a number of those guys that I don't know send us pictures and evidence and things that are happening behind the scene Is that I am not At liberty to share with you, but this is a fact Do you know what up do you know why else it's 582 million Because this is the exact same shit they do with Ukraine They take your money they pretend they're buying a fucking missile and then the missile cost five times as much and they keep the rest of the money Yeah, so yeah I mean half a billion dollars in four months bro It's pretty large amount. That's what they would have done with our country too, man. Well, it's like you know They don't care. Yes, she can when is that a camo print on her fucking shirt and yes, she can huh No Yes, she can Man, I tell you what dude like you could say whatever you want about Oprah, but fuck you better not huh?

No she's forgotten where she came from and who the fuck she's Attached to and where and who the people are that that made her. Mm-hmm. No guys jump it on this combo I just know what you guys think down in the comments I was that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline that's crazy Oprah look Oprah 70 years old bro It's crazy. You think she's hot You just said you wanted to suck a dick Right before we turn the fucking cameras on it's my first time out the media propagation We're talking yeah DJ was talking I'm going to Thailand What me Going this weekend. Yeah Guys any third of final headline number three this one was crazy. I know you've seen this But let's talk about it man FEMA Fires official who told hurricane relief workers to skip trump houses. Did you see this shit? Hmm the female worker yeah, I did bro. Yeah, I mean it doesn't surprise me but fuck The FEMA supervisor who ordered relief workers to bypass the homes of Donald Trump supporters While administering hurricane aid in Florida has been fired following the daily wire report female administrator Deanne Criswell announced Saturday that supervisor Marnie Washington had been fired after she ordered federal employees under her supervision to quote Avoid homes advertising trump as they canvassed like placet florida to identify residents who could qualify for federal aid According to messages shared with the daily wire by whistleblowers these instructions were given both verbally and in writing Multiple government employees revealed quote More than 22,000 FEMA employees every day adhered to FEMA's core values In our dedicated to helping people before during and after disasters often sacrificing time with their own families to help disaster survivors Recently one FEMA employee departed from these values to advise her survivor assistance team to not go to homes with yard sign supporting president Elect Trump Criswell said in the statement quote This is a clear violation of FEMA's core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation This was reprehensible. I want to be clear to all of my employees and the American people this type of behavior in action will not be tolerated if FEMA and we will hold people accountable if they violate these standards of conduct she had it But yeah, so I mean this lady Marnie Criswell sorry Marnie Washington. This was the tweet that was or the message that was sent out Well, it says you know, she's given orders to her team implement best practices Not one goes anywhere alone Avoid homes advertising Trump practice de-escalation and preventative measures community like Who the fuck do you think you are? Well, this is what people think they can do when for the last number of years the law and order aspect of society has been completely abandoned when you take Consequences away From the enforcement of real laws This is what you end up with you end up with people making up their own rules You know when you persecute More than half the country because they want to vote a certain way or maybe they don't want to take a vaccine or maybe They have their own Belief systems and you throw cancel culture on top of it And then you don't enforce any sort of laws at all You know or the laws even become backwards like in the case of Daniel Daniel Penny in New York This is what you end up with you end up with people who feel emboldened and empowered to do whatever they feel like Right out in the open with no consequences and uh if i'm not mistaken. She's black woman Okay, and if i'm not mistaken where the hurricane hit was Mainly a white area of Trump supporters now. What if the situation were reversed? Right? What if I was the FEMA director and I and a tornado hit downtown st. Louis. I said hey Don't fucking worry about where they're at Because you know they're Biden supporters. Let's not worry about them. What what would happen to me right what's the double standard there the double the double standard there is that I would be crucified I would be drugged through the media. I would never ever ever be able to get a job again. I would probably go to jail But she's gonna get a fucking slap on the hand Fair fair. We want one hundred percent okay Kim Gardner same thing She was a sorrows funded attorney Prosecutor here in st. Louis she did whatever to fuck she wanted what she get slap on the wrist Okay, so until people start getting Real consequences for these kind of decisions where they just circumvent the laws or the rules and decide on their own Whether that's for against any group Doesn't matter what their identity is it doesn't matter what their politics are we are fucking Americans until we get equal Justice and enforcement across all spectrums of the law we won't return to that because there's a very clear double standard in society actually a few of them Okay, the biggest one being that if you vote for Trump or you're a Not in line with the liberal agenda Then you know you're subject to a different set of standards than they are and and I think that's ending because I think people are starting to realize That with Trump getting more votes as a Republican candidate than any Republican candidate in the history of the United States Okay, they're starting to realize holy shit We are the minority and we're not the minority by a little we're the minority by a lot Well, one thing I was gonna say to that too. That scares these people that is very very scary and like to that point bro People people on the majority need to start acting like the fucking majority Well, that's it. I mean listen We talk about that pendulum swinging and here's the dangerous part like at that happen your situation where you know skipping Biden support as houses Culture will be fine with it at this point. Yeah, that's right and that's the dangerous thing You know I'm saying it's like roll like like guys A disaster is a fucking disaster. It has no time. I agree with you bro. Like I'm with you as dangerous man Yeah, no listen dude We can need to remove the criminal element from our from our country We need to get the law straight We need to enforce the laws that are on the books. We need to reduce the size of government and The most important part which is going to be the hardest part is we're going to have to realize that these people have been the victims of a trillion dollar propaganda machine and they have been Led to believe that reality is not reality and that's why we're having these meltdowns and shit And dude, I know there's a lot of people that are super pissed off. I'm one of them. I'm super pissed off Like I'm outspoken as fuck bro. Nobody's gotten hammered away I've gotten hammered on the internet for the last fucking 10 years not I mean, maybe a couple other people like Trump and maybe a couple other people But at the end of the day, I've never shied away even when it was unpopular and um You know, so I know what these people are about and I know what they do they call your business They try to cancel you they try to fuck your life up You know in my case, I had a dude break into my house and right welcome to the no-fly list on my fucking wall Penn how many stalkers have I had that are fuck? I mean like dude It's been a major expense and admit I know better than most people What the fuck these people are about and they're fucking insane, okay? That being said We have to make room for the common sense people to come and realize that They have been lied to and they have been manipulated and if these people are willing to say hey fuck dude Like I was fooled. I had a reasonable You know expectation to believe the media I think we got to make room for these people to to come over and say okay. Let's get back together Let's move forward as Americans and you know the times I've said that on the show what happens these same people like fuck you We're not uniting with you. Okay. Well then let's be real you're standing on an island by yourself. You don't understand it yet Because all the common sense people are coming together We all want to be able to be economically successful. We want to be safe. We want to be left alone We don't want to be burdened by obnoxious Tyranical tax codes in our government. We don't want 60% of our money finding its way to the the government. We all want the same fucking things We want our tax money to be reinvested into our neighborhoods and to our people and to our culture. We all want the same shit Okay, so all of the people that want that we're gonna get together. It's not an option anymore Like you you people melting down on the internet It's not an option. This is happening and you're gonna be on the outside Okay, and you're gonna be looked at as the fucking whack job that you fucking are Most likely bullied well dude. Yeah, bullying is gonna happen cuz dude that's their that's their that's their that's right Let's do I do listen part of me is like fuck them, but part of me is also like hey man Let's not Take this as far as it's been taken in the past where you know people are drug out of their houses and fucking Be even killed on the rebound of these cultural movements. That's what happens. Yeah Yeah, now one last little thing I want to add in about FEMA that I thought was quite interesting You remember the narrative like especially like in in Nashville and North Carolina. Oh hold on one more thing With that all that being said Some of these people are uncurable Some of these people are communist to the core and communist to the core will lie to your fucking face to get what they want so Just like all the sudden these people felt safe to come out and show their face They weren't just coming out and they didn't just show up. They've been subverting the fucking mission For years and years and years and years and years think of the college professors that are straight up Communists that are fucking basically saying it now to our kids But they've been professors for 30 40 years. They didn't they didn't start out freedom loving Americans They were communist then and they worked and worked and worked and worked and worked to work to subvert culture to the point where now It's acceptable to even say things like that and uh, you know Your days are over motherfuckers one way or the other so you can either get on the pro-America Freedom train or get run the fuck over by it either way. I don't really give a shit But you know, that's what's coming for you and we're not gonna forget who you are We're not gonna forget forget the persecution that you've put people through. It's not gonna happen man. No Um now one other thing Quickly I want to talk about with FEMA Because if we go back remember what happened In the Asheville North Carolina right like these towns were destroyed Bliturate it right still destroyed That was a narrative that started coming out that hey FEMA was running running out of money Remember that that narrative and that was an overwhelming swell of civilian support People coming out of their own personal pockets to help these people that's still going on today by the way Um, but FEMA was running out of money Okay, and there was this whole concern like we're out of money. We don't have enough money. We're out of money And I thought that was interesting Um, and I thought about that when I saw this article this headline Concerns amount as FEMA selects a scotta airport for massive emergency hub 350 semi-trailers with equipment set to serve six Michigan counties in preparation For emergency situations. Did you see this? No. All right Uh, a scotta Township a small Michigan community has been selected by the federal emergency management agency or FEMA as a key emergency staging area for northern Michigan with plans to house And 50 semi-trailers of emergency equipment at the local airport the FEMA emergency hub established to serve six counties In the event of an emergency I have stirred a mix of interest and concern among Americans the announcement Was actually made a couple of weeks ago On October 28 Where supervisor Bill Palmer confirmed the news of FEMA selection um of worth Smith airport Um of this controversial initiative um, here's a map of the airport. Okay, everything that's highlighted there uh, in uh uh In the uh in the in the in the plots these are all FEMA plans where you know the one to the red those are avia Aviation industrial or business development for FEMA Um, there's a couple of yellow boxes the FEMA's designating as the business only development um and then aviation um The FEMA's taken over this entire airport Um, and nobody's talking about it And my question is if we were just running out of money a couple of weeks ago How the fuck are they paying and affording to take over hundreds of acres of this small little town to serve six counties for some emergency situation that nobody's talking about What what's the reasoning? Are they giving a reasoning? Yeah, they're just saying this for you know to prepare for In the event of an emergency and that's only supposed to serve six counties in Michigan What emergency are they dealing with not saying? Hmm I mean, that's a good point Just it's weird It's weird keep throwing the back in and you're uh Your burners there. I don't know what's I honest it's hard for me to keep my finger on what's been going on with the The hurricane relief shit But it ain't good and these people are suffering still they're gonna be suffering for a long time. It's starting to get cold there There's still elderly people living in the elements And people have forgotten about it people have stopped talking about it the the news cycle has stopped talking about it And apparently FEMA has moved on to doing other things Dude our military should be on the ground maybe some of them are But from what I've heard from a lot of people that are there there's not much help and that's fucking bullshit Okay, when we're sending trillion or billions of dollars might as well be trillions everywhere in the fucking world Accept our own people How is that acceptable to anybody It's not it's not acceptable to anybody and it goes into this whole Thing that we were just talking about about how they have utilized technology And social narratives that they can create on demand through the propping up of certain social aspects and trends on the internet and the suppression of others They have created a false reality where nobody agrees with the things they're doing But we are made to believe that there are people that agree And it's not true. So it's okay. Yes, right so so they're able to get out of these things Without any accountability because the people like us who all are like fuck This is crazy. We all believe That there's this other group of people out there that disagree with us that they're listening to when in reality There's not these people are just acting on their own doing their own things serving their own interests that keep them in power and keep them Rich and making money and You know all I could say is I hope this shit changes for real. I mean, it's looking it's looking okay But I still have the opinion and I am still of the opinion this my personal opinion this I do not have nobody's told me this nobody's given me information on this. This is just my own deductive reasoning I do not feel fully comfortable Believing that Trump is even going to be inaugurated into the presidency Okay, the social media and the mainstream media narrative that has been put out by the typical left pundits is Iranian assassination plot that has been jammed down our throat over and over and over and over and they were talking about it this morning on liberal media outlets okay It is my opinion that They will try to assassinate Donald Trump between now an inauguration or shortly after inauguration By blaming Iran for his assassination and Then getting all the people who voted for Trump in a patriotic frenzy Exactly like they did post 9-11 and then try to go to war with the Middle East again Saying they killed your guy we have to go to war And then if we think about what they get for that they get all the things they want they get rid of Trump They get their war and They get to say hey look It's free and fair elections Trump won What do you what are you crying about and then they can move on down the future stealing elections running their play Saying what do you I thought we settled this right so that that is what concerns me I believe that's a very real possibility and I think if you're in the Trump camp especially if you're Donald Trump We need to be very fucking careful right now because these people are acting way too nice Way too calm way too reasonable They know something's going to happen. It reminds me very very much How they behaved pre-COVID if you remember pre-COVID you had a lot of these politicians in December of that year Which is why I even started this fucking show December 2019 We had a lot of politicians and a lot of media players saying don't worry. He's not getting reelected There's no chance. He's getting reelected And I didn't really understand what they were talking about but I felt weird about it I felt like fuck dude you my fungers got something going and then COVID happened right and I get the same feeling now that I have then And the same feeling that are the same perspective because I what I witnessed during 9-11 9-11 I fell for it like a 9-11 dude. I was like fuck yeah, let's go Flat and turned the Middle East into glass and I was behind it Okay, but I was uninformed and I didn't know and I didn't realize our own people would lie to us like this But what I'm seeing here Reminds me an awful lot of the black swan of 9-11 And I would not put a pass these people okay, they're talking they keep talking by the way around came out and said Your government's making that up that is now what we're doing and they've come out and said that Like they've taken responsibility for plenty of things. Yeah, like when they kill mother fuckers They say yeah, we fucking did that. They just yeah, yeah, yeah So and they they've come out flat out said that our government is lying to us And you could take that for what it's worth. I don't know you know, I don't trust our government anymore. I trust theirs. Yeah but When you when you look at how are these people gonna get their way? That's the plan that gets them their way Kill Trump Lamed on Iran get everybody to go to war at the Middle East and then claim the elections were free and fair because Trump won and if they weren't free and fair he couldn't have won Which is some funky business going on with those. Oh, yeah, I mean we talk I had tomorrow The point is is like dude, I'm very concerned about it and Not many people are talking about it. Yeah, man guys tell us what you guys think down in the comments. Let us know That being said man, let's get to our final second of the show. We got thumbs up at dumbest fuck That's where we bring a headline and we talk about it to get one of those two options This is an interesting one Love just hear your thoughts on this It's about the election election night searches Specifically on point hub Point hub reveals each states tap election night searches and you won't believe what Florida was looking at I probably believe it out.
