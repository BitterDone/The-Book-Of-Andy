What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate. It is what it is. I'm not a professional podcaster. I'm an amateur podcast. We are amateurs and comedian amateurs but you have businesses to run man. We got other shit going on. Yeah, you know a lot of stuff. Now I do want to I feel like we do need to address something. That is I'm gonna be honest and it's kind of other me. Yeah, what's that? Well, so you know I I spent my day tapping into you know one of my sides. And I was able to find this. This is a for those of you on audio. This is an OG grape smash. Where did you find that? I can't I'm not gonna tell you. I stole it. From where? I've been trying you must be a better stealer than me. Well, so you know I got this. I'm like you know we're gonna you know little DJ pride day put the grape out on the table and then I notice you have the black can. That's right. And I'm always out black in you baby. See that. We got to talk about we all know who the weird Tadeh we all know who we all know who the blacker host is. You know what I went through to get this photo right bro. You know, like you just show up with the black hands right. Hey, just put on the tape. That's the same size though. That's XL baby. Bro, the best I haven't tried that flavor though. Huh? I haven't tried that flavor. It's mystery flavor. Yeah. I heard it's good though. Yeah, it is good. Yeah, I like to grape the best though. Grape is old. That bro when I tell you what I had to go through to get this. I'm not gonna tell you but if I did tell you, you'd be involved about like holy holy all right welcome back. Pay the fee guys. Yeah. Yeah, don't forget to pay the fee. Don't be a whole try the show man. All right. Yeah. Yeah. We got a lot to cover today. We do. Got a lot to cover man. Let's get into it. I wanted to bring this up. I just thought this was you know funny. You know, people are always trying to figure out ways to reinvent the wheel. Do shit easier. And for you know, a man of zero compromises, I wanted to get your thought your your your your your take on this. Get your thoughts. Human washing machine uses AI to hose down your filthy body because people are now too lazy to shower. What? Okay. Yeah. No, I didn't you. Yeah, that's it. Oh, that's it. I don't get it. Yeah, there's a you thought the Japanese toilet was advanced. Japanese showerhead firm science co has put the pod and tied pod after inventing an AI powered washing machine of the future that is purported to give people the ultimate bath. Quote, we're about 70% there. While discussing the when the device will be available at a lecture at the Osaka Health Care Pavilion in late October, it's dubbed the Mirai Ningen Sintakuki, the cutting edge shower capsule is completely enclosed like a hygiene based cryogenic chamber and takes just 15 minutes to wash and dry the user. 15 minutes. That's three minutes. That's fucking three times as fast as I take shower now. Yeah, I don't take long shower. No, I get in there. I fucking hit the butt crap, hit the weiner area and then the armpits got to spread the cheeks. Yeah, that's right. That's my question. Does this thing spread the cheeks for you? Like does it get in the crevice? It looks like it might. Like what if it's that thing? Oh, is that the whole pod? That's the whole pod. Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, I don't think it does. That's the whole pod. So you're telling me that this is better. Is that origami? You got origami over there? I'm an origami fan. What'd you make? Sorry for the interruption folks. What'd you make there, buddy? So everybody was making paper airplanes here. What'd you make a goose? No, it's a crane. Oh, crane. But I thought making a plane would be too too stereotypical for making a plane would be too stereotypical. Yeah, exactly. So I opted for something different. Yeah, something a little less trending. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's beautiful. I had two water bottles here. I moved one just to be safer. Yeah, so you didn't draw any. Yeah, yeah. I got it. No conspiracies here. Yeah. So anyhow, very nice. Bro, what? I don't even get it. Anyway, so you're telling me that this is a solution to something that already isn't a problem. Right. Right. Right. You can sit in this and get your but do you remember that fucking hotel we stayed at in Boston when we went across from Boston comments, the fucking four seasons. Yeah, I had the bidet. Yeah, that crazy toilet. Did you use it? I didn't use it. No, I didn't have one. Oh, you didn't have one of those? You're lying. Yeah, you did. No, I didn't. All the rooms, I don't know. Oh, just the fucking, just the pimps, just the pimper rooms. I mean, my room was fucking nice. Yeah. But it was just like the answer. I didn't have the fucking butt squirter. I wish. Yeah. I've never tried one, actually. Well, bro, they got heated heated seats. You know, but the problem is the heated seats is like when you fucking do your business and they're smells way worse. Yeah. It makes it like cook or something. And hey, right. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, toilet's a pretty simple man. I mean, it's like a hole and make the shit go away. Yeah. You know, I don't know why you would spend all this money trying to develop something that is more difficult to use than an actual shower. I mean, it's very simple. It's a simple process to get in. And this takes longer. Like, okay, now if it was like, listen, like you get in this thing, you know, spread your cheeks and a clean gym, like fucking 60 seconds. That'd be different. That'd be different. Maybe do we have some jets in this shit? Yeah. You know, but yeah, I don't know. What is it with people that don't fucking like to take showers? That is it. I love showers. It's nasty. Yeah. Now, do Japanese people take less showers? I always thought Japanese people were like pretty clean. They're pretty clean. Yeah. I mean, every day, I take you list type people. They got the one toilets were like the public toilets, the fucking paper, like automates, like, generally, yeah, I give you a new piece of paper every time. But maybe they're just tired. All these dirty Americans. That's what it is. I can feel the Americans. They won't even take a shower. Let's put them in the cell. Yeah. But I just thought it was interesting. You know, the shit people come up with, man, I don't know guys tell us what you guys think. Let us go down to the comments with that being said, the fuck it can be too lazy to take a shower. Oh, I mean, listen, I know there's people like this people out there, bro. Yeah. There are people that are like, oh, man, that guy's only successful because he got lucky. You need to get lucky. Find your way to a fucking shower, buddy. It'd be a good, good place to start. Yeah. You ever notice like their hair, it's like, it's all fucking matted together and shit. And these aren't like homeless people. These are like, you know, like, God showers. Yeah. There's like a certain fucking take one musk. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I had a guy like I used to work with a guy like that. He didn't believe in it. Really? Yeah. But like, in like, over time, like, you know, how he says is like, it creates his own, like, natural deodorant and all that. Is that me? No, no, I don't worry. The other no, I worked at the summer camp. And I don't worry, the other because I want my musk be everywhere. I mean, I did it. It's like marking a tree. I just marked the tree. Yeah. Yeah. I do it. My armpits. All right. Oh, weird. Huh? Is that weird? I mean, it's a, you know, it's peculiar. Okay. That's for the right. Not all the way to weird though. Yeah. No, I would say all the way there. I've seen worse. Yeah. It smells worse too. Yeah. All right. Well, let's get into it, man. We got some business to handle. Guys, remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find the whole link there for you. But that being said, headline, numero uno, big talk. Got to talk about it. What's that? Joe, Joe Biden. Oh, yeah, man. What's he doing? Yeah, he issued a full pardon. Unconditional part. Oh, yeah. Fuck, we haven't done a show in a couple of days. It's been a minute. Yeah. Got covered because that's a month day too. Now, people get mad at me about this. They're like, what? Where's the show? I want to hear what you said about a Hunter Biden. Yeah. He's just, we're actually waiting for Biden to pardon us as well before we comment. Yeah. Biden issues a full and unconditional pardon of his son, Hunter Biden. So yeah, full and unconditional pardon of his son. He released that on Sunday night. After repeatedly insisting he would not do so using the power of his office to wave aside years of legal troubles, including a federal conviction for illegally buying a gun and for tax evasion. An statement issued by the White House, Mr. Biden said he had decided to issue the executive grant of clemency for his son, quote, for those offenses against the United States, which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1st, 2014 through December 1st of 2024. He continues saying, quote, the charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election, Mr. Biden said in the statement, quote, no reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son. And that is wrong. Yeah, not because of the crack rocks. He was snorting or the 10 plus years of corruption and taking money from foreign interest groups on behalf of your dad splitting the money, taking pay for play, making decisions and policy decisions that are not in the favor of American citizens for money, pretty much being a complete and total trader to the country. Yeah, none of that. Now, well, I mean, here's the interesting thing, right? And I want to think about this. I want everybody to think about this. Think how big of a piece of shit human being you have to be really think about this. Okay, because like, yes, I'm a very patriotic person. And yes, I know everybody doesn't have the same, I don't know, country first attitude that I sort of have or that a lot of us have, right? Not everybody's on the same page, but this is a motherfucker's the president and the president's son. So I mean, we should assume that they have that same love for country. Yes, no, you would want to. Okay, yeah, right? And you're willing to leverage your position of power to make decisions that go against your countrymen and your citizens for money. Think about that. You're willing to take money from other countries and then make decisions that hurt your own fucking people. Okay, that is the, this is why they hang traders in the worst possible level of scuminess that I think anybody could have. Yeah, you know, it's one thing to do things that are going to like fuck your shit up. You know what I'm saying, or whatever like make a deal with the devil. It's on you for these consequences. Correct. Yeah. Okay, but when it literally affects 350 fucking million people in this country, whatever it is now, take it out. You know what I mean? It's fucked up, man. It's fun. When I saw this, I was just like, all right, well, I mean, this is why we say nothing fucking happens to these people, right? Because like they either, you know, they either write the law that excuses them or, you know, makes it legal for them to do insider trading, for example, or whatever the case is, they just fucking pardon themselves. Like, you know, so I mean, I don't know if this is the first of many that's been a talk of the town. People are like, oh, who's next? He's going to pardon, this person. Well, now they're asking for pardons for everybody. Right. Did you see that? I saw that. Yeah, I saw that. And so I mean, it's interesting. Now, if they weren't doing anything wrong, what the fuck they need pardons for? Preemptive pardons for what? You haven't even been fucking trying to trade. You know, I'm saying they know it's coming. Yeah. You know, now with the should be no pardons for that kind of crime. I don't think you should be able to pardon treason. I agree. Or 100%, which is what it's a addition is what these people are guilty of, because they're all conspiring together. It's addition. I think I think that should be a crime that is not part of the bull. I agree. You know, but an interesting update here. I mean, this is a new line of the narrative that's coming out now. And obviously, we'll get to some of these reactions from people. But apparently now it raises a new question about the Fifth Amendment loophole. Right. So Fifth Amendment, that's the right that we have to not incriminate ourselves. Right. People say, I plead the Fifth, right. You know, there are still people that were involved in these crimes that this dude committed, right? Joe Biden being one of them, but there's presidential immunity. But Joe Biden's brother, Joe Biden's fucking daughter, I believe. There was a few of them that are all entangled in this business could Hunter Biden technically testify against them because he's, you know, safe from prosecution and throw them out because we have friends in these places, right. And I have somebody that's telling me that the word around the house was that Hunter Biden basically forced Joe Biden to pardon him under threat of releasing all of this shit and just coming out and saying, no shit. This is what the fuck happened. Huh. So I mean, I get that's guys that are in that would know you know, they're in those fucking hallways. Yeah. I'll just say that. So it's interesting. I don't know. I think, you know, it's interesting. Now one thing that pisses me off those is the reaction from the left and how they're kind of like they don't really know what to do about this. You see some idiots like this way to go, Joe. Democrat representative Crockett congratulates Biden for pardoning son. Let's check this video out. It's pardoned. Well, I won't pretend to speak for the entire caucus, but I will say way to go, Joe, let me be the first ones to congratulate the president for deciding to do this because at the end of the day, we know that we have a 34 count convicted felon that is about to walk into the White House. So for anyone that wants to clutch their pearls now because he decided that he was going to pardon his son. I would say, take a look in the mirror because we also know that when it comes to this cabinet, this cabinet has more people accused of sexual assault than any incoming cabinet probably ever in the history of America. So we are living in unprecedented times and we know that this was completely political as someone who serves on the oversight committee. This was Gengsmanship the entire time and we know that this investigation had been taking place for five or six years. We know that Hunter had accepted responsibility and it was the oversight committee that was pushing to try to say no, it wasn't enough and ultimately the judge decided to reject the plea. And so considering everything that took place and considering where we are in this country, I say way to go, Joe. Well, can I ask a question? And it looks like your seatmates behind you think that this is very unprecedented to have someone be on television while they're boarding the plane. But we have talked a lot with you on MSNDC programs about the way that African Americans and Latinos are often brought up in the drug trade and results in criminal convictions. Do you think going forward that this is an opportunity for the president to use his clemency power more broadly? I'm certainly given the kind of criticism he's likely to face over this, but to expand the array of individuals who are also offered clemency as his term lines down. So thank you so much for the question because I actually have a letter that I am actually about to really push out a lot more widely. This letter is to actually work on the disparities that we've seen specifically for crack cocaine. It is a conversation that I started with the Attorney General before the election. It was something that I wanted to do in the lame duck no matter who won the presidency. And so we know that there are people that are still sitting in custody in the federal government, federal prisons because they were charged with crack cases years and years before the law ever changed. And even when the law changed under Obama, it still was an 18 to 1 disparity. It is time for those people that have been sitting there and have had this disparity held over their heads and it's been nothing but racism that has driven it. It's time for them to go ahead and have their sentences recalculated. And we have the numbers. We know the percentages of people of color. We know the percentages of people that would get out. And so I'm hoping that the president takes us up on it. All right, thank you so much. First of all, clean your fucking phone, your phone's dirty. Not only that. Yeah. She looks like she's talking with a bunch of shit in her mouth. Yeah, bullshit. Yeah. No shit. I just love the story here, right? Like you got Joe Biden, 1994 crime bill, locks up all of these fucking people, right? And I mean, that was what almost 30 years ago. And the first one he grants clemency to is his son, which is a white guy. Not only that. Not only that. What's the what's the destruction to the black family unit then because of the 1994 crime bill? What's the generational destruction of the black family unit because of that? That is that is 100% on him. Oh, yeah, okay. And then that always made me wonder like, why? How do people not see this? And then on top of it, for her to sit there and say, oh, yeah, Hunter Biden deserves to be pardoned because Donald Trump has all these charges against them. Yeah, they all got dropped because they were made to fuck up. This dude is spilling national security secrets and selling shit for money. Like what do we don't like? He was just it's not like he was just doing drugs. Yeah, right. Right. No one gets a fuck. No, it was never good time. That's cool. But what other shit that you were doing and that's the problem that always gets me like they always just put it on the gun crime and the tax. Yeah, there was way more on that fucking laptop. Dude, that nobody wants to talk about. It's it's very bizarre and it's very bizarre that anyone anyone would be okay with anybody in this country selling their influence for money. And here's the other people. And the only reason I can fuck it, think it's okay. The only reason I think they think it's okay is because they all do it too. Right. Well, I mean, here's the interesting thing, right? Like if if if it was just about the tax evasion and the gun crime, then why didn't Biden just issue the pardon on those charges? Yeah, why did you get why do you do a 10 year window? Why why is it a 10 year fucking window for any crime that he may or and by the way, what happened in 2014? Oh, that was the bereased mission. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You know what I'm saying? It was like when he when when I do it, it's it's fuck. I think anybody everybody knows. Any ounce of common sense should be able to look at this and like, okay, yeah, you're like, this is fucking bullshit, man. Yeah. Um, you got KGB, of course, uh, she's claiming that it was war politics. That's the reason for the hundred Biden, uh, pardon, um, and insist that the DOJ was not weaponized against, uh, Trump, I mean, you talk about gas lighting. Holy crap. I've never seen someone that can lie like her. Oh, well, she's good at it. She's good. Let's check this out. Now this is an audio clip that was taken during a press briefing. So let's check this out. You have said repeatedly yourself since the election, the president has said for months, no pardon was coming. I just, yeah, I wanted to ask you could those statements now be seen as lies from the American people? Is there really a credibility as you are given now this announcement? First of all, one of the things that the president always believes is to be truthful to the American people. That is something that he always truly believes. And if you see the end of his, I assume that you've read his statement and you look at the end of that statement and he actually says that in the first line in the last paragraph, um, and, and respects the thinking and how the American people will actually see this in his decision making. Um, and I would encourage everyone to read it for the president statement. I think he lays out his thought process. Uh, he lays out how he came to this decision. He came to this decision this weekend. So let's be very clear about that. He says it himself. It's in his voice. He said he came to this decision this weekend. Um, and he said he wrestled with us. And, um, because he believes in the justice system, but he also believes that the war politics infected the process and led to a a miscarriage of justice. It's beautiful. Shit, man. Uh, beautiful stuff. Just like, you know, and everybody's having to go back on it. Got political here. This is like a, a timeline of headlines from political, um, president Biden says he won't pardon. Hunter Biden. He said it like a thousand times, a thousand times. Yeah. Biden issues pardon for some answer. Republicans pounce on Biden for pardon this. Like, what do you think? What do you think? I don't think it matters. I think the media, I think it doesn't matter what the media says anymore. Yeah. You know, like everybody sees it. Everybody's seen all the clips. Everything's recorded. It's out there. We all know what the fuck's been going on. And, you know, I think they're going to try to put pardon fucking everybody. Hillary Clinton, Pelosi, all these people, and I don't think that those should be partners. I don't think that that should be allowed. Well, I mean, the fact that you're issued in a part, a pardon, like, I mean, they kind of almost like in the, in the legal way, you're not supposed to take that as like an admission of guilt or anything like that. Yeah. Cool. But like, if you didn't do anything wrong, where the hell are you getting a pardon for? You don't need one. You know, I'm saying so like, yeah, they're kind of, they're definitely telling on them. So, of course, almost immediate. Of course. Um, I was kind of interested why Trump hasn't said much on this. You know, Trump, Trump made a tweet, um, to some of first, he says, does the pardon given by Joe, uh, Joe to Hunter include the J6 hostages who have now been in prison for years, such an abuse and miscarriage of justice. And that was kind of it. You know what I'm saying? But like, I, again, I don't know if he's just trying to keep his cards close. You know, uh, we got, we got some other stuff coming with some of this picks. I think we'll change some of this. But, um, it is, dude, the whole thing is just, I'm not going to say I didn't expect it, but it's just like, all right. Yeah. Now what? You know what I'm saying now? Listen, it's bullshit. Yeah. Okay. And if you're going to, if you're going to take money for, you know, uh, for foreign influence and make decisions against your own country for the benefit of you personally, financially, that's in my book, that's treason. And that should never be able to be pardoned. And those people should be held accountable. We can't allow people to make decisions selfishly, especially when they're in a public office that screw over the entire country for, for, for, for some dollars. You know, you know what I'm saying? Dude, it's fuck, well, let me actually, this then Andy. So, so you pardon your son, your, your, your Joe Biden, you just pardon your son. You know, keeping that theme, what would be the next thing you would do? Pardon yourself? Uh, not shit. I'm not, I'm not going to be surprised that I come up. I might just, you know, give a billion dollars to Africa. Yeah. And, and what's going on in North Carolina still? For, for natural disasters. Yeah. Right. Exactly. The natural disasters in Manitarian aid for people displaced by drought or conflict in 31 different countries when we have two states that have, yeah, been completely fucked. What would you do after that? I wouldn't do that. So I don't know what I would do after that. Well, by mistake. Let's check this out. With the US, dude, fucking falls asleep at the fucking little bit of corridor. Tanzania have used the little bit of corridor as an integral part of a broader strategy to enhance connectivity in Africa. We also appreciate the fact that the implementation of the project will provide important opportunities for Africa's development in sectors such as agriculture, renewable energy, transformation, to go to sleep logistics along the corridor. Tanzania is, bro, he's out. That clips like two minutes and he's out there. I don't blame a man. I would hate to sit in those kind of meetings for real. All these formalities and all these like ridiculous scripted out talks that everybody gives and you can only take so much of that shit. I don't blame them on that. But yeah, North Carolina is still fucked and let's give some more money away. That's just money they're giving to themselves. That's what people don't understand. Yeah, this shit comes back. You said this stuff up for good retirement. Yeah. What they're doing, man. For sure. Yeah, guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, let's go check these out. This first comment comes from at Danielle. I'm going to fuck this up. Danielle El Nice, 8027. She says, I've been following you guys for a few years now. We're into a guy wearing the real AF gear Nashville and my boyfriend got mad. I gave him a fist bump told him if you know, you know, maybe get him a hat so you guys can feel left out. He's a showing not a grower. You got it. That's like, yeah, it's all right, buddy. It's be okay. That's fine. If you know, you know, that's the truth to, man. It's a secret. Yeah. It is. Yeah. Secret, man. Yep. This next comment comes from at Ethan.tie11. He says, it's only gay. If the man you are calling handsome is gay. They aren't gay. Then it's not gay. I think you could say gay man is handsome. Okay. I don't think that's gay. I call them a guy handsome all the time. Yeah. I think that's a good rule. That's a good rule. That's a good rule. I mean, I don't know. It's fine. It's all right. What do you call a gay dude? It can't call him handsome. Nothing. That sounds like a great bar joke. Actually, I have to figure that one out. Last comment comes from Burejo. Burejo. Burejo. Burejo. Burejo. Why do I agree with these guys so much? I don't know. This is what it is, man. Yeah. Sounds like someone's coming over to the dark side. That's what it is, man. That's what it is. Guys, we appreciate you for being real ass fans. Thank you guys for liking the comment. It makes you guys as subscribed that being said, let's get to head on number two. This is an interesting one. I'd love to get you take on this one. Trump's selection of cash but tail to lead FBI electrifies America first movement. This was cool. Yeah. I was happy with this. I like this pic. Yeah. I thought it was a good pic. You know, and around number 13 of the first round of the America first draft got cash but tail. More than any other personnel decision, former president Donald Trump, the president of the leg now has made for his incoming administration, his decision to pick attorney cash but tail to lead the FBI as the bureau's next director has a electrified Trump's most ardent supporters. That's not to say supporters are unhappy with any of the other selections. They're not a few of them actually by bar. Trump supporters are very fired up about all of them so far and excited as the former president builds on his comeback administration but there's something about the Patel selection that has really got the base jacked up and excited. So yeah, so Trump nominates a cash cash Patel to serve. And yeah, everybody's been pretty happy with this. I think that's a pretty good safe bet. Robert O'Brien said, President at real Donald Trump has made America safer and more just by his nomination of cash Patel as director of the FBI, he will be a worthy successor to my friend Christopher Ray. I think anybody that calls Christopher Ray a friend, you can't trust that person. So I don't know how. Yeah, it's weird how these dudes all suck each other's dick. Yeah, yeah, that is weird. Like these people are fucking criminals. They're doing bad shit. They're using the FBI to press fucking citizens and politicians and now he's your friend flat out lions in the American people. Yeah, it's your friend. All right, okay, Tommy Tuberville says cash Patel is the perfect pick. He will restore law in order and end FBI corruption clean house hashtag MAGA. Now what's interesting, dude? And I wonder if you've seen the same thing on this, right? Like any of the picks that I would say are good picks, mainstream media destroys. But the ones that are not good mainstream media doesn't even touch. That might be is that like is it like are you seeing that? No, I mean, dude, look, I've had my head and the other things, you know, so I don't what do you mean? Dude, I've been seeing it like like the the one lady for Sergin General mainstream media done touch her like terrible pick, right? Like, I mean, it's very clear she has her bad stuff about it. Why do you think that is does not touch her? But yet you get that's because they want her to stay in or they want her to be unnoticed or I don't maybe a little bit of both. Yeah, you know, I'm saying like they're not touch it or you know, I'm saying like cash Patel, you know, of course, like no, we can't have it. Gotta get this guy out of it. Let's check this out. Let's go to NBC News real quick. I think cash does have relevant experience particularly when it comes to the mandate the American public has signed of turning these agencies around that will come complete, completely corrupted. Cash has pointed out. He's probably the best at uncovering what's happened at the FBI and I look forward to seeing him taking it apart. Yeah, you know, I'm saying so like this guy goes on NBC to, you know, stand up for cash and it's just the constant barrage of like, oh, he's disqualified. He's unqualified. He's you know, all this stuff. But again, like it's just it was bugging me, right? Like the guys that we should not have in they don't touch and the people have to get pissed off. That's what happened with this other pick should be disqualified conservative slam trumps DEA pick Chad Kronister for being a woke Democrat donor, pro vaccine tyrant who arrested the pastor during COVID. Yeah, he resigned, though. They need dropped out off the public pressure dropped out. Yeah. But like not to any mainstream media doing, you know, I'm saying, no, it's because of Twitter and fucking social media. It was the people. Yeah. Well, look, man, anybody who arrested anybody during COVID for anything or put any of these draconian restrictions in or tyrant policies where they could just say you can't go to the beach. You can't go outside. You can't have people over to your house. You can't have Thanksgiving. No singing like bro, none of those people should be allowed to serve in any role of government ever and not even just that they should be in fucking jail. Oh, this dude glowed at about it. Yeah. So like he tweeted about it. This is back in March. There's a March 30th of 2020. And he tweeted this fucking thing. He says, quote, announcing the arrest of dr. Ronald Howard Brown, pastor of the river at Tampa Bay church who intentionally and repeatedly disregarded state and local public health orders, which put this congregation and our community in danger. Um, and order's not a law. Yeah. Two different things. Yeah. Neither is a mandate. Yeah. Fuck off. Yeah. Honestly, I mean, do you trust me? I've listened. I don't I don't know too many chats. Be honest with you. But the last name I feel I kind of gave it away. Chrono. It just sounds like a crony. And that a bad thing. Yeah. No, I just look man. I mean, we can make fun of these dudes or whatever, but it's a serious matter. Like these people shouldn't be in our government. They shouldn't be in law enforcement. They shouldn't be allowed to serve in any position of authority over human beings in any sort ever. Yeah. Because when they are telling people arresting pastors and, you know, like bro, they were putting remember when they arrested that guy on the fucking beach. Like, dude, listen man, that is completely unacceptable. This is not their world. Their laws do not rule the world. There are human rights. We're allowed to go outside. We're allowed to breathe. We're allowed to have people over. We're allowed to do whatever the fuck we want as long as it's not fucking breaking laws. Okay. And even if it is breaking laws, there's certain laws that really are not applicable to human fucking rights. Okay. So I don't know where these people get off thinking that they're in a position of authority to the point where they can tell us that we can't go outside. Fuck you, dude. And dude, it's a bad thing. I don't why would Trump put him out like that? Why would Trump even nominate this guy? I mean, it came with a very long, you know, yeah. I mean, he not know this or does he not care? Or does he know it and he wants the people wants to see what the people do? Exactly. You know what I'm saying? I mean, listen, it's very plausible. You know, it's very, very plausible. You know, because I mean, this dude got torn the shreds within hours. Yeah, he should. And anybody who sided with those people on anything should be as well. Yeah. Well, I mean, what was even crazier? Like, I mean, so this guy's gloating about a rest in this fucking pastor, right? For having church during COVID lockdown. Yeah. Meanwhile, that same person, that same guy, it was the same one that was releasing over 100 criminals because of COVID out of the fucking prisons and jail cells in Florida, one of which actually went went on to commit murder. You know, and they, and they, you know, they have them on record saying, well, quote, we didn't go back at the time and look at people's criminal history, chronist, just that Thursday. That sense has changed. So you weren't even looking at the people's rap sheet that you were just releasing because of COVID, but yet you're locking a pastor up for having, yeah, this guy doesn't belong anywhere near it. I'm glad the people called it because that's exactly what they did. Yeah, you definitely rescinded it. Said it was an honor to be nominated, but he's going to stick with the local tyranny. So that's cool. And other news, another interesting pic that's going on right now. Another guy got Pete Haxeth for state department. Yeah. And there's some interesting things going on there. Yeah, I see a lot of people talking about it, but I don't, they said he was, there's some serious allegations. This is what I saw, but I didn't see what they were. That he has like a drinking issue or some, some, some, all those motherfuckers got drinking issues. They got a fucking bar in Congress. Yeah, there's a room in there. You go by beer. Yeah, that's, I wouldn't say that that would be my main concern. That's a very, fancy Pelosi has drink problem. Kamala. Auntie K. Oh, bro, Nancy Pelosi's some dude filmed her on the airplane the other day. And he counted that she drank seven drinks on the plane. And she was already fucked up when she got on the plane. No, shit. Yeah. Seven drinks, bro. Seven drinks. That lady probably weighs a hundred pounds. That's a lot. I mean, she'll drink me out of the table. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, but like, I mean, Pete has to be making some noise. They're trying to get him out. Is what is sounding like. And now, there's this like talk about the Santas. Yeah, let's talk about the Santas. Yeah. What is that? What, what I don't like it. I think I don't like it. I like around the Santas for, for a lot of things, but I would rather have Hegsith and their, um, a fresh young face, bro. And like, I feel like the Santas is the pick that the establishment Republicans want to be in that role. And I feel like they don't think Hegsith is, you know, mature enough or qualified enough, or most likely they're afraid of them, corruptible, right? And so, and I don't think, I don't think the Santas is, is corruptible. But I think he's more polished. And I think people are less afraid of them. Um, and I think the fact that they're trying to resist Hegsith so much is an indication of why he should get the position. That's kind of how I see it. But like, it's like whoever media attacks, that's who I want. Yeah, me too. And it's ones that they don't attack. They get worried about that I'm worried about. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. And to me, that's been the telltale sign this whole time, right? Like I said, the attorney, though, this, the, the, uh, surgeon general, nothing, great pick, whatever. Silence. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? But Lord for big, Pete, Pete, headset gets in there. It's a problem. Cash, but tell like these are great people you wanted in those positions. Um, and, and they're, they're silent on them. You know, I mean, there's silent on the ones that they, uh, that we don't want. So I mean, it's, it's interesting. Um, it's very, very interesting. Yeah. I'm happy with cash. Yeah. Let's go, Pete. Yeah. Look, dude, here's the bottom line. Okay. Uh, you got to give someone 90 days to see what they're going to do. All right. And that's that 90 days from now or from November 5th. That's 90 days from the inauguration. All right. So I am not loyal to any person. I am loyal to this country, the constitution and how I believe it should be run and it's people. And I think Trump deserves 90 days of, let's see, what's going to happen before anybody starts saying, oh, he's, controlled, or he's part of this or he's part of that. I talked to someone who is my friend, but is also Trump's friend and he's, his very good friend. He's with him all the time. They're at events together. Okay. And this guy's a friend of mine. And I talked to him and I said, hey, tell me the real shit you happen to be here on Monday. Um, I say, hey, tell me the real shit is Trump going to fucking wheel the hammer when he comes in the office or not. And he fucking smiled big and he goes, bro, you have no fucking idea. And this is a guy that sits in the rooms. Okay. So and it's not anybody's been on my show. All right. So that's refreshing. Yeah. It's and it's not a bullshitter. It's someone who, oh, he shoots the shit. This motherfucker tells the truth. Yeah. Okay. So yeah. And he looked me right in the eye. Big smile. He's like, bro, you have no idea. So I think these dudes are going to wreck all the bullshit and the corruption. 100%. Um, yeah, there's some of the picks I don't like. And there is some things to indicate like Trump isn't going to necessarily make all the reforms that, you know, everybody wants, but like, dude, what president has done that that's never existed before. We've never had a situation where you're candidate or my candidate or anybody's candidate coming in done every single thing that we want. I do think that there's a very good chance that Trump and his cabinet and his administration will make the structural changes required that will allow our country to move on and become America again, meaning election reform, meaning corruption reform, meaning shrinkage of the government. I think they're going to find all kinds of stuff out that they don't even really know yet, especially with Vivek and Elon with the Department of Government. Uh, efficiency. I feel like those guys are going, I think we're going to have massive changes. And I think that those changes that are going to be structural are going to allow us to move forward and potentially get America to where we all kind of want it to be, right? Uh, and maybe he does it. Who knows, but I think this, I think instead of trying to pick apart somebody who's been through the fucking ringer, the way that he has, I believe that he deserves at least 90 days of benefit of that. And that's what I'm willing to give them. I agree, man. Guys, tell us what you guys think. Let's know down in the comments. And the reason I say 90 days is because bro, we're going to, we're going to be able to see the moves, right? We might not see the results, but we'll see the moves. And I think that's a fair amount of time. You know, in business, they have a saying it's 30, 60, 90, okay? And, um, you know, to make changes that you start on today, and this is your life, too. It's the same. It's the same thing in your life. 30 days, you know, of work, you probably won't see much. 60 days, you're going to see a little bit. 90 days, you're going to see a lot. And that's the reality of business. That's the reality of your personal development and your, your fitness. Uh, you could tell a lot in 90 days, okay? Even in the biggest business. And, and, uh, so I'm, I think that's fair that we all give them that. We'll see what happens. Yeah. Guys, tell us what you guys think. Let us know down in the comments. Uh, what you guys think. Would that be, let's get to our third and final headline? We've got headline number three. This one's a little different. Um, we saw this coming. We'd like to speak about, you know, tyranny and, uh, corruption and government and, uh, all of those things that we gotta go cross these for this one. This one was kind of interesting. South Korea president, you, the Claire's martial law and unannounced TV address. Do you see this? Yeah, I did. I didn't see, uh, the civil, I saw a little bit of the civil unrest, but no, I didn't see much about this. This is some weird stuff that's happening over there. It's still to this day. Actually, there's still some remnants going on. We'll cover this. Um, but this started, uh, on December 3rd, uh, South Korean president, Yoon, Suk Yo, on Tuesday declared martial law and an unannounced late night address broadcast live on YTN television, claiming he would eradicate, quote, shameless pro North Korean anti-state forces. Um, he did not cite any specific threat from the nuclear armed north instead focusing on his domestic political opponents. The surprise moves since shockwaves through the country, which had a series of authoritarian leaders early in its history, but it has been considered democratic since the 1980s. Uh, the Korean unit of currency, the one, uh, was down sharply against the US dollar. White House wasn't commenting initially when the stuff came, they just say, hey, we're monitoring the situation. Um, uh, his statement when translated says, quote, I declare a martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces to eradicate the despicable pro North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people and to protect the free constitutional order you said. Um, now he didn't, again, he didn't address what specific measures were going to be taken. Um, Jan Hopp news agency reported that the entrance to the parliament building was blocked. Um, they stated, uh, quote, tanks armored person nail carriers and soldiers with guns and knives will rule the country, uh, Lee J. Myeong, leader of the opposition democratic party, which has the majority in parliament said in a live stream online. Quote, the economy of the Republic of Korea will collapse, um, irretrievably, my fellow citizens, please come to the national assembly. So that is the president. Okay. Um, now he is the leader of the people power party, formerly known as United Future Party. It's a conservative right wing, political party in South Korea. Now these are some images, some videos of what was going on during that time of shake this out. So this is some understanding this properly. This is the government and the army and the president are the right wing. And then these people fighting them in the streets are like our antifus. Correct. Okay. And then you also have the fact that like the parliament, which be like our Congress is majority liberal. Okay. Right. So you got the president, military Republican. You got Congress, they're Democrat. You know, I'm saying and then you got the, you know, apparently a decent amount of people in the uh, crowd that are anti-state. How fucking stupid do you have to be to beg for a government to rule over you and make more laws and make more restrictions and make things harder for you as an individual? Like how big of a fucking coward are you that you are afraid to live a free life? You are afraid to live a free life. It's not that they don't want freedom. They want someone to take care of them. They want someone to provide for them. They want someone to make the rules that they can follow and they can be good little people and just how weak of a person do you have to be to want that? It's very, very absurd for me to think that anybody would want that at all. But what's even crazier, bro, is the fact that like why would you fight for that? Yeah. Well, I mean what's crazy is when you give them a little taste of what that shit looks like. They don't like it. Yeah. Well, because like that's what communism would look like. I mean, that's martial law, military, I know people like I know. And that's what you want. Bro, and I know in these people that are fighting for it, don't understand that they'll just be facing the same people later that will be making them do all this crazy shit. Dude, it's weird, man. Now like a couple of hours, I think it was like two hours after that broadcast, South Korean parliament voters, they voted to defy president by lifting his declaration of martial law because again, they have the majority, right? They overturned it. But the thing is, it's weird. Like, I mean, how their laws and stuff is set up. The constitution of South Korea says the president shall comply when the national assembly requests lifting of martial law with the majority vote. They did that. But it doesn't specify when he has to actually lift it. All right. And so like I said, I mean, there's still some things that are going on right now. There's still some some battles at the national assembly there. You at their capital, if you will, there's still been some clashes here and there. It was just such a weird thing that happened kind of like out of nowhere with no real like, you know, usually you kind of see these things coming on the horizon and South Korea declared martial law. I didn't really see coming up at all. But it is definitely weird, man. It's just weird times. I think all around. Anything else on this? I mean, look, I'm surprised this didn't happen here or hasn't happened here. I mean, we're real lucky that this wasn't the case here over the last four years. Yeah. You know, specifically on the fucking election. And if we don't, if we don't get it corrected, if we don't get it corrected over the next four years, meaning correcting the election system, you know, shrinking the size of the three letter agencies, stop allowing them to instigate these crazy fucking events in our society that you know, hurt culture, divide culture. If we don't get rid of or help or make some regulations around media being paid by the government to push a narrative, these things, this is what ended up happening. Okay. So we have some, this is what I was talking about with the corrections that need to be made so that we can structurally move forward from here because our foundation and our, you know, I mean, I guess the foundation is the best word for it. Our foundation is cracked and crumbled right now. And we have to fucking re strengthen that so that we can move forward, you know, in a productive way. And this, you know, this is what happens when that's not the case. I mean, 100%. I think the other thing too that's cool to see, did you know, we see that Elon put out for the Department of Government Efficiency that actually has like an expiration date for that entire agency? When is that essential? I forth of 2026. Yeah. So it's like, you know, a little bit over a year that they're going to come in and do all that shit in the guess what they're doing. Yeah. You know, I'm saying, I just like, I mean, that's how government should work. Like you shouldn't be in there for these long careers or, you know, you set up these deals to fucking set you in your kids and your kids kids up. Like get in, fix the fucking problem and be done. Yeah. It's that simple. Yeah. I mean, so this is interesting. We'll stay on top of this. We'll see what happens. It was just wild to see, man. I don't know. Guys, tell us what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. Thumbs up at dumbest fuck. This is where we're bringing in a headline and talk about it. Get one of those two options. Speaking of this resurgence of America coming back, one thing that is always good to see is just some some some good testosterone of violence. And so that's what that's what that thumbs up is. Not sure if you saw this has happened last weekend, but Ohio State and Michigan, they had a little situation after their game. Yeah. And now they got some some punishments after their post game scuffles. So let's just talk about it. See what we think on this. Ohio State and Michigan will both be fined $100,000 for a violation of the Big 10 sportsmanship policy after the rivalry week matchup led to an ugly post game scuffle. The Saturday lunchtime game hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons after police storm the field and pepper sprayed players and a bit to calm down the violent scenes. And has now been reported by Yahoo News and Yahoo Sports, the both teams will be hit with a hefty fine while Ohio State police also continues its own investigations into the circumstances that led to pepper spray being deployed by its officers. It is expected that both teams will not argue the fine and will pay it without any appeals. So it all started. It started right on the field. This occurred at Ohio State where Michigan players planted their school flag on the field, which is considered a major sign of disrespect in college football. And Ohio State players physically confronted them. Let's check out. Let's check out this clip. Ohio State field and the Buckeyes rushed right to them. And now there's some skirmishes going on on the field. I mean, dude, this happens all the time. That happens all the time. I saw this on TV and I was like, I couldn't believe they used pepper spray. Yeah, I mean, I couldn't believe it. Well, I mean, those guys are pretty fucking big. Dude, that's it's college football, man. Yeah. Like, dude, of course, there's going to be emotions. Of course, there's going to be fighting. Of course, there's going to be violence. It's not going to progress to the point of needing pepper spray, bro. You jump in there like a man, you grab off of each other and you fucking let him go back to their locker rooms. This is men doing men shit. Let him go. Yeah, man. And like the pepper spray thing, I couldn't believe it. When I saw it on TV, I was like, there's no way because there's been, you know, I've watched football my whole life, man, I've seen way worse fights than this. Yeah, bro, way worse. So this was a pretty interesting clip. Let's check this angle out. So this is a different angle on the field. You got a Ohio state with the Michigan flag they were able to take and let's check this out. Yeah, I mean, I mean, what do you think's going to happen, dude? When you run out and try to put your flag on somebody's field, like that's going to happen. It's a great lesson here. This consequences for actions. Dude, it's going to happen, bro. Like are those guys brothers? No, actual brothers. Not brothers. Yeah, look at them. They look the same. They fucking do. And then the one guy's got number 22 and the other guy's got number 44. So I was thinking like you 22 times two is 44. Those guys related. They got same haircut, making the same face. They got pepper sprayed together. They got the pepper spray face. Oh, man. Bro, you tell me those dudes don't look alike. They do look alike. No, they do. They do. Right. They have fucking got just these two guys. Okay. Yeah. Like not all the players look alike. Just these two. Yeah, that's right. You knew what the fuck I was saying. I give this thumbs down for the consequence. No, I think, yeah, I think this is part of sports, dude. Like they've already removed all the dangerous shit from football anyway. Like football now has become like almost like flag football, you know, compared to 20 years ago. And I'm all for safety and everything. But like, bro, they fight and hockey like straight up fucking fight. And then I'll put the spray nose, my fuckers. You know, say like it didn't look like it was that out of control. No, it didn't even look that bad. Yeah. And I think I think the cops definitely made the situation worse for sure. Yeah. It's like, fuck man. Just let them go. Just let them go. I mean, I could see where, you know, if you're like four or five people in the middle of those two guys, but bro, maybe you just should get out of the middle of it. Yeah. Yeah. Do we had always, we always had a rule, bro. Like we fight. We were playing another team that like we know, like, you know, this is a big rivalry. You know, you go do the shake the hands of the fifth of the art line. Keep your helmets on. Yeah. Always keep your helmets on. Like you're protected. Like, I mean, like you punch a helmet. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Cool, bro. You put your hands on. Yeah. Okay. You learn something. You know, like it's fine. Yeah. You know, like it's all right. Man, they're all they got the gear on still. It's fine. Man, just let them go. You know, I don't know. I think it's stupid. Yeah. I do too. That's a big ass dude. But that's the best. I see how big I do this. Big fucking dude. Like there's some big boys. Hey, man. You know, so like, you know, those dudes are real smart. That guy's real big. I think he's massive. Yeah. I think he's massive. As a motherfucker in college, he looks 50. You know, saying, like for real dude, that guy looks 50 years old. It looks, yeah. I think he got pepper spray too. Yeah. What? Well, all the black. I might pepper spray that motherfucker. Yeah. That's a big motherfucker, dude. Yeah. I mean, yeah. T. Say. Yeah. Yeah. All right, man. All right. I tell you what, pepper spray, no joke, dude. Oh, so you know what? That shit in your face. Oh sucks. You don't want to be in the vicinity of it. Mm-hmm. Even get a little bit on it, like last for a couple days. Well, they got the news out of you. It's like foam. So like, like it sprays. Like it doesn't like just spray. Yeah. Just streams. Oh, really? And it sticks on you. It sticks on fucking everything. You try to wipe it off. Now it's on your hands. Like fucking sucks. But yeah, man. Thanks. Yeah. Let the boys go, man. I agree. Let the boys boy. Um, guys, Andy. It's all got me. All right, guys. See you again tomorrow. Yep. All right. All right, guys. Don't forget to pay the fee. Don't be a whole show.
