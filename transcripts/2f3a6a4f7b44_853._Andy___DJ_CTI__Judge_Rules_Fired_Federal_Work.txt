I tell people when they come here Like they stay down the four seasons don't believe it and I say hey man Don't go outside at night. Yeah, and they're like oh Dude I can handle myself anywhere. I'm like you don't understand you don't understand when I'm telling you This is not South Central Los Angeles. This is this is fucking Bay root Okay, like Yeah, I do didn't I have to give these arguments with these people that come in and they're like do you I'm fucking fine I fucking served in the military work. Did they teach you how to stop bullets? You fucking hands? Yeah, right, right? You know what do you and the fucking matrix? Like I don't know what to tell you Like they don't listen to me and then one of the dudes came in he was staying over at fucking the chase Mm-hmm, and he's like do you never believe what I saw and I'm like what you see? He's like I saw do you get shot? I'm like I told you yeah, well, I mean it don't go outside down there at nighttime. It's not safe It's not safe. No, it's not it's not I mean those places. I mean listen granted every city. There's place Plot places. Yes agree sure, but the north side of St. Louis. You don't go period dude at any time Yeah, don't go there But yeah, I'm not like you know, I thought this was winning now. I mean like again. It's you know what dude? It's sad. It shouldn't be that way It is and this is why I get so passionate about all of this stuff that we talk about all the time guys You know when I talk about the black communities and a lot of people are like why are you care so much about that because I'm from Fucking St. Louis bro, and I see the way the community's been robbed and pillaged and The crimes have not been prosecuted which creates more crime and more danger. I've seen the money gets stole I've seen it. I've seen it right here and Dude you lifted it. You know, and so like You know people don't understand like dude. This isn't fucking Philadelphia. It's not fucking New York. It's way fucking worse. Yeah Yeah, dude. I'm not trying to talk shit on the city. No, I mean these are statistics man these real things Well, I mean I love this fucking city. Yeah, but like dude it should that's just shouldn't be happening here. No, I mean like I mean like again like you know We're trying to make light of the situation, but I mean the the deeper underline course It's a fucking joke about everything. Yeah, but the underlining tone here bro like I mean like that means like there's victims like there's these are people Bro and like when you look at well who are the people that are doing it who are the people that are you know That are the victims of these crimes bro like I mean nobody wants to address it and like to this point We I know we just brought we had the topic. I think a couple of episodes ago But that that fucking team that was running that track meat right that hit that lady Well Came out that she did get charged with the salt Well look at the accountability behind it local NAACP issues and outrageous defense of attacker why Why are we did I say this you said exactly that didn't we talk we did talk about that? I think I asked you what was the accountability issue? We talk no I said that I said look at the difference between different cultures and I did that right? Okay, if you missed the show I asked a very honest question. What is the difference? Why is it that in white culture? Like dude, you know if I have someone I'm related to or someone I know or someone I'm friends with and they do dumbass shit I'm gonna be first one to be like well shouldn't have fucking done that dumbass I enjoy your belonging sandwich, but when these things happen in the black communities Everybody's like I didn't see nothing You know what I'm saying like what do you you're picking on this guy who just he he doesn't know because he you know like do we make up all these excuses sympathy and dude it's it listen criminals you're fucking criminals man It doesn't matter what color they are doesn't matter what race they are and we can't continue to make excuses For criminals it doesn't for any criminals and I don't understand what that culture is I just don't understand it like Why would you want to defend people who are doing bad things From accountability who are Statistically likely to do more bad things because they didn't face accountability first time Yeah, it's wild. I mean here's part of the release that just put out from the NAACP chapter And then down at the bottom says Alia the the attacker they say quote Alia is not an attacker And what would you call that yeah, right? Yeah, what do you call it? Yeah, they said Immediate headlines continuing immediate headlines that allude towards that in any way is shameful We understand the sensitivity of the circumstances for both athletes and their families involved but this narrative must not go under Unaddressed Alia is an honor student star athlete historic. I see Norcom high school from all accounts She's an exceptional young leader and scholar who's athletic talent has been well-documented and recognized across our state Okay, so if he's not an attacker, what is she yeah, right? Right, I would have loved to see the NAACP why would they defend this? That's what I'm saying. This is how they lose all credibility. It's thinking listen dude You want to know why people don't take a lot of this shit serious? You want to know why more people aren't invested in fixing the black communities that don't live there? You know why? Yes, because you can't do it So like you try to say hey get that motherfucker Charged or punished or how accountable and the community doesn't want to do it And then they want to blame like people who look like me right for causing the fucking problem That's just not true now. I would have loved to see the NAACP statement had that been you know a white girl that hit her You know I'm saying like like that That was a white girl that did that we all know what would be going to be riots there be riots It'd be all stirred up it'd be looting at Nike's Foot lockers. I mean maybe not to this point. I think everybody started to realize that we are pitted against each other But there certainly would have been a crowd of people would have been an attempt that were like yes It would have tried to push that for sure for sure, you know, but like you know, it's stupid man It's stupid. I just thought that was a nice little follow up. Yeah, it is it's stupid, you know By the way, this is not a temperature map Is that the crime that Looks like the fucking more hobby desert bro I Got no comment on that man is what it is man guys. Let us know down in the comments What you guys you know what dude that's that's that's like what we're missing in this town though like if you go to other cities Like if you go to Boston people say whatever they want about Boston now they do have a bad shit crazy mayor Yeah, but you go there you feel safe no point in time. Okay, you for real. Yeah, um you go to downtown Nashville You you feel safe. Mm-hmm. You go to Downtown Austin or Dallas you feel safe like you can do things. There's things to do. Yeah, you know here You can't do shit because the city is like you're afraid you're gonna get fucking car jacked everywhere you fucking go Once you enter the city limits dude and it's not the police that are enforcing the laws It's that they aren't allowed to enforce the laws because when they do the people don't get prosecuted And they get let out in the create more quiet dude It's it's it's it's sad dude because this is a beautiful city. Yeah, it went filled with amazing people Good people man. Good people. Yeah. Well guys Andy let's do some cruising. I would love to see St. Louis just go hardest fuck Cleaning up the criminal element here I mean like and I think I don't think I'm alone and saying that yeah I think people are tired of not having any social a bit like any social Yeah, yeah, well, I mean and that actually may be on the horizon because there's some stuff right now with the St. Louis city police So with the state coming back in taking control of the city police department which will open them up to immediately Centro just a state also so is that real? Oh, yeah, I think we've done it a few times like it's been back and forth Well, I mean dude look we need drastic action. We need in the city like this This is unacceptable. It's not what we want for the amount of taxes that we pay in this town and then in the city You pay another one full one percent for what I don't see it. Yeah, I'll see it man. Yeah, well, let's get into some crews and dude Let's let's check these guys these headlines out remember if you want to see any of these articles pictures links videos Go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them like there or you can just you know come on the YouTube and watch us here and Stay at our hands some faces Either way, yeah You're it's crazy how many people it's it's lit it's real it's it's actually kind of crazy how many people still only listen to audio and don't Watch the YouTube don't want to see especially with the amount of production that we offer on the show Probably I don't want to see a black man. That's probably what it is. I mean, I don't racism. Yeah, yeah, I mean One of the night. Let's let's march Go straight to foot logger back Hey, man, look all I'm saying is is you know I Appreciate all you guys on audio.

No you know, it's it's Honestly, there's no way you could watch days of thunder and be like oh it's one of the worst movies. The plot by itself You're you're fucking retarded then well, I mean I think the people who watch it might be oh okay, so it's everybody else It's everybody else is called it's just being real brother. It sounds like the people that blame the crime on everybody The sand this everybody else I can understand while you know culturally why that's an important movie while you guys Why's that huh why no, I'm like the NASCAR the thing you know like that's I get it I get why that's culturally significant for you. Are you are you upset that you don't have your own car bubble Wallace? No, we do we have our own like TV car thing. It's called cops Yeah, you know, we have a little fucking watch the TV show you're gonna watch the movie with me. Okay. Yeah, all right What happened to the sugar packets?

Yeah, well, let's give it to this cruise man. Is there any black people in that movie? At all. Oh, I don't think so. Yeah, I don't think so.

I don't think you watched it. Well, I do like he built their car and like fucking 30 seconds You know, I'm saying like there was a plot line.

I'm like I see what Andy's doing here like you know We're you know, and I do appreciate we're trying to just like you know do like a cultural exchange thing here You know what I'm saying I watch days of thunder so I got I got something I ordered it last night when I was watching the movie I prior to seeing it. It's the entire roots collection. Yeah You're getting to Kintay. Yeah, you see yeah, like one through seven though. I seen the whole thing. Okay. Well, we're gonna watch it again Okay, and like you know, so you know Okay, you didn't watch roots bro.

No, they they fucking roll the TV in They're like oh, we're gonna show a movie today. It's gonna be great. And they're like a name boy And they're like what is it you're like roots of like fuck It's every year, man. Yeah They're only doing you know, that's how they start that white guilt. That's what it is bro. That's what it is man All right, uncle, you know, yeah, I get it I get it, man. Um Oh, man. Yeah, well, let's do some cruising guys. Let's get to it. We got our first for clarification Days of thunder is is better than Bridgerton I think you know, that's the beautiful thing about cinema is that like you know, everybody's like art You know, you what you get out of it. Yeah, it's like sexual orientation You know what I'm saying I get it. It's what you like It's all right. It's what you like man. Yeah, it's what you like well I do like these headlines I got for you. Okay Let's get into it. Let's get into our first set of headlines guys headlight number one. So this is a A big thing going on. It's just happened right before we started recording here everybody's wild up about it and talking about it Hella number one reads Thousands of fired federal workers must be rehired immediately judge rules So you know, we know Trump fired, you know, tens of thousands of people a lot of those people were probationary employees Who were fired and US district judge William Alsup Described the mass firings as a quote unquote sham strategy by the government central human resources office To sidestep legal requirements for reducing the federal workforce. So this guy right here This is the judge. This is the honorable judge William Ashat. I mean, uh, whatever. He also wrote a book The trial of Lee Harvey Oswald. I thought that was interesting, but um, anyway, who is this guy? So also He's a San Francisco based a pointee of president Bill Clinton He ordered the defense treasury energy interior agriculture and veteran affairs departments to Immediately offer all fired probationary employees their jobs back The office of personal management the judge said had made an unlawful decision to terminate them And even if it is upheld on appeal, it does not guarantee that all workers will be able to get their jobs back permanently Alsop made clear that agencies still have the authority to implement Reductions and force as long as they follow the proper procedures and doing so Uh, article continues and federal agencies are that's weird man like what what it So did they follow the uh the the proper procedures when they fired everybody for not taking the cova shot right What about what about you know what about what about all these businesses that you tried to Try to charge seven hundred thousand dollars per employee that wouldn't take the shot. Is that the proper procedure in this country? It's a great point It's a great point You know and do it so it's so weird too right because like our government at the basis of it is supposed to have checks and balances But the president oversees the executive branch a lot of these things were under his authority Fuck, I mean like we're saving How much money because the truth of the matter is bruh I know everybody likes to get personal about you know, fucking federal employees, but like let's be real bro like the shit We have all of these fucking excessive numbers How efficient is our is our government? You know like all these fucking IRS fucking people we still don't have get our taxes returned on time You know i'm saying like like there's so much inefficiency that obviously The drastic number of these people like they're not doing shit to begin with get them out of there There's you don't get a fucking right to have a government job. I'm sorry Like it doesn't it doesn't make sense. So I mean this is an interesting thing like so I mean yeah, this is common sense I mean i'm not saying anything because i'm like yeah, yeah Well, here's the thing too like they they have to offer their jobs back I don't know how many of these people are actually gonna want to go back anyway to be real You know i'm saying like bro they fucking hate their administration they hate Trump So like why would they even want to go back? You know i'm saying now everything that also opens up some other issues though because those same people These are the reasons why we were having so many cultural problems in our government. It was these fucking people You know i'm saying bring in the bring in the fucking trans books and the fucking offices and the pride flags and the offices and like these were those people I'm aware you know, so it's like fuck like good riddance man um Trump doesn't have to do any of the shit this guy says just i think he should he doesn't need to I think it's a supreme court says that then that's different thing but he'll probably ignore it He should and um Yeah, I think everybody that doesn't have a government job or or household isn't supported by a government job understands how much bloating and uh You know Waste there is in the government I mean all we have to do is go to a government office where there's 16 people to do one job They'll sit in their fucking asses and let you You know sit there for as long as they deem necessary To make sure that you know that they're in charge and not you they're all rude They all treat you like shit and you know what I don't think people would fucking you know if you if if we walked in To a government center or uh, you know that DMV or any of these places and it was quick and easy and the people were nice I there wouldn't be as much of an uproar about this right so in my opinion these people who are You know at you know at the end of the acts on these things you guys brought it on yourselves by thinking that you deserve an Title to that job and that there was no accountability. It was ever gonna come your way Because the reality is is if they follow procedure like judge Alsup is trying to tell them they need to it makes it almost impossible to actually fire anybody and anybody who's worked in a government job We'll tell you this. It's almost impossible to fire people for anything and That creates a situation where the employees know That they don't have to do their jobs and they don't have to service the customers And they don't have to take care of people even though those people are paying They're fucking salaries right how many times of all of us been into a government run Center whether it be a courthouse or a licensed bureau or somewhere get permits and We get treated like total fucking shit How many of you listening you know, okay now if that were the opposite and We went in there every single time and everybody was on it and dude, you know what If everybody was on it they wouldn't need the people anyway right right so the only reason they have all these extra people is because the inability to remove people that don't do their job and what they continue to do is hire more and more and more and more You know it becomes a game of You know, we need a higher person to do that versus I need to do that and so you end up with a whole bunch of people that have jobs and salaries that do nothing Collecting our tax dollars and then also not doing the jobs that we need them for so it becomes a cycle um They don't want to do their jobs so they hire more people to do the job the more people that they hire to do the job The more money it costs us those people finally figure out that they don't have to do their job Later they hire more people cost us more and that's where the bloating has come from it's come from that now if we had a great experience with all these things Bro people wouldn't be as You know as fired up about cutting this as as as they are now, you know like but I can't tell you I could tell you Two times I've had decent experiences with government paid employees in terms of licensing permits You know and those kind of things one was when we went took my driver's test that guy was fucking awesome and then um, I met I had another lady like the last time I got my driver's license renewed not this time But the last time which was six years ago or whatever I remember the lady because she was nice and it stuck out so much That I still remember her that long ago, which was almost ten years ago, right because I was like wow I can't believe how easy this is it's because it was such an anomaly of what my experiences had been And I think a lot of people share that and so it's like dude what the fuck are we paying you for? Yeah, no I get it weren't the last thing I want to do is walk into a government building and listen to some fucking Turd who doesn't know how to do anything except collect the fucking free ride for my tax dollars Tell me why I can't do what the fuck I want to do with my own money my own property. I don't want that while I'm having to give them more of my fucking Bullshit, yeah, right. It's crazy man. It's crazy. Yeah, so I mean so you got that going on We'll see we'll keep updated on what what Trump's response is on that we haven't gotten one just yet So we'll see other things to going on though A Trump hater sets himself ablaze while torching Tesla charger station in South Carolina That's I call that instant karma A masked man vandalized a Tesla charging station and attempted to burn it down using Molotov cocktails in north Charleston, South Carolina Ultimately setting himself on fire in the process many X-Brade painted long live Ukraine next we vulgar match the chain that president Trump at the scene Yeah, I call that instant karma Instant they live. I don't know. We don't have those answers yet Um, but I was a weird incident that uh that happened that uh near a pizza real long live Ukraine. Okay. We'll send them there They need people to fight that war. Yeah, well, I mean he's burned up now. So yeah, well, yeah, we'll see But you know, so you got that that stuff some notes still been going on Trump saying that uh his response has been he's planning to label these attacks on these Tesla locations as domestic terrorism Um, because again, I mean where who are these people? I'd imagine they're the same people that tried to burn and half the fucking country down a few years Yeah, we're yeah Of course it is the same people these are paid leftist protesters agitators. They're not protesters. They're agitators They're activists. Yeah, that's right and they're paid by NGOs Which come from your tax dollars You know, so hopefully that goes through um at a recent why house of the president I don't think people understand this. Yeah Your tax dollars Go to NGOs the NGOs then pay these agitators to go destroy Property in your city in your town in your community in the name of activism. Yeah, so you're paying You paid For all of destruction during BLM you've paid for all of the destruction and all of these protests that we're all like what the fuck is going on? Why are what we're in America man Fuck Ukraine like fuck all these other countries. We have homeless people. We have our own problems. We like Most people feel that way And then we have this group of people that's paid that runs up and down and destroys everything like these people should be terrorists And they should they should be dealt with as terrorists 100% man Um, yeah, the recent meeting uh president trump declared that he would label violence at test locations such as dealerships and charging stations as domestic terrorism following escalating violence against the company and its CEO Elon Musk But it wasn't just uh wasn't it wasn't just the test locations that are getting it today. There was also a protest in New York City Chaos is protesters storm trump tower demanding release of Columbia grad student my mood calil Who is in the process of being deported right now? Because he's not supposed to fucking be here anyway Um, well, he was on a green card right any broken law broke the law when you are on a green card It's pretty much understood that you have to like mine your peas and cues until you get permanent residency Which you didn't have yeah, so I mean like who's the fucking idiot. Yeah. Well, I think it's funny how this started out Right, so I mean this is how that protest started Oh, what is the commonality between those fucking people there NASCAR yeah And mayonnaise Every one of those mother fuckers a extra mayonnaise. That's all right. I'm corn. Oh white people. Oh All white people doing it and all Privileged fucking white people doing remember I mean it's Columbia Columbia the You know I'm saying it's crazy Um, but yeah, I mean this is how it started right and And when I say privilege, I mean upper middle class white people privilege. Yeah People who have never dealt with fucking crime or hardship or anything they don't understand what's actually going on And if it came to their front door they would have a fucking breakdown But they're more than happy to go out and fucking protest all this shit that they don't even know anything about So they can feel valuable and virtuous. Yeah, and show their little brunch ladies how I'm an I you know what I went and stood for this You don't have to fuck your standing for yeah, and by the way all the shit you're standing for You're gonna create a scenario where your husbands and your fucking sons and your brothers and your cousins We're gonna go have to fight a fucking war because you're too stupid to understand what the fuck you're talking about Well, what please? I don't understand. I mean the protest in this Columbia guy I would assume a lot of these students are probably you know Columbia's why are you guys not in fucking class? Like aren't you supposed to be learning they don't have to go to class anymore bro I believe schools aren't what they used to be yeah, I believe schools are Operating off the brand that they used to have that that they don't they don't For fucking two decades bro. They've been running off D.I. D.E.I. programming They've been allowing people in who are not qualified to be in Based on their race They have not been serving the best education. It's become indoctrination camps This part of the communist insurgency they attack the universities first Specifically the ones that are held in the highest regard because they have the best reputation So if you can get the Harvard and you can get the Columbia and you can get the Yale and you can get the brown Now it looks like to everybody else that Fuck dude these are the smartest people and listen to what they're saying and it flows down through culture there Well, those same people go into our government and they get fucking off the street yeah But the main reason it's like Influencer marketing. Yeah, you want to go to the influencers with the most influence So who has the most influence in terms of being smart quote-unquote in society? Well, if you're fucking boy rips out a Harvard degree, you're gonna automatically think what oh shit man He's pretty fucking smart dude. He's smart Columbia degree Yale brown all these things They were very smart and calculated that they attacked those places first Because they understand that the smaller places the the state colleges and the the other private you know And all they're all gonna say well fuck Harvors doing it So we got to do it. Yep, and then it flows down all right, so make no mistake This is a targeted cultural influence Move that the communists have done And implemented over the last you know 30 years If you get a degree from today from Harvard it done me shit Like in fact if someone shut up at my companies with a degree from Harvard, I'd be like no Zero chance Listen to your fucking ass lecture me about what the fuck you don't even know Well the truth of the matter is that's the worst part about it the worst part about it is these people believe That they're smarter than everybody because they have a Harvard degree or a fucking Columbia degree or a brown You see what I'm saying? It doesn't mean shit truth is they haven't even led in the the smartest people bro If you ever seen that video there's a video on the internet Of a guy who had a 4.5 GPA. He's a college kid. He's going to cow you know what I'm talking exactly I wish we could find that video you didn't get in no He makes a reaction video He had a 4.5 GPA. He was valedictorian of his high school class And he's applied to all these colleges Harvard brown. I mean yeah, no he had like crazy SAT score all the shit Bro, he didn't get in anywhere. Yeah, right. Okay, so those people are no longer a best and brightest they are at the They are manipulated into believing they are because of the previous prestige at these brands quote-unquote universities have And so now you have a bunch of fucking dumbasses running around talking about thinking about how smart they are That's why they have no problem voicing their quote-unquote intelligence on everybody that'll listen when everybody else rolls or eyes like bro You're a fucking idiot. Yeah, right. Right. Well the truth is they're probably getting extra credit for this This uh, well, I hope they got extra credit for the fucking jail All right It is crazy. Well, this is how it started. This is how it started and uh, this is how it ended They're getting loaded up onto a fucking prison bus Yeah, and they're all gonna act like they're victims. Oh, there's no doubt about that. Look at this guy Not in our name. Well, how many weeners been that guy's mouth all of them this guy from mind in your yeah Yeah Midnight's always been I mean if that's a weenermouth I that's a weenermouth virus. He won bro Just say him He's taking a look at the hole on You want to begin yeah, he's hanging out with the BBC's look at that thing come on now. Yeah, he loves your people That's probably the happiest he's ever been yeah It's about he's about to go He's practicing. Yeah, he's excited to go where he's about to go bro. This guy dude Shit man. Well don't assume I can we can't assume he's a guy I could smell the soy Proof fucking TV. What is it? What look at this pants? I know Yeah, he's probably thrifted he's probably got a fucking PhD from fucking Harvard too Of gender studies these people really think they're doing something they do bro. They do they do But I mean they can't do a lot well because apparently they can't do a lot well I mean they're setting themselves on fucking fire so there's that look dude Let's move on yeah, I got nothing else to say like like dude deep What I said is what I said, you know if you got a degree from one of these schools in the last fucking ten years at least It's just it's an indoctrination degree. It just is Yeah, you know Now I'm sure there's gonna be some people that come out of there just like there's people that come out of everywhere They do good things but they certainly aren't the place that they used to be It's not anybody who pretends like it is is insane.

I don't say this enough But I really fucking love our audience bro Like I love the people that listen to the show even the people who talk shit, you know like It's always in good fun. Sometimes it's not and fuck you anyway. So like it's all good You know what I like most about our people is that when other people come in that ain't part of the group Oh, yeah, they're like they start talking some shit. They don't fucking own those motherfuckers. Mm-hmm Now we got great people. I dude. I love it bro And they support us and they defend us and they you know clarify things when things are you know because a lot of times people will make videos out of context on purpose and people get in there and be like bro That's bullshit like dude. We just have amazing people and what I really like The most about them though is that Everybody wants to get better Everybody wants to improve everybody wants to have fun with people and be good to people and build things and create things and I was thinking about this last night. I'm not this isn't just like shit. I'm talking on the show It's thinking about it like how fucking fortunate I am and all of us are really here To like be surrounded by people like that. You know, we're surrounded by people like that here at H.2 Right. Yeah, we're surrounded by that in our community You know out on the internet like I'm not like I Don't have to be around fucking losers and shit like I'm not around them anymore, you know And so like a lot of people when they complain about how people are and shit out there I'm like well fuck. I don't see that. You know, I'm saying like so it's just I don't know. It's cool. I just really appreciate um, you know what we're doing is for Fucking 10 years now it'll be in July to be 10 years straight of podcasting. No shit. Yep. So Um, I just appreciate you guys and I appreciate all the support you show Myself personally the show Uh, the companies, you know, everything that we do is just it's it's I feel very very grateful for it So no doubt man. Well, let's keep this cruise moving man. We got headline number two Uh, hello number two reads Putin agrees in principle with us proposed 30-day Ukraine ceasefire So this is a little interesting update with what's going on over there You know Trump has he brought peace to the Middle East before Um, now let's try doing it with Europe and uh We'll see how it goes But Russian president Vladimir Putin said Thursday he agrees in principle With the US proposal for 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine qualifying his affirmation by noting a host of terms and conditions Are still to be determined to ensure any lasting peace Um, now AP news they reported Uh, the development now needs a mechanism to begin the transition process From an idea into action quote so the idea itself is correct and we certainly supported Putin told a news conference in Moscow AP set out Uh, quote continuing um, but there are issues that we need to discuss and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners The Russian leader noted the need to develop a mechanism to control possible breaches of truce and uh another issue He said is whether Ukraine could use a 30-day ceasefire to continue mobilization and rearmament Quote we agree with the proposals to halt the fighting but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead To lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis Putin said basically he thinks that uh, Zalinsk is gonna use this opportunity to just kind of regroup Um, which again if we're trying to get to a fucking peace you don't regroup during a pause, you know, I'm saying yeah And I think he's exposing the part which I don't disagree with them on Um, now Trump responds he said Trump uh, this hell I read Trump hopes Putin agrees to ceasefire as Moscow signals no truce yet um Trump it out in the statement saying quote uh, we know where we are with Ukraine He told reporters while speaking from the Oval Office alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rout Uh, quote, hopefully they'll do the right thing he added in reference to Russia so so development will see I mean any thoughts on that I Mean dude. I think this is getting drug on way Longer than it needs to be yeah, I think it's very simple. I think It's very very simple. I think if Trump is who he says he is he calls up little man over there in Ukraine It says you better fucking stop right fucking now or I'm gonna fucking get you And it'll be over in a second That's what I would do. It's one way to do it. I dude. I call him straight up. I say hey look dude Here's the deal. I call him little man too. Yeah, I'm saying a little guy to say no um If you don't fucking stop this shit Uh, I'm gonna make sure that in a hundred years you never existed What would you like? Yeah, which one? That's a pretty easy choice Not a hard decision to make man. There's been other hard decisions, you know that Trump has had to process and make Um, it do listen Trump can do that I don't know why he's not doing it. Well, I mean he maybe he has well If we really want shit to stop that's how you stop it Okay, same goes for the Middle East You fuck around. I'm gonna fucking turn your entire fucking country in a fucking glass try me It's that simple. It's worked in the past. Yeah, I mean you did that shit with that terrorist leader since I'm a picture with the fucking house so I mean I mean it works it works, bro And I in some fortunate that it's like that, but you know like look dude. It takes three or four times. Yeah, okay Little it all right like for example like Like when those those fucking people were sending uh missiles and rockets and shit at our ships over there Uh, like last year. I forgot who that was was that theory? Syria. Mm-hmm. Okay I would pick up the phone and I would call the fucking Syrian King or whatever the fuck they got over there. Yeah, okay, and I'd say If we get hit with one more missile I'm gonna fucking blow up your fucking whole entire fucking government. Mm-hmm. Okay, and one day And I'm gonna leave your country and fucking chaos Okay, so you can either get these fucking people to stop or I'm holding you accountable boom And the fucking shit will stop it would stop okay and When these little attacks happen these little nippy attacks The consequences should be so harsh that no one ever does it again You know, you know, we I mean bro. You got countries flying spy balloons over our entire fucking continent United States Yeah, we did nothing We did nothing Now granted, I mean, you know listen by the last administration was intentionally trying to deconstruct our fucking country and hand it over and until they're held accountable That that will continue to happen every time they get in power. We're already seeing the media And even people like even me become a little bit disenfranchised with what Trump is doing Because of the Israel shit. Yeah, right like what are you doing dude? These people just killed an entire fucking country full of people all right They're trying to drag us into a war with Iran. They know that we're the big friend, right? Like yeah I know you've dealt with this like you've had little or friends who have big fucking mouths And who only had big mouths because they knew that you were there right and the minute you weren't there They got the fucking asses beat. That's what we are to Israel. Yeah, okay, and to a lot of countries. Yeah, and dude We got to stop doing that. I don't mind us sending money to countries that need it When we're doing well, but we are not doing well and nobody can fucking say that we are Our cities are crumbling I Said this over and over again. It's like beating a fucking It's beating the same drum over and over No money none of our tax dollars. We shouldn't even be paying tax considering What we just found out about what USAID and the NGO has been doing well that's the other part like I'll be okay with the money actually going there If it actually made it there bro like we said we said we said I'd be 50 billion dollars But only two of it made it I'm not okay with it because here's the truth bro Like the amount of money we send there should be no problems globally. That's the truth What the problem is is that the amount of money we send and the amount of money that actually got there there's two different things I I don't think we should be interfering anything. I think when people don't have their big strong tough friend Behind them to clean up their messes they figure out a way to co-exist peacefully. Yeah, shut the fuck up Yeah, I understand some people off. Yeah, and that's that's what's going on and And Israel is going to instigate a Fucking world war with all of the fucking Muslim slash Arab countries. Yeah, and it's gonna it's gonna stretch globally Not it's it's not gonna be like desert storm bro They've imported these people across the fucking country into the western civilization. Yeah, so When this happens It's not just going to be war in the Middle East. It's going to be everywhere. It'll be everywhere It'll be in your fucking city ally country that yes And we have all of these people who are blindly You know saying the same talking point for the last fucking 20 years that israel's our greatest ally Well, what has israel done for us? What have they done for us? This is not a conversation about the Jews This is about the country of israel and their leadership What have they done for the United States? Have they ever sent a troop to help us fight in a war? No fucking never look it up Okay, and they sent us aid no, what do they do for us? Oh, they blackmail all of our fucking influential people in our whole country so When they want something done We do it because nobody wants to be embarrassed all right and That needs to be corrected Trump is tone death to this. I don't or maybe he just doesn't fucking care, but he is There's a lot of people who are becoming I'm giving it time. I'm just making myself clear But there's a lot of people who have already made the decision that he is no different than the Biden administration Just in a different way then already like yeah Considering the considering the fact that we have no transparency that we were promised Not with JFK not with Epstein not you know these guys get in and they fucking start cheering all of a sudden they're quiet I haven't heard about the fucking Epstein list from anybody in fucking weeks a month Pan body's not talking about it cash per tell's not talking but why? Because they got called the fucking mountain bro and they got their blackmail was exposed to them and now they're quiet Because do nobody's off the hook because they're blackmail intel operation so wide it's listen It goes down to your particular cell phone It goes down to your they have it on you every single one of you listening they have your shit And like I mean so people are out there still trying to be reasonable. Okay If that's not the case then where is the shit at what's the hold up? It's it's insane dude and uh You know I'm giving it time but not much more time yeah because we haven't been we haven't they are not being transparent and dude here's what they're doing They're tossing us little bones hoping that fucking they can get away with that while they continue business as usual And I work that's not fucking cool. Oh, no, oh, hey prices are going down. Yeah, right. Oh fucking gas price. That's great. Cool But that's a little bitty bone as opposed to fixing the fucking actual problem, right? You know that's given someone a fucking tile and all instead of like removing the fucking spike that's driven into their fucking brain Two different things right that's real all right, so You know and a lot of people think oh, I'm turning up. No, I'm not I'm a patriot bro I'm not loyal to an individual. I'm loyal to the values. This country was based upon. I'm loyal to The betterment of our entire American population. I am an American. I'm also a nationalist. I also believe in America first These are real things that I believe in I don't fucking I'm not loyal to fucking anybody. I'm not loyal to Trump I'm not loyal to fucking anybody in power. I'm loyal to the people of this fucking country and what's best for them? And you know people get upset when I start to criticize trouble. Oh, you're fucking sound like a liberal. Well I don't know what to tell you bro. I call it like I see it You know, and I'm not gonna fucking sit there and you know I'm just not dude. I wouldn't be where I am in life if I just went along with the fucking flow Which is not I say what I think is right. I say what I observe and you could be think whatever the fuck you want of it I don't give a shit, but like dude he's I'm just telling you and I know some of you guys down there listening to the show You're losing the base out here because fucking bro you guys ran on America first and what you do is not necessarily American first You know Maybe we should all agree that the blackmail that Israel has on everybody extends to everybody and everybody shit And we can all say hey, guess what? I don't fucking care. How about that mother fuckers and they lose all their power You know what I'm saying fucking come blackmail me. I'll be like yeah, I did that Yep, so I don't think I told you what they got on me bro I might have said it was nine. It's actually eight like that's it like that's run. Oh, you know what I'm saying like 9 o'clock in the morning. Yeah, I only got shit on me Oh Just saying it's real. No dude like this scary monster that we're you know like there's not that bro dude. It's not there. I'm not will listen Americans and in politician they need to all ask themselves very simple Are you willing to fucking go down in history as a coward because you were too afraid of what people might find out about you versus doing what's best for the future generations of your children You see what I'm saying right like at some point you got to be like you know what bro It's life. I made some fucking mistakes. That's embarrassing, but it is what the fuck it is, but still fuck you Well, and like right now like I'm gonna hold this because I again like there's more there's more that has to develop but Thomas Massey representative Thomas is Massey that's another thing He's one of the only ones that have spoken out that's not embedded doesn't have an A-Pack guy right like And everybody's turning on them Trump included that's bullshit You know I'm saying that's bullshit. What does that tell you like that's a problem dude that makes me dude I observe this as it happens. I said I want you to have this go through the story and I'll talk about it at the end. Yeah um Well, I was holding that I don't I don't have that full code. Got Thomas, but because like again I wanted to get more on it. Well, it's scary dude. Yeah, and it very much so looks like it appears like Exactly what we've been saying hate to fucking say this dude, but like it you know the fact of how people are turning on Massey for not voting for something that's going to You know that really isn't good for the country Who's been the only guy that's out there that's called out the truth, you know who's told the truth about A-Pack Who's who's fucking said I mean it's dude it makes me it makes me feel like the Trump might be compromised by you know I know I'm very confident that the Biden administration was compromised by fucking China But now it seems like the Trump Organization is somehow disproportionately loyal to Israel for some reason I don't understand why that is the reason I wish someone could explain that to me You know what I mean outside of just saying The fucking stupid shit everybody so a little Zion Don or just like give me a logical explanation right like let's have a discussion Well, I mean educate me on why this is well most of it like I said I think there is no education on it No because what they do when you point any of this out is they attack you and they don't they attack your character and they attack you They don't attack the argument what you say yes Which dude that is a gaslighting uh You know Deflection technique that manipulators use you know, well, I mean I think I think too like I mean this is a A point that I make all the time with this conversation too. It's like you know because there is a religious argument to be made Okay from a Christian Judeo Christian standpoint cool But hey, I'm not talking we're not talking we're talking country to country and we have a separation between church and state and Our policies can't be influenced by that. Yeah, we're a Christian nation at heart sure But our government the decisions that are made with our tax dollars can't be influenced by that shouldn't be influenced by that Well, that's the whole separation between church and state. That's what I'm saying. I guess shouldn't be influenced by that It can't it constitutionally can't be influenced by that well, and that's that's one of the problems that you know Democrats and like look dude most Democrats are centrist, okay That's that's the truth There is a segment of leftist Democrats that make them all look fucking insane Where the Republican party is today is where the Democrats were 20 years ago, right? And all you have to do is go look at The speeches made by Democrats today were marching forward right right right right and what they've done is they've shifted the overton window Little by little by little by little to the left to where now Conservatism is not even conservatism which is okay with me because Real conservatism to me is no different than the progressive left because it's a bunch of people telling you how you fucking have to do everything I don't like that either um But young people don't really realize that you know they Which is really bad for the Democrat party because the youngest people you know the youngest voting uh segment demographic Has figured out like These people are fucking nuts and that perception is going to stick with them for a long time So it's gonna be really hard for them to really recalibrate and now you see them turning on Gavin Newsom But the funny thing is is in like dude. I fucking not a Gavin Newsom fan me either at all, but He's at least intelligent enough to move himself away from the crazy shit like the pivot's going Yeah, make the pivot dude to the rest of them. We're just fucking idiots They can't see that you know that you just got your ass beat for something that you were doing and now you decide to do three times as much of it Like right that's not a good strategy man, which I'm glad But I don't feel like that the Republican party is really that much different anymore like I feel like it's just different countries Different talking points different lies and manipulation And that's unfortunate bro because I really had a lot of hope The and dude like I said I'm giving it time. I'm an entrepreneur. I understand that things take time from the time you plant them to the time they sprout Totally get it and I do like a lot of the moves and I do think it's a hundred times better than what we had and where we would have gone but um Some of these moves, you know, you get they're indefensible You know like like as much as I as much as I know we what we know that's what I'm saying Yeah, and like bro, I'm no secret about this like I like Trump. Yeah, I like most of the shit he does. I don't understand why like Where is the where's the transparency bro that we voted for where's the information on the fucking guy who tried to shoot at you Where's where's the covid shit? Where's the the JFK where's the Epstein where's all the shit? There's only one reason That it wouldn't come out. There's only one reason it wouldn't come out And the reason is is that it'll implicate literally our own intelligence with Israeli intelligence and make the entire Intelligence community worldwide ineffective because it would it would remove all of the information The power and the blackmail and the shit they have it would it would it would ruin it So they wouldn't have the ability To do the things that they've been doing towards the bad guys anymore So I imagine what's actually happening in there and bad guys was in quotations because it's all Perception really but I imagine what's going on in there is Something to the effect of Well We promised them all this shit But if we give them all this shit We can't use it against the actual bad people So we're just we're gonna we're gonna give them some crumbs and then we're and I'm sure they're saying it on the inside We're just gonna actually use this for what it's supposed to be used for from now on and that's how they're just We'll use it for I've been there. Yeah, but bro that's not enough You guys have violated the trust of the American people to the point where we don't know what the fuck is up And what is down? We don't know what history is we don't know You know, we do I think they're lying to us like in this, you know, people are gonna get fucking weird about this And I think I'm crazy Crazy or but We don't even know our own fucking origins dude like we don't even know Humanity origins we don't know How long people have walked the face of the earth there's all kinds of different theories that are that are busted every day in terms of archaeological findings and scientific findings and so we have this Like bro, I think we've been lied to I think we've been lied to I think the two bit I think the two biggest things that we've been lied to Is that we have been intentionally kept in the dark about what we were actually capable of in terms of our human ability, okay? if you don't know that you can actually Visualize and create things in your existence because nobody told you then how would you ever figure that to fuck out? But I know you can do it because I've done it my whole life all right um And the other thing is that I'm starting to fucking truly believe Is that they have completely covered up the truth of Jesus Christ and that it was a historical truth And they've lied to us saying it was hocus-pocus when in reality archaeologists and scientists are starting to find more and more and more evidence That this was actually fucking real shit And I think they've done that so that they could remove the power of God And insert the power of man and I think those are two massive lies that we've been you know and I don't get on here and preached you guys you know and shit but I'm That's what I'm thinking like you see it growing that's real that's real shit man I see it the same way. I think we've been here for maybe 12,000 years. I think the earth is it's 12,000 years old I don't like because I brother listen because structures There's structures of That were built by humans that are older than that. Mm-hmm. That are archaeological finds and digs like bro It's it's not that hard to find the information bro go fucking go look at Robert Sepher's fucking YouTube channel Okay, uh, SCP-HER go watch some of these videos now some of these videos you're gonna watch and be like this guys You know this he's anti-Semitic or whatever, but go watch his videos. They're based on archaeological fact Okay Anthropology is is what he he does, but it's both but the point is is We've been lied to about a light dude and until Until our government is willing to side with the truth and Present that to the people. We're not gonna really fucking no shit and I don't believe in my personal opinion that These people have the right to keep anything from us They say well, we would have chaos in the streets. I don't know maybe for a minute But at least we would know what the fuck was going on, you know I don't know dude. It's we're in a weird place and I still stick to what my what I believe it's gonna take to fix the problem and I think it's still all of us becoming the best versions of ourselves and Stilling the culture and the standards that we want to see in the country into our household into our community Into the way we do things and to who we become what we create what we build And if we do that these people will not have the power to change that and so It's still a cultural issue that we're in control of But the sure would be nice to get some of the transparency and be able to answer some of these questions that we sit here in debate about and are distracted for and and part of me Thinks they want to keep you in the dark just to keep you distracted, you know That's real man guys jumping on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three um Let's talk about some crazy communist for a minute New subject to get bro i get frustrated man with this because people still think this is left right You could see it by the way they argue on the internet. It's not left right dude. There's fucking communist insurgencies on both sides of the aisle Yeah, well, I think that's the ignorance two people think it's only on one side. It's not it's on both. Yeah, it's all fucking both Um, but yeah, let's get into our third set of headlines here um This first one it's it's i'm not gonna say it's irrelevant, but I thought it was interesting I sure if you saw it there was a house hearing Uh, they started it ended in about two minutes After a lawmaker introduced representative Sarah McBride is mr. McBride. Did you see this video? No, so you remember the uh, we had this dude Okay, we talked about this dude. Yep, and he's dude I know I do think it's funny. They put them on this magazine. It's called the cut Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha I didn't do this. I you know the cut the cut. What'd you cut and look what look where the Quarers hands are But yeah, so so uh, you know Representative McBride was at this hearing we're supposed to be doing this hearing whatever and it abruptly ended Let's find out. Why check this clip out And now recognize the representative from Delaware, mr. McBride Thank you, madam chair Ranking member Keating also wonderful. Mr. Chairman, could you repeat your introduction again, please? Yes, it's a it's a We have set the standard on the floor of the house and I'm simply what is that standard, Mr. Chairman? Would you repeat what you just said and you introduced a duly elected representative from the United States of America? Please I will The representative from Delaware, Mr. McBride Mr. Chairman you are out of order. No, he's not Mr. Chairman, have you no decency? I mean I've come to know you a little bit, but this is not decent. We will continue this you will not continue it with me unless you introduce a duly elected representative the right way you did This hearing is a darn He was hoping to get some dick later Listen Listen He did the right thing Okay, this shame and guilt and embarrassment that is tried to put on people to call a man a woman and a woman a man is Part of the manipulation All right, if they can get you and this man obviously understands that if they can get you to call this person Mrs. You are Assuming that that is the truth you are you are buying in complicit. Yes, you were buying in Based upon pressure and force and guilt and shame not what is true Which is the point of how they operate all right, so That's what the pronouns were all about it did listen to this was what the masks was about Like I don't understand how this is so fucking hard to understand you don't do it The mask was about compliance the pronouns are also about compliance All right, if you don't wear the mask you're a bad person if you don't admit that a man could be a woman and a woman could be a man Guess what you're a bad person All right, and then it extends beyond being a bad person quote unquote and into we're gonna get you fired And we're gonna ruin your life and we're gonna tell people where you live And we're gonna Molotov cocktail your fucking business and broke that's communist, okay? So none of you should ever ever ever be pressured into saying something that you know to be on true Because these people are guilty you into it that man did exactly what he's supposed to do now if Mr. McBride would like to wear a dress and have his hair Looking like a woman and where women's clothes. I don't give a fuck. Oh, I don't care. Still do Dude and that's it. Yeah, I mean that is my wife has the same one listen man We can make jokes all we want but this is a the first thing that communist attack is the language All right, and they attack the language because that's how they can get you to buy in without officially buying in you're not They're not gonna come to you and say Hey, mr. Frassella we have this contract here sign it and you're now a communist That's not what the fuck they do they do it little by little by little they get you to admit things that that aren't true like Everybody's equal everybody's not equal, okay? They they make you admit things like you know Fuck dude all kinds of things that aren't true. I mean pretty much fucking everything in society that is Is a point of contention is because these people have twisted the language To to mean something that it doesn't fucking mean and um, you know It is what it is well. What's even crazier about this situation is like shortly after Transgender Democrat Congressman congressman. I saw this calls Republicans weird and bizarre. Let's check this clip real quick We will not take a lecture on decorum from a party that incited an insurrection Hmm, you're still beating that I appear to live rent-free in the minds of some of my Republican colleagues I wish that they would spend even a fraction of the time that they spend thinking about me Thinking about how to lower the costs for American families I wish they would spend a fraction of the time that they spend thinking about me Figuring out how to make government actually work better rather than making it work worse In order to prove that government can't work They are obsessed with culture war issues the Republican party is obsessed with culture war issues It is weird and it is bizarre No, it's not weird and bizarre which weird and bizarre is having grown men where fucking women's clothes in the fucking military And then you know what else is weird bizarre having grown men dressed as women talking to our fucking kids You know what else is weird and bizarre Putting books with pornography in the schools. You know what else is weird and bizarre Teachers allowing kids to pick their own identity and not telling the parents You know what else is weird and bizarre you mother fuckers didn't give two fucks about the price of anything the whole time that you were in fucking power to last In fact, we ruined people's lives you shut down their fucking businesses You pushed all the business to your billionaire friends who have now bailed out on you to support Trump because you're so fucking insane We're in a bizarre Yeah, but we're fucking bizarre You know what you're fucking you guys hired a fucking dude who stole women's luggage and wore their clothes and then he had to be fired You made tick-tock videos of daydams with 14-inch fucking fingernails making us laughing stock of the fucking world And we're weird the fuck out of here. We're you know we're in a bizarre you bro you cut your dick off like bro wait wait like I get it weird and bizarre bro You glued fucking titties to your chest bro like surgically You mother fuckers had mother fucker on the fucking White House lawn showing his titties that he glued on surgically bro Yeah, we're weird and bizarre weird and bizarre. Yeah, fuck out of here bro. Listen real weird real talk you these people Fucked us and they fucked us real good and we might be getting fucked again That's you have to be determined in my opinion, but There's no doubt what they did Okay, and flation just transitory fucking KJP got on the on the TV every day and lied about everything they had a fake fucking White House Weird but dude this fucking I Love like He must have a massive set of fucking balls to be able to stand up there and say that after what they just did for the last four years I like that. I mean like bro all the actual women behind them that go along with the shit That's the part that I don't fucking get Well notice like notice the patriarchy notice who those women are They are fucking white upper-class women Who have never dealt with reality? Okay That's it's always the same group of people. Do they not get that like a hypocrisy? They listen dude, you know what communist called the people who go along with it useful idiots Okay, the the fucking organizers of communism strategically target people like this who are of privilege because they know that those people have guilt About not living at the bottom of society So they can target those people to make rules that are completely logical and backwards Because those people have no idea what reality is really about they've never had to stand up to a a criminal physically They've never had to defend their girlfriend or their wife to a fucking criminal. They've never there's never been physical You know repercussions repercussions like there is for men It's a totally different thing dude Fuck dude That's why I'm man. I just It's wild. I don't know man. I I think I think people need to be very aware that When you go along with these things it's not only geared For for you to play along publicly. It's geared for you to mentally become more comfortable and conditioned to these things being true Okay, and they are not true you could put big titties and cut someone's dick off and that is still a fucking dude A weirdo and bizarre all you got to do is draw their fucking DNA sample Uh, and analyze their DNA look at it. It's gonna tell you the truth. Yeah, like dude a thousand years from now They're gonna dig up congressman I'm gonna dig up this fucking dude and be like has to do that was a dude. Yeah That's it And the people behind them those are those are women. Yep. Well allegedly. Legally. I don't fucking know.

You ever know the set? Well, because I mean they can join the men's boards, but like they'll still get you ever know to set It's not women dressing up as men that want to go dance at the fucking kids schools right or push those books. It's men Dressed up as women you don't see uh Women who dressed up as men making demands about using the man's bathroom.

I I think a lot of people say that about her just because they don't like her No, I'd say it because I think it's true. Well, I don't know I've I on on that situation I would have to see more proof to I think Candace Owens if you're listening you need to do it I mean you did the McCrone situation beautiful Well, it is interesting that Joan River said it and then like two weeks later she was dead she was dead. Yeah Well, fuck hopefully I don't die now she they have said that if she went to under she went under the anesthesia and that she is they killed it right there I don't get no surgeries coming up so she's be okay Um, but yeah, so I mean like let's watch her promotion video that she did with her brother Um here it is That's not her brother that's her brother Her brother looks like a fucking chick too.

Now there is a specific segment of this episode. I want to show you Okay, all right. Um, they were talking about their upbringing and the childhood and stuff like that, okay And I think her brother accidentally spilled some tea. Let's check this out As a result you and me we were we were physically close. Yeah Remember when we used to share a bedroom of course that was our our life growing up Uh The same room until you went to high school, right? That's that's right. Well, let's first Just call how small the apartment we lived in you know, it seemed like it was huge But it was essentially two bedrooms, right? No, it was one bedroom Well that little offshoot bedroom that mom and dad stayed in that with you would consider that a bedroom But that was the only bedroom the room we were in was actually the living room and the living room That we what we called the living room was actually the dining room Huh, okay You and Sal share bedrooms. Yeah Brothers yeah Yeah My I rest my case. Yeah I mean we didn't share bed We sure we had the same room for fucking probably till we were like I don't know high school now No, probably till we were like I don't even know Eight yeah, my daughter share room Yeah, and daughters sure yeah, brothers will see room look dude Come on, bro cheer that boy. I school look, but I know people that grew up and fucking one room house that had like eight kids And I also have in the same room. Yeah for sure. So I don't think that necessarily means anything maybe I mean, that's that's a reach You're digging you're digging Z-shon is it is it is it That's a different culture In our culture two different sex kids don't say you can do that, bro, even if they're poor I mean, that's a whole different discussion. That's what I'm saying an average situation, right? I agree with that Brothers and sisters don't look at their clearly saying that they're very poor they weren't poor in high school. We'll guarantee you that I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, but that dude Feels gay I mean, I'm getting my gay dars going away to fuck off And and I don't know bro and the way like the way they talk about it. That's right She didn't want to talk about she did not want to talk about that because the way That she was stuttering and hesitating she was trying to figure out what to say she didn't want to talk about it Listen, she ain't got no problem going on stage. You know, but her big fucking mouth and being great speaker because she is a great speaker Okay, so like that was definitely odd But uh, you know, the reality is is they're gonna find out real quick nobody wants to hear what the fuck you say In fact, most people are tired and blame The Obama's for the downfall of our fucking country, which I believe is actually true. That's true Well apparently there's been other rumors in shit too that like I know this I went on the comments just out just because I saw like I'm a podcast. Yeah, yeah, and bro They were bad. Yeah, like they were at every listen every single comment was Negative there was no positive geez That's rough. I mean, dude. This is what happens when you ruins people's country and then lecture about how racist they are while you're a fucking President of the United States and first lady. Yeah, right, you know like you're so I'm saying apparently is for eight years For eight years I was told actually was that 2008 18 for fucking I don't know 15 years now. I've been told I was racist just because I was fucking white While she's in the White House and I'm trying to build my business killing myself Okay, to fucking do so I've got you know, I got to listen to all this shit from these people like bro fuck off And I think that's how most people feel about the Obama's there sick of them. They've worn out their welcome They can get fucked along with fucking mr. Vingelberry dingo berry here whatever to fuck be whole Yeah, I mean dude bullshit, okay, and she'll hire some big PR agency That will buy her 10 million followers on fucking YouTube and a bunch of views on YouTube and all the shit to make her look like it matters And that's what they've been doing for the last 15 years since the internet became a real thing dude We just got they just came a report out that up to 60% of the internet is bots, right? All right, so this is how they've manufactured the social narrative for for over a decade They have used fake accounts that appear to be real To boost up narratives they agree with and tear down narratives. They don't agree with and It's I guarantee you bro. Take a look at her right now because her podcast is the big number one news for the last two days And she's only has 19 or $20,000 Check back in a month or two months. She'll have 5 million and it should be the hero pot It's all fucking hoax pokas.

By the way, that's happening Well, I mean it's simple supply demand Can't wait to fucking supply Wow, we burnt down we we burnt down all the tobacco plants. There's no cigarettes the price went up Yeah Make these cigarette prices go up and shit All right, man thumbs up double fuck was second on the NFL thumbs up double fuck hell I reads NFL rookie fumes after being forced to pick up six figure check for team dinner at luxury Detroit steakhouse So let's dive into this a little bit. So Detroit Lions rookie Terry on Arnold. Well, I've taken some big groups to dinner Yeah, how the fuck do you get to six figures? Well, we got think one. These are all like giants. Okay, and it's pretty much like majority of your veterans on the team So all right, let's hear it. Yeah Detroit's line rookie Terry on Arnold received a scare when he reportedly picked up the check at the team's dinner rookie dinners are often a traditional welcome to the NFL by a lot of teams around the league when the franchise is new newcomers are made to pay the often extortionate Tap for the veteran teammates and dude as the 2024 season came to a close it was Arnold's turn to step up for the Detroit Lions And the first round pick received a reality check along with the actual check Arnold the 24th overall pick and last year's draft took the social media to reveal That he allegedly paid the check for himself in 19 of his teammates at the luxurious sexy steak restaurant in Detroit on the fucking strip club probably yeah probably sounds like it Um, they get some special yum yum sauce in there uh The next thing's gonna be Arnold is is on the injured reserve list because he contracted a non-curable sexual disease. He did a joke to his test positive for something Yeah Well, uh, yeah, so let's check this lip out. He posted this to uh, uh, tiktok. I believe check it out So a lot of f�ers got a team money team medallion on his fucking chain. Well, so the check So he's got floyd made weather as his fucking agent. Yeah, the check was $80,000 and then attacks and Ingrituity it total came to a $102,000 yeah, a hundred and two thousand dollars. I mean, that's a lot for night for 20 people bro Bro, what the fuck were y'all ordered? Oh, I mean look that has to be a strip club because only only a strip club Do you pay that much for regular stuff? Yeah, it's true like you know steaks like fucking $500. Yeah, that's right It has to be it has look it up dude sexy steak is that strip club? It's a real restaurant It's a steakhouse. Well, that must be their theme like sexy steak like we're not a strip club, but we charge like one Yeah, right, right, you know, you know, you know, you have to leave worry about getting married It's not that expensive to a flaminion is 70 bucks. Oh, that's pretty. That's pretty. I mean, that's up there That's a nice restaurant there. That's not like crazy. That's not crazy But I mean fuck what what would they go to any Vegas restaurants more than that? Yeah 70 new 20s 1400 look bro. They had to have they had to have been ordering like all the big bottles of liquor and champagne shit Jesus, but dude, I tell you what I've taken some big groups to dinner and we've gone hard Hard and You know not even half of that. Yeah, right. You know, I'm saying right what's the most you've ever had to spend it in dinner? Well, I know what I'm a little embarrassed to say Because like people are gonna get upset But you know You're taking your teams and shit. Yeah, it's different about 40 grand 40 thousand dollars. Yeah, but that's like a big group It's like a big that's like a whole company. Yeah eating whatever fuck they want. Oh, okay, well, that's not saying That's not drinking and eating the whole night. Yeah, that's not bad. Yeah, that's not bad. Not not This is when the company was smaller. No, it is now. Yeah, like obviously we couldn't fit everybody But this was like we bring the we bring the restaurants here, you know, yeah, right. Yeah, but but I mean yeah dude, I mean Uh I believe it was a craft state dinner and drinks that we went to in Vegas and which is an amazing place Take care of the whole team. We had like, you know, the party room plus like half the restaurant You know, it was 40 grand. I wasn't shocked by it. Yeah, right, you know, but like it wasn't 20 people. It was like 60 people. Yeah, right, you know, that's crazy, bro. Well apparently so Uh What the article continues while many NFL stars rake in millions including Josh Allen and his new 330 million dollar contract rookies tend to be on lower deals Arnold's rookie deal Uh, it's a four-year contract worth 14.3 million dollars, but it's 2024 base salary was only 795 That's a big chunk for fucking dinner then. Yeah Yeah, damn dude. They hit him hard. I'd be pissed too. All right. That's one's apparently that's a thing like the rookie dinners are a thing man Yeah, well, dude. I mean, that's that's not cool. Yeah, that's cool. It's fucked up That's fucked up. Yeah, it's fucked up That's fucked up. Yeah, that's not cool, man. No, that's that that is fucked up. So you know, but I don't know maybe we you know Culture maybe I guess it's a culture with that. It's to me. I look at it. It's like fucking hazing But we all know what to fuck happen. Yeah, everybody went in there in order five of everything It was the most expensive thing on the fucking menu. Yeah, right, right the Louis V's the fucking Half the home with them, right, you know, and Fuck well, I feel bad for that guy. That's dude. That's Fucking one seventh of his entire salary and by the way that's before Exactly. So that means after tax he's making 400 grand. It's probably more like a quarter of his fucking take home income That's fucked up. That is fucked up. It's fucked up It'd be different if he signed a hundred million dollar deal, right? You know, that's different man Dude, I'd be pissed too. Should we do rookie dinners here though for the team like Joe's the newest guy What I was just thinking about this like Joe's the newest guy of the team Right I'm not doing it.
