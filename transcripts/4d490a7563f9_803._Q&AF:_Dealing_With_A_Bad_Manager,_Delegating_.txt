What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realist say goodbye to the lines the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today we have Q and A up that's where you submit the questions and we give you the answers now if you're unfamiliar with the show Q and A F is about anything it's about personal development business life entrepreneurship how to kick ass you can ask about what's going on in the world too but typically it's about how to get better we'd like to start the week off with that now if you want your questions answered on the show you could do so a couple different ways the first way is guys you can email these questions in to ask Andy at Andy for sell.com or you go on YouTube in the comment section you could drop your question in the comments will choose some from there as well now tomorrow we're going to have crews the internet that's a current event show okay we call it CTI we put topics up on the screen we speculate and watch true what's not true and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world all right other times we're going to have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes and me giving you some real talk and then we have 75 hard verses that's where people who have completed the 75 hard program come on the show they talk about how they were before how they are now and how they use the 75 hard program to reclaim their life if you're unfamiliar with the 75 hard program it is the initial phase of the live hard program which is the world's most popular mental transformation program in history and it's free you can get it for free the entire thing at episode 208 on the audio feed only there's also a book available called the book on mental toughness you can get it Andy for so a calm it is a lot more in depth it includes the entire live hard program plus a whole bunch of other stuff a bunch of chapters about mental toughness why it's important how to use it some case studies on some famous people who have used mental toughness to become the famous people that you recognize all right so you can get that at Andy for so a calm now you're probably wondering why it is we do personal development and what's going on in the world and it's because this we have to be aware what's going on and then we have to know the techniques on how to get better and become the change of society so we do both of those things here we talk about what's going on in the world we talk about what we need to do there and then we talk about through Q&A after personal development how we need to individually get better because the truth of the matter is nothing changes unless we change we are society all right personal excellence on an individual level is the ultimate rebellion that all of you are looking for all right so that's why we do what we do and we do it a little different than everybody else we don't run ads on the show okay I don't answer anybody I don't have anybody tell me what I can and can't say and in exchange for that I ask very simply that you help us share the show we're constantly dealing with shadow bands traffic throttles all that stuff that they do on the internet hopefully it ends soon after the election but right now we're dealing with it and we need your help to grow the show so if the show helps you if it makes you think if it makes you laugh it gives you a new perspective if it's something that you think needs to be heard do us a favor and don't be a hoe show the show all right what's up dude it's going on man oh not much I think sweater weather is full in fact getting fall we should get some onesies yeah was you where one I'm on backwards with the feet or without the feet oh well if you got those like slippers like you got I think you could know I think if you're gonna wear onesie has me don't want to feed in it yeah otherwise it's not a onesie what is it it's a to see because you got to wear it it's a three-seek she got where socks that's three pieces a onesie is one piece a true onesie has fucking do you have I feel like you're when I was a kid I had him I liked them I thought they were sweet yeah all right I just we got a I'm sure there's dudes out there that were him as grown adults you know I have I do have long john that's like a full but no feet yeah I use that for riding in the code yeah riding what bikes what kind of bike like a huffy it's one's a stole my no man yeah there's nothing wrong with them people like them that's fine but yes what sweater sweater yeah it is I love it yep it's not bad it's a little chilly it's not bad but you know it's Missouri it is Missouri all right so what we got man listen I got some goings all right good got three specific ones that are good for you and you guys listen so let's make people better sounds good guys any question number one Andy I started with a new company two years ago to date I quickly became top sales as the youngest guy on the team before I started the team was between 35 and 50 year olds me at 25 came in started walking circles around I think they all got upset at the new young guy and all eventually moved on two years in I'm seeing your sales and I'm wanting to put myself in a position to be a sales manager the current manager can't follow through doesn't really manage the team bad bad mouth after all of our meetings and it's just a bad manager the owner is pretty hands off in my territory so doesn't see the issues firsthand my question for you is what's what's the best most ethical way to go about this prior to this I had seven years of retail management so running a sales team isn't anything new to me I know the value I could provide would amount to a successful team all around rather than just the star players you're an owner I'm sure you've had employees come to you on this thanks for your advice well I was there a question there the fucking question I guess what's what's the most ethical way to go about this how do you do this a manager that's in a bad position but a owner owner that hands off how do you how do you battle that well I mean look dude you don't have to have permission to lead anything that's the biggest thing that people don't understand you don't have to have a title or a permission or acknowledgement to lead all right leading is something that leaders do on their own regardless of what title they have in fact some of the most effective leaders in the world are what you would call peer leaders meaning they don't have the title of leadership but they take over the lead of the team and you know what happens whenever that person who is a peer leader becomes the leader of their team now they have leverage now they can go to their manager they say hey all my guys are with me bro we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this you're not doing your part we need this we need this we need this to do our jobs and you're not providing that so what do we need to do to get that okay and that's one way you can go about it another way you can go about it is become undeniably great at selling whatever it is you're selling with your team and then when you're kicking ass and everybody else is looking like shit which you seem very confident that you can do which I question your confidence to be completely honest anybody who's 25 years old that sounds that confident usually has an ego issue just being honest so if you are who you say you are and you can do what you say you can do here's what I'd recommend I'd recommend putting up numbers that that company's never fucking seen before ever in the history of their company not even close and then I'd recommend going to the owner himself and saying hey you see what I'm doing here I could do this for your entire company if you let me how about that that's an ethical way what do you mean ethical you mean like going around the manager but that guy's fucking not doing his job who's he holding back oh he's holding back you he's holding back all your teammates all the people you're working with so really the ethical thing is to go to bat for those guys do what I'm saying and then get this motherfucker out of the way straight up with your performance or get him to start rowing the boat so there's a lot of ways you can go about this but the number one thing that has to happen for you to go about this is you have to win and put up numbers that no one can fucking deny which everybody talks about all the time all the numbers they can put up and all the shit they can sell and how great they were at their last job and how awesome they're gonna be at this job if we just give them this and this and this and this well if you're that good why the fuck are you not doing it okay so let's be real the owners met 50 fucking 25 year old kids that have come to him and said I could do this and this and this and this and this and this and I'm gonna tell you what the minute you walk out the door he says yeah that I heard that before but the response would be different if you went out and you put the fucking numbers up and then went to him okay and this is what people do if you're an entrepreneur I'm gonna give you the most valuable fucking advice you'll ever get about providing for yourself an income it's not hey if if you pay me more I'll do this that's not how the fuck it works okay it's I'm doing this I'm kicking ass I'm dominating I'm putting up numbers that you've never fucking seen before I'm worth this that's the way it works a lot of you motherfuckers try to get paid off of what you're gonna do when in reality you only get paid off what you're already doing or what you've done all right so and that's entitlement that comes from an entitled culture of the younger generation who believes that they're worth way more than they are they say oh pay me what I'm worth well you're not selling anything you're not doing anything well if you paid me I go do it that's not how the fuck it works that's not how it works nobody pays a fucking you know a fucking baseball player you know a hundred million fucking dollars for what they're gonna do they get the hundred million dollar contract if they proven themselves okay and they may have proven themselves in the minor leagues they may have proven themselves in college they may have proven themselves for that first two year contract where they made league minimum and now they're getting a hundred two hundred million dollar deal okay but there's a prove yourself phase that has to be recognized that a lot of you young motherfuckers don't get okay if you're not putting up numbers and you're not putting up records and you're not setting the standard you don't have a standing to go in and ask for anything so don't get it twisted don't listen to your fucking loser friends and your uncle who never did anything and all this shit when they badmouth their place if well they paid me I do this more well that's why you're not getting paid because you're a fucking idiot you don't understand how works works like this put up or shut the fuck up that's it you're either putting it up your set and records you're kicking ass and you're gonna get paid more or your coasting your bitching your whining and you're gonna be fucking you know working a fucking Taco Bell in your 50 years old yeah man I want to I want to there's two things I really want to dive in on this you know that first part where you're you know people expect you know they'll get the title first and then they become this leader you got a lead before you get the title can we dive in this a little bit more well I mean dude a lot of people believe that they believe that you know someone has to come along and annoy them the leader that's not how it works and then they start leading yes that's not how it works you lead and then you get the title of leaders okay you go first you help your team you show your team how to win you earn their respect you perform personally and you get them all to follow you down that path of performance now we can talk about something now now you know what I'll say you're a leader and I'm gonna give you some sort of title to recognize that but waiting around for the title to be a a dorm you know on to your fucking quilted business card or what you think businesses about is not a way to become successful bro a lot of people just have it backwards and you don't have to wait for that title to start leading you shouldn't you should start trying to become a leader right now you know and a lot of people don't like that because like they feel like they're the kid in class with the fucking apple up at the front well you know what that kid in class with his apple up at the front that gets all the good grades and my fucker makes all the money okay so do you want to get paid or do you want to feel a little bit weird about standing up to all your friends and be like hey bitches we got a fucking go and win I'd rather do that and get paid I don't really care if they don't like it I don't care if they think I'm a suck at I don't care sucking ass and saying this all this you kiss it as brown nose that's loser ass shit we're trying to fucking win okay that's what we're here for and winning for us looks like doing our job at the highest possible level proving that we can do it and then the money comes later it's no different when you're an entrepreneur you have provide the product you provide the service you do it in an excellent way over the top and then people give you their money that's what the fuck it works it doesn't ever work as you know you get the money first hey I got an idea come spend money with my company and if you spend enough money I'll give you a good experience right now that's what employees fucking say that's what they think yes it makes no sense no hey all her hey Steve if you pay me three times as much I'll do three times as much well there's no proof that you can do three times as much you're not even good at this shit you do yet you see what I'm saying yeah like it's just backwards logic bro it is it is I also want to touch on this piece too because you kind of you mentioned it but let's dive into it because I feel like this this can relate to listen here's what you should do if you're an entrepreneur you should become the best you fucking can you should put up undeniable results you should monitor everything that you do and keep track of every win that you have so that you can go in and make a case for yourself to move up in the company because no one's gonna come to you and say you know hey man I think you should be president of the company you're gonna have to inch your way and inch your way and inch your way up by showing what the fuck you've done okay and I know everybody thinks they do a lot but if you start tracking on paper you'll find out exactly what the fuck you do and exactly how many wins you have and a lot of people overestimate their wins which makes them overestimate their value and when they don't get recognized with the value in return they get bitter they get angry and they end up giving up on the ability to go out and create something for themselves when the whole reason they're in the position they're in is because they're overestimating their value based upon you know what they think and they don't have the perspective to think anything right you see what I'm saying right so I got turned on paper man well Joe got fucking 50 it's like who you use a parent it to you listen if people simply took their wins and tracked them down and made a list of them they find out much more quickly what they're actually worth because most people don't do shit most people spend most of their day trying to fucking play business or pretend to be busy or pretend to be working or sort of slithering into the corner so nobody notices them and then they get pissed when they get passed over and and the career opportunities go to other people okay it is what it is winners win losers fucking lose winners are gonna come in they're gonna get everybody to win with them losers are gonna come in they're gonna pull everybody back you want to be on the winning side because the winning side is the guy who wins in life and the losers don't get shit and that's it that's a reality that these fucking kids have lost they don't understand and all another thing they don't understand is how fucking hard it actually is a lot of people think I'm just gonna show you know what they say I show up on time I've never been late well no shit you're not supposed to be I do my job you're supposed to do your job it's not those are the people that progress it takes way more than that it takes you producing undeniable real results and then making a case for yourself saying hey look what I've done and by the way when you do that you'll be confident in your own skills because you can actually see them one through 20 right here okay and if they don't want to fucking help you and they don't want to progress you and they don't want you to do better in their company guess what you can do you can go somewhere that will yeah I want to touch on this because I feel like a lot of people like especially the young guys can relate to this situation but I want to spend some time on talking about what not to do in this situation right you you're a builder of culture you understand culture more than anybody I feel like this person I'm not saying you know he's gonna go do this but I feel like it's an easy thing to feel you know all right well I'll just try to talk to this manager I'm gonna do my best and make him look bad and talk shit stupid like let's talk about those people never win those people never win just so you know if you're the type of person that thinks you're gonna get ahead by pulling other people down it will never ever ever work it never works it never works we talked about this with Ed my lat when he was on my show like two three years ago there's a ladder to success and the people above you have been through more shit than you and they can very easily recognize that you're full of shit okay you're not gonna fool you might fool some people on the bottom rungs you might get a little bit higher and full some more people but eventually someone's gonna see what the fuck you're about and when they see that you're about tearing everybody around you down to get ahead they're not gonna allow you on their team because they understand what that's gonna create it's gonna create a massive cancer that they're gonna have to clean up later so all you fuckers that think you're real smart and you're smarter than your boss and you're some they've seen you a thousand times they fucking seen you you're not the first mother fucker to think that they've seen you you see what I'm saying I know this is a great idea let me talk my manager this has never been done before dude they've seen you there's been a hundred of you before and that comes from their ego thinking that they're the smartest mother fucker on the planet you know they think oh well you know they've never seen anybody like me because I'm so good at my job and they and they think in there you think you're smarter than your fucking boss who's been doing whatever the fuck he's been doing for 25's 30 years you're an idiot he's seen you he's seen a hundred like you you're not gonna fool them the only way to get up the ladder is by doing it the right way it's by being great at what you do getting the other people around you to be great at what they do and then you will be rewarded I'll fucking love it man I love it guys Andy question number two hey Andy thanks for taking this question I own a landscaping business and I'm about to finish up my second year it's two full-time guys including myself and then we have occasional part-time guys that help our motto has always been stay small long enough and we will be big enough soon enough I do believe it's best to keep the cash high and overhead low I also find myself struggling as I work in the field all the time it's hard to be able to work on the business side of things and grow isn't normal to get completely fed up with the day-to-day tasks because you get to a point where you almost feel like you're above it I keep getting this inner voice in my head telling me that I'm above the bitch work because I'm the one that's obtaining all the business in the first place maybe I'm just expecting more out of the other guys since they don't do any sales how can I combat this prideful ego or is it time to take the step and delegate tasks to other guys while I solely focus on sales and growing do you know why your guys don't want to work for you you know why they don't want to work because you think what they do is bitch work oh boy oh buddy you just fucking said it in a question oh buddy you think people are gonna come and fucking work for you if you think what they do is not important in this bitch work and whatever you do is more important you ever been around someone like that did you like them did you want to work for them did you want to run through a fucking brick wall for them or have you ever worked for someone that will get on the fucking line with you and pack some motherfucking boxes or sweep the floor or help you be fucking great at what you do now did you want to work for that guy do you want to run through a wall for that guy okay you're not the guy yet you haven't figured it out okay so this isn't about delegating this is about an attitude adjustment that you need to make as a fucking leader and that's this without them you ain't shit so you might as well help them feel real good about what they do and help them be great at that so they can progress and when they progress that will help you progress it's very fucking simple okay the fact that you even wrote above the bitch work shows me that your ego is so fucking out of control that you don't even understand your own fucking business all right I'm a McDonald's making the fries as bitch work well what if the fries are bad what if the fries are soggy what if the fries fucking get over fried what if they're what if they got oil all over them what if they're not salted what how's that gonna help affect your business is that bitch work now see what I'm saying oh man so this is an attitude adjustment from someone who's clearly not ready to fucking lead that needs to make a fucking adjustment say hey I am not going to ask my people to do anything that I cannot do at a very fucking high level and every chance I get I'm gonna help them do that my fucker I take trash out here real talk there every single day I go to one of our fucking trash bins and I fucking empty it you know why because I want to remind myself what the fuck it actually takes to remind to run this place my job as the fucking founder okay is not to think of myself as better than everyone my job is to fucking make everybody else better that's the job and if I went around and said what they do is bitch work do you think they'd want to get better or what they do how do you think a grown man feels when you think what he does for a living when you're paying them to do it that you think that's bitch work how do you think he feels you think he feels confident when he goes home you think he feels better about himself you think he feels excited to come to work knowing that his owner thinks that what he does is bitch work you think he wants to get better at it you need to add a two to just mbbrow you need to get the fuck out of business that's my fucking answer no I am let me ask you this because I mean like even just to that part though right like you know when you started on the retail side I mean how long were you in the stores for six years and then and then four more after that that's I mean so 10 fucking years yeah and you know what's funny it's what I miss the most I fucking loved it I love doing what we did in the stores I loved helping people I love being and everybody's in a hurry to get away from there wherever they are and they don't understand how great they fucking have it yeah be sitting making big decisions that are that that require you to consider the well-being of hundreds of other people and their families is an immense amount of pressure that no one could possibly comprehend and the only person that can do it without feeling that is a fucking sociopath that gives zero fucks about those people and you know what if you're that way those people will always know it and they won't come for you so the only way they won't go to war for you the only way that you can actually build an amazing culture is by truly being about it you have to everybody fucking hears what I say about this and then they think they can like skirt the corner yeah or like make it diluted no why do you think I'm here seven days of fucking week because I give a fuck I give a fuck about what we're doing I give a fuck about our people I give a fuck about our customers and I care about at the level at which things are done here and so does all the other leadership dude you listen here's the reality this is just the truth okay most people that are in business that think they're entrepreneurs should be in business because entrepreneurship has become so glorified and so fucking celebrated and it's been made into this thing that it isn't it's been made into this easy job right I'm going to be an entrepreneur so I don't have to answer to anybody I want to be an entrepreneur so I can have freedom okay you answer to your customers you answer to your employees if when you become the entrepreneur you you answer to way more people than when you're an employee all right so the truth of the matter is you know if you got the attitude that people around you are doing bitch work there's no secret why your business is fucked up bro yeah man I love it grow the fuck up realize this there's ethical entrepreneurship and there's unethical entrepreneurship ethical entrepreneurship is knowing that every single person that is around you deserves your best as a fucking founder owner CEO leader okay because if you don't come in and do your fucking best it hurts them it hurts their fucking families that's ethical entrepreneurship unethical entrepreneurship which always fails is people who come in and they say I'm not going to do the bitch work yeah I love it I'll tell you what dude I fucking hate that that pisses me off I mean I think I mean I'll fucking get it bro yeah but that's the thing I mean the the lack of perspectives the thing though man you know it's a hell of a power to hell with power man you know how bad that hurts people the fucking that they look man you got to build people you go to my Instagram profile it says very simply builder of people and companies okay it says people first for a reason you got to build people you think people want to come to work for you because they know that you think what they do is bullshit bro that's fucking bullshit wow man it's wild I hope I listen I hope he hope he takes it fucking makes that adjustment well he either will or he won't and if he doesn't he'll fucking lose yeah man I love it guys Andy question number three all right a little bit more for person development on this for a young guy okay good morning I really need your guidance my son goes to a Saint Louis area high school he's a junior and he's been playing football for eight years his freshman year he played on the junior varsity team his sophomore year he played on the junior varsity and varsity teams and was told he couldn't start varsity because he was a sophomore and the upper classmen started which is fair this year he hasn't played at all and they have been putting a sophomore in his place at center I found out through a little sleuthing that the sophomore's father went to the same school knows the coaches has a lot of money let me give you a little bit more background on my son so you don't think the other kid is just better and I'm just a big whiner my son is 16 he did 75 hard the 75 hard program over the summer he went to all the summer practices camps worked out at the school with the team went to work at home depot and after work he ran up to edge fitness and worked out and then ran home he also went to some college camps and hopes and scholarships started his own Twitter account for scouts he's lost 50 pounds reading books whatever had to happen he did it I'm at the beginning of the school year he planned on being a team leader now he doesn't care and wants to quit all of his sports including football wrestling and throwing my son's father's alive but absent I was taught to never question coaches and I don't know what to do please help thanks thank you for your time I'm a lawyer listener I feel like there's a hell of a opportunity here what would you think I mean this is a make or break opportunity for that kid putting on what he decides to do well I mean if he quits here he's gonna quit everything hard in life okay so that's the first thing you gotta understand and you should probably communicate that to him and if not let him listen to this if you quit now you're gonna fucking be a loser your entire life that's it we don't get what we always want and to get what we always want we have to be so much better than it's unquestionable and I can tell you for a fact not knowing the circumstances that is not the case because if you were unquestionably that much better than that Southmore in front of you I mean dominant you would be playing okay so let's this is called real AF this isn't called feel good AF you're not good enough okay because you gotta be so good that you gotta be able to outpace the people with the relationships and the connections and the politics and the money because you know what when you go out in the real world you're gonna face that same shit you think that doesn't exist in the real world you think it doesn't exist that people have connections or have you know of some sort of backdoor deal or that's all real shit bro and you're getting your first taste of it here as a young man which is actually a blessing in disguise so my advice would that would be this if you quit you're gonna quit everything hard in your life and that's a big fucking problem for you because I could promise you and this is coming from someone who played sports at a high level it gets a lot harder a lot harder all right so take that for what it's worth if you were my son I wouldn't let you quit okay my dad I tried to quit when I was fucking in high school because I didn't like to shit that out my coach did yeah you know what my dad said you ain't fucking quitting that's it yeah you're into the practice as well so you know and I was lucky enough to have a dad that pushed me like that and you know my dad will probably nowadays if if if his parenting was broadcast all over the internet he'd probably be in jail but the truth of the matter is I'm very thankful for it and I think there's a lot of bad parenting strategies out there because of the feel good do gooders you know in the participation trophy culture which doesn't sound like that's the case here but we have a lot of parents that just don't push their kids and anything and then they act surprised when they don't do well in life to do well in life you have to be good and you're learning the lesson here you can't be as good you have to be better and you have to be so much better that doesn't matter if that fucking kids dad was building a whole entire new school out of his own pocket you gotta be better than that kid and play where everybody in the crowd knows that if he plays that kid it's only because of that and you're not that good because if they did they will play you all right get back to fucking work bro you know it sounds like you got a really good momentum yeah it sounds like you're doing 75 already lost 50 pounds you made a lot of progress dude I know you're frustrated because of this going on and and that's that's aggravating I don't get everything I want in fact right before this fucking podcast I had to tell these guys that I wasn't getting something that we playing on getting did I not yep okay so I'm fucking a grown man that shit still happens and I have all the connections okay it's gonna happen to you too so how are you gonna respond are you gonna respond by saying oh poor little me he gets the advantage because his dad's big shot and you'll be saying that same shit at your job and fucking ten years you'll be saying oh he got the promotion because uh you know he sucked owners we we you know like you'll make up some bullshit and dude that's what and then your life your life you'll be 50 years old and you'll be a loser and that'll be that and I don't think that's what you want bro you're 15 16 years old you're putting all this work don't fucking quit get better those are the two things that you need to do and if you don't get better than that kid because dude sometimes you can't be better than people some like if I was playing basketball against fucking Lebron James it doesn't matter how much work I do or how much I put into it because he's still gonna be better Lebron James yeah so we got to be written this is a good lesson for people we got to be real about our strengths and weaknesses so that we can produce the result that we're looking after and yes there's a lot of truth to you can do anything you want but there's also limits to that too okay in the real world yes man and but they're not as bad as you think their limits based upon like physical ability right like in sports like bro if you run a fucking five two forty you probably ain't playing fucking college football you know unless you're four hundred fucking pounds you know what I'm saying if you can't dunk a basketball you know you probably ain't playing in the NBA right you know there's limits and the good thing is is that in the business world in the life world there's far less limits than in the sports world so you're dealing with a very harsh reality possibly now it could be possible to that you're just a young man and you haven't developed enough and you're just kind of getting your athletics going on because you're making all this progress and you could come back next year and be fucking dominant I promise you this if that kid knows he's gonna start over you next year and you're fucking hungry he ain't gonna work as hard as you're willing to work he's chill yeah so what if you come in next year the season's over already what if you come in next year and you fucking crush that would be my advice okay and and dude you're wanting to play college ball you're wanting to go pass that that's not too late your dreams are not crushed you're frustrated and if we give up when we're frustrated bro we can't win okay a lot of winning has to do with us not quitting when everybody else quits that's really it it's a game of longevity it's a game of dedication and commitment and perseverance and grit and fortitude which dude you've already realized doing 75 hard okay so stop feeling sorry for yourself get your fucking ass in the weight room get yourself eating the right food take it real fucking serious and come out next fall and smash fucking skulls bro that's what you should do okay and and take this as a real life lesson brother okay you it's not always going to be fair it's not fucking it's it's hardly ever fair but you know how you overcome unfairness by being so much better than nobody can question it that's how you overcome it and and for all of us for most of us who come from the real world we have to be that good to succeed bro because it just ain't fair people with connections people with money people with politics people those people are gonna get the opportunities before people like us that come from regular world okay so how do we overcome that we overcome that by being fucking great so you gotta go be great and you gotta put in more work than I know you think you did a lot but you gotta put in more than that and this goes back to the question I said just before this what people think it takes and what it actually takes is it's completely two different things and while you've made good progress man we got more to go so let's get the fucking works stop you on sorry for ourselves I fucking love it man I love it guys Andy that's a Monday man yeah all right guys look let's go out let's kick some ass we'll see you guys tomorrow
