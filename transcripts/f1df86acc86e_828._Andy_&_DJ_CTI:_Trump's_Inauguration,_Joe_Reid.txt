We have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking and that's what CTI stands for. It stands for crews the internet's we put topics on the screen we speculate on what's true and what's not true and then we talk about how we the people have to fix these problems going on in the world. All right. Other times throughout the week we're going to have Q and A F that's where you submit questions and we give you the answers because submit your questions a couple different ways. And that's what is. Guys, email these questions into ask and Andy at Andy for salad.com or you go on YouTube in the comments section on the Q and A F episodes drop a question in the comments will choose some from there as well. Other times we're going to have real talk real talk is just a five to 20 minute segment of me giving you some real talk and then we have what's called 75 hard versus that's where people who have completed the 75 hard program and used it to transform their lives come on the show they talk about how they were before how they are now and how they used the 75 hard program to fix their dumpster fire of a life and how you can do the same. Now you can get the 75 hard program. It's not a challenge. It is a program at episode two zero eight on the audio feed only two zero eight if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard. It is the initial phase of the live hard program which is the world's most famous mental transformation program that you can get for free. At episode two zero eight there's also a book. The book is called the book on mental toughness. You can get that at Andy for salad.com. The book is not required but it is much more detailed than the podcast. It goes in and out up and down left and right. All the things if you're somebody who wants to know what's the details are that's what you want. You want the book plus it has a whole bunch of other stuff that is relevant to mental toughness. Okay, so you get that at Andy for salad.com. Now we do things a little different here on the show. We don't run ads. We're the biggest show in the world that doesn't run ads. We don't run ads because I don't want to report to anybody. I'm a successful entrepreneur. I can afford to promote and produce this show on my own and I ask very simply that you support us in a couple different ways. One, if you see these first form energy drinks in your grocery store and your convenience store, you see our meat sticks, our snacks, our bars, our supplements. Our apparel. Support us that way. That's a great way to support us. But also, we need to share the show. Okay, that's the main thing. We're constantly dealing with censorship issues. Hopefully those are getting cleared up but they haven't yet. So we ask very simply that if the show makes you think, that makes you laugh, it brings you value, it gives you a new perspective. If it teaches you things, if you make you have a better day, do us a favor and tell one person. Okay. We're going to show with one person with each show that you listen to and if you guys do that, we'll have a fucking army of light-minded individuals to counteract this bullshit going on in culture. So make sure you pay the fee. Don't be a hell. Show the show. All right. What's up? What's going on, man? Nothing, dude. Yeah. Where's your grape? Oh, I drank it. Okay, good. I thought you stole it. I was just making sure that you know, get some feet of its own. I was pretty sure you stole it. Now I drank it. Yeah, it was good. It's my favorite one. It's good, bro. It's timeless. It's a classic flavor. Yeah, man, what else is going on with you, man? You know, took a few weeks off. You know, now on day two, 75th of hard, I feel really good already, dude. It's super sore. Because I haven't done it in a while. You know, the last 90 days, 120 days or so of the year last year, I didn't even do cardio at all. So my feet are sore even from one day of doing, because I'm going to do rucks. Okay. Yeah. And I'm definitely gassed. Yeah. But, you know, I'll get it back quick. I feel, I already feel better. I don't look any different, but I feel better. It's just knowing you're back in the, yeah, back in the cycle. Yeah, I'm a little thick right now, but, you know, I call it juicy. It's nice. Juicy, thick, dense, saucy, yeah. All the good stuff. All of that, man. I'm down with it. I'm down with it, man. Um, bro, I was shredded when we went to Colorado. Like, when we first went to Colorado, I was fucked. You were peaked. Yeah. I was fucking ripped. And then mountain standard. Mountain standard got me, bro. They fucking got me with all those drinks and that clam chowder and all that fucking mento and, oh, the food was so good. I'm listening. It ruined me. Leave right now. You fucked up my palate now. And I can't eat like regular food anymore. I got to eat all this gourmet shit. I'm going to graduate into the little stuff. Yeah. Oh, bro. That shit pisses me off. I know. I can't do that. Don't put that shit in front of me. That's a little bit of my palate. Teasing me. Yeah. Anyway. But feeling good, man, you know, working on some big projects. Got some big projects getting ready to launch. They were going to hurt some fucking feelings. Let's just put it that way. Actually, a few of them are going to hurt some fucking feelings. Got the MSEO project launching here in a few weeks. Excited about that. It's going to be on an app. It's not going to be on iTunes. So you guys are going to have to go get the app. But we'll have announcements about that. Excited to be working with Vaughan again, you know, all good shit, dude. Hey, man. It's starting off good. Yeah. It's a good start. Yeah. It's a good start for a lot of people actually. Except for one person. I thought this was interesting. Somebody's not having to get started to their year. Who's it? Is it is a tennis player actually who probably had one of the biggest meltdowns I've ever seen. Ever. Like on the court on the court. Little John McAro action. Why? What's that? You don't know John McAro. John McAro is one of the best tennis players ever who was famous for losing his shit on the court. Yeah. He was famous for it. I wrote. Yeah. So let's. Let's see if he compares. Yeah. Yeah. Medved death. That's the right one that I thought I actually wrote you like the culture expert. That's like an NHL name, bro. Is it Medvedev? Medvedev. Yeah. Yeah. He had epic cameras smashing meltdown and an Australian open. So let's dive into this a little bit. Daniel used his racket to smash a tiny camera attached to the net at the Australian open when he was trailing Cassidy Samarits. The 418th ranked player in the world before eventually avoiding a monumental upset and winning. So he did win the match. I guess that's good. But let's see what his meltdown looked like. Uh oh. Oh, you smack that. Yeah. That was a given there. Does that compare? That's a camera deal. I do. Can we get close up? They're tennis players, bro. Yeah. They don't get that heated. The better sports meltdowns is like Ryan Leif when he tried to beat up the reporters in the locker room. You probably don't even know who Ryan was. No, that is. He was drafted ahead of that compete manning. Jesus. Yeah. And then, uh, you know who's hot baseball fucking coaches. Yeah. I've seen a few of them. Yeah, bro, fucking Pete Rose. All them dudes were fucking tennis players don't even know how to even know how to be violent right. Yeah. They don't. The sports was a different time back than to though, man. Because I mean, yet steroids in. You know, they don't got steroids now. Bro, all these motherfuckers take steroids. Yeah. Yeah. I have to. Yeah. They have to. Most of them. I don't know. I thought that was interesting. He's telling up winning those. I guess that's good. That's okay to let out a little steam every now and then. Yeah. He looks like he needs some steroids. Oh, no, man. Guys, we got a lot to get into today. A lot of stuff to cover. As always. So let's dive into our headlines. Remember, guys, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to AndyFaceCellar.com. You guys can find them all linked there. That would be a set of headlines. Number one. Guys, talk about inaugurations coming up. That's the first thing we're less than five days now before the big day. Now they haven't said is like, they release this whole like itinerary and scheduling stuff. That's cool. Supposed to be like this four day thing. A lot of moving pieces here. One of the things I thought was cool. We'll DC. They did this update about just the level of law enforcement and resources they'll have on the ground. Let's check this briefing out. Our entire police department will be activated for the presidential inauguration. In addition, we'll be reinforced with nearly 4,000 officers from across the United States who are generous enough to raise their hands and commit their time to a systematial pilot and police department. All additional resources will be deployed to manage traffic, secure dignitary routes, and ensure public safety in our city. I'd like to pause and thank those officers who are coming to our city taking time away from their families to ensure the safety and security of this event. Their commitment to our country, to this city, and their law enforcement partners are admirable. They deserve praise from us all. Also out. Yeah, something that's cool. Yeah. Nice little step up in security. I feel like they need more than that. They probably do. Yeah. I feel like they need a lot more than that. I mean, I think it's cool that a lot of officers are donating their time to go out there and help. But I mean, look, man, you got the most powerful people in the world all in the same place. You got dignitaries and leaders and people that are completely opposed to the new world order, the globalist, the world economic forum, people who bucked it COVID, who really, through a big wrench in all their plans. And they're all going to be in the same spot. Probably need a couple more. It makes me nervous. Yeah. Well, I think it's also like nice to have too. Like, I mean, it's always important. I don't know. I'm not going to call them corrupt. I don't know how entangled and ensnared the DC command staff is. I mean, we saw how they operate it with J6 stuff. So it's probably nice to have some outside fresh eyes and not a part of the training to command. Yeah, because we don't know where the corruption starts and stops. It's important. It's important. Now, I know we covered, I think last week, you know, this whole thing with Jimmy Carter's funeral flags being lowered to half staff. So that got changed today. House Speaker, he orders the capital flags to full staff for the inauguration. So that's a nice little update. I thought that was cool. But like you said, dude, there's going to be a lot of people here. A lot of people here. A lot of big time names. Melee from Argentina is coming in. The Italian president is coming in. All these people who are big fans of Trump. Look at these guys. Here's the headline. Foreign leaders desperately jockeying for invite to Trump's inauguration. They're all going crazy. You and I got invited multiple times because we're a big freaking deal. Isn't that right? We got our grass stain new balances out here in Missouri. Black Air Force. Black Air Force ones and they want us to come. You know what? I'm not going. No, we can't do it. I'm not doing it, bro. I don't feel. First of all, I got to be real, dude. Like I'm not loyal to anybody. I am loyal to the idea of what America can be and should be. I'm not loyal to a political candidate. I can be happy that political candidates do certain things. Wish them to do the good thing. Absolutely. And I do wish that Donald Trump, I hope he does everything that he says he's going to do and even more. And if he does, I'll be one of his biggest fans in history. But that is yet to be determined. And I think people in America need to really understand that, like, look, dude, we have to build the best America possible. We do not worship candidates. We do not worship political figures. We do not worship celebrities or any kind of foreign dignitaries. We the people are the power. We the people are the, we are America. And we have to build it from the ground up. And that's going to take, you know, what we talk about on here over and over and over. And it's going to take the individual understanding the role that they play in America, raising their standards, living what they believe the American dream should look like. And eventually America will look like that. But this idea, I don't, I'm not a, I mean, dude, I have a lot of respect for the Trump family. I'm friends with Don Jr. I, you know, talk to him quite a bit. Really like him a lot. I think he's a really good dude. Friends with a lot of Trump's friends is some of his best friends. But, you know, I try to keep it non biased, dude. You know what I'm saying? And I just don't, I don't know, man, maybe we're making a mistake by not going. Maybe it's an amazing thing. I don't know, but like it just doesn't feel like the right thing. You know, because if Trump goes in and fucks up, I'm going to fucking call him out on it. You know what I'm saying? Like I'm not going to sit here and be like, oh yeah. And justify all the, you know what I'm saying? Like how they do it. Yeah, I just don't think we should do that. I think, I think we should call it how it is. And I think that when you get too close to some of these people, you're not able to do that the proper way. Yeah. Not like that. Does that make sense? It makes sense. It makes sense. Because dude, I've got invited, and you've got invited to Marlago a million times. And dude, I respect that and I appreciate that. And I really do think it's an awesome thing. But also I think it's important that we call it how it is as it goes. You know? Yeah, for sure. Somebody else won't be there either. I thought this was interesting. Did you see this? Michelle Obama will not attend Donald Trump's inauguration after skipping Jimmy Cardo's funeral? Well, I mean, is that weird? No. He called her a dude. Oh, he did. Yeah. Well, I forgot about that. Yeah, he called her a man. You know, and multiple, would you go? I forgot about that. No, bro. Like I will. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I'll do that. Yeah, I get it. Yeah. Why the fuck would she go? I get it. Yeah. Then you got, then you got Barry laughing it up with him. Dude, come on. Probably what they were talking about. What if someone called your girl a fucking dude? Yeah, man. I meant it. And then you're sitting there chopping it up. How do you think your home life's going to be? Oh, dude. Big Mike's going to be big man. Big Mike's handing out black eyes at home, bro. Oh, Bob was laughing because he can't wait to get out of here. He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, TT. You were right, bro. I'm making my ass kicked at home. Dude, I forgot all about that. Yeah. Dude, and they make so much sense now because I'm sure they got the seating chart, right, with the even with Carlos Frider. She probably didn't want to say nowhere near him. Now, granted. Okay, granted. They've called him every name in the book. Your home's in and he still shows up to the places. So I mean, I don't know. There's something fishy going on there. It may just be as simple as that. I don't know. But she didn't miss that funeral. Now, what I, my initial thought was on all of this, bro, you know what I thought it was. Well, and this is coming from some personal experience. Mad black woman syndrome because it's not just some shale. Yuck Kamala Harris also doing something weird. She. Yeah, we're right. Kamala Harris declines traditional invite for JD Vance to visit vice presidential residents. She's not like so like there's supposed to be the like every year every time every fucking new presidency. There's just like, you know, a ritual they do, right. The president shows a new president, you know, walks him around. The vice president is supposed to work with the vice president's house with the new vice president, right. Yeah, she declined. She's not doing it. Several Democrat and Republican sources confirmed to CBS news that Harris has declined. The traditional sit down meeting or tour of the naval observatory residents, which has served home to vice presidents since the 1970s. Now, they were obviously still, you know, shown access and you know, given a detailed briefing and all of that stuff. But it wasn't my Harris, which was into us. I don't know, man. Like, I've seen, I've seen that that syndrome in play for a friend of mine. I'll say this. I'm not gonna fuck them on house, but it happens. It's a real thing. I just maybe that was a part of it. But like, what did Vance do to Kamala? Besides beater. I mean, he made her look stupid. I mean, let's be real, dude. Like he's smart. She's dumb. Everybody saw it. She's embarrassed. Is there a right way? Is what it is. And on top of it, she doesn't belong there anyway. Yes. Okay, let's be real, man. She did not earn her position in life. Okay. I mean, I don't know where she is because of DEI. She was picked. She was not, okay, look, people get real mad when you say this. Okay. But she is where she is because of the color of her skin. Oh, if it's right. 100% fat. For sure. She, the public, some others, Joe Biden said, okay, first of all, in the presidential primary in 2020, she was the least popular candidate out of all the candidates in the primary. Okay. So those of you that are gonna get mad, just listen to what I'm saying. It was the least popular president or primary candidate. Okay. This year, there wasn't even an election or anything for her to even be the candidate. Right. She was appointed. All right. When Joe Biden picked her for a vice president, he picked her after saying publicly, what did he say? I am committed to picking a black woman as vice president. And by the way, he did shitty at that because she ain't even black. Okay. So she, and dude, where she got to as a prosecutor is very famous. She was a socialite. Okay. And she made friends, quote unquote, friends like the kind of friends you suck their dicks. All right. And worked her way up the ladder. And that's the reality of Kamala Harris's career. Okay. So I don't have any of those friends. Huh? I don't have those friends. No, I don't either. My point is, is it, you know, like she's not qualified to be there. She knows she's not qualified to be there. She knows why she's there. She's embarrassed herself for four years. Extremely embarrassed herself since July till now. She can't even do an interview that's a lot Oprah Winfrey, who they paid to do an interview for her, who is one of the greatest interviewers in history. Couldn't get a good interview out of her. That she still look like an idiot. Yeah, bro. So this woman who is probably not qualified to like, and I say this all the time joking, but I'm being serious right now. She's not qualified to run a fucking lemonade stand. Yeah. She could not run a lemonade stand. And now she's mad because some dudes kicking her out of her vice president. These people are entitled, bro. They think that they deserve to rule over us. We have said this thousand times on this show, bro. You know what I mean? And she's mad. She's mad, mad. Well, that's what I'm saying. I mean, I just saw a loser shit. Who gets more mad, Z-Shop, Black women or Indian women, being for real? I feel like Black women get mad in public and Indian women just kill you in private. Is that true? We should ask the people. What do you guys think? Who gets mad at Black women or Indian women? Italian women do. Latina's get mad. Oh, bro. That's a different. I would vote for Latina. Latina's get mad. That's a different. You don't want to fill their wrath. Yeah. You don't piss off. It's fucking cut you, man. They will make you a... Yeah. I don't know. Listen. Let's have a fucking bracket like for the Super Bowl. Except for what... Okay. You guys can buy squares to it. Let's do what the fucking score is. Oh, dude. It's wild. I don't know. It's there. Italian women get mad too, though. They get real mad. They get physical. They'll beat you. They will. They don't stab you, but they will fucking beat you. My mom threw a bunch of shit at my little brother. Huh? My mom. She's Italian. Oh, yeah. She threw shit. She threw shit all the time. Yeah. All the time. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe it's just sort of lose your shit. I don't know. We got to put white trash women in there, too. I think they're gonna throw a trailer park. Like if you threw up a trailer park. What do they do? They throw shit at you, too. They're throwers. Take your drugs. No, they do them. They do your drugs. I don't... You listen. Hey, listen. It's not fair as we talk about it equally. Hey, you know. You guys are such misogidists. All right. Who's the most angry men? I don't think men are that angry, bro. Short dudes. Short dudes, bro. Short dudes get mad. Good hot. Yeah. You gotta be careful with them more guys, man. Come down, man. Well, buddy, be all right. I don't even think... Like, what does it not really are racing? It's more physical traits. I don't think there's like... I don't look at like man and think like... All right. These dudes get more mad than these. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy, you got to do it. Get into mad. Because they want to be big. All right. Yeah. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Oh, god, dude. You know, those kids mad that can use the stand next to me in the urinals. Oh, piss. Dude. Or some wrong with me. Yeah, man. It is what it is, man. We got... We got... We saw all of that's going on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in the magnificate. See. Here's a lot of stuff that we shared. Uh... Small of things. This would be the last step forward. And people would come and yell at you. The scales out there. The overall answers to the questions. Well, Showdown can come back to my tip. Now, here's kinds of things you didn't use them in. It looks like old stage Technique. Or whatever. Which one, which you couldn't know where you're going. You were going to see it from performers. And you knew you got the signal in right away when people might know that you could watch it in time and move. Right. And you didn't know what you played that the moment. However, it was completely ridiculous to play this. I tried to think well, was it true, instead? It's. Trump defense pick Pete Hegseth at confirmation hearing. I wouldn't call it that. No, it wasn't that. I would call it as an You know what I saw. Okay, you you you do the thing. Yeah, here's what I saw right. Oh man. We're getting in trouble for this episode Just go ahead and just go ahead. I'll fill you in at the man. He's destroying them. Okay. He's destroying. Okay. He's doing he listen He's a great pick. Listen man. Did you see his uh, did you see his interaction with Liz? Oh my god. Oh, you have it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm going to hell. Yeah. Let's go. I just I wanted to point this out because it's always so interesting how the left tries to paint their wins. Bro, we're sick of those people. Everybody's sick of those people. Everybody's laughing at them. No one's taking it serious. Elizabeth one the whole fucking room laughed at. Bro, everybody's laughing. They're laughing at AOC. They were laughing AOC yesterday. It's like AOC AOC yesterday was talking about something about trans. Oh, they passed the fucking law of the women protection act. Right. And did you see her response? She was up there screaming saying women are actually bleeding out and parking lots. Like dude, she was going, you know, in her AOC fashion and it's just like dude, no one, no one fucking listens to you guys are all liars. You all make shit up. You all talk about things that aren't actually happening. Or if they aren't happening, they're a massive outlier situation that is outside the norm of what's happening. And you speak about it as if it's the norm. And people have caught onto this. They have caught onto this. And this is what's created this polarization amongst, you know, the population in this country, which I think is healing because these people are getting laughed at. Well, the other part that irritates me too with this bro, they always try to hit below the belt man. Like they do, they brought us kids up. They keep bringing this this this shit up about his alcohol. Yeah, how about their kids? Right. Exactly. Like Senator Woody, who son is a registered member with aunt Tifa and was fucking throwing pepper spray and shit at people like what do you have said, but you want to bring up? Come on. This is all these people every single one of them. They've got more skeletons in their fucking closet than any of us would ever have. Yeah. They paid out like 30 million dollars last year and defense legal fees that come from your taxes. Yep. For Congress members to defend themselves against sexual lawsuits. It was it was like 20 million. I might be exaggerating. I think it was a lot. It was close. It was 20 to 30 million. Okay. Of your money. Your money, my money, our money went to defend these fucking shitbags against sexual. Yes. What it is. And then they're on here talking about this dude. Oh, his alcohol consumption. Well, fuck what day of the week are you talking about? What's your alcohol deal with you people? I'd be drinking too. Well, there is a famous. I was thinking today like how glad? How like you know, like when all this shit was going on and we were like, fuck maybe we should run for office or this. You know what? I'm never doing that. These people are miserable. Oh, they're terrible. I don't like the whole, you know, bring them out into the circle of shine the spotlight on them. And like all the people that are holding spotlights, bro, they would tremble in their pants if they were the ones that actually were. Yeah, light was being shown on them. Yep. You know, nobody's like, bro, listen, my philosophy on life, man. You know, you're just as perfect as I am. Bro, we're all. You know what I'm saying? We're all fuck. I mean by their standards, we're all pieces of shit. Bro, you know what I'm saying? It's insane. It's insane. But but but let's dive into this Senate confirmation hearing. But yeah, I mean, so he writes like that, but the reality is he came out swinging and he held his own and and he had some great answers. Bro, he's got a bitch. He's smart. He's young. He's experienced. He's with it. You know, I mean, he caught out. You got got a chance to kind of display. You got to kind of see the foreshadowing of what his career is going to be like. If he gets confused, his wife, the one that was singing the song. In the national anthem in the capital. Wasn't his wife? No, I think that was that was the one of the other picks. I know you just saw that video. I don't know. That was a gates his wife. Yeah, that was Matt gates. That was beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, you got to touch on the zero accountability for the the Afghanistan withdrawal. I got to to to really talk about a bunch of stuff. So I got some clips here. Let's just dive through these. Let's check these out. Here they are. And other words, you're quite sure that every general who serves should not go directly into the defense industry for 10 years. You're not willing to make that same pledge. I'm not a general senator. You'll be the one. Let us just be clear. I'm smart. You're all laughing. Look at all the people in the background laugh at her. And look at him tried not to laugh. Oh, dude, she's so dumb. Bro, these people are so dumb. And they all got elected on the same shit. This same woken like I can't wait to all the wokies are like primaryed out. Go to sleep. Yeah. Fucking Elizabeth Tonto warned me. Right. G. You know, here's another close. Check this out. There's been no accountability for the disaster of the withdrawal in Afghanistan. And that's precisely why we're here today. Sure. Is that leadership has been unwilling to take accountability. It's the time to restore that to our scene. Most senior ranks. How old is hexath? Who will add up there? 44. Oh, he's same age. Yeah. Yeah. A young, good looking god, man. Yeah, he is a good looking dude. He's got tattoos too, bro. I think he'd be the kind of dude we would hang out with. No, for sure. I think he's the kind of dude that most men are like, yeah, that's a fucking real dude. It's good to do right there. Yeah, he's been a fucking war fighter. He's been perfect. I mean, there's, listen, nobody's perfect. You don't get to be 44 years old and have a perfect resume. Right. Like, that's what you, do you know why it's valuable to be 44 years old? Because you made all the mistakes, bro. And when you're 60 years old, you made even more. And when you're 70, 80 years old, like Trump, you made so many, you don't give a fuck. That's when the new balance is coming. Yeah. Like, dude, that's the value of experience. The value of experience is the mistakes that you've been through. So like, yes. So like getting up here and, you know, quote, unquote, grilling people about their shit, like that were me. I'd be like, yeah, I did this, but this is what I learned. Yeah, I did that. I did that too. You know what? That was bad. I fucked that up. But I won't do that again. You don't even really remember that. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. It's just so, it's so weird how society judges people so harshly for the mistakes that they make. When first of all, they all have made the same mistakes. And second of all, mistakes are how you learn and improve your life. Like, what are we, where are we lost side of that? Right. You know, it's insane. I got one more clip here. This is one of my, probably one of my favorite clips that one of the exchanges that happened. Let's check this one out. And as you said in your statement, do you agree anybody should be able to serve in the military if they meet the standards? Senator, as the president has stated, I don't disagree with the overturn of Don't Ask Hotel. Great. Because I don't want you thinking, can't serve if your mom, can't serve you LGBTQ. And then last, can't serve if you're a leftist. The statements you said about people who have views differently than you, that were the enemy, are you saying the 50% of the DOD if they hold liberal views or leftist views or are Democrats are not welcome in the military? Are you saying that? Senator, I volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan under Democrat President Barack Obama. I also volunteered to guard the inauguration of Joe Biden, but was denied the opportunity to serve because I was identified as an extremist by my own unit for a Christian tattoo. Not only that, how about that? How about all those military members that got called out and kicked out of the military for being quote unquote domestic threats because they wouldn't take a fucking vaccine that wasn't proven? Or they really liked their commander and chief. How about that? Right? I mean, I love how these people when the coin gets flipped over on them, they start acting like they weren't just doing this. Like, dude, I really, the domestic extremist is definitely going to come out at me in about one second. These people need to be fucking dealt with, okay? Because they will not ever stop. And when you make a mistake, when you have someone who is like fucking evil, who has shown their cards and shown what they are willing to do, and how far they are willing to go. And then you give that person grace. It's only a matter of time before they do it again. And they get the way that they want. So these people, that woman and the people who think like her, you don't belong in the fucking military. And to be completely fucking honest, you don't belong in the fucking country. All right? And I'm not talking about Democrats. I'm talking about leftist, communist people who put other ideologies ahead of the American ideology. I'm talking about people who put globalism at the top, or who put Israel ahead of America. All right? This is America. We are American citizens. We should be first. Everybody else can get fucked until our citizens are taken care of. After our citizens are taken care of, after our country looks amazing, after all of our streets are fixed and our homeless problems is fixed, and everybody's making money, and we're doing all these things, then we can be concerned with other causes that have to do outside of this country. But right now, we are a crumbling country. We are not the shining city on the hill that we're supposed to be. And then he's be fixed. And that's what America first is about. And all these people who say, oh, I'm a miracle first. I'm a miracle first. And then talk about sending money to Ukraine, or doing things for other countries, or Israel. And this is that you're not America first. Quite honestly, Hegg sets one of those people who says that shit. That's a big knock on me for him. Well, I think he pulled it back a little bit because in his confirmation, I think he re-worded that. Now he's just saying, yeah, I feel like Israel has the right to do what they want. And that's... I can be okay. Cool. You believe Israel has the right to exist. And that's true. That's fine. Okay? I don't disagree. But there's a lot that I do disagree with when it comes to that country and how involved they are in our country, exactly. And there's a priority list here that we have to knock out. That's correct. And no other country should become America. Dude, dude, dude. It's just that simple, man. I don't know why that's such a hard time. Because all these people get most of their money from pro-Israel packs. So they have to say the shit in public. Otherwise, they don't get the fucking money that they want to actually get elected. So it's all money, dude. And it's bullshit. Okay? I don't give a fuck if you're Black, White, Christian, Muslim, Jewish. We're not a fuck you are here in this country. If you're an American citizen, you come first. Everybody else can get the fuck out until we get that fixed. That's my opinion. And real talk, every single person who's here illegally, all of them should be gone. Yeah? Okay? All of them. Then they should be sent a letter or a piece of mail or some sort of, hey, here's the proper process if you really want to come here. And we'll see how many of them can do that. And we'll do that. But just shit that's been going on here. We got to wipe it clean and do it the right way. That's very, very simple. Now, Hexath specifically, right? So he's going to be, you know, running the Pentagon if he gets confirmed, which I don't see why he wouldn't. You know, but one of the other things, he's just like the standard of the military because when they wiped everybody out from all the COVID nonsense, it left people like this. You know what I'm saying? And like intentionally, intentionally, DJ, they want people like that. For those of you listening, we're looking at a trans man or trans, I don't fucking know. What I, we're looking at a dude who's pretending to be a woman, waving rainbow flags. Like, this is not a priority. In the military uniform. Listen, this is not a priority for anything that has to do with this country. What? Here's the issue, though. Any of the problem that I have with it is, is that we can't push this stuff and make it seem like this is okay. This is the new America. We're strong. We're like, this is supposed to be our fighting force that protects it's a joke. And then at the same time, you got people like, you know, FBI director Christopher Ray, trying to tell us who our enemies are and how bad our enemies are. You know what I'm saying? Or how, how infiltrated we are as a country, but this is what we're leading. It meant it doesn't make sense. It does make sense. Unless you're, that's the goal. That's right. It does make sense because we have been, we have been subverted through communist ideology. It still boggles my mind how people don't understand this. If you go back in history and you look at what the fuck is going on here, this is communist ideology. This is subverting our actual American values. Okay. Trans-generism is a communist idea. It's to, it's to subvert. It's to create a situation of lesser reproduction. There's all kinds of, it's, it's to challenge and remove the idea of truth. Mm-hmm. And what can be considered? Yes or no? This or that? When you can get people to question the idea of what a man is and what a woman is, and you can get people to say, well, a man is a woman, a man can be a woman or a woman can be a man, then you remove the idea of truth. And when you remove the idea of truth, you create a scenario where people can't be naturalists at all. They cannot be proud of their country because they don't even know what their fucking country is because it's up for debate. Mm-hmm. Okay. So there's all kinds of things that, that come from communist ideology that we're gonna have to clean up. And dude, when you, when people say, oh, well, it doesn't make sense. No, it makes perfect sense because that's what the people who have been running the country since 2008 have wanted. It's real shit, man. It'll be interesting to see why I can't wait to see these people just get fucking railed in the press and culture. People are so tired of it. People are starting to recognize because there's a number of people us and a whole bunch of other people who are willing to tell the truth. Mm-hmm. We'll have taken some arrows for a minute too. Yeah, that's fine. You know, but it's worth it, man. It's worth it. Guys, jumping on this combo, I just know what you guys think down in the commentary. Let us know from that being said. Let's go check out the chat. Shall we? Yeah. All right, we got this first comment comes from at Rubin J. Leon. He says, Andy DJ, you guys come to Austin. Just north of Austin is a private airport right off the toll roll where the speed limit is 80 so y'all can get around fast and y'all can be just far enough from the crazy traffic and crazy people. It's funny. He mentioned that because we actually have to go to Austin here in the next week or two. Oh, no shit. Yeah. Oh, sweet. Yeah, I got to go see Jesse. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I got to see that's where my for our dealer is too. I got to see JP and the guys down there. I think they are because you know, you pulled out there like where should we relocate and do a satellite office for the podcast? People like Austin. People like Austin? I like Austin. I've never been to warm. Never been. To warm seems like a cool dude. Yeah, Rubin, we'll be there soon. All right. Tell us where to eat. Where can we get some good food? Oh, yeah. One more comment from you. This comment comes from at Sandy Cregan. This episode is a metaphor for life. You got to get through burning your balls to get to the best part. That's 100% true. Thank you, Sandy. Thank you for your insights. I love our people. Well, they're good. Yeah. They're good people, man. Guys, we appreciate you for being with us. That sounds like a passage that I read one time in Marcus Aurelius. Yeah, yeah, it was right in there. It said, you got to get through burning your balls to get to the best part. That's it. Yeah, that's it. It's poetic. So, meaning of life. Guys, we appreciate you for being with us. Sandy, Sandy, I got some ghosts right now, opportunities. DJ's got some ghosts reading opportunities. I do. Got some ghosts reading opportunities. Who was it, DJ How to Read? We got a special role. I got you that book is down here. Which one? Yeah. I learned to read book. I always keep it here just in case. I've been doing good. Yeah, because you've been learning to read. I'm on the first page like LeBron. Yeah, here's DJ. All right. Yeah, guys, just keep the cruise moving. I had lined up too. Your favorite one of your favorite humans. You live this lady. I do. You do. Let me guess. How much do I love her? Well, by lover. I know what you mean. Right. Is she like number one on the list? No, she's not number one. That'd be Hillary. Yeah, that's for sure. Hillary's number one on the she's top five. AOC? Nope. Give me a hint. Or will they hit me too obvious? It'd be too obvious. Michelle, toy read. Oh, God. She's number two, bro. All you would have had to say was number two. I hate joy. Read her as much she hates me. She hates me because I'm white. I know. I hate you. I know. I hate her back. Fucking hate her right back. She didn't even spell the last name, right? That's not how you spell read. No, it's R-E-E-G. How do you spell read, DJ? Well, what's read? Rad or read? Listen, fuck joy read. How about that? You know what I can't stand. I can't hurt face. Well, no, you know, I think you're receiving hairline. Listen, you believe in God, a universe. Her cultural appropriation with her wigs. That was worth it. And then tells us that we don't have a culture. Why people don't have a culture, but I'm going to wear a blonde wig. Right? The hypocrisy is thick. It's thick. Yeah, it's a thick. It's definitely a thick. By the way, I don't give a fuck if people wear a blonde wig. Yeah, sure. Give a shit. I wear blonde wig. Yeah, fuck me too on a weekends. But the point is, is that I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit if a white dude wants to dress with like a hip hop guy. I don't care that a fucking that joy read wants to wear a blonde wigs. But what I do care about is when you tell me, I don't have a fucking culture and the white people haven't done shit. And then I can't culturally appropriate you because I wear Jordans, which I don't. But if I did, and you can wear a blonde wig and act like you're fucking, you know, fuck you. How about that? Yeah, I get it. I agree. You get to big fuck you. Yeah. What I, you know, and listen, whether you believe in God or the universe, however you choose to see it, it works in mysterious ways. And what I don't understand is why are all of like those people, their names, like it's like the complete opposite of their being. Joy is not joy. No, whoopi, right? Fucking sunny. Like, I don't know. I just thought that was like that's a massive life. I think joy read is, I think it's unbelievable that she's a lot to be on TV and be as racist as she is. For sure. She's really racist. Yeah, I know. She's really racist. I know. And, you know, it hasn't stopped. So joy reclaims being a self-destructor, bro, because Americans know inherently, dude. They know where nobody's with this racist shit. Like we hear in America, we like to make fun of each other for our differences. That doesn't mean we're fucking racist. I still shit. You got a small dick. Yeah. Yeah. What? First of all, I'm Italian motherfucker. I'm Sicilian. That's all Zita. Yeah. I got you, bro. I'm just saying that. I hold butcher shops to fit me in it. Right? I don't want to hear this fucking white man shit. I ain't white. Fuck white people. They're little dicks. Yeah, she didn't stop joy. She's still on her joyful rants. Joy read claims billionaire right wants a apartheid state in post wildfire, California. So wildfires. I don't even know you call them wildfires at this point. We got a little bit more on that in a minute. But she's making this wild claim. All right. That is the billionaire right, which I don't even, that's a new term. I guess she just created. That they want to drive out the non-white people from the state of California to making a apartheid state. And she just made this in a little rant. She pushed out. Let's check this clip out. Retro fitted with their ugly right wing policies. The way they've ruined Florida and Texas and every other red state where poverty rates are high and education is warped and non-white immigrants, pregnant women, victimized girls and LGBTQ folks live in fear. Then, then the fight for permanent control of America is basically over. They can drill and frack, California to the fires this past week. Pale in comparison. They can rip out all the forests and hand over the land to developers. Florida style. They can drive out the brown people and the black and Asian people or just sink them into the same apartheid. They've created in Texas. And they will control enough electoral votes if they control California to never have to worry about another presidential election. The billionaire right knows that they cannot take California home to Hollywood, San Francisco, and Kendrick Lamar by culture. So they're looking to try to take it with lies and deceit and by fire. And joining me now is Altadena resident Natalie LaFource. Natalie LaFource, thank you so much for being here. So Donald Trump set the fires. Yep. Essentially is what she's saying. Yep, but he's going, and me. And you, and you're going to burn down the whole state so that you can create an apartheid and kick all the black people out. Okay. But it's, my first question is, is like, with all that fame and money, what the fuck are you doing about your hairline, lady? She's worth about four million. Four? Well, you can afford a fucking whatever you got to do to your head. Go to Turkey, I heard it's great. I can see what, dude, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Like, and I don't like making fun of people's appearances, but she hates me. She does hate you. Yeah, so fuck you, joy reading. Get a fucking hairline transplant. Well, but here's the interesting thing, though, Andy, is that outline? Is he showing? Okay, a hair transplant? No, just anything about it. She, dude, everything, she's eyebrows, too, with the fuck where they at. She must have lost a bet. She probably bet, she probably bet Kamala was gonna win. It had to shave her eyebrows. Shave her shit. Yeah. Fuck man. I can't stand her. And by the way, we don't stand each other, so it's fair. It's fine. Like, but it's mutual. Like if she was a neighbor, I would like put shit in a bag and light on fire and throw it at her house. You're gonna kick off this apartheid. Yeah. Fuck you. Bro, but here's the thing, though, man. She makes this wild claim, trying to again point, you know, they always do. You're trying to paint the right, wealthy, you know, good, upstanding citizens. Like they want to just take over. Yeah, I got this interesting clip, okay, that I want to play real quick. Why the fuck do you, why is everything, your fault? Yeah. Why, fuck white people? Fucking insect infestation. Never built anything either. Right. Never. Never built anything, nothing, not even Europe. Nope. Dude, the fuck out of here. Anyway, I can look at her face. Look at that fucking face, bro. If I have to draw a snake slowly transforming into a woman, that's the middle face. Yeah. That's right there. Yeah. Yeah, bro, she's lizard. Bro, she's definitely got some. But listen, dude. What, where, where, where, like, okay. Mm-hmm. How racist do you have to be to come up with what she just said? It makes, bro, listen. There is no amount of weed that could get me to that point. That's what I'm saying. Like she walks around thinking the shit. She believes it though. Yeah. That's the problem. Like, because I mean, this is what I was saying earlier though. She does believe it. And if she, and people like her gotten power, they would fucking do, listen, man. Do you not remember what they were willing to do during COVID? They were wanting to take people's kids away. They were wanting to exile people who didn't get the shot from society. They want, they fired people. They fucking ruined people's lives. And she was happy about it. Mm-hmm. She wanted more. That wasn't enough. Bro, those people, those people, meaning these fucking communist leftist people, they have no problem. They, they will fucking kill you if they are allowed to be in power. And the history has shown this. There's 66 million mother fuckers killed in Russia. Nobody talks about it. Mm-hmm. 66 million. Not 6 million. 66 million. Okay, that were killed by Bolsheviks. People should go look at what Bolshevism is all about. Who does it? And where it comes from? And what ideology they had. And if you actually learned about it, you'd recognize what's been attempted to happen here. Just in a matter of time. Yeah, that's all right. Fuck, dude. Don't talk about that. Can't say that. No. But this, this, this, this little rant was interesting. By the way, those 66 million people were fucking Christians. But here's the thing, like, that the rant, the little, you know, this rant that she did, by the way, that wasn't a thousand years ago either. That was fucking in the 1900s. Yeah, it was a fairly recent. Yeah. But here's the thing about this wild claim, the joy just went on, right? She's claiming that all the billionaires, you know, they're gonna, you know, they're the reason these fires are going on. And they're gonna take over all the land. You know, all that, that's fine. That's cool. That's, okay, joy. But here's the problem. There's this clip that just surfaced of the governor of California, Gavin Newsom. Let's check this out. Newscom. Over the course of the next several years, Los Angeles will be hosted to the World Cup and then the Super Bowl and then the Olympics. With this rebuilding effort, needing to take place, is LA gonna be ready for all of those global events? Yeah, my humble position. And it's, and it's, it's not just being naively optimistic. That only reinforces the imperative moving quickly, doing in the spirit of collaboration, cooperation. President of the United States, Donald Trump to his credit, was helpful in getting the Olympics to the United States of America to get it down here in LA. We thank him for that. This is an opportunity for him to shine, for this country to shine, for California and this community to shine, the opportunity with all of that, and all that opportunity and that pride and spirit that comes from not just hosting those three iconic games and venues, but also the opportunity, I think, to rebuild at the same time. And that's why we're already organizing a Marshall Plan. And we already have a team of looking and reimagining LA 2.0, making sure everyone's included, not just the folks on the coast, people here that were ravaged by this disaster. You just said you're organizing a Marshall Plan for the rebuilding of California. What is that Marshall Plan? We're just starting to lay out. I mean, we're still fighting these fires. So we're all in the back of the city leaders, we're already talking to civic leaders. We're already talking to business leaders, nonprofits, we're talking to labor leaders. We're starting to organize how we can put together a collection of individuals on philanthropy for recovery, how we can organize the region, how we can make sure that we are seeking federal assistance for the Olympics more broadly, but also federal assistance for the recovery efforts, and how we can galvanize the community with folks that love this community, to really develop a mindset so that at scale, we're dealing with the scope of this tragedy and responding to it at scale, with efficiency like the executive order I talked about, time value of delivering projects, addressing building codes, addressing permitting issues, and moving forward to rebuilding and being more resilient. So you already got a plan. You got a plan. For LA 2.0. Right, right. It's weird. You're standing in somebody's front yard, where their houses burnt down, next to 100 other houses that are burnt down, where these people can't even have a place to live. They can't find shelter. Okay, there's no rental properties in LA that these people are filling up. I mean, this is a bad situation. And you're sitting here basically saying, oh, we've already got a plan to rebuild the California, and it's going to be awesome for the Olympics. We've been talking about it already. It's interesting. It's interesting. And then we get caught. So these fires just, you're right. Happened to... Well, no, that's a good thing because we can revitalize and we can come together and collaborate and cooperate. It's interesting. Yeah. I bet they went around to some of these immigrants and they said, hey, man, you go start these fires. We'll make sure you get to stay. Mm-hmm. Help us rebuild. Not immigrants, illegals. That's what I'm saying. Help us rebuild. Yeah. You know, so I mean, it's just interesting to Joy Reads claim. You know, she's making it, you know, it's you out there. Oh, yeah. And that. But Newson's already had the plan, man. And how is she not fired from television? Well, here's the other thing, bro. She's gonna be unapployable. Where's she gonna go after this? Right. When the woke shit's done, where do all those people go? Bro, she's gonna listen to a fucking... She's gonna start a podcast and no one's gonna listen to. Do you ever notice these mainstream people that go start podcasts? They don't even rank. No. Oh, we're number fucking one in business. They're number fucking... And we float between number 20 and 30 and fucking overall podcasts in the world. These people fucking aren't even in the top 500. It's because no one gets a fuck. And they still think that people do. That camera's a dangerous thing, bro. Camera on the microphone's dangerous. It's dangerous. I mean, it exposes people's true power. Like when you're on MSNBC and you're spewing all this crazy shit, or you're on CNN and you're spewing all this crazy shit and then you go start a podcast, nobody listens to, it kind of tells you what's up. You know what I'm saying? Like how much of your listenership have you lost MSNBC over the last four years? Because I know other places have lost upwards of, you know, 90% of their fucking listenership. Yeah. People are tired of the shit, dude. They're tired of it. Well, it's funny you say that because Steve Smith, he also jumped in on this. Steve and Steve and A. Steve and A, bro. All right. He's coming around. Steve and fucking A. He's coming around. Bass and Newsom gotta go. Have you seen this clip? Check this out. They gotta go. They gotta go. I'm, you know what? They gotta go. I don't give a damn if they do. After what I've seen less of, they gotta go. They gotta, I'm done. I'm done. Kevin. I'm done. Steve, sometimes they're, Steve, sometimes there are natural disasters. You can't do a damn thing about it. When a hurricane hits your house down in South and Florida, what can you do? Are you yelling at the politicians? Dave, I'm not out there. Stop the whims. Dave, I'm not going off about the fires. The fires is not default. But when firefighters are standing there saying there's not enough water in the fire. That's true. When Donald Trump asked a water to be pumped from Canada into the LA system and Gavin Newsom opposed that, when you're hearing about environmentalists compelling him to protect, smelt, and little fish and salmon at the expense of LA citizens, of California citizens, Kevin, I don't need much else than that. I just don't. Maybe you're nicer than me. Maybe I'm too cruel. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it. They gotta go. You know, I'm starting to have a different perspective on Stephen A. For real. I've been hard on him for a long time. I mean, I've always thought he was a racist. I've always hated the shit that he says about like, where I always felt like he's made issues around race that didn't need to be made as a excuse. He definitely stoke some fires. For sure. But in the last year, year and a half, I've started to shift my perspective and I actually think that he actually believe those things. And I think he does call it as he sees it from his perspective, which makes me respect him in a new way. You know, does that make sense? I know for sure. I would love to have him on the show, bro. I'd love to argue with him. That'd be cool. Yeah. He'd be cool. No. Because dude, he's fun. He used to get like really mad in his arguments. And now he like, there's like a humor part to it. I just, I don't know. Oh, yeah, I think it'd be cool. Bro, he's kind of turned me around, man. I'm kind of starting to become a Steven A Smith fan, all right, which I would have never said that five years ago. It's weird here. You say it. I know. But you know what, man, when people change, and they change their perspectives, and he comes across now as a much, like, okay, dude, like what I'm saying is, is like, you know how you see people, and they say stupid shit, and you're just like, bro, you're just being an asshole. And that's how I always perceived him. I always perceived him as like, this black dude that had a chip on his shoulder and was making issues that didn't really need to be made. Right. And I just think that that's what he believed. And I think he's starting to come around, because now he's starting to talk about things and challenge things that I've seen him argue for in the past. Which, bro, I think there's nothing in real talk. I think that's one of the most respectable things you could say about someone, because it's, they're not just talking heads. This guy's actually thinking he's speaking from his perspective, and I can get down with someone that does that, as long as it's, you know, what they really think. Right. You know, I mean, I get that vibe from him too. He's definitely been coming around. You know, but the joy reads shit. You know, people are pissed, obviously, at the Democrats, and then more and more, it's coming out about these fires and their origins. You know, there's illegal immigrants that have been caught on camera, getting arrested with blowtorches, and homeless dudes setting fires, and open fields, things like that. But at the time of this recording, I want you to look at this headline, LA's low-life, the looters, burglarers, and drug addicts arrested during Palisades fire, all share common trade. They have over 40 people that have been arrested, and they've grouped them all together of being very close to these fire locations when they started, right at the evacuation times, you know, the people being evacuated out of their homes, and as people will leave in their homes, they're going right in. Right? Right? Like, logistically, what would seem to be impossible to just, you know, be a coincidence to happen? Mm-hmm. Okay, it's weird. But dozens of those people that have been accused of looting homes, and stories in the Ritzi Pacific Palisades, enclave of LA during the Daily Fire's have been pictured in mugshots. Cops charge more than 40 detainees with various offenses, including burglary and drug possession, since the fires broke out on January 7th. Remarkably, none of those arrested were actually living in the evacuation zone, and seemingly traveled with the intention of taking advantage of the devastation. Now, what's important to note here, because I did some dives in this, it's not like they were just, you know, a few subdivisions over. These people lived nowhere near these fires, and the moment that they broke out, they were there. They're all there. What's that tell you? Logistically impossible, Andy. Not this can't be a coincidence. Can't be a coincidence. I had someone who is, oh, by the way, there's their mugshots. Mm-hmm. That guy also needs the joy retreatment. Jesus, Lord, look at that. Who? This guy here? Oh, yeah, he needs hair transplant. What the hell? Oh, oh, this guy scares me. Yeah. Anyway, he's seen some shit. Yeah. Fuck the heat. That's like the first time you saw boobies. Bro, I am changed forever. Dude, listen, these people, I had, I've had, I gotta be careful how I say this. I have someone who is, who would know? Who would know? Who is, they're involved in intelligence. Tell me straight up, like, hey, man, just so you know, we have credible evidence that this is a coordinated terrorist effort to set these fires. Here's an example, right? When during the, a lot of the riots that happened, right? I mean, St. Louis is home to a bunch of those, right? We were seeing these trucks come in, dropping off pallets of bricks, right? Like, that's just one example. Like, logistically impossible for it to be a coincidence, right? And we're seeing the exact same signs and symptoms in these LA fires, bro. And like, what is the truth? What is actually happening? And why is nobody even like, everybody wants to throw this climate change shit in there? It's not climate change, man. It's not climate change. It's fucking wine. Who just saw boobies for the first time. That's right. You know what I'm saying? Now, who sent wine? Because I don't believe, I mean, doesn't look like a very capable guy. You know what I'm saying? Until I, you know, create this massive plan on his own. Who gave him the plan? Who gave him the supplies? I mean, dude, they're running around again, caught with burglary tools. They got crowbars and I mean, who's supplying these people? And who's given them the info and the insight to even know where to go? Well, you know, it's, you know, it's the same old thing that's been happening. It's been happening since 2014 here in St. Louis with the Mike Brown riots. And it's interesting that a lot of the money that's being raised to help quote unquote victims of, you know, the LA fires is going to act blue again. Okay? And furthermore, how is it that the people of California pay the most tax of any place in the country? And yet, they are so unprepared, we have to have citizens come out of packet and do humanitarian efforts, which I'm glad they're doing because that's an American thing to do. Yes. We take care of our people, we take care of our neighbors. It doesn't matter if they're black, white, you know, Asian, Christian, it doesn't matter. We take care of each other here. And I can appreciate that. But why is it that these people in California are, and by the way, this goes for everybody. We're all overtaxed, for sure. And yet we can't handle simple things like a fire. Where's that money going? Right. And why are we paying those taxes? And why is it that, you know, every time there's a natural disaster, we're having these issues now. We never used to have these issues when there was natural disasters. May have been create fire in 2020. No, bro, and we still have people in Asheville that are living in fucking tents when it's two degrees. This is bullshit. Okay. And the fact that we're even taxed like this at all is bullshit. And these people like Elizabeth Warren who are up, they're making millions of dollars on backdoor deals while people are literally living in tents in Asheville, which should have been handled by our government agencies because of the tax that we pay. So we've become a country where the tax no longer goes to serving the people. It goes to serving the ruling class and these people find ways to laundry it and steal it and keep it from the situations and the organizations and the places it needs to be to serve us so that they can live in a bigger fucking house. That is fucked up. Okay. And that is a fundamental change. This is what I'm talking about when I talk about Donald Trump's administration. We are taxed in a way where we work when you not just income taxed but when you add up all the tax that we make, bro, we pay more tax than we get to keep. Okay. If that's the case, then what does that make us? Does that make us free? No, it makes us tax slaves. It means worker bees. We exist to work our lives away so that they can take the money. And not only do they take the money, they take the money and they don't do anything. For us, they do very little. They keep doing stuff that further keeps the foot on the throat. Of course. And I mean, of course, that's what that's about. Do taxes. They can print as much money as they want. They do it anyway. So if that's the case, then what is the fucking point of taxes? The point of taxes is not to serve the public. It's to handicap financially the individual citizen so that they cannot become too powerful for the government to control. And that is something that Donald Trump's administration needs to fix. And if they don't fix that, their administration will be a failure in my opinion. Because that is the ultimate issue here in this country that no one wants to address or talk about because we are brought up believing that that's how it should be. Our ancestors fucking had a revolt over 3% taxes. Okay. And here we are 250 years later paying more of our money to the government than we get to keep. That is anti-American. That is against the fundamental guidelines that this country was even founded upon. Well, I mean, here's another example. Trump needs to change it, dude. There is another example for you. A lot of these people that they have arrested at this time for starting these fires. Right. You talk about priorities and tax dollars and where it goes. Right? Like, you know, I'd be curious to see. I mean, a few of these people could potentially be American citizens, but a few of them problem a night, right? Or like the people that have been getting caught starting fires, actually started them. They're not documented. What should happen to people to get caught starting fires? I think they should get caught on fire. I think we should light them on fire on television. I think, listen, dude, we got to get Dana White involved. He understands how to put on live events. Okay. Okay. We're getting pay-per-view. Yes. We let him create a new avenue of his pay-per-view company, which is called The Big Show. We talked about this so many times. It was great. The Big Show, we take all these violent criminals and these arsonists and these people that disrupt society and you pay 100 bucks once a week if you want to watch and be lit on fire or thrown into woodchipper on live TV. And then the money that's generated goes towards the victims of the crimes that they committed. I legitimately feel like that is a tremendous idea. And the reason I feel that way, because people think I'm joking, I'm not joking. I'm not serious. That's serious. Is that over the course of history, people have been shown that there are violent repercussions for doing things like rape and murder and molesting children and starting fucking fires that ruin people's lives and kill their dogs and their kids and their families. And did you hear the story about that man who had a son who had a cerebral palsy and couldn't evacuate and he stayed with him and they both died? Like, bro, these people are killing people and these people need to be dealt with. And unless there is a tremendous fear of the repercussions of actions, people will continue to do bad things. And we have been, we have been intentionally indoctrinated to have sympathy for criminals when we shouldn't have any. Okay. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and most people don't have an experience to speak from from dealing with violent crime. I do. I got stabbed in the fucking face. Most people don't even know that unless they read my book, right? Or they've been listening to a show for, you know, 10 years. Right. But dude, I have a perspective of that. And, and a lot of people know they think that like, you know, all these violent crimes and these violent situations, they feel like they are accidents. Oh, the person, you know, they were molested when they were a kid. So now they killed someone. I don't care. I don't fucking care. I don't care that they were molested as a kid. I care that they killed my kid. Right. You see what I'm saying? Right. Like, this, this justification and making excuses for disgusting criminal violent acts has to stop and they need to be dealt with publicly so that we can stop this shit in society. Yeah. That's my personal opinion. It's a relatively new thing too, like in, in just in the human timeline. That's right. Of history. Right. This, this bleeding heart with the people who do not want to participate in society, like everybody else that it's relatively new, man. You know, but, but on the tax thing real quick, because I thought, I mean, this is, this is interesting how it all works together. Imagine, you know, a lot of these people that are getting caught setting these fires. A decent amount of them, they have been, and this is verified by ice itself. They're not, they're illegal immigrants, right? But imagine, imagine, you know, you get all these people getting caught for setting these fires. They're all illegal immigrants. And then your number, your number one priority as governor of, of California is to, to take more tax dollars and put it aside to trunk proof the state, which money is going to be used to prevent those same people from being deported. There's nobody in California that agrees with that. Nobody. No, he's doing this on their own. That's right. They're doing this shit on their own. And so I get one point to do the California. Even my liberal friends who are Democrat, they're, they're hardcore Democrats. My liberal friends, they're liberal. They're not leftist. They're not communist, but they are very liberal. These people are sick of that shit. I mean, that, that's a thing, man. Like the people in California, they're going to have to stand up. I know they didn't ask for that. No. Tell them, don't fucking do it. You know, I'm just like, how do you trunk proof a state? You know what I'm saying? I think everybody in California is just not paying taxes. That'll be a hell of a day. That'll be a hell of a day. Because I mean, they pay a shit ton, man. I know. That's crazy. Most people leave there because of that. They start making money. Because it's such a big deal. It's crazy, man. Guys, look at that. Slime ball. Tard. I want to, I'm trying to cut back on my cursing. That's good. Yeah. Good. He's a fucking piece of shit. Sometimes it's just appropriate. Hey, hey, I get it. Guys, jump in on this convo. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think about that topic. Let me tell you what, let's get to our third and final headline. We're going to headline. Numerow. Three. You know the Spanish word for three? Mm-hmm. What? Trace. Okay. You know how I know that? Uno no straice. Nope. Trace liches. Cake. That makes sense. What does it mean? It's three layers of milk. A milk. Yeah, three, three, yeah, it's three milk cake. Three milk cake. Mm-hmm. By the way, she's good. We got that somewhere. You ate it. Yeah, I did. I like it too. I ate a pizza. You did. Yeah, what was that? That was a fall line. Listen. I think it was in a place called. Yeah, fall line. Yeah, yeah. It's like a spot too. A spot. Yeah, fall line up there in Veil. They took care of us. Trace liches cake. Yeah, that's how I know three in Spanish. Shocking. All right. All right, line number three. Headline number cake. A lot of people are upset about this. It's an interesting conversation. I'd like to get your take on it. I got to talk about social media companies here for a second. US lawmakers urge Biden to extend TikTok January 19th ban deadline. So TikToks on the move to get banned from the United States, okay? It's some interesting things that's happening in a few days. A lot of people are upset about it. Yeah. So let's talk about it. Two Democratic lawmakers on Monday, urged Congress and President Joe Biden to extend a January 19th deadline for China-based bite dance to sell the US assets of TikTok or face a US ban. Supreme Court held arguments Friday on TikTok and bite dances challenge to the law. A lawyer for the company, Noel, France Francisco said it would be impossible to complete a sale next week's deadline. He said if banned, the short video app used by 170 million Americans would quickly go dark and quote essentially the platform shuts down. Biden could extend the deadline by 90 days if he certifies bite dance is making substantial progress towards a divesture. But it's unlikely bite dance can meet that standard. Edward Markey said he plans to introduce legislation to delay the deadline by which bite dance must sell TikTok or face a ban by an additional 270 days. Quote a ban with dismantle a one-of-a-kind informational and cultural ecosystem silencing millions in the process, Markey said Monday. Now what exactly does that mean? Because it's not like TikTok would just disappear. It's not, but new users would not be able to download the app. But I think most people who are on TikTok, they're already on there. I think most people who aren't. Wait, wait, wait. So is that true? So if they ban it and you already have an account, you still use it. It will still be available. But Apple, like the Apple app store and Google Play Store, they would not be able to do that. I don't think that's true, bro. Yeah, I mean, that's what the ruling is here right now. This article actually talks about it because there's another app that's also coming out of China called RetNote, which I think that just screams communism to me for some reason. I don't know why. Yeah. But it's a new app called Sickle of Hammer. Exactly. It's about saying it, right? It's a little weird. You know, that's interesting name. We got this new app called Throw You Off A Building. This new app called Mind Comp. Like everybody download it. It's like, what the fuck bro? Hey. Hey, we got this new app. It's called Hitler. Right? RetNote. Cool. But this is supposed to be like the backup plan. So if they don't sell and there's been talks like Elon Musk might buy it, I don't think that's been verified. It's just being, you know, conspiracy theories throwing out there. But yeah, if they don't get somebody to buy TikTok by January 19th, the app will be illegal for distribution through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Internet service providers will also be required to make the app inaccessible to US and Internet browsers. But the thing is, let me find it here for you. If the band takes effect next Sunday, Apple and Google will no longer be able to offer TikTok for downloads for new users. But existing users will still be able to access the app. US government and TikTok agree that the app would degrade and eventually become unusable over time because companies would not be able to offer support services. So yeah, so it still be available. They'll be updating all that. But just no new updates, no new nothing. So eventually it would just fucking kind of fizzle out. You know, but a lot of people are freaking out. But yeah, this red note, this was actually launched in 2013. It became one of China's fastest growing social platforms with the value of over $17 billion. Known as the little red book. It translates to the little red book. Do you know what the little red book is? Maybe you guys should all Google that. Maybe you should read it. It's responsible for more deaths than any book in the fucking history. The war saying it's not a good look. It's actually the second most popular book I think in history. But what if that's the plan? Band TikTok is bringing the red note, which is like the actual fucking social miles little red book. It's actual a fucking social control. You know what's crazy about it is when you read it, it's like it's very convincing. Like if you read it from a state, if you read it from a non bias. If you read it from a, if you read it from a position that he's talking about freedom, you're going to read it and be like, oh, this is fucking great. Like it's the same thing with fucking rules for radicals. Like the book suck you in, dude. Like if you're stupid, you're going to fucking fall for it. Anyway, what does it say? What's the say about it? It just tells me the details about it. Is it the second most popular book besides the Bible? I thought I heard that. What's the top five books of all time? Top five distributed books of all time. I thought it was. The prize probably up there. Why have we ever read it? I have. I have it at home. Yeah, really? Yeah. Dude, it sits on my coffee table. It just gives different fiction books. Anyway. Yeah. Yeah, so I mean, it's not a good look. No, not a good look. Yeah. What? It's number three. It's the number three most distributed book of all time. Bible Quran. Bible Quran. Red book. Damn it. That's crazy. Yeah. We're second. Yeah. A long mark. I'm just saying the book, the books kill more people than fucking any book ever. It's dangerous. Yeah. You know, so I mean, that's happened on the TikTok side. Any thoughts, theories, comments on that side? I mean, it'll be interesting to see what happens if they do ban it. I don't, you know, I have my own theories about why they want to ban it. I think that TikTok has become the, I think TikTok is not controlled by the left. And I think that's why they hate it. That's why they hate Twitter too. And I think there's been a resurgence of conservative values, Christian values that have come from the younger generations on TikTok. I believe that the young generations on TikTok have recognized the propaganda that has been pushed to them in schools, in high school, in college. And they are revolting. And I think a lot of that comes from TikTok. I think the reason that Donald Trump won so decisively was because of the flip flop of TikTok being, you know, woke left to conservative and value. And so it makes sense why certain people want to ban it. Yeah. I don't think Trump wants to ban it. I think Trump wants it to stay. I don't know what's going to happen. You know, if it does get banned, that's going to push a lot of people over back to meta platform. So they're controlling that. Right. And, you know, look, there's a lot of backdoor deals that are done here too. And yeah, well, I see that there's like three parties in the play here, right? So you got the Democrats who can't control it because TikTok, in my opinion, it probably has one of the more freer algorithms, right? Like, obviously, there's some sort of China, like there's some influence. No, I think it's, I think we all agree on that. But I think it has a better algorithm. So it's way more open algorithm, right? So you have Democrats who can't control that. And they want to control that narrative. Then you have the rhinos that come in and because China's the biggest threat to our country, they want, they don't want the control theory that's there, right? But you have that third group that's kind of like, it's fine. Well, you know, look, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I feel like a lot of people are lying about a lot of different things to get their way. Yeah, for sure. And my underlying feeling is what I just said. I feel like the communist influences in this country have figured out that TikTok is actually working against them and not for them, which is why they don't want it here. Yeah. And I think it was intended to work for them. I think so too. Yeah, I think so too. So it is interesting how that works. You know, but if it does get banned, like you said, I mean, it doesn't really leave us with too many options, right? Because you got Instagram, Facebook, that's all the same. Yeah, I mean, look, Instagram will get more left again. And Twitter will get more right. Yeah. And, you know, it is what it is. Yeah. Well, I mean, speaking of Meta though, I'm not sure if we were already talking about Zuckerberg coming out. I made that video talking about the new channel. I think a lot of leftists are leaving the internet, dude. They should. No, I think they are. I think they realize that their entire mentality and their entire worldview has been propped up through propaganda bots and all of these things. And I think they're starting to get a temperature for what the world is really like. And they've been so abusive and so aggressive and so mean and so fucking vile for the last 10 years that they can't operate anymore. Because their whole strategy to operating online is to bully and gang up and cancel people. And you can't cancel people when the bot system isn't working on your behalf. So we see all these leftists coming on people's shit and saying shit and they're just getting blasted. Well, that's a thing, but like, what were it's three or four years ago, they were getting celebrated. Exactly. Well, that's the thing. That's what I'm gonna say. Like, social media, those platforms for the last six years were the only place that they could go where they wasn't alone. You know what I'm saying? Because in reality, they're by themselves. It's such a small mindset group of people. There's not that many of them. But on the internet, they had platforms that all these things that they could use in pop modes are not alone. I'm not by myself. I'm not the only person who thinks a kick and chop off his penis. You know what I'm saying? And they propped them up and it did a lot of damage. You know what I'm saying? But if it does go back to meta, we'll see. But we've covered meta. We covered Zuckerberg, making that new announcement, change it direction. He's already took a new step. I don't know if you've seen this. This just came out before the show. Meta announces 5% cuts in preparations for intense year. We read the internal memo. So he just laid off 5% of meta. What's the intense year that he talks about? Well, I'm assuming all these changes that he's coming into. So let's dive into this a little bit. Meta set out to cut about 5% of its workforce focusing on the company's lowest performing staffers. Is that some, what? That's a meritocracy. This sounds like some meritocracy. Don't do your job. You get fucking fired. Wow. You know what's funny? That's how it's always been for fucking white people. It's the fucking truth. It's the fucking truth. Bro, it's the truth. It's the truth. It's the truth. But yeah, let's dive into this. So CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees about the decision to quote, move out low performers faster. In a memo posted on the company's internal workplace form on Tuesday, Zuckerberg, told employees 2025 will be quote an intense year. The company specified that it's exiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers in a separate message posted by a company director. Meta has more than 72,000 employees according to its most recent quarterly report. So what is it? How many people is that? 5% of 72,000? What's that? Yeah, 3500. 3500? Okay. I mean, let's be honest, it's probably that's probably how many were actually fucking making these fucked up ass calls and algorithms and shit potentially. No, no, no, no. Those people are active employees. The lowest 5% of your employees don't do shit. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, they hide in the corner. They pretend to be busy. They do enough not to get fired. And that's what the lowest 5% does. The people who are doing what you are saying they're doing, those people are there for that and they're active. Okay. So they're going to have to do more to rid that part of their culture out of their system. Zach probably doesn't know that because the reality is is he's been running the company the way he's been running it for a long time. And I don't know that he knows that. But he could always bring me in. I could help fix his fucking culture in about fucking 90 days. Anybody with purple hair? Bro, he's not. No, no, no, no. I don't care if you have purple hair. But when I care, as you do your job, the way you're supposed to do it, you do it at high level. And you believe in the mission of what it is that we stand for and what we do. And I am very, very good at that. And I could help him for real. So it's up. Give me a call, bro. Yeah. Well, here's the internal memo. This was the memo that was released. It's not long. It's not that big. But that's what she said. Let's dive into this. Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year. And I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams. I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren't meeting expectations over the course of a year. But now we're going to do more extensive performance based cuts during the cycle with the intention of backfilling these roles in 2025. We won't manage out everyone who didn't meet expectations for the last period if we're optimistic about their future performance. And for those we do let go, we'll provide generous severance in line with what we provide it with previous cuts. Yeah. He's nervous about those lawsuits that are going to come. But the reality is the law has been changed. And you're not going to get the sue anymore for that shit. No. So I don't think you should be able to sue for that. Fuck no. Like bro, listen dude. You didn't do it. No, DJ, you got to understand. Companies have been held hostage by this shit for fucking a decade. You have a person who's not meeting expectations and they're in a protected class and you fire them, you get destroyed on the internet. You get destroyed in public perception. You get fucking sued. Okay, that's all over now. So now companies are having, we've talked about this on the show. Companies are having to move back towards meritocracy. I said this four fucking years ago on the show. I said you better move towards pro-America. You better move towards meritocracy because that's what a fuck it's going to go back to. And here we are four years later and it's exactly what's happening. So, yeah bro, we have to understand these people, these low performers, they have used their protected class to leverage companies into keeping them or even into promoting them into positions. Okay, that is not okay. That is not okay. And that shit's over and Zuckerberg is starting to realize because he's surrounding himself by good business people. They know why it's one of the best business guys in the fucking world. Okay, he's got smart people in his ear now who are being like bro, fuck these people. Okay, they're fucking you up, they're holding you hostage, fuck him, rip the bandaid off. And then when you fix the culture and you get it right, you'll never have to deal with that again because the internal culture will manage those people out on their own. You know what I'm saying? Like bro, one of those woe fucking motherfuckers comes here what happens? They're out of here and fucking two weeks. Yeah, on their own. On their own, they quit. You ain't got to find them. Right? That's real. That's real. I mean listen, it's good to see. I mean, I don't know how change is gonna come that quick, but I mean, it's at least nice to see you stick in the way. Well, he has to otherwise he'll lose. Yeah. If you do not change your company to a meritocracy and you continue to do this shit where you're putting people into play that aren't good enough to be in that position, you will lose because of the market. This is what, this is, this should be obvious. That's how it works. Bro, if I run a football team and I run the Dallas Cowboys and I start putting fucking dudes out there because there's not enough white dudes on the team and I put them into positions because of their whiteness or whatever. They're Asian guys. We don't have another Asian guys. So we put out three Asian guys. The fucking team's gonna lose, bro. I couldn't see the ball. No. Look. Ha ha ha ha. Look, they're gonna lose. They're gonna lose. So if you own a company, we talk about this all the time in RTA, we talk about this all the time in Q&A Fs. We're gonna talk about this all the time in MSCEO. But dude, if you do not run your company to win, you're going to lose. It is the natural order. Natural order always wins. It always comes back around. It always comes back to the strongest survive and the weak ones lose and die. And Zuck's recognizing this as a 40 year old dude now. Okay, who's, you know, like, bro, I think, look dude, a lot of people don't like the dude. I don't have an opinion on like or dislike, but like I can empathize with his position. The guy was fun, the richest guy's in the world at 23 years old. He's never been able to grow up. He's never been able to have real friends. Who the fuck are his real friends? He doesn't know because he's so much richer than everybody. You know, so I think he's starting to find his way. You know, he's doing jujitsu, he's doing his six. And by the way, people are like, well, you know, that doesn't excuse the things that he's done. Well, you know what, that's a conversation that should be had. But it seems like, and maybe he's just doing it to cover his ass. I don't fucking know, but it does seem like he's growing in a different way. It does. Just like Steven Aesmith. I agree. I agree, guys, that's what you got to think. Down in the comments, let us know what you got. I have a hard time judging somebody who has been in a unique situation like that that really nobody can understand. Well, not the thing though, it doesn't everybody think they have a unique situation. Like it's, you know, somebody like this. Yeah, but you do when you're 22 years old and you're one of the richest right in the world. Like that is a 22. Okay. If I was fucking as rich as I am now at 22, you'd find me in a fucking gutter with cocaine all over my face and a fucking, you know, who knows what? He's doing good just to be alive. Yeah. But plug in or some fucking weird ass shit. Like I probably, you know, like I'd be one of them dudes. You can claim shoulders. Yeah, that's right. Bro, like it would, it would, it would mess you up. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? And the fact that he's not like that's a totally fucked. Yeah, that says a lot. I think so. Yeah, I agree with it, man. I agree. Guys, let us know down in the comments what you guys think. I would that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show as always. We got thumbs up or dumb as fuck. You're a business guy, right? Podcast or YouTuber. Yeah, that's business. I, you know, I just mess around with this. There's a couple of things, right? Not very good at it. Well, I think, you know, I would describe you as a branding genius. You're very good with that stuff. Well, we're about to find out. Yeah, just gonna let that simmer on your guy's brains. Yeah. Well, I wanted to get, you know, a, an experience veteran entrepreneurs take on a company doing some new branding stuff, okay? All right. We got Walmart. Unveils new logo for the first time in almost 20 years. And shoppers are stunned by brand refresh. Okay. You see this? No. Okay. All right. This is good. Here we go. Okay. So Walmart has updated his logo for the first time in 20 years. And shoppers are seriously stunned. The retailer describes the new look as comprehensive brand refresh that reflects its evolution. So many back to different. According to the company, one of the key features of the refresh includes a word mark inspired by founder Sam Walton's classic trucker hat with a modern custom font, the color palette, true blue, and spark yellow was updated to keep the brand fresh. Okay. So comprehensive brand refresh that reflects its evolution. Okay. Now, for those of you guys who have forgotten what the Walmart logo looks like, this is the logo. So here's the before. You ready for the after? Mm-hmm. Shut the fuck up. Come on, dude. Come on. Hey, this is bullshit. This is real. No, it's not. This is real. Okay. Before. Come on. That is lies. Bro, listen. All right. Now, the text that have two logos, right? This is like the signature trademark sign, right? Here's the wording before. After. A comprehensive refresh. You guys are fucking popping up. I swear to God, bro, this is real. Is this real? I know Z-Shine tell me the truth. This is real. Z-Shine's my minister of truth over here. Z-Shine's my Mary Poppins of truth. I'm a foreign policy officer. Yeah, that's right. You're everything. If I need to know something, I ask him. Is that true? This is true. Really? Yeah. Well, this is an example. No, listen, bro, this is an example of what we're talking about. What we were talking about with Meta. You got all these people by committee. Nobody wants to make a mistake. Nobody wants to fuck anything up. And dude, they probably paid $30 million for some sort of market research. $2.1. Well. $2.1 million. No, that's not even what they pay their employees and all this other shit, dude. Like, and they probably took a year to figure it out. And all of these people show up and they don't do anything. And this is what they have to show. And I mean, dude, this is corporate inefficiency that is reflective in their work. You know, like I would fire every single person. I was just about to ask. Okay, so you're saying I would fire Sam Walton's dead. But if Sam Walton were alive, he, Sam Walton would fire fucking 80% of the people that work at Walmart. Today, yeah, that's what not because he doesn't care about people because Sam Walton was actually very famous about caring about people. But what Sam Walton was also famous for was he cared about details. This dude used to go into all of his stores and measure the width of his aisles with a measuring tape. And if it was one fucking 16th of an inch off, he would make the entire fucking shelf be torn apart, take him down and move the 16th and it's show it's all perfect. This dude was the ultimate detail oriented entrepreneur. And if you go read books about him, I mean, dude, he's, he, listen, he was awesome. That's why Walmart's so, so tremendously good. But what Walmart stands for today is not what Walmart stood for when he ran it. Okay. And I think if he were here today, I think he'd be very upset with what's been done with this company in a lot of different ways. I mean, let's be real, dude. You know, like you probably don't remember this. And Joe, you might remember this. Do you remember when Walmart didn't have super centers and then they just came? Do you remember Walmart was just like a Woolworths? I do. Yeah. So, so Walmart used to be just like a true value or like a Woolworths or like a fucking general store. Okay. And then it's probably 30 years ago. They came out with a fucking super center. Okay. And the super center had groceries. That was the big thing. You get the groceries and then it became you can get all your home goods there. Automotive shit. Yes. But when you went into Walmart when they first did that, bro, it was fucking perfect. It was perfect. It was perfectly clean. Everything was facing perfect. It was like an amazing thing to go to a Walmart super center because of how perfect it was. And now you go and want that means there's fucking people of Walmart. Now you go and want it. Facebook page. Bro, that's what I'm saying. It looks like fucking shit. And so when I say he'd fire everybody, I don't think he would re-ire people. Yeah, for sure. But there would be different standards. Yeah. So anyway, yeah, this is, this is insane, dude. And that's, that's embarrassing, you know, to the whole branding department of that company should be fired. No, listen, listen, I'm being serious, dude. Somebody said, I can't believe someone got paid for this. Somebody else said, I hope people will still be able to recognize that's Walmart. That's, dude, that's insane. Yeah, dude, it's wild, man. I don't know. That was up at the, but it was fucking awesome. This is the dumbest shit we ever had on here. It's, dude, imagine being the person who is the lead of the brand graphic design team coming to, like, imagine if this were me. Like, yeah. Yeah. No, for real. Imagine if this were me. And they, and they, and I said, hey, guys, I want to complete, I want to complete brand refresh. Wait, wait, you guys use their words. Hold on, use our words. Comprehensive brand refresh. Okay. Don't bring me anything until it's fucking perfect. Comprehensive. And then they turn around, bring me like our regular logo back again. It's a 90 degrees. No, dude. It's like a sharper color. Like, wow. Man, it's reflective of corporate attitude, though. Nobody wants to make a decision. Nobody wants to make a mistake. And, you know, we'll throw a little Q and A F in here. If you're one of these people that works inside of a company who is a total coward and you trying to, like, not make a mistake, you're never going to make any money. You're never going to be successful. You're never going to do anything because the best people, the best ideas, the best things come from people that are willing to step outside what is comfortable to present. And that doesn't mean it's going to, you're going to get your way. At least, like, my best people that I work with, they will bring me things that are different than what we're doing so we can say, okay, we can go in that direction or this direction or that. And because people are so fearful, they hold themselves back because they can't move outside the idea that, well, if I do this, I'm going to get in trouble. Motherfucker, what the fuck are you talking about? You're paid to push shit forward. Let's do some cool shit. Push some shit forward. That's what I'm saying. So if you're one of those people, bro, you better break out of that. You can be broke forever. I love it, man. I love it. Guys, Andy, that's all I got. All right, guys. Don't be a hoe. Show the shot. Yeah. Never sleep in on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck up, bro. Fuck up, stole. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch. Booted slow. Got a own bank road. Can't fold. Dusset note. Hit shot. Case closed.
