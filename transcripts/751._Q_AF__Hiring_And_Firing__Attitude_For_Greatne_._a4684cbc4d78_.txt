black cards I got the blue cards you know I'm saying all right man let's fix the people better man guys Andy I got three gopens for you all right you always do hey man I'll do my best I know so let's knock these out guys Andy question numero uno hey Andy and DJ thanks for taking my question I've been a tattoo artist for 20 years now and open my own shop one month before covid shut us down the business survived that and has been thriving and growing since them but I've made a lot of mistakes primarily in who I've hired I've let the wrong people in and as a result I've gotten very comfortable firing people I've been guilty of knowing someone needed to go and keeping them on way too long now my tolerance for bullshit is very low when I can see it's not a good fit I am quick to stop the bleeding my question is am I being too picky I don't want winners in my shop who want to contribute to our overall momentum and growth of our artists collectively but those people are very few and far in between in this industry should I allow B players to take up space and put more time and effort into coaching them in order to keep moving the needle forward or do I keep holding out and hope to attract those A players that I really want thanks so much for your help it's firing too quick is that a thing well there's a saying and the saying is higher slow fire fast and the reason that you want to fire fast is because you don't want a negative attitude to infect the culture of your business when you're a good person you care about people business owners tend to be overly empathetic towards people that aren't going to work out I've been guilty of this myself where I've hung on to people way too long because I inaccurately believe that their only hope is for them to be with me I know I'm going to win I'm fucking winning bro and when I look at other people and I and this is wrong okay I'm saying I'm just telling you how I look at it I believe in what I'm doing so much that when I look at people and they say oh you know I'm not doing this I look at them and I think bro you're only fucking chance to really get where the fuck you say you want to go is going to be hitching your mother fucking wagon to me because I am a fucking Clydesdale bro I don't ever stop I will never stop and I will get where I want to go and I know that deep inside me the problem is that's not true people can can win and survive and do things in all different places and they need to be some place where they're going to fit not everybody is made to operate on a high standard all the time I have a saying that I use and you you know it's very simple the world needs fried cooks too okay the world needs people to make the fucking french fries and that's okay just make some good fucking french fries you know do the best you can so I can understand where a business owner will get in the in the habit of allowing people to stay but that usually comes from you caring about them and also you believing that you're the only chance at really getting where they want to go which is inaccurate and it's not a negative way a lot of times employees perceive that to be negative like you know no it's just that I believe in what I'm doing so much that I know I'm gonna get there and I know you will too if you just fucking come along right and so you know it becomes very difficult to go through that process of really caring about people and their future and their career and then you know watching them make decisions that you may not agree with but at the end of the day bro we can't control what people do and a lot of times when we try to prevent them from making decisions we're actually preventing them from learning the lessons that they need to learn so that's a natural progression as an entrepreneur if you're an empathetic caring person in the beginning you have a hard time firing the first time I fired someone I fucking cried dude I got my truck and I fucking cried I felt so shitty about having a fire the dude I remember I'm dude I remember the guy's name I'm he just couldn't do the job and it bothered me like it's still kind of bothers me because I can't you know it was it was hard and you know as you go through the process of hiring a firing it gets it gets a little easier gets a little easier and when I ultimately came to understand which made it much less personal and much easier to handle that situation was that by me not letting go of someone who needed to be like go of I'm letting down the rest of the team I'm costing them opportunity because this person's they have to drag this person and also I'm preventing that person from finding something that they're really gonna love and really excel at where they're struggling here right so I came to that conclusion which is true that's the truth the truth is is when you try to keep someone who doesn't really fit you're preventing them from finding something where they will fit and that is or learning a lesson about how they could fit somewhere if they just gave a little more and developed a little more so when you step in the way of someone's karma that they have developed themselves right you end up taking the brunt of that and that's something that I've learned the hard way plenty of times where I've tried to keep people and it ends up blowing up into a huge negative situation where had I just let him go when I first knew that they should have been let go it would have never caused that so I think this person you know at 20 years in you have definitely progressed to the point where you need to be and I think now you're feeling a little bit guilty for just snap snap snap firing them through but the reality is dude I actually think that's a super healthy way to run things I think that you are you have to be very careful about people poisoning the well poisoning the culture well and the truth of the matter is is if you want to attract a players and an a player comes into your studio or comes into your business and they see a bunch of C players they're not gonna want to work there all right so it's very important for the standard that you're trying to hold as a premium elite tattoo studio that you have a players in there because when the other a players come in they're gonna want to be there and if you have a bunch of you know medium level people that don't really give a fuck those a players are gonna come in and be like now this isn't where I want to be right and I tell my team all the time and every company that I'm involved in I tell my teams all the time I say look this isn't for everybody dude there's plenty of jobs there's plenty of careers that are easier than this we are the University of Alabama here we are trying to win championships we are trying to build an iconic brand we are trying to be the best and that is not something that everybody can handle nor should they some people that's not the focus of their lives that's not what they care about they care about other things and that's okay but if you take one of this these people who cares about other things and you put them in that environment they're gonna be fucking miserable because the standards so high the pressure is high they can't take it and they end up resenting you in the company for even putting you in the position so I actually think you're in a very good spot I don't think you should feel bad about it I think you you've run the course of developing your mindset as an entrepreneur from someone who hangs on to people to someone who maybe is a little bit fast and the answer to this is you know a question that you can ask yourself when you're deciding whether or not you should have put more time into this person or not would be something like did I fail this person did they fail me right did I fail this person by not coaching them up teaching them the skills spending enough time with them to get them where they needed to go or did I do that and they just failed me on their execution and if the answer is you failed them then it's time for you to sit down have a real talk with them and say okay look I failed you bro you're not developing at the pace that I need you to develop at and I'll take responsibility for that this time but here's what I need okay are we clear on this what do you need help with and you give them another chance and if they come out the gates and they start doing a thing and they move down the right track cool if you give them that discussion and they go back to doing the exact same shit then you have your answer and it's very simple it's not emotional it's just facts that person doesn't belong here and if you keep them there they're a liability not only to the company but to the other members of the team and also they're going to keep themselves from being where they need to be and learning the lessons that they need to learn so that's how in a nut shell how I would think about it now if you want like detailed information on this these are the kinds of things that we go through an RITASINNICATE you can apply to be a part of RITASINNICATE it's the entrepreneurship group that at night at my latinite run together and we've run together since for almost six years now it's for people that own real businesses it's for people that are building real companies and and we talk about these kind of things in depth all the time yeah I was going to ask you to do before you said like you can ask yourself this question but like man what's that equation look like when you know you might have a B player but that B player you know with just a little bit more you know investment in education or whatever it is they could be the star of that studio for sure and so like like that's got to be a hard thing to kind of like to to kind of eyeball and judge man I'll tell you what's really hard what's really hard is when you have someone that has that potential and because I've been doing something for so long I can see that they have it but they don't believe they have it and because they don't believe they have it they don't really try to like material like make let it materialize and then they go from thing to thing to thing to thing to thing you know how many people I've worked with in my life bro that are fucking one inch away from being fucking great at what they do but because they were raised in a shitty family or they have shitty friends or they have people in their ear telling them they can't do anything they don't really try and they never become anything and they end up working you know a bunch of different careers thinking man this isn't right for me it's look bro nothing's right you got to make it right we're all gonna have days where we come into what we do and we're like fuck this sucks I'd rather be doing this um it's those days that matter the most ironically those are the days where you have to execute at the highest level because those are the days everybody else fucking doesn't do shit and if you can execute at the highest level when everybody else doesn't do shit you distance yourself from them so yeah dude it is very hard and it's very hard when you care about people um I think when you detach your emotions from it it's much easier but I just don't think that's the way to run a business I don't think that's like an unemotional I just personally dude I you got to have a little bit a little bit but but not really because if you really care about him you're gonna let him go find something that they that they're great at right if you really care about him you're gonna you're gonna tell him what they're lacking truth is and some people don't like that bro some people can't handle that you know but I could tell you this if you are even considering coming to work for me and anything I do just know it's hard as fuck it's high pressure we are here to win if you can't cut it in that environment you shouldn't even fucking try to come here because you will fucking hate it yeah it's funny you see styles really really good at that too which what which part like like the I care about you but here's like the fucking brutal honest fucking truth that you may not like to hear well that's because he what let me tell you dude let me tell you dude people think that he doesn't care about him because because of that right the truth is there in anybody in this fucking company that cares about people more than him right because he will tell him the exact fucking truth so and people people have a hard time handling that yeah yeah you know I love it love it guys any question number two hey Andy I'm gonna be a sophomore in high school in a couple of weeks I got screwed over last year in school ball for softball I was promised a starting spot at second base as a freshman and I had it for a game or two but a girl from another school her dad knew the assistant coach she got my spot I got shoved to right field which I'm not complaining about because I still played as a freshman on varsity but she just walked in and took my spot the position I earned she got it handed to her next year I'm going to strive to get third base I do not want it to happen again I want to be a killer next year I want to be the oh shit kind of player when coaches see me not the we got it in the back kind of player I'm a decent ball player right now I started trop stop for travel and I have a 800 fielding percentage which isn't great but it's good I want my coaches to have to play me next year what tips do you have for me to get mentally prepared for that well I think you got the right attitude okay I would caution you I'm just going to speak straight with you if you're listening to the show you're a straight shooter you probably weren't good enough to keep that job a second base and this is a reality lesson that you should take with you anywhere you go because there's going to be times in your life where you are as good as someone else and that's someone else will have a relationship or they'll have a connection and beat so for that reason being as good is not good enough like you said in your question you have to be the kind of person that someone says oh shit they're fucking good okay if you are not undeniably better than the person that you are competing with you have to understand that you're running the risk of not getting that job and that goes for you know varsity softball that goes for college softball that goes for your career in your whole entire life if you are as good as someone else that you are competing with you are running the risk of not getting the job because of some other aspect all right so I would caution you to not look at these situations they only got that because of their dad because you're creating a mental dialogue we're going to get into the mental part now you're creating a mental dialogue that is an excuse making dialogue okay and you don't want to get in that habit I'm not saying that you're out of line here but what I am saying is you want to be very careful what you blame and who you blame when you don't get what you want because ultimately it's you the truth of the matter is is had you practice and taken a thousand more reps than that girl who went to second base you would have still been playing at second base but she probably took the same amount of reps that you did maybe even more and that's why you're not there and that's the truth so let's bottom line the truth here it's not about the dad it's about how good you are if you were undeniably better than her do you think that they would have moved you to right field no they would have kept you there they would have put her in right field all right so that's the first thing that I want you to understand and I appreciate you asking the question but if you're going to ask a question here you're going to get straight answer I don't care if you're five or if you're 50 all right so you need to get better that's the truth um mentally how do you get better you have to adopt this mindset that I'm explained to you you have to be undeniably better in every area of your life so like and what I mean by every area of your life I mean as you go through life and this could be your career right let's say you're not going to become a professional softball player let's say you're going to become an accountant you have to be a much better higher skilled accountant than the person next to you so that you get the role right um so learn a lesson now when you're young you're 14 15 16 years old learn that lesson now and it won't be a problem um you know this is going to come down to reps it's like anything else so if you want to be where you want to be next year like you say and I think I believe that you do or you wouldn't be listening to this show to get better um you need to put in a lot more reps than that person's doing you know whatever you think that person's do I would do 50% more than that you know take 50% more ground balls take 50% more batting practice and by the time that game comes around especially your age you're going to be further developed in that person will it's very easy to develop in sports when you're at that age if you're just willing to do more work um because that's what it comes down to and you're developing your motor skills so fast right now that just those more reps is going to put you in that position where you're undeniably better so I would just commit to the work I would like I honestly assess you know like let's just well how many reps is Suzy doing Suzy's doing a hundred ground balls all right you got to do 150 you have to okay Suzy's taking 20 you know or 100 balls at bats all right well you got to take 200 you know I'm saying you just got to do more man and you got to do more reps and that's going to put you in position to win mentally uh how you justify that is you have to set and this is what I tell myself and you guys know this listen to the show and and you know this guys here I tell myself I don't have any special skills I wasn't blessed with extreme IQ I wasn't given any special breaks so I know I have to do more you know when I when when I look at what's going on in my life and you guys who follow me for a long time you know this is I talk about this all the time there might be better people than me but there isn't anybody it's gonna put in more work to me and and honestly I feel like that's why I am where I am and I honestly feel like that's why most of you guys relate to me because I'm not one of these people that was just born with all this special shit I'm I wasn't extra you know blessed in all these areas I had to put in that those reps and that's why I believe and I know that all of you can do the same thing if you if you were willing to adopt that mindset of hey I wasn't blessed with the athletic ability that Susie was so that means I got to do more and that's the reality of life you know right now there's a lot of topics around uh you know you know you know everything being equitable and even and everybody ending up in the right at the same spot that's just not reality dude the reality is is um if you started out with nothing and someone else started out with you know something let's say you know people like to say oh your the guy was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple right all right so you're born on home base you weren't born with any special gifts you weren't really given any special treatment and then you're competing at someone who was gifted who let's say born on second base that means you got to do more work you can't complain about it and say oh it's not fair no shit is not fair that's the way the world works the world is not fucking fair so we have to bottom line that and say okay this is the reality if we want to be great we have to bottom line that and say okay this is the reality um I wasn't blessed with these gifts so I have to do more and if I do more I'll pass that person up and I actually think that that's a very very very great place to be because you learn the habits that will sustain your success over the course of your life whereas someone else who was born with these gifts doesn't ever learn the grit the work ethic the fortitude that it takes to push through the really hard times we see this with like you know people who were tremendous athletes in high school they were first team all state they were first team all-american in high school and they get in college and they're okay and then you know maybe they get to pros and there are nobody right but then you got the Tom Brady's of the world you got the guy who was okay and then he got he was okay in college and then he was okay and he just decided he's gonna fucking put in the reps and he became the greatest of all time I would much rather come from less skill set and less blessings because it forces you to develop the work ethic required to maintain and become great versus someone who's born with the natural skill who doesn't appreciate it and doesn't learn that uh way of operating over the course of time so a lot of times when you're younger you look around for example like in business people will say things like this oh look I was born rich parents you know he his parents he like do when I was starting my business brother there was all kinds of people I competed with that had like you know parents that invested a bunch of money in their business or uh you know they came from very wealthy circumstances so they had options right but here's the problem the problem is they had options okay and because they had options they weren't able to fully dedicate themselves to becoming great at what they did for me to compete with someone more resources in the beginning I had to get better they didn't have to get better so take fast forward 10 years I have all these skills that they don't have because they relied on their resources and they're still where they are mentally and skill set that they were on day one now who do you think wins 10 years in I'm running circles around these guys right because I had to learn what it takes to compete and the reason I had to learn what it takes to compete is because I wasn't born with all the bonuses that some of these other people were born with so if you're that person and you're looking around right now and you're saying man I wasn't born with all good because that's going to force you to develop the things that you're going to need to be successful of course of your life the the the work ethic the grit the skill set the ability to learn as you go the adaptation the ability to be resourceful these are things that people who were born with blessings never learn because they rely on those blessings to get them through so like 10 years down the road when when you've dedicated yourself right now at 14 years old to okay I don't have the gifts that Suzy has and I've got to put in twice as much work to get rid if you adopt that mindset now due to 25 10 years from now you're going to be killing everybody because of the mindset that you developed all right so just just be okay and say hey I didn't get everything everybody else got so I got a work harder I love it I absolutely love it good luck in your season um Kaz Andy question number three they're in the final question guys uh dear Andy I've been wrestling with your concept of aggressive patience recently and I'm wondering if you can just dive deeper into it I am 19 a full-time employee and a full-time college sophomore studying software development I'm ready to move out on my own and begin my career with an internship or an entry-level position my family however keeps telling me to stay at home save my money and focus on my studies rather than getting an internship my question is in what situations should aggressive patience be used rather than moving forward and taking the next step and also a first one happens to be uh or have a software development internship available let me know um okay look I think you're misunderstanding the concept of aggressive patience all right there's there's there's three things that have to happen for you to become successful in anything okay you have to put in the work you have to become skilled and you have to allow time to do its part and the analogy that I've always used for this is baking a cake all right you could want to bake a cake and you go on Google and you say I'm a big cake and you find this amazing cake recipe from Martha Stewart at one all the awards all right and you're like all right that's the cake I want to make so you read the recipe out and you put all the ingredients in the pan you mix it up just like it says exactly like she says it says 400 degrees for 40 minutes so you're pouring all the ingredients in the bowl you pour it in the pan you're just about ready to put it in the oven and you're like fuck dude if I cook this thing for 800 degrees for 20 minutes I could get it out twice as fast all right so you you think you're real smart so you turn the thing up to 800 degrees and you set the timer for 20 minutes and you throw that bitch in there and then you go to pull it out what is it it's burnt to a crisp it's smoking your smoke alarms going off it smells like shit and you're like what the fuck is going on all right you did not obey one of the crucial elements of success which is allowing time to do its part okay we cannot rush time in terms of what it takes for us to materialize our outcome in most situations now there is a max velocity that we can achieve but there is also things that we cannot substitute because they take time for example it takes time and business for a customer to become acclimated to your brand it might take 5 10 20 30 impressions before they ever think about trying your brand out that doesn't happen in one minute just because you want it to it takes time okay when we think about what that means that means that we have to be patient we have to allow time to do its job but the problem is is that when we say to people hey I need you to be patient here usually what they do when you tell them that they have to be patient as they stop doing the work and they believe that time will just bring them the result without any of the work and this is where the aggressive part comes in all right so you have to understand that it's going to take time but you have to also understand that every single day while you're waiting for time to materialize you have to show up and you have to give max effort and max execution all right so that's why it's called aggressive patience it's aggressive and daily execution but also mindful that we have to be patient and this is the reality of success you have to have work you have to have skill and you have to have patience and if you do not have those three things you cannot win all right and a lot of people say you don't need patience you need to be aggressive they're saying the same thing I'm saying but you can't out aggressive time in certain scenarios okay so all you can do is you could show up every day you can execute perfectly and the time will be what it is we can collapse time as much as possible by following the method of aggressive patience but a lot of guys will tell you oh you just need to be patient and a lot of young people young in the entrepreneurship game misunderstand that and they think that means just wait and that's not what it means when I say be patient to all of you what do you think automatically you probably think just wait okay and that that is not good enough you have to come in every single day kick ass executed a high degree executed at a high level and also understand that it's going to take time and that's what aggressive patience is about so and it's a required element of success you can't get around utilizing it yeah yeah and so so what you're saying is like okay you put that cake in the oven you said at the right time it's gonna be 40 minutes you can't speed that time up you can't stop it can slow it down right but there's other things that you could also be doing while that cakes yeah you could be making the icing you could be cleaning the kitchen you could be making the icing you be setting the table you could be aggressively showing up and getting prepared for that event that you need to cake for right so there's this is all part of how it works and you know it's it's very simple when you think about it like that it's so different than an athlete bro an athlete's gonna show up like for example the the girl from the last question yeah all right she shows up on day one we got 365 days in the year right she wants to improve her skill set she shows up on day one and just fucking she works out for 16 hours that day shows up for day two 16 hours shows up for day three 16 hours shows up for day four 16 hours doesn't show up for day five because she's like fuck this okay whereas the person who shows up every single day for eight hours and crushes exactly what they do and they do that for 365 days straight that motherfucker's gonna be highly skilled because they allowed for time to do its part how skilled can you get at a sport in one day no matter how hard you work number okay what about a week what about a year yeah right there we go so so but if you were to sit on the bench for a year and just say I'll be better because I'm gonna be a year older you you're not gonna be much better right if any so we have to understand it's work skill and time and we have to understand the roles that those three things play in the the end result that we're chasing all right if you if you're lacking any of them you won't win and here's the other thing about aggressive patience that skill part of it you develop while you're being aggressively patient you see what I'm saying whereas if you were just patient that skill would not grow so show up every day execute effectively do that the next day do that the next day and understand that no matter how hard you work today and how hard you work tomorrow and how hard you work the third day it's still going to take time I love it that's aggressive patience in a nutshell I absolutely love it man well guys Andy that was three that was three guys all right we got CTI tomorrow remember go out this week be good be kind kick ass be a good example we'll see you tomorrow
