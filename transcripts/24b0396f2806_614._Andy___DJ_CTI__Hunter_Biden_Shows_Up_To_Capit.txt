It's a big deal. So don't be a hoe share the show All right, what's up? Well, it's going on not much. Yeah, so there is this I wanted to start off. There's this you we've been getting a lot of requests for this also The people are asking for your reaction on This new movie that's coming out. Don't know if you've seen the trailer for civil war civil war. Yeah, so this so a two four It's a big production company. They produced a lot of the horror movies and you know dramatic movies or whatever They're coming out with this new movie called civil war and supposed to release in spring of 2024 so Let let let let's get the people what they're asking for so so this new movie is released the first trailer for Alex Garland's new movie civil war political allegory that imagines a large scale insurrection in which 19 states have succeeded including something called the Florida Alliance Meanwhile a three-term president is trying to hold together what remains of the United States So we got a three-term president right now. Yeah, no shit currently. Okay. First of all, that's the first thing You guys don't get it But your buddy Barack Obama with his free fucking cell phones is one call in the shots right now anyway So we already have a three-term president secondly if I'm gonna be part of an alliance It should be the Florida Missouri Alliance Okay Because we're the same kind of people we just don't have ocean bias or allegors. Yeah, we got other shit Like like fucking cousins Okay, wait wait like fucking the cousins maybe depends Okay And also if we're gonna talk about this large scale insurrection, do they have weapons this time? Because if they don't I don't want to hear about it. It's not an insurrection. That's right. That's a fact Well, here's a trailer for those you guys you have not seen it United States Army ramps of activity white houses You warnings to the Western forces as well as the Florida Alliance The president or sure is the uprising will be dealt with swiftly. What we know if you want to try anything I think that's a way of this like a pretty huge civil war going on all across America We just try to stay out with what we see on the news seems like it's heard the bus Citizens of America the so-called Western forces of Texas and California Have suffered a very great defeat at the hands of the United States military Mr. President do you regret the use of airstrikes against American citizens? You're moving to DC today we need to go down there. They should generally on side in the capital every instinct And he says this is death blood Every time I survived the war zone. I thought I was sending a warning home Don't do that Here we are there's some kind of missile to stand in here. What? We're American, okay Okay, what kind of American are you? You don't know The Western forces will reach the White House on July 4th You're gonna head back I'm not hanging back one nation under God Indivisible with liberty and justice for hope Go go go God bless America Yeah, I call bullshit First of all if we have a real civil war, this is what it's gonna look like It's gonna look like all the fucking warrior class of Americans that people pretend like don't exist Okay, which there's millions and millions and millions of people are here with guns and supplies and training that are not really showing it right now Okay, and we've emboldened this very weak side of society the progressive left who show up at protests with trash can lids and fucking pool noodles and dress like fucking gay pirates of the Caribbean okay and They think they're gonna fucking fuck us up All right, so they're emboldening this fucking weak ass side of the society to believe that these guys have the control And the reality is all the real warriors are quiet under the surface and they're ready for shit Yeah, and so what this would actually look like as those people versus the little weak blue hair Trash can lid pool noodle fucks with the backing of the United States military that's completely compliant because they weeded out all the warriors over the COVID mandate that's what the fuck it would look like yeah, I mean So I got two thoughts on this man. So there's this other movie that just came out Called leave the world behind right? I saw that. I didn't realize that was made by it. Does this one by Livamas too? I mean listen, I don't know, but I do know this a You know, I think the left is highly highly highly underestimating Who the fuck is out here the the true issue that they're gonna have to deal with for sure You know, but but like dude, I look at this stuff, man And I've always thought this you know is that they use Hollywood Almost as like a vent Like oh this is what's gonna happen But let's put it off in movies so that way everybody writes it off as entertainment. Yeah, like But I was a predictive programming. Yeah, like this is them showing exactly what the play is and how and who they're gonna blame it on Yeah, and what's that gonna look like man? I Don't know I'm I don't think I'm gonna be donning red sunglasses though. I know that like come on Bro, it ain't gonna get to this anyway because they have no there's no support on the progressive left side It would basically be the American military versus the American people and I think that's not gonna happen Yeah, I don't see that either no like the the the left in the media the progressive left the media these corrupt people are Exposing themselves, dude the more they try to control the narrative the more the narrative becomes exposed and they're they have a Death grip on it right now, which means everybody can see it So they're all being exposed right now and there's no support for them in the real streets like there might be some people Who are out here who are like fuck, you know They're going about their daily life and you know they had they still are like well I'm a vulgar buying again or whatever right right but like dude the vast majority of people who are like Activated into what's going on understand what's going on and they're on the other side They're it's the common sense look dude the right in the middle and even part of the left is on the side of The opposite of what we got right now. Yeah, they recognize it's a big problem and whether it be Trump Or anybody else that comes along they're gonna vote for them because fucking And here's what's I think is gonna happen what I think is gonna happen is they're gonna try to They're gonna realize they can't first I think there's a there's a Kind of a drop-down of options That they could do I think first, you know, they're gonna try to get the election with a range where they can cheat Okay, if they can't do that and they start thinking they can't do that I think anything else is okay and on the table for them to do meaning a cyber attack or complete fucking Nuclear attack or some kind of pandemic or war or whatever whatever it is it's gonna be real bad It's gonna be worse than what it was in 2020 and people don't understand it The only way for us to be able to defeat it is non-compliance say what I fucking do in that Yeah, and unity bro. Yeah, and unity yeah people don't people I talked about this last night on my story and people like you know They don't get it like all these identity politics labels that they keep putting down on us, you know left right Democrat Republican black white fucking gay straight all this shit It's continuously propagated to us because they understand that the one thing they can't have is us getting together Noticing what these people actually been doing to us. So they're gonna They only know one way of operating and that way is that way so they're gonna continue Yeah, they're gonna continue to do this and when they realize that it's not going to work Because their asses are legitimately on the line bro We're gonna see some big problems and and the people are gonna need to come together and fucking not tolerate this shit Not allow it whatever they're planning on doing. Yeah, we gotta be stronger. Yeah You know, I saw a headline the other yesterday that said that Putin named Cloud Schwab a legitimate military target of what's going on in Ukraine, which is exactly what he should be No shit. Yeah, exactly what he should be Cloud Schwab and those people should be eliminated off the face of the fucking earth man. There should not be a world They're no one causing all of this 100% Yeah, damn, I didn't see that and we're a wide too. It's not just here in America. It's all these places The reason it's at a height here Look man People here are still buying into this idea that we live in this free country. It's the greatest place in the world to live It's fucking not okay statistically provably not at all all right And if you if you need evidence of it you can go down the list of all the data and these other countries versus all the data in our country Okay, education and all of that okay, we're not even at the fucker. We're not even close to the top on any of the shit Okay, and we're not free Okay, because if we can't even say things like look at our YouTube channel We can't even say certain things or they shut the traffic flow off. That is not free We we give more of our money to the government than we take home that is not free We have to reevaluate and redefine what we actually are to solve the problem It's like you know like when you're fucking fat You got to look in the mirror and be like fuck I'm fat before you ever do anything to fix it And so we into the Americans have to quit saying this lie that you know, oh, we fucking this is the greatest freeest Well, oh, bro fucking all these a lot of these migrants that are coming here are going back to where they came from because they're like holy shit Dude, this is fucking coming to shit You see what I'm saying Let's fucking stop with the lies. Let's stop with the delusions and let's start talking about what actions need to be taken to make What it is we all think this should be yeah, cuz that's the only fucking chance we got There's no going back to 2019 dude 2008 it's not we're not going back 2005 and you people who think that you're fucking delusional. It's not gonna happen We have to think about what changes need to be made now so that the country will take a form That we think is the ideal America moving forward and we have to coordinate and unify and realize who's trying to stop that Otherwise, we're gonna lose Yeah, I do my my predictions on this movie. I think it's gonna flop just like all the other fear based shit They've put out now people watch this you think so Hmm, I mean people are itching for something to happen. That's what people don't understand Like the fuck listen dude these blue head say fucking it. No, it ain't the way it's gonna happen No, yeah, and I'm sure that they paint this. I'm sure this is I'm sure this is at the end of the movie the fucking government wins, right? And they'll do you be right to rise and yeah, it's probably got a fucking trans drag queen president You know like come save It's fucking absurd. That's a fact man, man. They should hire us to produce it Dude listen man Here I've said this a million times The people propagating violence are the weakest people in society It's gonna be able to even handle it. Yes, the people who are out in the street calling for violence and saying violence violence violence With their fucking little outfits on and all black and scared to be on the TV and shit Their weakest fuck these are little fucking malnourished turds Okay, and there's a whole warrior class of men out here that have been very quiet and the reason they've been very quiet It's because they understand that they don't want to give away what the fuck they are thinking or what their position is ahead of time Surveillance state. I mean we yes possible to plan like there is a whole dude There's no fucking way Zero chance the United States military couldn't even defeat what's out here otherwise they'd already be trying to do it So but they know Huh, man, they know they'll know when it's right. Why do you think they're trying to take away the guns dude? Yep, they know And the other side knows when it's when it's time dude and these these these little weak malnourished turds fucks These people are in for a surprise dude Like people ain't gonna show up. You think of insurrection's a bunch of people that don't have any weapons or you fucking serious dude Are you fucking serious like like these people talk about January 6th? Oh my god There's a insurrection there were no guns Like they're so out of touch they can't even know what's what?

So with that being said man, let's get right into it headline number one headline number one reads Hunter Biden shows up to capital defies subpoena for house deposition rules for the not for me Yeah, yeah, so this is a daily wire article reading despite showing up to Capitol Hill on Wednesday Hunter Biden skipped a deposition with congressional investigators likely paving the way to contempt of congress proceedings that house Republicans have been threatening if he did not comply with the subpoena addressing reporters outside the US Capitol building Biden dared oversight chairman James Comer to allow him to appear for a public hearing instead to answer legitimate questions quote What are they afraid of? I'm here. I'm ready. He said here's a quick clip There is no fairness or decency and what these Republicans are doing They've not just revealed they have lied over and over about every aspect of my personal and professional life So much so that their lies have become the false facts believed by too many people No matter how many times it is debunked they continue to insist that my father support of Ukraine against Russia is the result of a non-existent bribe They displayed naked photos of me during an oversight hearing and they have taken the light of my dad's love The light of my dad's love for me and presented it as darkness They have no shame These same committee chairman have engaged in unprecedented political interference and what would have already been a five-year investigation of me yet Taking up your offer when you said We can bring these people in for depositions or committee hearings whichever they choose Well, I've chosen I am here to testify at a public hearing today to answer any of the committee's legitimate questions Republicans do not want An open process where Americans can see their tactics Expose their baseless inquiry or here what I have to say You mean what are they afraid of you mean How they hit 12,000 hours of video footage from January 6 You mean how they suppressed every data points on covid for three fucking years four years now still dossier You mean how they made up the steel dossier to fucking make Trump look like he was colluding with Russia when they couldn't win with a fucking miserable crusty old little cut Okay, like what the fuck bro? Do I wish I had that man what my dad's love Well, and then he comes on here and plays and then plays victim bro. What is that no like we haven't all seen your shit dude bro Like it's everywhere like what do you think you're doing you smoke you try to smoke Parmesan cheese bro Dude like you're selling paintings to people from fucking China dude Like wouldn't like Professionals career, but that's just this professional career. Did you see what Jim Jordan said about it? Oh Jim Jordan came out yesterday right after he said whatever he said and was like yeah Do you notice how the story keeps changing the story keeps changing because they said that at first there was no relation Uh that Joe Biden didn't know anything about the business dealings and now he's saying there was no financial involvement. Is that word play bro? I know dude these well listen because these people know that there's a whole bunch of people out here that do not do any Research outside of what they see on MSNBC or CNN nothing they don't look in anything so You know, I mean well here's some quick things. I mean these uh, so how speaker Mike Johnson How about this hold hold on Mike Johnson. Let's say this to Mike Johnson. Hey Mike Johnson Why don't you put some fucking get some congress uh to pass some shit about some protection at the southern border for us? That'd be nice. Yeah, that'd be nice You sit here and talk about all this good shit you're doing for America and all these things While we got millions of fucking criminals coming across our border See, that's the biggest problem because it's like they put this stuff up right like I mean, you know I'm sure you saw this the house votes the formalized impeachment inquiry And it's Joe Biden and that's that's great sounds great, right? But here's the problem like you can't do that and then at the same time pass a bill That continues the fucking surveillance on innocent American citizens You can't do it. Yeah, they can't they just did it You know, but I'm you know what I'm saying like so like you're trying to do this like oh we're doing such good things Like no the fuck we're not bro. We got Americans at a starving right now. Listen man. They don't care You know they're assuming they care. They don't care They don't care if they look like they're lying dude. This is the mask of communism coming off Everybody that's bitching and complaining and so you can't believe they're doing this like all these dumb ass conservative talking heads Well, okay, believe this is happening believe it and they don't care that you notice it They don't care So until people wake up and say well fuck if they don't care that we notice it We better step up and do something else Nothing's gonna change they don't care if you see it and the more you let them operate In this position where they can transparently tell you one thing and do another without holding them accountable The more comfortable they get doing it and they know you're not gonna do anything Do these people this is a fucking coup these people are illegitimate real talk All right, they're taking bribes to put ourselves into a very vulnerable position To be conquered physically financially. Yes morally. Yeah, it's the destruction of America intentionally That some people have chosen to sell out for financial gang and that is treason. Yeah, it's like even with this hunter Biden thing bro like I'm sorry like I subpoena Is this a peanut you violate the subpoena you get held in contempt Right like you they should have that shit fucking hot and ready off the press dude the shit that he's saying is all the shit They do every day they've been doing it for years. It's okay for them to do it But it's but when it's done to them It's a problem interrupting the love of your father Yeah, man, it's a clown dude guys tell us what you guys think on this topic Well, let's know down in the comment hashtag bro You're such a clown you had to spend fucking 700 grand of hookers like you couldn't even fuck a pick him up We were one of most famous dudes in the world like you should you're a go kill yourself bro You're a fucking failure real talk like you're a fucking failure dude You're embarrassing your fucking family you've embarrassed this fucking country You're a criminal your dad's a criminal and you guys should go fucking fuck yourselves Fucking think you can do whatever to fuck you want in this country and everybody's talking about how fray They are the Biden's fuck you guys. Yeah That's the attitude the entire country should have Who the fuck are you guys you guys think you could sell out this country and fucking ruin it? That needs to be the attitude. Yeah For your own financial gain and then you're gonna weaponize the DOJ against anybody who speaks up against you who the fuck are you You're a bunch of nobody's to spend 40 years and fucking in our government and did nothing but take People should be standing up to these people real talk and calling space.

They're gonna be nobody lead you guys The entire populace of this country should be extremely loud about all of this all the time All of it obnoxious whatever they do however they try to see this is why I think they're gonna shut down the grid dude Because what's gonna happen is the unity voice is gonna get so loud and people are gonna get so and then they're just gonna shut the whole thing down Because it's like flipping the game table over right like you know you're gonna lose and you're about to lose You're like fuck it and you flip the game over and that's what they're gonna do bro. Yeah, they have the ability to do it That's what that movie's about that Obama's put out Yeah, you better start thinking about what's gonna happen if that happens People better remember how to organize in person You you you old dogs out here who remember the life before the internet start thinking about how you would do that Because I believe that that's what they'll resort to if the pressure gets high enough. Yeah The real talk is if we had competent leaders in our military and people who actually stood by the oath That you take to be in the military about Defending our country against all enemies foreign and domestic This wouldn't be a problem that the citizenship would have to bear The police in the military would do their jobs and state of their oath. This would already be handled So a lot of you guys that are in that positions of leadership in those organizations You're failing your oath you're failing your obligation your promise of what the fuck you said you would do So sleep well at night knowing that you're the people that are allowing America to fucking fall after 50 fucking years of people who have sacrificed for it you people You know Guys that was the first headline. Let's get into our next segment of the show. We got cruz the comments But I thought it'd change it up a little bit today. Okay.

We'll get we'll get one in here But uh, we appreciate you guys. Appreciate our real last fans as always All right Let's keep the show moving guys. Let's get back into a headline number two headline number two Reats Oklahoma governor joins DeSantis bands using funds for DEI at all state agencies and universities Hell, that'll free up most of the budget. I should turn off it I should turn off it's a Republican governor of Oklahoma Kevin Stitt has issued an executive order banning state funds This is bigotry Yeah, one bigot Just wait to wait wait to the second half of this But uh, yeah, he saw he's banning state funds property or resources from being used by state agencies and institutions to support quote diversity equity and inclusion positions Departments activities procedures or programs that band will be implemented quote to the extent they grant preferential treatment based on one person's particular race color sex ethnicity or national origin over another's. The governor's office stated, Stit joins governor Rhonda Santos out of Florida who signed a bill last May that man floored as public colleges and universities from using funds for DEI programs. Quote in Oklahoma, we're going to encourage equal opportunity rather than promising equal outcomes. Stit said, encouraging our workforce economy and education systems to flourish means shifting focus away from exclusivity and discrimination and toward opportunity and merit. This is great. Because what they're talking about is stop discrimination. It's white people, which has been allowed for 30, 40 fucking years. And nobody's been able to talk about or say anything. Otherwise, you're a fucking racist. Okay. The racial double double standard in this country is absurd. It doesn't make sense. It's absurd. And I am the last person to put identity in my race. But like the fact that they've been able to do this for so fucking long is absurd. Bro, did you see a fucking Boston dude like they're having like a they had a the mayor of Boston. Yeah. Who is Asian descent. Okay. Sends out an email that says we're having a Christmas party and everybody can come except white people. Yeah. Color people only this is it. This is this is a literal holder of public office assuming it's okay to say something like this. Imagine if I were the mayor of St. Louis and I said, Hey, everybody can come to the party except black people. Yeah. Imagine what that would fucking be like. Imagine what that would sound like. Oh, bro. And people and bro, the cities would burn down. Okay. But white people have been conditioned to take this shit for the last 40 fucking years. And they say shit like, bro, just let it roll off your back. Who gives a fuck? Well, I don't really give a fuck either. But the problem is is that when it continues, it continues, it continues, it continues. We end up in a fucking corner and excluded from everything in society. And then punished for all kinds of shit we didn't fucking do. Okay. This this is not a country. Dangerous narrative. Bro, this is not a country that is determined by the color of the pigment of your skin or where the fuck you come from. This is who the fuck are you in your heart? Who are you in your brain? Who are you? This is a place for everybody that looks every different way has any different sexual preference. They want outside of fucking kids. Okay. And comes from all different places of the world. That's the point of America. And this is the culture. Yes. And this idea and dude, what's really cool about this is I'm seeing a lot of the black community wake up and recognize what's happening. Yep. And they're saying, dude, this is fucking wrong. And I really think that's cool. But dude, there's a chance to unify it on that point. Yeah. Because if you said this shit three years ago, it was like, you're white. Bro, how many how many fucking times was I called a white supremacist on the internet the last three years almost as much as I was exactly. No, they fucking know that's real shit. DJ, you're tap dancing. Yeah. Yeah. Remember when Duke came on and said you were tap dancing? You got my tap dance shoes on. Yeah. Fucking here. Listen, bro, this is not a country for any sort of racial exclusion in any way, shape, perform against anybody at any time for any fucking reason. Other than fucking with kids. And yeah, that's not racial though. But what I'm saying is, is that when you have a public office, the mayor of Boston, putting out an email and then she comes out and says, oh, it was a typo. It was a mistake. No, no, her apology was that it wasn't meant to be sent to everybody. Yeah. Like you're doubling. You're doubled down on that. Dude, listen, that person should be removed from office today. Bro, and why people got to start fucking speaking up for themselves? That's the thing. Like, I mean, I don't have that as a full story, but I looked into it. It's it's about half and half. It's like six six members are people of color and the six are white. Listen, discrimination against anybody for any reason. It's no, it's fucking evil shit. It doesn't matter who it's coming from. Yeah. It doesn't matter. And like the thing is is like, you know, we see it like dude, like for me as a white dude, I've been blamed for shit that I fucking never even did. Like I was never a part of it. My ancestors weren't even a part of it. My fucking family didn't come here until like 19 fucking 20. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? In fact, my first generation of people that came here, my fucking grandfather to my dad's dad was killed for this country. Okay. And I've been yelled at and screamed at my entire life about shit that happened in fucking 1860s. And before that, that's fucking bullshit. Maybe you're the reason my credit score is so low. Listen, dude, I'm not. Listen, that's why I don't care when people say shit to me because it's a fucking absurd statement. Yeah. It's an absurd statement. And by the way, if we want to go back, my ancestry goes to this little place in Italy. It's called Sicily. Do you know the history of Sicily? Sicily was conquered by Africans who were black. So I could sit here and say fucking, you know, all this shit about them. I don't like bro, it was a thousand years ago and give a shit. We're here now. Yeah. I agree with you, man. I'll tell you this, dude. I know who there is a company out here that needs to end their DEO because they just they're getting fucked. You see this one, former Facebook diversity manager pleads guilty to stealing more than four million dollars from the company. So you so wait. So you put these people in these positions and they just steal your shit. No comment. This is this is a comment for you. Let him have it DJ. I'm gonna plead to fit on here. Stop stealing shit. My fucking give you fucking job. You're the global manager. You fucking steal shit. Damn, man. Making us all look bad. I ain't never getting promoted. I'm not leaving laughing. No, I'm like, dude, this is it. I'm out the laugh. I'm white. It's insane. It's insane, man. But you know, I thought we would take a minute because like I said, I mean, you're all jokes aside real shit. But like, I mean, there is a common denominator here. Look, man. Listen, this, this, this is, look, you've got like five. Just saying I don't work. Okay, just so you know, I didn't make the show. Oh, I produce it. DJ produces the show. No, but before I wanted to like, I think, you know, for those who don't really understand or maybe have forgotten where DEI comes from, you know, like on a more serious note, outside of all the black people stealing shit, there is an actual pusher, bro. Like, I mean, you know, when you look at the mandates that a lot of these companies have, have had put in on, bro, I know. I know. I know I'm saying. I'm like, listen, there's a real, listen, man. There's a real push. It's not like one day, oh, that's, let's build DEI. Where did it come from somewhere? Listen, dude. Like, I feel this pressure on our company, right? Like for years and years and years, people have been like, you know, why don't you have this kind of person in this leadership position or this or that? Because I don't put people in leadership positions because I, who the fuck they happen to be born? And what part of category of identity politics they happen to be born? I like to win. So I put people who are good at what they do. In fact, not good, but are the best at what they do in those positions. It's called meritocracy. And this is a good thing because what we're seeing here is we're seeing other people recognize that this idea of inclusion means that other people are going to be excluded. Okay. So if we want real inclusion, meritocracy is real inclusion, which is who is the best? Because as far as I know, and by the way, this whole policy is racist by design. Because what it assumes is is that people who are not white cannot do the job as effectively as white people. So what happens is they have to be promoted into these positions to change culture, not based around their skill set. And the reality is, is it doesn't matter if they're Asian or Indian or black or white. If you put in the work and you get the skill set and you're the best, you should get the opportunity. It's gonna be undeniable. Yeah. I mean, you don't see fucking, you don't see the NFL or the NBA doing D.I. You know why? Because I lose fucking games. Everybody knows every white dude in the world knows this shit too. No one cares. They're like, fuck dude, these guys are better than us. I'm not gonna play this. I understand coach. Let's have the fucking Lakers put a five foot 10 white dude out there. Nobody's watching. No, they're gonna lose. No, man. Like bro, listen, we got to get back to common sense. This shit's absurd. Yeah. Let's let you know, she might as well go to jail. Good. Good. People who still should go to jail. You about to lose your job. This is still a great video. It's a time of this video, man. Yeah, man. I mean, she's gonna deal. How fucking stupid. She was, so she linked her PayPal, Venmo and cash. Of course, she's using fucking cash at that's the black person's thing. No, it's not. Yeah, this cash. That's black. Yeah, really? Yeah. I'm not saying it was made by black people. I don't use none of that shit. So I don't know. It's the predominant demographic there. Yeah, for sure. I don't buy anything myself. I got people to do that. They ain't a lie either. Yeah, I mean, listen, I get it. Four million fucking dollars, though, man. That's well, it's so crazy. Off to jail. You go. What do they say? What's that? What's that guy say? How's he say it straight to jail? Straight to jail. How's he say it? Say it? What did you say it? Straight to jail. Yeah. You're looking white jokes as a black person. Straight to jail. That's right. Barba furlough smiles. That's her name. So yeah. Yeah. Well, she's gonna be smiling too much longer. Yeah, guys, jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. Hashtag furlough got furloughed. See what I did there. Yeah, it's a good one. No star. Rob sick of the race shit. I'm so tired of hearing it. Yeah, most people are. Yeah, like it's so ridiculous. It's just important to still like you like it's just like what do you think, man? You got you got to call it out whenever you see that shit call it out for you. It is. It's bullshit. It is bullshit. All right. And they're gonna steal your fucking money. All right. That's our black horse, fun and DJ. Yeah. All right. Guys, keep this show moving. We got our third and final headline headline number three. That ain't even true, bro. I know some white trash mother fuckers that do the same shit you're talking about. Like the truth is the same criminal element exists in white communities. Pieces of shit are pieces of shit. Yes. Yes. No matter what black. Yeah, it's just called it's a poverty problem. That's correct. It's not a it's it's unless you're originally this call it like white crimes or white collar crimes or whatever. Yeah, but see rich people steal billions right. Bertie made off. Yeah, sure. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Four million dollars. Yeah, four million dollars is fucking legitimately a fucking vacation to Europe for them. Yeah. That's you know, man. Well, guys, let's get into our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads LeBron James sits during National Anthem. That's son. Bronnie's first NCAA game in WACP game. They bring his Malcolm X book. There's a Laker star. It's still on that first page. Yeah, I got you. Laker star, the Brian James has taken a beating on social media after he entered the gallon center at USC during the National Anthem and sat down while the song played before his son Bronnie's first game with the Trojans. Quote, quote, the 19 year old son of the NBA superstar made his debut for the Trojans on Sunday just months after suffering a terrifying cardiac arrest during practice noted whiskey riff. Quote, but it was LeBron's actions pregame that are drawing attention online. A video shows LeBron walking into the gallon center during the National Anthem ahead of the matchup between the Trojans and the Long Beach State 49ers. But instead of remaining standing, LeBron promptly takes his seat court side and remains seated during the anthem. Now, he has been getting slammed. Yeah, the beautiful thing is is by black people too. Well, okay. Yeah, so like this is one quote from a Vern Spicer. She tweeted this out as a black woman. This hurts my soul. LeBron should thank God every day for this great nation and this song that represents his freedom. Instead, he shits on us every chance he gets. So here's the video of it. Yeah, she sounded a little bit about to fuck up the National Anthem. But, uh, yeah. So, I mean, he's so here's that's the weird thing about it is LeBron James publicly supported the National Anthem Nielers during the height of the controversy. He even said that he stopped being a Dallas Cowboys fan due to the team's initial stance on the anthem. Nielie, quote, there was just a lot of things that were going on during when guys were kneeling and guys were having freedom of speech. James said at the time, I don't even think that was a complete sentence. But it continues to say, quote, they wanted to do it in a very peaceful manner. A lot of people in their front office and a lot of people that ran the organization was like, if you do that around here, then you will never play for this franchise again. And I just don't think that was appropriate. There's also been another infamous reaction. Do you think that's appropriate? What's up? Do you think if I own a sports team? Real shit. Yeah. And you guys were my executives. Okay. Okay. And we had a team. And I and one of the dudes kneeled and I came in and I said, go fuck it, fire that motherfucker. It's fire. Is that appropriate? Absolutely. I think it is too. Sure company. You do what you want. Not only that, like I think it's very disrespectful. Very. You know, my family personally has lost people to this. This cause, this country. A lot of other families, those people sitting in that stadium, I don't think that a lot of these athletes think about the perspective of the people who buy their shit. And what their families have potentially sacrificed for this country. I think I don't think they ever stopped to think about it. And while I can say I can agree, right? Like, okay, well, that's freedom of speech. I also agree that it's not appropriate freedom of speech. Just like we get censored every time we talk about certain things on our channel. So we can either have freedom of speech or not have freedom of speech. Not when it's convenient for you. Exactly. 100%. Yeah. But I'll say this. He's gotten a heated reaction from somebody. I'm not sure if you guys saw this at all, but this headline reads UFC star blast LeBron James amid national anthem drama. You're a coward. Let's just get into the video. Here's video. Yeah, where do I wonder what he really wanted to say? Where on the street is LeBron took the high road and just kept reading books. Yeah. Notice where he is in all the books. The first page. Every single time. Every single time. Mm-hmm. Bro, this guy's an actor. He's acting. This is a brand play for him. A bad actor. Let me pretend like, let me grow my beard and wear my glasses and look like I'm a political activist and read books around political activism and all this shit. But what he doesn't realize is that you're setting a very poor example, bro. This is why he probably in his mind, he's probably like why do people not like me? Yeah. And I know it bothers him because he talks about it sometimes. He talks about how people just don't like him like they like Jordan. Well, they like Jordan because Jordan didn't shove political rhetoric down their throat. Jordan won the bitch. Well, you look, man. I think my man here's making some pretty good points. You know, and I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. You know, I'm not a fucking, you know, I don't know. Like I like to give grace, dude. I think I look, here's the thing. Have you ever been to a sporting event and walked in when the national anthem was playing? Yeah. I have to. What'd you do? You stop. You stop exactly when you start hearing it. How much you hear it? Yeah. When you start hearing it, you stop. And by the way, if you weren't even walking the fucking dude to the seats, that's right. That's right. Yeah. So what if you're wearing hat, you take it off. The motherfucker off. Dude, it's about respect. And that's what makes this country what this country is is that people respect what this country is about. And when you're a leader like he is and we can say he's a leader or not. The motherfucker is a leader. He's got eyeballs and celebrity. And there are people following him. And when you set that example, dude, you're being destructive to people, other people's home that people have sacrificed real shit for. And like you're you're living a life that's 10 times better in every single way than all of them. And you're spitting their face. And I don't think he's like seeing it from that perspective. I think he sees it from, you know, like when I watch him come into the stadium, you know, it looks like he's got 17 people around him. You know, it's a it's a big ordeal for famous people to go in public like that, especially when you're laugh famous. Okay. There's a lot and you know this because you're an EP guy. Like it's a fucking operation to move people through crowds in a public place or he's not in a box. You see what I'm saying? Okay. So they're moving in. But like we're going and I can appreciate that. I can appreciate that's a big deal. But dude, just stop. Just stop and fucking pay some respect. He doesn't realize how much like better his public image would be if he just kind of like took it from somebody else perspective. And like even if you like I don't even see how he could agree, I don't think I don't see how he could hate this country the way that he appears to hate it. Because like look what it's provided for him. I don't think he does. I don't think he does. I think he I think he just panders and he has bad people in this corner that tells him the wrong things the fucking thing can say and do. You know, I mean like that's how I look at it. You know, I think the fucked up though the true messed up part about this story. And here's what the bra for this. Bro, this guy could be a hero. He could have been isn't he? No, no, no, he still could be. So could the rock. So could all these people. All these people who have deluded their public image can say yes, could save it by coming out and saying, you know what man? I fucked up. Yeah. And that one that's not right. And you know what? This is our country. This is what I believe in. And fuck the people who tell me otherwise. I don't care what it cost me. Bro, those if those two men came out and did that. Do you know, they would go down a history. It's more it's about it's not just being rich, dude. Yeah. It's not just being famous. It's about being historic. You know, and leaders in the position of leverage like like some of these guys are, you know, and their perception is getting tanked. It can very easily fix it by just saying, you know what? Now listen to these fucking people anymore. I'm going to do what the fuck I believe. I don't know what you guys think of the rock, but when I see the rock, I believe that he believes like we, we believe for the most part. You know, I think he's always been a guy who's appealed the patriotic Americans. I think he's a badass, dude. I mean, dude, you'll never find a bigger fan of his shit than me up until the political stuff really started where you know, you're, you're endorsing Biden and you're promoting the Pfizer shit and do that turned a lot of people off. And you know, I don't know. I don't know why that happened. I don't know if that's what he truly believes, but like these guys his images are suffering because of this and they have an opportunity to be real leaders and it's, it's frustrating watching them not do that. You know what I mean? That's not, not the thing is like dude LeBron. I'm not going to sit here and fucking say fuck LeBron James or fuck the rock. Like that's not what it's about. He's doing that enough to himself. Well listen, dude, I just think it's important. I just, I don't know. I wish he just has to get to his understanding. Like it's not that it's not about you, bro. I think I think these people are leaned on so hard and pressured so hard by outside circumstances that they have lost their authenticity of what they actually believe. And then maybe I'm wrong. Maybe they believe the shit they're doing, but it's not good for their careers clearly. No, that's what I'm saying. Like I think the real loser of this story, bro, is his son. Like think about being a son like this is your first fucking college game and all the attention that should have been, you know, at least focus Simmy on you, your dad fucking took it because he wants to be a domestic terrorist, the real kind. You know what I'm saying? I mean, I wouldn't, I don't know. Like, I mean, the guy's such a superstar, dude. Like he's going to get the attention no matter where he goes. Yeah, but like you don't make it worse. You don't make it better. First of all, you're late. You're walking in fucking late. I mean, look, it's just, to me, it's just a fucked up. I get it. I get it. And I don't disagree with what, uh, who was that coming to? I don't disagree with what he was saying either. I just, it's sad to see, dude. It's sad to see people who could make such a legendary impact on this country, like pass on the opportunity to do it. It's frustrating. Yeah. You know, and, and I think coming to his representative, his comments are representative of what most Americans feel like when they see that. Yeah, I think most people feel it slipping away, dude. And like the more they, the more it slips away, it's being pulled away. Yeah, the more, yes, the more they get fucking pissed at the people that who are contributing to it and not standing up. I mean, look, man, any of these people who are on the progressive left tell me one of them whose career has gotten better. Yeah. That's a fact. That's a fact, man. Okay, that should tell you something. What happened to Bud Light? What happened to fucking target? What happened to Disney? What, what, like, how are these people? You name it? Yes, CNN, the mainstream media as a whole. Like, how do these guys not see that they're standing on the wrong side of the fucking line? You know what I mean? And here's the problem. The longer they stand over there, the less likely they're going to be able to come back. And I think that window is really closing for people like this. And it's, you know, like, I don't think that like, let's say, let's say the whole trend of pro-America pro-freedom, America fuck yeah, starts to get full swing. And these dudes joining on that, I don't think they'll be welcomed into it. I think people are going to be like, dude, fuck you. Yeah, I think there's a window still for these guys to come around, but I think it's closing. And if I were like in their ears as their strategic advisor, I would be grabbing them by the ears being like, dude, you are fucking up. You are fucking up. Yeah, because anything after that window closes, it'll just be in Virginia and we viewed as in general. And I think we might be there with a lot of people. They're not there with me. I think there's so much, I think there's so much that we don't know in terms of like, because we don't know what it's like to be one of these guys, right? I think there's so much that we don't know in terms of the amount of pressure and the amount of leverage and the amount of threats and potentially like, you know, really bad shit that is leveraged onto these guys to do and push messages out. You know, I believe that that's what the Epstein thing was all about. And maybe not for these two dudes, but for a lot of other powerful people. And so we don't really know. We don't know. But I could say this, let's say someone broke that leverage and said, you know what, I'm standing for what the fuck is right no matter what and whatever it is came out about him. I would have a lot more grace for it. I'd be like, well, I can see why he didn't come out, but you had some fucking balls and we'll get in the past. Yeah, for sure. You know what I mean? For sure. I don't know, dude. It's it's really weird. It's really weird to watch. The lab, you know, I started with Colin Kaepernick, right? Like I used to like Kaepernick. Like I fucking liked them. In fact, we spoke a few times on the internet and DMs. And when that shit started up, dude, that like, it just fucked the country up, dude. Well, that's me honest. The only reason he Kaepernick did that was because he started sucking ass on the field. Well, I don't know. I don't know who knows. I don't know why people do these things. But like this is this is anti-American shit. And I don't think people are going to tolerate it for very much longer. And I think anybody that continues to propagate this anti-American shit is going to find their money and their career and their life and the shit. Yeah, absolutely, man. Guys, tell us what you guys think jumping on this conversation down in the comments, hashtag standup or leave. I don't know what you guys think. I mean, dude, I think right now, these dudes still have an opportunity to be heroic and like be real leaders. Like I like, dude, what if LeBron James came out in like a week and been like, fuck dude, they've been leveraging me, they've been telling me to do this. I fucking didn't know what to do because I've never been in this position before. But here's what I think and tells it or you know, anybody, any of these guys, dude, think what would happen. You know what I'm saying? But they seem to continue to go down the wrong paths. You know, like we see the rock at fucking at in Washington, D.C. with the establishment, you know, with Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. The guys that we all identify causing the problems in the world. Yeah, but everybody had that. Yeah, so it's difficult, man. It's like it's hard for me, dude, because I've been such a huge fan of this dude for so long. It's like sucks. Yeah, you know what I mean? Like it sucks, dude, it sucks. Like because like the guy has so much great shit to say and he's like built this. He is the American dream to me. You know what I mean? And like, I don't know, man, I wish I knew what was really like and take everything I say on this situation with the grain of salt because I don't fucking know. I just love it with the rockers for Halloween when you're not you did. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like he's an icon. You know what I'm saying? Like just me know what I'm cooking. We need some we need some people some some big time leaders to step up and like and I'm not saying Republican. I'm saying influencers. I'm not saying beer Republican. I'm not saying beef. I'm saying common sense, man. Yeah. I'm saying call for some unity. You know what I mean? Get people to understand they're being manipulated. Get people to understand that we're all the same, bro. We all have struggles. We all have hardships. We're all here trying to do our best and while we're all here trying to do our best, we have these people making it harder on us. Like, you know, we have to stop. We have to have some leaders besides me. I'm not big enough calling for that unity, bro, and to abandon identity politics and like start looking at people like human beings and stop arguing over shit that at the end of the day, doesn't fucking matter. Like we're having everything stripped away from us because we can't focus on who the real enemy is because they've got us all stirred up about things that legitimately in a real world, none of us give a fuck about it. You know what I'm saying? So like it's just it's it's just frustrating, dude. I think it's important for people to I think it's important for people to understand your voice matters and what you say matters and what you do matters and it doesn't matter if you're the rocker, if you're the brown or if you're fucking you, you know, it's important to stand for things right now and stand for the right things and not to get carried away with going too extreme to the side that you think is the opposite of what you believe is going on. You know, I see a lot of people, you know, and this is just speaking frankly, you know, I see a lot of people who are against the progressive left and now they've moved so far right that it's like, bro, I'm not with that either. You know what I'm saying? Like we have to we have to like not over correct. You know what I mean? Like like for example, dude, like Dana White signing with Bud Light, you know what I mean? Like he's getting blasted all over the internet and there's memes and shit and and and like dude, I can I can understand why I can understand why people are still upset about that because they never took accountability and they never said like, hey, this shouldn't have been done and we're not going to fucking do that. We're just sick to make and you know, beer and you know, cool, like we're going to be normal. You know what I'm saying? We're not going down this road anymore. No chicks or digs. Yeah, like we're not doing this weird shit and like if they were to come out and and say that, you know, that's one thing but they haven't. So I understand why people are pissed off, but like dude, also there's this whole other perspective which is this. The people who made those decisions are not the people that are being punished for those decisions. The people who made those decisions are causing people like our friends over here at Grey Eagle who are great human beings and they're they're patriots and they're pro-America and pro-freedom and these guys are beer distributors for a hands or bush and they're having to like, you know, their sales are dropping and they're they're having to lay people off and they're having to make adjustments and the people that are getting laid off are just a hardworking neighbor of yours who's trying to survive. Yeah, had nothing to do with that. Yeah, so it's like a very difficult situation and like how I read what Dana's doing, as I think Dana's a super fucking smart dude. I mean clearly he's very intelligent. Look what he's built. It's one of the he invented a sport and like probably what the is probably one of the most popular sports in the world now, you know, he markets it well. He's connected to every single celebrity on the planet. You know what I'm saying? Like this dude is not an idiot. He's a very very smart guy and what it appears to me when I see them signing with Bud Light as I see a twofold decision. I see a decision where he's going to get overpaid for for taking a chance to cook co-brand with a brand who's damaged themselves which is good business. And secondly, I think I really think this is what it is. I don't think it's money at all. I mean, Dana, why don't you need any money? Okay. What I think it is, dude, is I think he understands the importance of canceling cancel culture. I think he understands that we cannot just take the cancel culture that the right and the common sense of America has been at the on the receiving end of and now apply it over here from the other direction. We're in a hundred mile now. Yeah, because here's the thing, bro, we can never have a unified society. That's a weapon that was it strategically introduced to get people to fall in line. And in real America, that we all believe real America is, if we're honest with ourselves, there's room for differing opinions and different lifestyles and differences. And if we just take the weapon that they put on us for so long and start using it for every now, now look, I want to say this with the asterisk, there's there's times when it's appropriate. When grown men are dressing up as women and they are fucking shaking their dicks in front of kids, it's appropriate. And Bud Light supporting that, that's appropriate. But the point has been made in my opinion. And I would believe that I think the move that's actually been had here is you have a dude who understands we can't use a social weapon on the other side. At some point, it has to stop so we can have a reasonable society. And I do think Bud Light should take some accountability for what they did. And I think if they did, it would, their sales will come right back. Yeah, they did a classic step that made me they apologize without saying a word. You know, it's like they beat your ass like, you ready to eat. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like, and like, dude, they, you know, I think, I don't know, man, I think it's a very, like I don't like where it is where the cancel culture is on the on the right right now. Yeah. Like it's like, dude, if you cancel ourselves, bro, and the thing, dude, you see the side, listen, they don't work. We see we're the ones that work. We see that happening. Yeah. We see good patriotic Americans getting attacked because of one thing or another thing or another thing. And at some point, you know, people who have influence are going to have to stand up and be like, look, I'm not with cancel culture. Yeah. If you don't want to drink their fucking beer, don't fucking drink it. We got you. We're doing business. We got to check the records, bro. Huh? What, what, what does the record say of that person or of that company? What have they been doing for the last 200 fucking years? Okay. Well, what has AB been doing for the first time since they've been a very dude? Ah, has her bushes. The identity of this city that we live in. We're in St. Louis, Missouri. This is where it's from. Okay. Every fucking beer that you ever drink from Ah, has her bushes. St. Louis, Missouri on it. Okay. So I've probably, I'm a little biased. But to me, Ah, has her bushes and iconic American company, dude, and they've done a lot of shit. I mean, you think about like what they've done in disaster reliefs over and over and over and over and totally shutting down beer production and make water like dude. These are the, you know, the track record does have to count for something and like, this should and dude, I'm not sitting here advocating for them, but I'm saying there's a case to be made for us to consider that at some point we have to say, all right, this canceling shit has to stop. And the canceling shit is going to have to be stopped by people who are critical thinkers, but by not participating in it. And I personally putting myself in Dana White shoes. I think he's very fucking smart. He's very politically center and also aware. And that's how I see that move. And a lot of people aren't talking about that. You know, maybe I'm wrong. I don't know, but that's what it looks like to me. Yeah. I mean, and what point is it okay to drink a buttlight again? See, I was never a big fan of buttlight. So you say you were. Say I was. Okay. When is it okay to drink a buttlight again? I mean, shit, just go first. I think you just start out. I would say we're I listen, I think they learned the lesson. Like, I think they did the apology without apologizing. I think, yeah, I think they should still. I will also do. There's a viewpoint of this. Like, how long we gonna harp on it? Hold on, real shit. There's also, I just thought of this. You know, like, I've been canceled a hundred times. There ain't no fucking way I'm apologizing to anybody because I'm not fucking running my company at the bend and whim and will of fucking anybody else. So there's that too. Yeah. How do you cancel cancel culture? You start by not apologizing for shit, but I actually personally would like to see them take some accountability for that. That's my personal opinion. But I also, it's an actual fuck up. It requires. I understand both sides. You know, but I also understand if people never want to fucking do it again, because because we have had this cancel culture on coming on us for so long that like, people are just fucking done with it. And it, and it, I don't know, man, it's a hard topic and it sucks because real people are real like, like, common sense, hardworking Americans are the ones suffering because of it. So it's like, I don't know, man. Well, we learn, we learn, we know too that like our use of cancel culture has real fucking implications. Yeah. I'm saying so it's like, all right, cool. So, you know, we all boycott, but like it goes out of business. Okay, who's hiring all those tens of thousands of fucking employees of hardworking blue collar Americans who's hiring them? So date, I've seen the meme of Dana going around where he says, it says, if you're a patriotic America, you should be doing gallons of blood light, right? And everybody's fucking talking shit. But if you think about what I just said about canceling cancel culture, it's very patriotic. I'm saying, and when you think about what that company's done for this country, you know, yeah, they profit a lot. Yeah, they're people who own it rich, but I also happen to know the guys who used to own it and they're fucking good people. You know what I'm saying? These are just fucking people like, you know what I mean? Like, we got to get smarter as a culture and we have start moving towards what America is always supposed to have been, which is, you know, difference opinions, difference of culture, celebrating each other for differences, stop trying to push people's way of life on everybody else. I think what by light really fucked up is that, you know, they went with the trans shit, which is highly linked to the the kid shit. And that's where people are pissed. Yeah. You know, people don't look at trans people right now and not think that because it's been so overly infiltrated, the LGBT convinced me otherwise. Right. Yeah. Like most Americans are now correlating. This is why, and this is why it's important for people like the people who like Jamie who does gays against groomers, right? Gay people organizing and say, hey, that's not okay with us either. They're stopping that line. Yeah. Yeah. So like, you know, there's a lot of people, there's just a lot going on, man. And I think at the end of the day, we have to work towards unity. We have to work towards what America's supposed to be. And yes, there's things that we can't tolerate like fuck. And this is why Bud Light, I think, needs to address what they did because, you know, from their opinion, they're probably saying, oh, well, trans. Well, I think I don't think I think most people don't really give a fuck if people cross-dress and are quote unquote trans. It's it's the shit that trans is associated with, which is now the kid stuff, the inappropriate books and schools, the hormone, the hormones, the kids, the castration, the mutilation of kids, like all that stuff is now synonymous with trans, because regular people who, which have existed for thousands of years, who are trans, who dress up as the opposite sex, live their life as the opposite sex, have allowed these people to infiltrate their cause, you know, and you know, I don't think Bud Light really understands that that's how their customers see that issue, you know what I mean? It's not just an issue of people who, like, do people really give a fuck about, like, let's just say all that other stuff didn't exist, like the kids stuff, the hormones, the mutilation, the porn shit and kids books, you know, the drag queen story hour, dicks in their faces and shit, let's just say all that shit wasn't included and Bud Light would have sponsored Dylan Mulvaney a cross-dresser. Well, bro, that's been going on for fucking years and no one says shit. I mean, they probably would have still got a little bit of fun. Okay, they might get me a fun of a little bit, but like, do real talk. I wouldn't have been. No, fuck no, dude, they're tone deaf to what the issue actually stands for. You know, what's, RuPaul's been around for 50 fucking years, man. You know what I'm saying? Like, that's a, like, this is, there's always been this. It's, you trace it back to the earliest parts of civilization. There's always been segments of the population that have lived their life as the opposite gender. And, you know, when we start, what it's become is the problem, you know, hey, I'm, you're fucking demanding me to call you something that you're not or demanding me to pretend that men can have babies or demanding that my kids get this shit and doctorate on them at school. That's where the shit is gotten out of control. No one ever really had a fucking problem with it until it started getting jammed down everybody's throats. And that's usually coming right now from the normalization of pedophilia. That's the truth. Because all of the issues that are getting jammed down the throats, they're getting jammed down the throats. These aren't reasonable issues. No, we're talking about kids cutting off their penises, taking hormones, fucking reading sexually explicit books when they're when they're four years old, five years old. We're talking about, you know, people being pressured by doctors into taking, I mean, this is evil shit, dude. And it's already happened in history before people just don't realize it. This happened in 1930's Germany. It was called a Vimer Republic. Like, this is a real thing that has already happened. The first gender assignment surgeries happened right around that time. You know what I'm saying? Like we're not we're we're repeating the thing. Nothing new. Yes. Yeah. It's it's and I don't know, it's just anyway, that's how I see Dana's move. Yeah. I see it as him trying to stop and using his platform. I personally respect the fuck out of it. And I know people are going to disagree with me. That's okay. Because I feel like his I feel like what he's trying to do is stop the swing of canceling from happening. Yeah. That's how I see happening. He's not a fucking idiot, dude. Yeah. Yeah. That's real, man. Well, guys, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up or dumbest fuck. That's where we bring our headline in. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. And with that being said, our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads, it makes me sick. Luke Combs apologizes to fan sued for making merch bearing his likeness. This is an interesting interesting story, but it's cool. I'm going to ask somebody who has a personal brand. One is to get your thoughts on this too. So I mean, let's get into this story. So country star Luke Combs expressed his displeasure with a fan being sued for selling homemade drink tumblers with his face on them. A federal judge in Illinois ordered Florida based fan Nicole harness to pay the singer $250,000 for copyright infringement after she was accused of using the singer's likeness without his permission. Her case was part of a larger copyright infringement lawsuit. Per Tampa Bay's local NBC affiliate WFLA, harness has congestive heart failure and quote her only job is selling homemade tumblers and t-shirts through Amazon. The fan said she purchased the artwork online and sold 18 tumblers for $20 each, making a total of $380. Harness told WFLA she didn't find out about the $250,000 judgment until she wasn't able to withdraw money from her Amazon seller account, which had a balance of $5,500. Quote it was very stressful. I don't have money to pay my bills. Harness told about that. I just want this resolved. I didn't mean any harm to Luke Combs. I quit selling the tumbler. I pulled it down. I just don't understand. Now, Combs caught wind of it, found out about it, and he responded to it. So this is the video from the Combs. What's up guys? Luke here at 7.27am here in Tennessee. I woke up at 5am to use a restroom and the first thing I saw was this. A woman that's being sued by me for $250,000. I spent the last two hours trying to make this right, trying to figure out what's going on because I was completely and utterly unaware of this. So we reached out. Firstly, my manager reached out to this new station and ran this piece to try to get some info. So we do have a company that goes after folks, only supposedly large corporations operating internationally that make millions and millions of dollars, making counterfeit t-shirts, things of that nature, running legal businesses. And apparently, this woman Nicole has somehow gotten wrapped into that. And that makes me absolutely sick to my stomach. So I was able to get Nicole's phone number. I spoke to her this morning. She told me that, you know, she was absolutely shocked by this. I was so apologetic talking to her. It makes me sick, honestly, that this would happen, especially at the holidays. I can't imagine being in her shoes. She told me there's $5,500 locked up in her Amazon account. I'm going to double that and send her $11,000 today just so she doesn't have anything to worry about. She was never supposed to be involved in anything like this. No fans should ever have to be involved in anything like this. And she got in trouble, apparently, for making tumblers. So I'm going to make my own tumbler today. It's going to go up today. I'll keep you posted on that. But all that money is going to go to Nicole and her to try to help with her medical bills. Hopefully that can help her out. And again, this is unbelievable. I was completely shocked when I saw this this morning. It makes me sick. This is not something that I would ever do. This is not the kind of person I am. I'm not greedy in any way, shape or form. Money is the last thing on my mind. I promise you guys that. And I'm invited Nicole and her family out to a show this year so I could give her a hug and say sorry in that person. And yeah, I love you guys. I just wanted to clear that up because it makes me sick for anybody to be thinking that I'm this kind of person because I'm the lead, the for the thing from it. So I love you guys and I'll keep you posted. Yeah, man. So what we got on this. I mean, he seems like a pretty good dude. I won't say it. He sounds great. I mean, I know for a fact that he probably didn't know about that happening. But you know, there's more to that than this. And there are people out there that steal people's likenesses and try to make money. You know how many people have made 75 hard journals or 75 hard apps or little fucking tricks or like name shit, the same shit is my name and the scam people out of money. A lot happens all the time. And we have to fucking do things like that that has stopped them. Yeah. So, you know, while I can appreciate his grace on this, people have to understand that they, there's rules to this for a reason. To protect against certain things from happening. And I don't, I feel like he made the right call because I don't feel like she was doing it maliciously. Right. But at the same time, you know, legally, and this is probably what he's not realizing is legally because he came out and did that and said that he's actually weakening his own copyright and his own trademark because trademark is about enforcement. Right. And if you use the limit, hold on. If you don't legally enforce your marks or your brand and they can show a history of that, other people, your brand can be up for use by anybody. So, and he, him publicly doing this sort of puts them in a, in a difficult position later on for one of those companies, you know, that sells millions of dollars of fake merch. You see, look, man, I, I, that's really shit. Yeah, because dude, there's a lot of people that scam people and other people's names, dude, I have a habit of me all the time. See it all the time. All the time. You know, and it's malicious. It's not just innocent fan stuff. It's like, hey, I can, dude, I saw this with Hermosi, okay? Hermosi's fucking great friend of mine. And there was a company who used AI to create a video with his likeness to run ads of him saying, hey, buy my course or buy my shit here, which he doesn't even fucking do. He gets a shit away for free. And these guys are making all kinds of money because Alex has never sold anything before. So people assume that it's him when it's not him. And these, that you have to sue people and do shit to protect yourself against those things. They're, so I can understand both sides of it. Like, I understand why his team went after her, but I also understand why he feels the way he does because dude, a lot of times those people that do that, even to me, they don't realize like they're doing something illegal. They're like, yeah, and it's like, dude, like, you got to think you can't just make use other people's shit and make products and like make a business around it. Like there's that's, you know, there's a, here's what I'm saying. There's a difference between genuine mistake and malicious intent. And to me, this is genuine mistake. And he's doing real cool by it. So my only question is like, like, I said, I mean, like, I see your point, how you are going to count of that. So like, my question is like, yes, like, where do you draw the line? Like, okay, well, you know, $5,500 is fine. Okay. But it's $6,000 too much. Like, what point do you want to, like, do you enforce it? I don't know, man. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's a, it's a, it's a difficult situation. You know, I think, for me personally, I think it's about intent. Was this person just a fan? You know what I'm saying? That was trying to like support and do something and like get something out there. That happens to me a lot. Like a lot of, a lot of people who are fans of mine because I don't monetize my brand very much, they will take things and try to push them out. Like a couple guys try to do that with with this, right? And, and you know, we had to stop them because we have a business built around it, right? The parallel line that we've dropped and shit. So it's just, it's touching, man. I think it comes down to intent. I think it comes down to, is this person a genuine person who's just making a very silly beginner business mistake? Or is this person someone who is doing what they're doing to her? Right? Yeah. Right? Intentionally, intentionally trying to make money. I think that's, I think that matters a lot. Yeah, for sure. And, and, and dude, you know, I think what he's doing is far above and beyond what he, what he needs to do for that woman. And I think it speaks to his character. I think it's a really cool thing that he's doing that. He says he don't care about money, but he's got that prezzy on. That knee. That's right. Don't be bullshit me, bro. You better start saying you're like a whole lot of money. So you get more of it. Yeah, I'm a shit. By the way, it's good. It's not money till it is. Listen, motherfucker. It's hard to trust people that say they don't want money. Yeah. Like, to me, like when someone says that to me, when they say, it ain't about the money, or I don't care about the money. That's, to me, that's a red flag for a snake. You're about to get a fuck. You're about to get snaked. You're about to get snaked. Because if we were honest, the money's very important. We're important. That's why we do business because it money matters. Right. So like, I appreciate honesty there. When people don't give honesty and they say, I don't care about money, but they drive off in a fucking Bentley. You care about some, bro. That's right. Let's get the fuck out of here, man. Come on. Everybody cares about money. Let's not lie about it. That's that fucking fake humble shit that everybody buys into. I don't really care about the bullshit. Yeah. Okay. What the fuck are you doing here? Oh, well, if you don't care about the money, bro, I want someone that does. Right. I want to do business. Like, I want to do business with the motherfucker. Says I care a lot about the money. You know what I'm saying? That's that's for Q and AF. But that's the comes out on Monday. Yes. So why are we giving this story overall? I'd say it's thumbs up. Thumbs up. Yeah, because it's speed. I don't know much about Luke Holmes. I know like, I love his voice. I know everybody here loves him. Love him. And I'm sure he's a really good dude. And I think he's doing a good dude thing. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Absolutely. So, yep, I'd marry him. What? Hey, there's no judgment here, man. This is America. In my America, that's okay. I even know I'm a domestic extremist terrorist. Right. You're not still okay. Yeah. You want a sword fight? That's perfectly cool. Just don't sword fight my fucking kid. Guys, Andy, that's all I got. All right, guys. Hey, thanks to all you guys who share the show religiously. It means a lot. It makes a big difference. Things are getting better in my opinion. But we got a rough road ahead. So I'm going to keep doing it. And you guys keep sharing it. Don't be a hoe.
