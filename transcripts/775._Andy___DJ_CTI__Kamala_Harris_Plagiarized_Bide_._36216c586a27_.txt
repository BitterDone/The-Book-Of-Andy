Yeah, we know they built You know, they built the Eiffel Tower they built the Eiffel Tower. It was it was a you know tribute to boners Yep Yeah, I mean what else did they build they built everything you know what it you know here listen really the truth is It's not that they built everything. It's that white people didn't build anything They didn't do anything it really doesn't matter listen. It doesn't matter Everybody else built the key important point is that white people didn't do anything yeah lazy bro Yeah, they didn't build those beautiful cathedrals all through Europe You know, they didn't fucking Michelangelo. Yeah, I mean here. Yeah, yeah entrance and queer yes He was all the things you know, he was all the LGBTQ B He was the first POC You know definitely Was not a western white man those they have no culture Yeah, man. Yeah, we made a list We made another list we did we did really I just want to say I'm proud of of us I'm proud of you. I always knew you could do it Please please top spot the mr. Terri terrorism list now we're not the top yet We're still I mean we're in that one for sure. Yeah, this is another one. Oh This is Nancy. This is a dumbass of the day. Let's get into it Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi Suggest that 30% of Republicans are sexist racist and homophobic Mm-hmm. I mean That's actually low I mean, I'm surprised that she didn't say 100% that's what I'm saying man, you know because everywhere I go everybody I know is definitely racist and sexist and definitely homophobic for sure all of the phobics You know, they're always saying they want sandwiches and I am scared to death. Yeah Huh, I said I'm scared of gay people. I have a fear Well, you're homophobic because you don't want to have sex with gay people Yeah, I have nightmares sometimes. Yeah, they're gonna like little do they know your secret They wouldn't call you that they really knew you man look man I'm interested. It's a little funny how ever your your a phobic or a is for everything that you just don't want to do Yeah, like I'm gonna work out a phobic. Yeah, like You definitely in a sandwich phobic Oh, man, yeah, let's dive into this man So so ex-house speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested that 30% of GOP voters Will never back a democratic candidate because they are sexist racist or homophobic The California Dims eyebrow raising remark immediately drew comparisons to Hillary cutins Infamous basket of deplorables comments targeting Donald Trump supporters and Texas GOP Senator Mitt Romney's 47% comment about Barack Obama supporters quote who paid no income tax That might be factual I Check it. I'm not a hundred percent sure sounds about right Mitt Romney, will you remember that when he said 47% of Barack Obama supporters don't pay income tax? Well, I mean that makes sense because they want they want your shit. I mean You might have to fact check this is why this is why You should not be listen someone explain to me explain explain this to me Why should someone have a say in the direction of the country if they aren't Contributing to the country to the direction of the country. Yeah, no, no Yeah, you could have different opinions about where you want the country to go But if you're not paying tax, which is the piggy bank that we all pay into How can that person be allowed to have a say and where we go because their interest will always be themselves and To take from the people who are paying taxes and give to themselves. Yeah, and a new study just came out like today That showed that these illegal immigrants who come here from third world countries consume more tax dollars than the average person produces So how does that add up? So what happens? Well, then you got to print more money and when you print more money what happens to your money? Oh, it becomes less valuable So they steal from you to give to the like dude, it's such Fuckery. Yeah, you know what I mean? And the average person isn't educated enough to even understand it like bro They intentionally make our citizens stupid when it comes to financial Knowledge or financial intelligence so that they can do all these things and people won't notice You know, and then when you start to understand what they're actually doing dude. It's like I mean, it's it's worse than someone coming up to you and just stealing from you directly. Right You know, right right well because it's legal stealing is when they're setting it up to be meant It's like I think about it like this like this is the different analogy to look at it like we're in a boat Right, and we're like, oh, we're gonna go to this this destination, right? And we're rowing the boat and then this fucking dude gets up there's like, no, I we need to go here But that motherfucker ain't got an or in his hand. Yeah, like you're not even paddling. It's it's worse. Listen, dude. This is what it's really like You get paid just like in the old days You you stand at the end of the in the line you walk up at the end of the day and The boss hands you the money for the week, right like a hundred years ago You walk outside and the money the week and there was this piece of shit standing there Okay, who doesn't fucking do anything? They don't work. They don't they they cross crime They steal they they fucking do all kinds of bad shit for our community And then you got to take a percentage of your money and fucking just hand it to them and by the way that percentage is half of your money So imagine that that's what happens to all of you. You just don't think of it that way Yeah, how long how long until you know the people that are in that pay line get out of that pay line and go join the other line Well, that's the point because they want everybody to to join the group of Non-producers because that creates dependence on the government that is how you usher in a communist state. Yeah, man Yeah, she said um Back to this though she said quote there are people who will never be shall we say inclined to support Democrats because of They just have a different orientation towards women people of color LGBTQ, you know They just are not ever going to be there post you said during a Texas Tribune Festival interview Saturday While reflecting on why the 2024 presidential election is so tight. She says continue quote So that's about like 30% or something like that of the Republicans she said Um, so I thought that was interesting. Uh, did you see this survey that came out though um You know, polices suggesting that this other survey came out says uh survey suggests that 100% of progressive liberals are fucking faggot You see that would you make this? Ha ha ha ha Oh there it is Written by DJ in the New York Post. Yeah man, hey. Yeah Yeah new survey. Yeah, surveys this well It must be true if it's on the internet Just saying man, all I'm saying is this uh That's awful presumptuous of her to assume that all women gay people and people of any sort of color other than white are Democrats because everybody I talk to that may not be white or maybe gay or whatever else. They're voting for fucking Trump. Okay, and it's not racism or misogyny or anything. Here's what it is. You fucker suck. You steal our money. You're a bunch of rich elite fuck faces that nobody believes anymore. You lie to us about everything. You lie to these people about everything and your lies have caught up to you. And so people don't want to vote for you. That's it. It has nothing to do with women. It has nothing to do with people of color, whatever the fuck they want to call black Americans. It has to do with you and your shitty policies and people not being able to afford to fucking survive because you want to fucking flood the country with immigrants who cause crime and murder. You want to inflate the currency. You want to lock us down for two years. You want to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, we could go on and on and on. Fuck you suck. We don't like people that suck. So fuck off. That's pretty much it's not 30% either. It's like 100%. Yeah. And you know, if we're being honest, they're definition of misogyny and racism and whatever else, we call those jokes. You know what I'm saying? On our side of the fucking thing, we call those jokes. Comedy. Yes, right. We call that comedy. Hold tight. We don't actually sit behind closed doors and come up with plans on how to destroy black communities and then execute them. You know what I'm saying? Like we don't come up with a plan like, hey, we're going to go to the black communities and we're going to talk about all this shit we're going to do. And then when we don't do it, we're just going to say it's their fault. And we're going to go back again and they'll vote for us again. They don't do that or they don't say they don't do things like, you know, um, you know, we don't do things like, hey, let's figure out a way to get the black fathers out of the homes and get the black mothers dependent on the government. So we can ensure their vote forever. But let's not do, you know, or release all the criminals from jails, which increases the crime rate, defund the police and then make all the big businesses leave the area and then install government-run grocery stores. Yeah, see, see, we don't do that. No, like it's, it has, it has, it's crazy. Yeah, that doesn't have anything to do with racism or fucking misogyny dumbass. That has to do with you guys being pieces of shit, okay? And you're fucking plastic ass mannequin looking fucking stupid ass, crusty, dusty ass, fucking old nasty alcoholic ass. She shut the fuck up. And happy pussy. That's right. Fuck, I bet you smell her like you fucking smell seafood isle of fucking deer birds. Oh, they fresh. Yeah, that's right. They're friends. That's right. She, she don't smell like deer birds. Deerberg's got fucking fresh, freshest seafood in the world. She smells like the fishing doc. The bottom of it. Yeah, she looks like it too. I have a small argument to make. Okay. So she's saying that 30% of the Republican voters are sexist, racist and homophobic. So let's take a white guy who's Republican, who's straight, supposedly not racist. And let's ask what he thinks of Biden. He's also democratic. Yeah. So let's see how many people favor of Biden. Well, no, we hate him too, because we hate white people, because we were told our whole eyes of white people are the worst white devils. So we hate white people too. We don't even like ourselves, dude. So I was just hoping they're not racist. Yeah. Yeah, we are. Yeah. So maybe maybe she's right. Yeah, we're racist. The fuck are you doing here, by the way? I know. Yeah. I hate you. Oh, man. Guys, jump it on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments, which you guys think about our dumbass of the day. With that being said, let's get into our headlines. I remember if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You can find them all linked there. So with that being said, headline number one, headline number one, reads embarrassing. Kamala Harris plagiarized Joe Biden's campaign policies for website. Shocking. Shocking. Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign plagiarized policies from President Joe Biden's campaign website, copying and pasting onto its issues page Sunday. Seven weeks after Harris entered the presidential campaign. So as bright bar news noted, Harris finally posted a set of policies on Sunday. After weeks of criticism for not having one on their campaign website, the policies were published just 48 hours before the presidential campaigns first and likely only debate on Tuesday evening on ABC. But the new republic, a left-wing outlet reported Monday that several parts of the new policy section had simply been lifted from Biden's website, even including material that called for Biden's reelection. That's how fucking dumb these people are. More importantly, that's how dumb they think you guys are. That's what it is. They think you're, well, they know that they know that they know that their average voter is dumb. I'm sorry if you vote for them, you're a fucking moron. You're dumb. You, you don't allowable. Dude, that's what it is. You're malleable and easy to manipulate. Because you operate on fucking feelings and not facts. And dude, you think you know facts, but you don't know shit. You know what the fuck they tell you. And the thing and it's very provable, man, like you go to any one of these, and like listen, we, I was important to make the distinction when I'm talking about, you know, the good, hard at Democrats or some of these leftist progressive people. You go look at their fucking time on any of their social media. And you're going to see a paper bag floating in the fucking wind. That's what these people are. Yeah, you're going to see, you're going to see a black square. Then you're going to see pro COVID lockdown. Then you're going to see Ukraine flags. Then you're going to see vaccine. Then you're going to see Israel flags or Palestine flags. Like bro, what these people care about changes with the minute and, you know, like dude, look at when they, when they get interviewed on the street, dude, like how fucking uneducated their answers are. It's insane. And we're talking about the progressives. Like dude, they know that like their people are not going to get on there and read anything about policy because they don't care about policy. They care about identity politics. They're stuck on this idea that the first is what matters. The first black woman, this, the first gay, this, that is how you lose. That's how you fucking lose. If I was running a fucking football game and the football team was called the United States of America and we had to go out and play fucking China and we had to play all these other countries. And I put the first black woman out at quarterback and the first gay dude at Y receiver, fucking whatever. We're going to fucking lose. They'll be receiving it. And like I don't understand, I don't understand how people cannot grasp that concept. Yeah. Okay. Like we are a team. We are team America and we have to play the best players in the most important positions. And we don't get the luxury because things are so gray here like they were 10 years ago to celebrate, feel good, Dei type movements. Instead of just who's the best in out if the best happens to be a black woman. Fucking right, bro, put her in the game. If the best happens to be a gay dude, fuck yeah, put him in the game. That motherfucker can receive the football, right? You know what I'm saying? Like bro, we, we fucking, we, I don't care. We're winners, bro. We're trying to win. And this idea of I'm going to put this, I'm going to vote for her because she's a woman. I mean, dude, no. No, I think it's funny that like, I mean, the new Apollo dude, that's a left one, outly, even they call them a shut out. Um, and not just the, man, there's an interesting turn that's happened in a mainstream media anytime now. It comes to Kamala come queen Harris. Um, do you see this? Uh, even a CNN segment where Kamala Harris was exposed. It left the host stunned. She actually said she supports that. Let's dive into this a little bit. So CNN ran a segment exposing Kamala Harris, leaving host Aaron Burnett stunned. Kamala Harris finally in the dead of the night released a policy page on our campaign website dubbed a new way forward. Now Harris's policies are merely catch phrases. She absurdly claimed she will lower taxes and secure the border. But everything Kamala Harris has done over the last three and a half years while serving as vice president has destroyed the country, which is why she's trying to pivot closer to the center with her new campaign policies. However, a CNN K file investigation with Andrew Kazzowski exposed the real Kamala Harris and it left Aaron Burnett stunned. Andrew Kazzowski obtained a 2019 ACLU questionnaire filled out by then Senator Kamala Harris. And it confirmed she is a radical and anti American leftist. Let's check this clip out from CNN. Tonight Kamala Harris releasing details of her policy positions for the first time on her campaign website a K file investigation has uncovered meantime a 2019 questionnaire. And in this questionnaire Harris laid out some much more liberal stances among them on immigration. So in 2019 and what K file found she said she would cut funding to ice writing quote, our immigrant detention system is out of control. And I believe we must end the unfair incarceration of thousands of individuals, families and children. I was one of the first senators after president Trump was elected to advocate for a decrease in funding to ice. Well, now of course she's touting the Biden administration's executive order to crack down on the border. Hey, if I was Andrew Kazzinski joins me now. Andrew, that's pretty incredible on its own. When you're talking about what you found here on ice, what else did you find? Yeah. And this was a questionnaire that she filled out for the ACL ACLU. And this questionnaire is really an interesting snapshot in time of that 2019 Democratic primary. Kamala Harris was trying to get to the left of Bernie Sanders. She was trying to get to the left of Elizabeth Warren. And you really see that in a lot of these answers. And I want to walk our viewers through a little bit of what she said. Let's just take immigration and look at what she said here. She said on immigration she made this open ended pledge to end immigrant detention. She said she supported taxpayer funded gender transition surgeries for detained migrants. She actually said she wrote both wrote and answered in the affirmative when she was asked this. And she said she also supported it for federal prisoners. Now she also pledged to slash immigration detention by 50% close all family and private facilities and decrease funding for ice and then the end ending end ice detainers with local law enforcement. Yeah. So you have that now there is debate today at the time of recording to be tonight. Her and Donald Trump will be going head to head. Now there's some interesting debate rules that we'll be watching tonight. Obviously it's a 90 minute debate with two commercial breaks. The anchors are Lindsey Davis and David Muir are moderating. There's no audience. Okay. Only the moderators will be able to ask questions. The microphones will only be live for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. There's none of me no opening statements. Each candidate will get two minutes to answer each question with a two minute rebuttal. There's a one minute for a follow up and clarification or response. There was a coin flip that was done and Trump selected to give the last closing statement. Harris will be on the right side of your TV screens. There's going to be no props, no prewritten notes. Each candidate will have a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. And more importantly, campaign staff will not coach candidate during the commercial breaks. So that's an interesting setup. We'll see how it goes. It's interesting about the crowd thing. Like they can't afford to allow the public to see the crowd respawn. Because it'll blow their entire media narrative about how popular she is. Yeah. Elon Musk just did a poll worse like 70%. It was like eight million people or five million significant number of people. And it was like 70% Trump. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, because I mean, that's the what the true why and it was who else did that? Cuban did that. And it was 70% something. Correct. Yeah. Correct. Why is it? Why was why was the polls before Trump? You know, got shot at that Kamala Harris had 27% approval rate. That's almost 30. Okay. We'll call that 30. And why is it that all the polls that have been manufactured over the last 60 days have been, you know, Harris is right there with Trump. It's neck and neck. Yeah. You know, except when we run our actual polls on the internet, we're people and by by people like Cuban, who is a left. Okay. No one of their puppets. That's right. I, you know, unfortunately, you know, I've always enjoyed Mark Cuban. I respect him as an entrepreneur, but I think he's super off base with his political views. I think he's looking for big business and not caring about the middle class worker at all. That's my opinion. I don't know. And personally, I haven't talked to him, but he's a fucking leftist right now. And that poll came out 70, 30. Then then must does a poll 70, 30. So why are all the real polls of real people coming out 70, 30, which is reflective of the polls that were made before the assassination attempt? But then they're trying to feed us this line that Harris is neck and neck with Trump 49, 48 blah, blah, blah, bro, that's bullshit. And what they're going to try to do is they're going to try to create that perception as hard as they can up until the election to steal it. Right. They can get everybody to believe that, hey, well, it was a close election. Yes, it's not close. No, it's not close. It's very important that people know that it's not close. Yeah. But more importantly, dude, like people have to fucking vote. And it's super important, man, because on this topic, there was just this, this headline just came out today report more than 140,000 Wisconsinites can vote in the 2024 election without proving their identity by self identifying as indefinitely confined. A new report by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty reveals through the loophole voters can receive an absentee ballot indefinitely without ever showing an ID. The indefinitely confined exception has skyrocketed into wrestling enough since 2016 when approximately 66,000 voters registered under the status in 2020 and met the pandemic, 265,000 registered under the exemption. When cloaks and democratic strongholds encouraged voters to exploit the loophole to circumvent Wisconsin's voter ID requirements in 2020, a practice later rebuked unanimously by the Supreme Court. Joe Biden just reminded you guys defeated Donald Trump allegedly in that state by just 20,000 votes. All right, in a swing of around 48,000 votes to Democrats from the 2016 election when Trump carried the state. So in 2021, just by 20,000 votes. And now we have an additional 140,000 that require no ID. Now what have they been pumping into this country? Immigrant illegal immigrants. And who says voter ID's races, the left. And then now we have a state, a very important state mind you with more than 140,000 people that can vote in these elections without even proving their identity at all. Huh. You know, but it did it's it's crazy to me that people can support a party that is willing to blatantly cheat and go against what the Constitution of this country and what the majority of the people in this country want. You know what I'm saying? That's insane, dude. It's insane. And and and dude, what you know, they're doing this in Ohio too. They're pumping people in trying to flip that state through illegal votes. And dude, this is if you're not a citizen of this country, how the fuck can you vote in our election? It makes no sense. But it also why there's another report that just came out today to no surprise Republicans are more likely to trust Trump than official election results. By a whopping whopping number. And this was an AP norque USA facts poll that was done. Republicans Trump, trust Trump most on election outcomes to the tune of if you poll Republicans, almost 70% say they trust Trump over your local TV news, government certifications of elections, local newspaper, cable news, national TV networks, social media. I mean, all of them. And you poll Democrats and Democrats, almost at 75% are going to trust their local TV net news networks for their election results. You see the difference here. There's a much more stronger trust in propaganda, machine and mainstream media when you deal with those progressive left. So it's interesting. But the bottom line on my side, Andy, we people have to vote. We can't take shift for granted. Can't trust you. You get everybody you know to vote. Everybody because they're going to cheat. They are going to cheat hard. All right. They're all lining up. Didn't Trump say something about putting people in prison for life that cheat in the election? I'm not sure. Yeah. I thought you said you made a state. Dude, listen, I think it should be worse than that. I don't think it should be life in prison. I don't want to fucking pay. Bro, the fact that these people are willing to legitimately ruin the country, that's a revolution that's happening. It's a color revolution. And just because they're not running in with guns and this and that doesn't mean they're not attacking our country. Bro, the fact that they put her in as the Democrat candidate with zero votes and 27% approval rating thing in that they can get her to win. Think about that. Like that alone is a threat to our democracy. Think about that. They she was 27% approval rating. And they they decided that they would have a better chance with her winning than Biden winning because they thought they could pump her up close enough to cover the gap. The fact about Biden's waiting the fact that the fact that these people that it's no like think about this. The fact that it's normalized that there is a gap that these people cheat with is absurd. It's absurd. And that like do when you look at Kamala's face and all these Democrats face and these people have no problem stealing our country from us legitimately. Like what's what they want. They want to stay in power. They want to keep their jobs. They want to they don't care that the people are suffering. They don't care that the people are, you know, having trouble paying their bills or getting by. They don't care about the crime that's happening with these migrants. They don't care. All they care about is themselves. And I'm going to tell you something. If that debate goes real bad for them tonight, which I sure it will. We're going to see a big black swan event. We're going to see some sort of massive 9-11 world changing type event between now and the election because that's going to be their last hope. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said. Andy, let's go cruise some of these. Got some cool things for you guys today. Let's go cruise the comments. This first one comes from Joe, Joe Bell. Dojo, Joe, Joe Bell. 00. He says, damn. I almost wish Trump would win just so this dude will shut the fuck up. That's pretty good. It's time to be with mine, man. Hey, whatever it takes. You're still watching, though, aren't you? Yeah. Look at this profile. That guy is in his basement right now, a bunch in a fucking hot pocket that his mom made for him while he typed that. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Thomas, too hot. I told you 45 seconds. It's not a minute. 45 seconds, mom. Gosh. This is the same guy that's like, huh? That guy, no, he's not over got a toast. No, he's all the toast. No, that guy's no. That guy is, you know what? I promised I was going to be nice today. He might vote for Trump. You know what? Welcome to the team. Yeah. But here's the problem. I won't shut the fuck up. Yeah, I love it. That's the problem. I love it. This last comment quickly, this last comment comes from Bo Thompson 8413. He says, when Andy is president in 2028, will we get really F episodes from the Oval Office? Yes. Bro, that'd be badass. Yeah. Yeah. That's so badass. That's going to be our pipeline of the people. Bro, that'd be fucking sick. Yeah. And not like the fake Oval Office that they use. No, the real one. Like the out the resolute desk. Yeah. That'd be fucking sick though. Yeah. Let me say it. Yep. I'm excited. It's going to be. Yeah. Guys, we appreciate you for being real as fans.

Let me tell you, let's keep the screws moving. Got on number two. Hello, number two reads, Springfield Ohio residents say Haitian migrants crashing cars, spiking insurance, eating ducks from parks. This is interesting. All right. Let's dive into this. So the government's delivery of roughly 20,000 migrants to Springfield Ohio has been a boon for real estate, local employers, auto salesmen, merchants, and the migrants. But also an unwanted shock to locals as they try to manage their own community. The damage was displayed at the August 27th City Commission meeting where voters present their concerns about the migrants. Quote, maybe we should open up at Go Cart Land again so that people can have a chance to learn how to drive without being on these public streets, long time resident Jeffrey Allen, to the mayor and four other commissioners. Quote, I really challenge you guys to get out here and do something, Anthony Harris, who describes himself as a local YouTube influencer. Hey, that's us. Told the council. Quote, these Haitians are running into trash cans. They're running into buildings. They're flipping cars in the middle of the street. I hate the traffic concerns that you all see. Mayor Rapsu said later in the meeting. And it's interesting, dude, because one thing specifically has been this note about ducks and cats being hunted and killed by these Haitian legal migrants. And the most interesting thing happened. My ducks will kill them because I raised battle ducks. Yeah, my ducks are battle ducks. They're born and bred for action. I teach them aquatic survival. Yeah, every single day. I teach them how to march. I teach them how to bite and attack. They go right for the balls. Mm-hmm. Might like. Yeah, that's it, bro. You don't fuck with my ducks. My ducks will eat you, bro. They are big too, bro. I teach them to go straight after the Haitians. They're a bunch of little racist ducks. I was wondering why they always got weird around me. Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, you know, it is what there's some there's some collateral damage there, bro. I'll chase me and Blake, man. I just. But the end of the most. I was wondering why Blake's headway from there. But the most interesting thing happened, man. So, you know, there was all of these, you know, the city council, some government officials locally, they all got on this narrative that there is no such thing happening that ducks are not being the capitated. There's pictures of it. No, Andy. No, that's that's Russian disinformation. Oh, must be AI. That's not happening. Okay. Okay, ducks are not being the capitated and killed and hunted and cats are not being, you know, hung up and carved by trees. Dressed in the front yard of it's not happening. Okay, and we know it's true because our city officials told us so. But the problem. There's literally pictures. There's videos of these things happening. So, who do we believe? Well, you don't believe your eyes. Definitely don't believe your eyes. Don't believe your eyes. Yeah, don't do it. But thankfully Elon Musk dropped some truth bombs with an epic tweet about Haiti cannibal gang after billionaire Vinod Kostla. Tried to deny shocking report on Haitians eating cat in Ohio. Elon Musk has once again made waves with hard hitting tweets in response to a recent controversy brewing in spring for Ohio. The issue allegations that Haitian immigrants overwhelmed by the border crisis have been engaging in disturbing acts of animal cruelty, including the consumption of pets and wildlife in the area. Billion Evernod Kostla, founder of Kostla Ventures, attempted to dismiss these troubling reports that recently surfaced, but Musk fired back with explosive comments. As reported by the Gateway Pundit, outrage citizens in spring for Ohio confronts at their city officials during a recent city commission meeting, accusing them of turning a blind eye to disturbing crimes alleging allegedly being committed by Haitian migrants in their town. Testimonies from local residents were shocking with one individual claiming to have witness tations grabbing up ducks by their necks, decapitating them and walking off with them to eat. So Vinod, he posted this with that same trigger word that they all have been using. Weird, JD Vance repeats baseless claim Haitian immigrants are eating pets as Ohio officials say there is no evidence. There's no evidence of that. Well Elon Musk responded with a body cam clip from officers in spring for Ohio who was called. To this apartment complex, let's just watch the clip and let's check out this baseless claim of no evidence. What did you do? Why did you kill the cat? Smile for me. Smile, what did you do? I thought like this. Did you eat that cat? Did you eat it? Now why did you kill it? Did you guys see all this? No, we put up and she was just laying there with me. She's here eating it. She was eating it. Can you call the main society see if they'll come pick this cat up? It's deceased. Nice list claims. Yeah, no, no, they're all lying. Listen, here's what it is. Those black people who they just asked if another black person was eating the cat they were lying because they're racist. Black on black lives. Black on black racism, which we know is a real thing because DJ. I'm the king of it. I'm the uncle of it. You know what I'm saying? Hey, well, here's the most interesting thing. I mean, it's kind of beautiful actually. It's not beautiful. Listen, obviously ducks and cats. I mean, well, I'll draw the line of ducks cats. But it's fucked up. It's disgusting shit. Okay. You would eat a cat. Yeah. It must be the Haitian in here. I eat cat all the time. Ah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But the most interesting thing is so fry me on me all right there. I'm just saying. Yeah. How do you know? You don't. How do you know? Yeah. But there's been a shit ton of memes coming out about this shit that I think is just fucking beautiful. Epic memes emerge online following reports of cat and bird eating Haitian immigrants in Ohio causing liberals to lose their minds. And so there's been a bunch of shit ton actually. Even the House Judiciary Committee for the GOP, they posted this on Twitter saying protect our ducks and kittens in Ohio. To which to which Democrats are losing their fucking minds because of this picture right here. Why? Well, I'll show you why here's Eric Swalwell, Swalor of Chinese spies. Here is his reaction to this tweet that he calls out and opens it. What in the hell is this? The chairman tweets protect our ducks and kittens in Ohio because he goes some down goes down some crazy rabbit hole completely debunked that aliens are eating pets. I'll be caught in the alien. My God. Are you okay, Mr. Chairman? Because last year for a very long time you tweeted and promoted Kanye West as he was calling for genocide against the Jews and you kept it up. And now when we have victims coming here, you're tweeting this nonsense. Oh, my God. So do you know why you would do this? I hope you're okay. I don't know if the aliens who are eating your ducks are in the room with us right now. But Mr. Chairman, this is a serious issue. These people have loved ones who have been lost and you tweeted this. That was the faked shit I've ever seen in my life. Like go to acting class, bro, if you're going to fucking act. I'm just acting. Bro. Are you okay? I hope you're okay. Are the aliens in the room with you now? No, they're in Ohio eating a fucking duck. That's whole. Yeah. Yeah. No shit. But there's been a bunch of these that have come out AI for the kind of win. I guess on this check this out. Save the cats vote for Trump. There's another one here. Maga cats fight fight. That's pretty funny. Oh, there's another one. Not to worry. FBI is handling it. They arrest the cats. Oh, yeah. You know what it is? The cats are racist for not letting themselves get eaten. That's what it is. Yeah, bro. They're they're they're they're they're racist against the Haitians. Bro and their their massaging is too. Yeah, because they won't make themselves into a sandwich. I like this one. Massacre. Make America's cats safe again. Oh, man, they didn't do Trump very very solid there. But I put an extra 30 on them. Do you see what's chasing them? Hey, listen, these fucking people don't belong here. No, they don't. Yeah. And they need to go back where the fuck they came from. Yeah, they do. But don't believe your eyes, folks. Yeah, yeah. And by the way, this is what you get when you you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. And you try to pretend like everybody's this good-hearted, normal human being who is just like you. And they just want they just want what you have. And they want to be safe in this and that and this. Okay. Well, is it worth your safety? Is it worth your ability to provide for your family? Are you going to give up all your comfort for these people? Because I can respect that if you're one of those people with the problem is none of these people are those people, right? They all voted for this ship because AOC went down and fucking pretended like there was a bunch of stuff going on at the border. They called it racist. These people are so insecure about being racist that they'll support anything that says it's not racist. You understand what I'm saying? These people are so afraid of being called racist because secretly they are. They secretly believe that people that aren't white or aren't like them are low IQ dumb motherfuckers. And they don't want to expose themselves. So any anti-racist narrative, even if it hurts them, they will support. And so they made up this fake racist narrative about the border, which bro, why do we have borders anywhere then? If it, you know, like this is a country, this is our country, we pay for this country. You got fence on your house. Correct. That's right. And these people have cornered themselves now because now it's admit that you caused a problem and solve it or give up your comfort and give up your safety and give up your ability to survive to prove that you are not a racist human being. So they're in a corner. And that's the crazy. Like how do you defend? How do you defend this? If you're then, well, that's my, that's my thing. It's like, you know, this, this, this one person who quoted, maybe we should open up go cart land again so they can learn. No, maybe we should gather them up and get them to fuck out. That's right. How about that? Yeah. But yeah, you want to spend more tax dollars so that we could teach them how to fucking drive on a go like that, your solution, a go cart track. How about we go cart their ass the fuck out of this country? That's right. I mean, like do the makes no like listen, if you have you have everybody has a listen, this Jeffrey Allen is that the guy the video with the guy, the different guy. Okay. You know, but like it makes like to me, it's no different. Like you have a house. You have a front door on your house. You have a lock on your front door. You have a system. Why do you have a lock on your front door to keep people out of your house? What are you racist? Well, no, I mean, I just want to be safe. What do you? What do you? You don't want? Yeah, you don't want people to come in your house. Like it's so funny, dude, how these people who vote for this shit because. It's like karma really like we're at a point now where you know the people who vote Democrat are either very, very, very low income people in the inner cities or their upper middle class white voters or they are elite billionaire white voters. The elite billionaire white voters don't give a fuck because they're never going to touch them. Right. And that's the problem I have with it. Okay, but here's the here's the thing. It's karma, dude, because the inner city black. Community who have voted for this shit just because someone screamed racism without digging into it or now having to deal with these people in their neighborhood. They don't like it. Okay. And then the upper middle class white women are starting to get harassed and they're starting to have things happen to them. And they're starting to realize, oh shit, this is a problem because they voted for it. Right. So until it touches people until it affects their lives. They are all idealistic and they're all about it. But all these people are liars and frauds because if they really stood for what they voted for and what they say they stood for, they'd welcome these people into their homes, which they are not doing. Well, I forget the guy the guy's name, but he like did a street interview goes on the street. Yeah, he would answer people and I was like, hey, are you for or against immigration? Oh, I'm definitely for like, okay, well, how many people can you house? Yeah. Oh, no, I can't house anybody. I'm right. No, don't change it. And like that's my only issue with this. Like, yeah, it definitely is karma, but here's the problem. Like, I'm having to suffer for your karma. Yeah. And maybe not today, but it's fucking coming. Yeah, it's coming. And like the problem is if it was just them that had to deal with that karma. Okay, cool. The problem is is that the shit is not just going to stop in the inner cities. No, it's not just going to stop in the world. It's not just going to stop and fucking L pass. So it's going to expand and fucking ripple out over the entire fucking country. Yeah. Yeah. And these people are in for a rude awakening because they think they're going to be able to go out in their front yard and negotiate with these people. These people will break in your house and take your shit and rape your daughter is not going to fucks about it. I am the cop. You don't fucking get it. And due to a lot of these people, they're going to have to learn the hard way. And we're going to have to get back to we are Americans and they are not. Doesn't matter if you're black, white, left, right, straight gay, whatever, we are Americans. They are not. This is for Americans. This is not for them. Their country is called this. It's Haiti or it's over in Africa or it's in South America or it's in fucking Asia. And they got a country. Okay, this isn't the mother fucking homeless shelter for everybody's fucking shit bags. Sorry. Who do you know how do you know the shit bags? Well, why don't their own countries want them? Right. It's very simple. It's very simple. You know, for anybody that's pro immigration, if they somehow listen to this show tonight, when you guys go to sleep, I want you to leave your front door, your back door, and your windows, why the fuck open? Why open? Leave them open. Oh, no, I wouldn't do that. Why would it now? Why the fuck will we leave our border like that? Do listen, these people are liars. They're, they're, they're ideal, they're ideological liars. They, they, it's like when Aaron Elmore was on the show, when we were talking to her and she said they're trying to outliberal each other. I've heard to each other. That's what they're doing. They're trying to outvert you signal each other. And they will, they're the biggest liars in the country because they will not do any of the shit that they vote for. They, you're not housing these people. You're not feeding them your cat and I leave your doors open. Yeah, like bro, you guys are liars and you need to quit voting for this shit because now it's going to fuck up your shit. Do you remember like three, it was probably three years ago, four years ago, when I was saying, hey, look what's going on in Europe. You're going to want these people are going to come in here and they're going to rape your daughters and they're going to fucking rape you and they're going to, how many fucking rapes have we heard of? How many murders have we heard of? I told you this too many listen bro, I told people what was going to happen and now it's happening much like almost everything we've said on the show. Like dude, I don't fucking miss guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments, which you guys think about this. That being said, let's get to our third and final headline headline number three. I got tired of telling people all the shit, bro, like and it happening and like I told you this last night, like I, we recorded a whole show yesterday and we didn't air it because I got so pissed off because like dude, I feel like I have to come on here every day and just be like, I fucking told you this already. I told you this already, I told you this already, like it's so frustrating for me to be and you to be able to see what the fuck is going on. Tell people what's going on and then have them sit there and wafer it to happen until they're like, oh you fucking right. At what point in time are we going to start being like damn alright, well that makes a lot of sense we should fucking do something about that. You know, it's because people keep waiting for someone to ride in and lead them when they are the leader, like you are the leader bro, it's you. You see what's going on, you think that I'm going to come in and say I'm not coming to your fucking neighborhood to save you shit, you understand what's going on, you're choosing to stay quiet. You see what I'm saying, we have in it, we have, we have people that could lead, but they won't lead because they think someone else is leading. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, they're waiting on it. What do you want somebody to do, you want somebody to ride into your neighborhood and fix all your shit for you? Of course you do. That's how it works. That's why we're here. Yeah, that is why we're fucking here, man. Guys, let's get to our third and final headline, headline number three. I had them three reads Georgia school got even earlier warning about Colt Gray before deadly shooting mom says. Let's go into this. The mother of Georgia school shooting suspect Colt Gray claimed that teachers had noticed her son was making references to violence at the school, even before she called to warn administrators about them. Quote, the counselor said, I wanted to let you know that earlier this morning one of Colt's teachers had sent me an email saying Colt had been making references to school shootings. Marcy Gray told ABC News in a video interview from home. Authorities said Colt Gray opened fire about 30 minutes after his mother's warnings. The school said resource officers tried to track down Colt but stopped a different student instead. Now speaking of the two students and two teachers killed in the massacre, Marcy Gray told the network during the emotional interview. If I could have taken their place, I would, I would in a heartbeat. Between my gut feelings, the text messages, now the Z email, you need to like run to the classroom. She said, that's what she told the school. 30 minutes before he started shooting 30 minutes before. And so another update in the situation, Georgia, Georgia school shooting suspect Colt Gray's dad called him a sissy and bought him an AR 15 to toughen him up relative say the father of accused Georgia school shooter Colt Gray believed that his 14 year old son was too gentle and bought him the AR 15 style rifle in an attempt to quote toughen him up a relative claims. Colin Gray gave his troubled son the assault rifle for Christmas, the weapon that Colt ended up using in last Wednesday's blood bath at Appalachia High School that left two teens and two teachers dead authorities have said. But it was the way Colin spoke to his son that raised the eyebrows of concerned family members. Colt named to his face says a relative of Colt's mother Marcy quote names that no boy wants to hear sissy pussy bitch just names that were meant to break him down and emasculate him. Relative at it quote Colin always thought that Colt was too gentle and tender. That's why I believe he gave him the rifle. Now with all that being said another report comes out now almost a week after that incident that the Georgia gunman Colt Gray was ridiculed and called gay by bullies at the school details continue to flood in about the trouble life of Colt Gray the 14 year old accused of killing four of his teachers and classmates and a mass shooting at Georgia high school on Wednesday. The teens dad 54 year old Colin Gray told officers in an interview last year that his son was often picked on by bullies who touch him pinch him and taunt him quote Colt's gay his father said they would call out the elder grays interview with police came just after his son threatened to shoot up his middle school last year and a post shared on the messaging app discord quote he's going to a lot as dad said to a deputy at the time according to a police transcript obtained by the daily beast. He just wants us to have a simple life was very difficult for him to go to school and not get picked on the teens dad said Colt bullies quote riddle cool riddle killed him day after day the father at it I worry about him in school and you know what would ever happen Colt Gray will be prosecuted as an adult faces four counts of felony murder with additional charges still pending. Colt Gray the father has been charged and arrested with involuntary months lighter two counts of second degree murder and eight counts of cruelty to children which could send him away for as long as 180 years on the Georgia law. Andy what do we got on all this you know I don't know it sounds like he had a shitty dad lots of people have shitty dads lots of people have dads to do fucked up shit lots of people have stepped ads to do fucked up shit call him names and fucking threat them and bullion. Bullium and you know I mean this is this is not I'm you know I'm unfortunately you know this is not rare. There's lots of shitty people to shouldn't have kids and you know I can I can empathize with that. But those a lot of those most of those people don't go shoot other people or shoot up schools or kill innocent people and all this and like you know this kid deserves the fucking wood chaper bro like he just does he fucking kill. For innocent people I don't really give a fuck why he did it or what happened to him or who called names I don't care there's been all kinds of things that happen to me I could fucking in fact I need to talk about a lot of the shit that's happened to me because I don't want to sound like a fucking bitch okay we could go down the roster of everybody in this building there's 400 people here. And we could ask them about all the shit is shit that they've had and we have a long list of shitty shit that's happened to them and a lot of it will come from parents okay still doesn't excuse what he did I you know it's not the fathers quote unquote fault you know the kid fucking snapped and fucking it is what it is you know now should the father be held accountable I don't know maybe I don't know what the fuck he did but at the end of the day bro we live in a country where. People are responsible for their individual actions and it shouldn't matter why you know we talk so much about why things happen we talk so you know we we empathize with criminals and we give them excuses and we make outs and we talk about the trauma and we talk about what about the trauma of all those families it just lost for innocent people because this kid was a fucking douchebag what about their trauma what yeah no shit what about the fact that you know for families are pretty much ruined because we are not going to be a fucking bitch. Because of what this this kid did like and we have all these people trying to drum up sympathy for this kid this kids a piece of shit and sorry to like I don't believe listen I'm not one of these idealistic people like I don't believe in people that are bad people like I don't look at people and say oh well I'm sure they could be a good person I don't do that like I look at people for what the fuck they are that's a bad kid and that's a bad parent and you know whatever needs to happen happen like dude real talk in my America that kid would be publicly executed for what he did and not not hung and not shot like he would be dismembered and the reason for that is so the other people knew that when you shoot up a school that's what happened to you and people would stop shooting up schools you know unfortunately we we live in a time in history where people haven't been a hell to countable publicly because we have all these soft hearts and all these people that say it's cruelty and shit no shit is supposed to be cruel it's supposed to be cruel for 12,000 years people have been publicly dealt with to keep people from doing fucked up shit this is no different and just because it's been a hundred years since we've really had that doesn't mean that it doesn't work and that's if we want to go if we want to restore civility in this country violent criminals that do things like shoot up schools that murder people that rape people and do this shit should be dealt with publicly in a very harsh way and if you do that crime will go down I don't really understand how how people can understand that argument and I don't it's not cruel what's cruel is what happens to the victims nobody talk about that no they don't care nobody talks about that nothing to me like I don't know I mean I think we talked about this with Duke like like there is there like I mean people may not like this but it's the fucking truth there is a there is a great benefit to getting bullied because it gives you two fucking options you can either become something that you don't want to get bullied for anymore you become fucking better you can rise up you can get better you can you know do some crazy cool shit right or you have the other option where you come to that shit bro and you know what the fuck this dude I got bullied my whole life dude I was bullied until I got to be probably a freshman in high school I was bullied my entire fucking life and then I was bullied in high school but the difference between high school I got bigger in everybody I sure beat people's asses 100% yeah and like dude once I beat a couple asses guess what happened bullying stopped it did stop and not only did it stop I became somebody that other people looked up to you because I stood up for people that got fucked with. So dude same exact thing yeah like a lot of people may not know this I used to be a dancer yeah I know saying like you know Twinkle Toys DJ no like like like like Legida Milie like classically trained in Dancing you know I'm saying had scholarships and all this shit yeah I'll be not like I mean I was I was pretty decent yeah Um, and I was like, I think I was riding the middle school like seventh eighth grade man. One of the production managers, I will never forget her fucking name or name. I'll say her name. She's dead now, I believe at least. Well, it's probably because of karma probably because she called you fat. Yeah, she said, she said, I would never make it as a professional dancer because I started picking up some weight. Well, you should have stuck with it because now being fat is awesome. You get a, you get a pass to the front. You'd be on fucking Broadway right now, bro. Yeah, no shit. It's healthy. No, they're not being on the fucking magazine saying this shit's healthy. No, man, but I took that fucking pain like that should hurt. You know, I'm saying you tell 11 year old little kid that shit, you know what I'm saying? But I took that. Yeah. And I fucking went to the football field and started to lay in mother fuckers out. Yeah. And I put her face on every fucking opponent that I had and I fucking dominated this. Yeah. Yeah, I don't fucking, I don't have to shoot up a fucking. Listen, dude, bullying, Lizza plays for it. There is a place for it. Bullying and shaming prevent behavior that is not acceptable in civilization. Right. That's it. And like, and accountability. And dude, real talk, people don't understand this. Men operate on a pecking order of violence. That's just fucking reality. Have perceived perceived a bit. Potential violence. Correct. Like when I'm talking to another man, I automatically know. And it doesn't matter if it's someone who's 5'7 or someone who's 6'8. I know that if I say the wrong thing, there's potential for violent confrontation. That means there's amongst most men that are above the age of probably 30. There is a natural respect to other men. And the reason we have that natural respect to other men is because we know that if we say the wrong thing, we might have to violently have a confrontation. What doesn't mean we're going to lose. Right. But like nobody likes to have a violent confrontation unless you're totally fucked in the brain. It's not that fun. Yeah, just come down to how bad you want to fucking say it. Correct. And dude, this is why, and this is reality. How bad you don't want to do it. This is why you have so many women start all these fights with men, because women don't live in that same structure. So when they start running their mouths and all this, then they pull some dude into the fight. And then honestly, dude, this is a big problem in the black community. This is why a lot of black dudes get fucking killed. Because the women start to shit and then the black guys end up getting shot for it. But we see this in all areas of society. The women have no structure about, they have no fear of violence, because violence has never been bestowed on them in that way. And all men, they have restraint with what they say and what they do, because they understand like fuck dude, all right, I'm pissed at this dude, but am I pissed enough to get in a fight or am I pissed enough to get shot? Am I pissed enough to where I have to handle this? Meaning physically, and we think about those things. And women don't think about those things. They don't think about it. And neither do these young men. These younger men who were under 25 years old, when I was growing up, you got in fist fights, and then that was that. Like you went out in the parking lot and you fucking fought it out. And that was that bro. And sometimes most of the time you ended up with respect for the other person. You're like, are you good? I'm good. And then you went on. And I heard in the fucking chat. Bond. Yeah bro, a bond is formed through that. And we lost something in society when people started getting arrested for simple disfiding, just being real. 100% man, I'll say this too, you don't feed into the fucking, you know, like you're being bullied because allegedly they're called you gay. Everybody gets called gay. I'm just saying, but like dying your hair, fucking yellow, yellow probably doesn't help that. Well, I mean, dude, but these kids are, I know, but bro, remember what these kids are told. They're told growing up, listen man, this is the whole problem. These kids are told growing up things that are not true about society. They aren't told the reality. They aren't told, hey man, the world sucks. And people are mean. And they're not going to fucking like it no matter how perfect you present yourself to be. You can be jacked, you could be 10, you could be wealthy, you could have all your shit together. And there's going to be people that just fucking hate you. You grow your hair yellow, they're going to hate you. You shave your head, they're going to hate you. You fucking, you're a little too fat, they're going to talk shit. The world talks shit no matter what, right? And you have to develop a stick enough skin to operate in the world. And so they tell these kids growing up that, it's not like that. Yeah, that's right. They tell these kids growing up that you could be whatever you want, you can wear whatever you want, you can be a girl, you can be a boy, you could grow your hair, you could color it this way, you could wear a blue, you could wear a pink, you can get 500 piercings in your fucking face, you can get your face tattooed. And if the world treats you wrong, then it's the world's fault. While that might be true that the world's fault, that doesn't prepare the young person for the reality that the world is a very harsh place. So when the person gets out into the real world, which our first experience, typically of this is in high school, we find out real quick what's acceptable and what's not. You know what I mean? So like, dude, the parents and the teachers are telling these kids, idealistic shit, that isn't true about the world. This is the same reason why kids that come out of high school or come out of college are ineffective in the workforce. They come in, they have this dream about, you know, I'm going to get a job, and I'm going to make a million dollars a fucking year tomorrow. And, you know, then they come in, they're ineffective. They think it's supposed to be, you know, this easy thing where they show up at fucking nine, and they leave it for and they make a gazillion dollars, and they don't have to really contribute. They just have to show up. Like, these, the world will stop on your fucking throat, dude. And we need to be teaching our kids and preparing our kids for that, not preparing our kids for this utopia that doesn't exist, that when they find out it doesn't exist, they snap and go crazy, which is what happened here, in my opinion. Yeah, and honestly, I'm starting to even think a little bit more too on the dead, bro, because I mean, fuck, like, you got a son, you know, I don't know if this is his only son or what, but fuck, I mean, he's getting bullied for being gay. Yeah, let's try to tough him up. You know, I'm not, I don't even, you know what I'm saying? Maybe that wasn't the case. It was buying a gun, buying a gun and makes someone tough. No, I'm saying, like, I mean, he's saying I'm hunting and shit, like, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, well, I mean, is the kid, is the kid gay? I'm just saying, like, is this dad, does this dad have a gay kid and now he's like being a fucking dick, cuz he's gonna beat the gay out of him? Yeah, that's right. Like, bro, you know, like, look, man, you know, who knows? But it doesn't matter. That's the point. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. He killed him because he had something going on, bro, fuck that kid. He needs to go in the fucking woodchipper for real. It's real, man. That's real, guys. Oh, my fucking bro, listen, and I get into you. There's people right now that are like, oh, oh, so I was like someone who grew up with a perfect family. Listen, dude, there's a lot of shit in everybody's family. Okay, not everybody wants to go and fucking tell their whole fucking story about their fucking family because they don't want to embarrass people. They don't want to fucking, you know, sound like they're crying or making excuses. We could find a fucking shit wrong with everybody's fucking family. Know that? I'm talking about, don't change it. Shit's already happened. Bro, you got to deal with it. There's dude, there's fucking five dudes I'm looking at in this room that got harder family stories than that guy. You know what I'm saying? This guy's like, fuck this guy. Yeah. Yeah, guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know down in the comments, what you guys think. With that being said, let's get to our final second of the show, 80. Thumbs up or dumb as fuck. Let's remember bringing headline down, we talk about it to get one of those two options. Now, Andy, early days of business, you used to work at a bar, right? You used to work at a bar, you know what I'm saying? You'd have to work to kind of help make ends meet and shit and fund the business, right? Did you guys have any special like shot rituals or anything you guys did? Oh, fuck yeah, bro. Shots? Yeah. Yeah, bro, all kinds. Like any any special one off the top? Well, the house shot, the one that we all did was just replacements. Okay, yeah, but then we had, Willie had this one, it was called slick Willie. Okay. We all had like our own, we had this thing called a Sunday special, which was Schmiernauff ice with flavor vodka. Yeah, it's, huh? That sounds. It'll fucking cure a hangover. Or immediately. Yeah, we had one, because I worked in a bar industry as well. We had one that's called the last call shot. Yeah, so like, you know, those junk guys that come up at the end of the bar mat, give them the fucking bar man. Oh, yeah, yeah, I know about that. Yeah, so we had that. Yeah, but this is an interesting story about the bar scene. Yeah, we had that special one called the vizene. You know, when dudes were being smart ass, we put a couple drops of vizene in their shot and they were gone because they shit their pants. Oh, that's so bad. No, it's not people don't be an asshole. People fucking with your drinks and your food. That's true. That's true. That's world number one. I agree with that rule. I don't be an asshole. It's already a hard job as it is, bro. Teat treat these people with fucking respect. I agree. I agree, but let's check out this thumbs up. Because this is a very interesting story at a bar. The headline reads, bartender knocks woman out with a vicious slap during a hurricane shot. Wait, is this that same thing that we covered back in, is it some Florida where they were doing that shot where they smacked a dude in the fucking face? No, this is another one. This is a different one. This is a different one. All right. Different one. Hurricane slap. So why go out to the bar for just drinks when you can have the bartender throw water in your face and slap you like you insulted their mother? It's a question people are asking themselves on a regular basis. The hurricane shot which combines everyone's favorite things into one shot has become a good way to get some views on social media. You take it your shot, have the bartender throw some water in your face, then slap you. It's a simple equation for a good time out of the bar for and for eyeballs on the internet. What could possibly go wrong when a bartender is slapping around the customers? Well, I'll tell you the bartender could be packing a strong enough pimps slap to not folks unconscious. That happened at an unknown bar to one woman who decided she wanted an assault chaser with her shot. She pounds the drinks, takes the water to the face, right on cue, then receives a vicious slap. The sensor into next week. Don't worry. The guy recording the video didn't stop the video to catch her. You got the camera roll as he lied to the woman and made sure she didn't fall to the ground. He can be heard telling the cailed woman, you're okay several times. As he catches her and saves her from further damage, here is the clip. I just want her out. She is out. Is that the woman that knocked her out? It said that I just knocked her out. Bro, she hit her with the fucking with the heel of her hand. Watch it. I mean, that was not that's not a friendly like bar slap. Oh, John knocked her out. Bitch, you try to knock her out. Yeah, man. Who's paying for this shit? I mean, listen, here's what happened. Make sure you tip your parts in. What do you think happened here? What do you, why do you think she slapped her so hard? I don't know. Yeah, you do. Everybody knows. She okay. She was probably, I don't know. Everybody fucking knows. She's been a bitch. No. She's cute. She's cute in the bartender wasn't cute. That's what the fuck that's about. Letting her a little 100%. I could see. We all know that. I could see that. Listen, dude, women are vicious. That's true. You know, women, like we said, when Duke was here, they're the kind of women will tell another woman that they look great when they look like shit just so they look better. Because this is Gorillac in the video. Yeah, of course. She has four chins. Yeah. Going on her own. Yeah, of course you did. You fucking Hulk. Wait, let me see if I can do that. Yeah, she did that on purpose, bro. She hit that bitch extra hard just because she was hot and the other one ain't. That's what the fuck happened there. I guarantee it. And now she's shit in her pants because she's like, oh, fuck, this is gonna be on the internet. I'm going to get in the wrist. Yeah. Yeah. What we got with this, man? You know, I listen, I don't want to get slapped. I don't think I'll listen. I think if you're fucking stupid enough to pay someone for a shot and then to slap you, you fucking rolled the dice on what you get. I don't think she's getting trouble. I'm just saying she went extra hard because of what I said. Oh, that's definitely true. Yeah. But like, you know, if you're dumb enough to pay for it, you get what you get. You know, not to fuck out. That's my bike. Yeah. I don't know. Shit. I think of that. It's kind of like our bike. Yeah, right. That's my that's my. That's my. Yeah. I mean, make sure you tip your bar to those guys. Yep. And don't be too hot. And don't be better looking. No, guys, Andy. How's it all? I got. All right, guys. Don't be a hoe. Show the show.
