This is where we believe it or not. We put the internet up on the screen and then we talk about it. We speculate on what's true and what's not true and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems that are created in society. Other times you tune in, this is your first time being blessed with our message. We have shows within the show. Okay, we have Q and A F and if you go back to yesterday you're gonna hear Q and A F. That's where you submit questions and we answer them. Now you can submit your questions a couple different ways. The first way is guys you can email your questions in to ask Andy at Andy for solar.com or you can go on YouTube right there in the comments section and ask questions in there and we'll choose some from there as well. Other times we're gonna have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes and me giving you some real shit that you need to hear and then we're gonna have 75 hard versus now 75 hard versus where someone who has completed the 75 hard program comes on the show and talks about how their life was in disarray before the program and how they've used the program to realign their mental and as a result the rest of their life. Now if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard it is the initial phase of the live hard program. You can get the entire program for free at episode 208 on the audio feed anywhere audio podcasts are hosted. It will be episode 208 of real AF. There is a book. The book is called the book on mental toughness. You can get it on my website.

But if you're someone like me that likes to know the nuts and bolts the ins and outs it's a great book and I think you really enjoy it. It is currently I believe on pre order. Well not pre order but out of stock. We sell out of it every time it comes in. So if you just go in and order it it'll ship right as when we get it. So there's that and a lot of you guys been asking about full length. Well we have a whole new concept that we're going to replace full length with. I'm not going to tell you about yet because the minute I say it other people are going to start doing it and this is a unique concept that no one's doing. So we'll bring that to you as soon as we get that ready to launch. In fact we'll probably just launch it and not tell you anything about it. But you guys have been asking what about the full lengths? Well we're doing them a little different. You'll see we've got a lot of big plans coming up this year for the brand for the show and that's one of them. So we have this thing called the fee. The fee is very simple. You'll hear me say pay the fee. What that means is share the show. Okay. We talk about controversial topics here. We do not take ads on the show because I don't want to answer to any companies telling me what I can and can't say. I'm an independently successful human being. I finance the show myself. So I have the freedom to say whatever the fuck I want and I do it. So in exchange for that we get censored and shadow banned and mess with across all the platforms and I just ask something very simple. When it comes to spending your money, please consider my companies as the option that you spend your money with. And then also please help us get the message out. If it makes it think if it makes you laugh, if it gives you a new perspective of its things that you need to hear, please share the show. And by the way, you guys do a great job of this. Now there's a lot of people that don't, but those of you that do, you do a great job and I appreciate the fuck out of you guys. Now I also appreciate you guys supporting our companies. This is not an ad, but you know, when you buy first form, you're supporting the show indirectly and I'm very, very much so appreciate that. So I just want to put that out there.

Hey, listen, in any trope that there's one. Okay. There's one rule on the show and everybody fucking knows it. And the rule is I decide what the fuck is funny. And you don't. That's that. Yeah. It's kind of like how I'm doing. Actually, it's a madat and I we decide together. That's a horrible judgment. But doctor, was that fucking fire joke in the beginning of the show? Yeah, yeah. It's amazing. See that. It was amazing. You're so great. You're the one with fucking. All right. Let's get in the show. Let's get into it. Holy shit. Enough about nuts in your mouth. Yeah. All right.

Bro, listen, I will come in. Listen, I will come in the mall and fucking record it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We can record some tomorrow. You won't be doing cardio an hour after your shoulder surgery. Yeah.

Chaco taco is coming back. You don't miss. Listen, we got to play the clip. Fuck what the clips say. You got to play this right here. Play the clip. It's fucked up, bro. I'm calling it right now. It's coming back. You calling it? Okay. All right. I mean, I can see it. It's coming back. You got to build the place. I think this can't be real. I'm refusing to accept this. Yeah. Hey, this is a publicity stuff. Fucking Bernstein Bayer is, bro. I'm not about it. Yeah. This is two thumbs down. If 100%. Yes. 100%. I hope they come back. They're coming down. We need to get a stockpile, bro. Listen, they are coming back, market down, guarantee. Listen, you said they come back. In the back. I don't miss. You don't miss, man. You don't fucking miss. Chaco taco is coming back. I'm actually happy, but there is like a little caveat with this. I think this is a PR stunt to get the fucking Chaco taco to be controversial again. Yeah, the problem is though they put it in like, it's coming back. Let's just die because there is a caveat here. It is coming back. It's like some cinnamon thing or something, isn't it? No, no, no, no. It's just where it's coming back. So, a beloved ice cream treat that was discontinued in 2022 is making a comeback. Not just not with the same company. The Chaco taco invented a 1983 and made by Klondike was retired after the company quote had to make very tough decisions to ensure availability of our full portfolio nation. Why does spokesperson told next star at the time now an ice cream company out of Portland, Oregon is teaming up with Taco Bell to recreate the dessert and bring it back to the public once more. Starting this summer's salt and straw is offering a little bit of an elevated version of the Chaco taco. Oh, featuring cinnamon and show ice cream, hardened chocolate and toasted brown rice. Yeah, it sounds a little too liberal for me. That sounds a little liberal. It's not the Chaco taco. No, no, this is bullshit Taco. No, they're like like this is like this is like this is the trans taco. That's pretty good. That's fucking good. How's it going? That's shit. That's a trance. Chuck. That's to DJ's name. Bro, that's not the Chaco. Why do we got to fuck up everything is good in the world, bro? It is Portland, Oregon. Hey, that's true. I mean, like it is Portland. Yeah, what do you got? What's wrong with you guys up there? I don't know. You got to be fancy. Like these are the motherfuckers that took avocado, put on toast, charge $50 for it. Oh, okay, but that's shit. It's kind of good though. Yeah, I don't know. $50 for $50. Bro, it's avocado and bread. But it's because they try to do the old. Our avocados are humanely sourced from Mexicans and no one cares. Like bro, just give me the fucking avocados, man. Bro, people only care that it's not like brown. Man, did you ever for once ever in your life ever? Like you go to one of these Mexican places, they come out. You're been in Mexico place where they make the shit right there at the table, like guacamole. Oh, yeah. Have you ever for a fucking second thought anything, but like damn, that looks fucking good. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Like I don't give a fuck where they come from. I don't care. I don't really care. No care. Yeah. I need to care if they fucking use chemicals on them or any of the shit that you make it. I don't do shit. That fucking shit looks good. I'm gonna eat it. I got tequila. I got tacos. You can mash that shit with your hands, bro. Like like make it with your fucking hand. I don't care. It looks good. I mean it. Well, that might be taking it overboard. Yeah. Well, what you saying? Like I don't think many people wouldn't eat it with some things. I mean, like they can't have like fucked up fingers and shit. They could have just digging in the fucking crotch clean hands employees have to wash their hands. They don't, but they don't say f*****. They say they do, but they don't. You ever seen the fucking bathrooms that have those stickers? Well, they are. How many fucking clean bathrooms have those stickers in them? Like, doesn't it? Isn't it more impressive for your facility to have a perfectly clean bathroom with no sticker of employee washed their hands than a completely disgusting bathroom? Yeah. It's like a sticker. Like it doesn't. It doesn't joke. It does not make me feel secure. In my cleanliness. That's real. That's a real. That's a real point there. That's wisdom, man. Bro, more people. Yeah, which you're gonna lose when they pull those teeth out, bro. I'm gonna find you f*****. I'm gonna find you. I'm gonna find a new one, man. We're gonna throw in there with those e-shaw in there. It was wisdom, right? We're gonna replace you with f*****, Cyan, bro. Yeah. Then he's gonna kick your ass. DJA f*****, he's showing almost had a boxing match. Oh, come on. Oh, yeah, bro. Oh, yeah. We're bringing this shit out in the real world. We got it in here, bro. It was almost a war between African and India. World War Three. Who knew World War Three was African and India? Who was walking? Was that you walking? We hit the other day, but I said that shit to him. Bro, we're walking. We were walking. First of all, DJA is a big dude. If you listen to audio, you never seen him. Well, he is black. I'm black. You guys don't be surprised. Secondly, what are you six foot? Six, one. Yeah. Six, one. F*****, 280 pounds to 75. Yeah, we'll take it. Big f***** dude who knows how to handle this. F*****, Z-Shod. What's he? Five, seven, f*****, 30. Yes, so can win. You know, I don't know though. He's doing 75 hard now, bro. His shoulders and arms can be doing 1000 hard. I will. Anyway, destroy him. No, he's dude. Listen, I'm telling you right now when I was walking across part of it, he says he's gonna kick your ass. I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I'm going to break break break break. I said, hey, I said Z-Shod and he like looks to be and I said, I heard you're going to beat DJs ass. He said, I'm a f*****k kill him. Oh, is that what he said? Yeah. Oh, all right. That's what he said, bro. Well, guys, we're going to listen to this. We'll be right back. Just come in. All right. Well, this is thumbs up. I don't really do a thumbs up beginning to show. Let me sure. I mean, it's not a thumbs up. It is thumbs up because it's it's homage. But you all are making it weird. It's man. That's a trans-trocotaco, bro. That's f*****ing it up. That sounds like hate. Like, bro, I was, well, that sounds like hate speech. It is. But like, dude, I was serious like before. I'm like, shit, dude, I will fly to a f*****ing Portland, Oregon and get an unlimited supply of these motherf*****ers. I don't want those. And I will tell you what there's a reason the saying's exist. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. There's a reason that saying who's this? Like, I'm convinced that people f***** up their lives so much because they can't just abide by these little nuggets of wisdom that have existed for thousands of years, which is if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Yeah. Well, with these people, the problem is is that there is no problem. That's the problem. I don't, I don't, I don't, I actually think the problem is is that they're f*****ing stupid. That's what I think. F*****ing, I'm this choco tacos, man. Would you try one? Would you try one? You might like, say ahead rice in it. Yeah, it's, it's, uh, let's get the actual ingredients here. It's, uh, cinnamon, macho ice cream, heart, hardened chocolate and toasted brown rice. Why do I want rice with my ice cream? That doesn't make sense to me. Is that like tapioca? That might be that. Hmm. Still don't f***** is ancho. Isn't it like anchovies? I'm f*****ing no, man. I'm, I listen, let's look at that. I'm from Missouri. Cinnamon. We don't have that shit around here. Cinnamon. You know what it is? Yeah, you would, you would go for that ice cream. Joe, Joe's, are you guys eating the taco? No, we got two nose, one yes. What about you? Spice, two and two. And you're, you're staying no DJ? Yeah, no. Okay, I'm saying no, too. So it's definitely a thumbs down. I'm ready. Avocado ice cream. Yeah, let's move on. This is ruining the world. What the f***** are they do with? Yeah, you were just talking about avocado. I'm f*****ing down with these people. That's discussed it. I agree. It's avocado. Oh, you know what, bro? F***** you guys for making this taco and bastardizing the choco taco. F*****, that's my official thing. It's insane. Yeah, f***** those guys. Guys, that's real, bro. You know what, you know what happened to them? What happened to them was they missed their daily dose of this amazing first form energy drink. Screaming freedom. They missed it and it fucked up their brain and it came up with this idea. Now they're going to lose gazillions of dollars. Don't let that happen to you. Drink first form, scream and freedom every single f*****ing day. This is not an ad. Just saying. Guys, let's get into our headlines. Man, remember if you want to see any of these pictures or articles, links, videos, go to andyforceler.com. You guys can find them, links there. I was not being said, man, headline number one. This is a big one. Big one coming out of left field here. Headline reads, media admit, showbiden involved in lucrative AmeriCorps deal with brother James. No shit. But now mainstream media is covering it. Yeah, well, they're trying to get rid of the left. Yeah, that's what it means. Man, they're bearing him. That's what it means. Listen to this. They brought these old, they brought this old motherfucker in to do all this damage. He did the damage. They don't need him no more. See ya. And he's so stupid. He fell into it because he wanted to be president of the United States so bad. He couldn't recognize what was happening to him. Yeah. Did you really think that you're smart enough to be president, bro? You're a f*****ing moron. These people used you and now they're going to ruin your name and your reputation, your f*****ing family forever. And you let it happen because your ego is massive. This is why you should never, this is why you should never, ever, ever let the pursuit or desire of a position for your own ego, getting the way of your judgment and cloud your judgment. It will be used again. Yeah, 100% is exactly what happened here. Yeah. Let's stop into this article. So political, who is very left leaning on a lot of the things. In fact, just a few months ago wrote an article saying this was total bullshit is now admitting it. Political national political correspondent Ben Shrek Ringer, sh**k kicker. Sh**k kickers. Ben Sh**k kicker. Ben, Benjamin Sh**k kicker, admitted Sunday that President Joe Biden was involved with James Biden in the family's lucrative AmeriCorps deal. The article appears to contradict political reporting in October that no quote, smoking gun existed or exists that proves any Biden family wrongdoing. Political publication that tried to dismiss the Hunter Biden laptop story typically works to suppress the Biden business scandal. The outlet review information that shows that quote, Joe Biden's name and inner circle were more involved with the company that has been understood. Sh**k kicker acknowledged. Quote, the investigation also reveals that Joe Biden's name and inner circle were more involved with the company that has been understood. In addition to the accounts provided by former executives, investors material described Jim Biden as an advisor to his older brother. And on top of Joe Biden's own previously reported encounter with the firm CEO, at least three of Joe Biden's relatives did work with AmeriCorps. They include Jim Biden's wife Sarah and his son Jamie. The president's son Hunter Biden also met with the CEO and his personal doctor, current White House physician, Kevin O'Connor joined a meeting with Jim Biden and the president of a hospital being acquired by AmeriCorps, according to a former executive and emails obtained by Politico. Politico's change in turn comes months after House on the Oversight Committee Chair James Coleman produced findings in October about AmeriCorps in a $200,000 check landing in Joe Biden's bank account. Coleman believes the $200,000 payment is suspicious because the money flowed through a distressed entity, AmeriCorps, which loaned James Biden's $600,000. On March 1st, 2018, AmeriCorps wired him $200,000. That same day, James Biden sent Joe Biden a $200,000 check. Now James Biden denied the $200,000 check. He gave Joe Biden was due to a pre-existing business relationship. He insisted instead that the money was a return payment for money Joe Biden lent him. Coleman requested the alleged quote, loan documents the Biden brothers might have consummated, but the White House stoned wall the request. In media appearances, Coleman blew holes in James Biden's claims and stated his story was contrived out of the rear end. Let's say they pull something out of their rear end that says Joe Biden loaned Jim Biden money. Either way, we have his James Biden's personal bank records. I can say with confidence, he had no money to pay Joe Biden back other than that $200,000 wire that came from AmeriCorps Health Company. So either Joe Biden was paid $200,000 as part of the influence peddling scheme payback, kickback dividend, or Joe Biden actually made a loan to his brother and because his brother influenced pedal to AmeriCorps Health, he paid him back $200,000. Now, political's acknowledgement of the AmeriCorps wire money wire comes as James Biden is set to sit for a deposition with the House impeachment inquiry. In September, Commerce, a peanut James Biden's Lion Hall group and JBBSR Inc entities. This is a peanut appeared directed to add obtaining records linked to Joe Biden's corporation, Saltic Capri Corp, which received nearly $10 million in 2017 without specifying revenue line items. And here's the title for the political article. Biden's brother used his name to promote a hospital chain that it collapsed. So that hospital actually went bankrupt and closed down and somebody actually died because of all this, which is also part of the mix. And then what do we get on this? Well, I mean, there's a lot here. This is another example. You know, a lot, first of all, I'll say this, all of this information has been out for years and years and years. Okay. And for years and years and years, the media has completely denied it. They have completely lied, Politico, the Atlantic, all these, the mainstream media's, these people have sat on television and penned articles that are complete bullshit to protect these people. Okay. Now, because the polls are showing that this guy can't beat anybody, they're now bailing on him. Just like I said a minute ago. So they bring this dude in. He's old. He's seen how he's fumbling over everything that he says, what better person to do the damage to the United States than someone like that? Because if it were Gavin Newsome or if it was someone who was put together mentally, we would be standing at the White House with torches saying, bro, treason, right? But because it's an old man, they've played it off as like they said in the media last week, a confused, well-meaning elderly man. That is not true. Okay. This is the play they've been running. And I have said this a million times on this show when I've talked about them using this guy as a chess piece to accomplish the destruction of America. So this guy, because he wanted to be president so bad, he failed to identify the role and the accuracy and the reality of his position. You are not qualified to be president. That is why you've been in Congress for 40 fucking years and you've never made it. You're a moron. All right, you're not sharp. You're not on top of it. You're Barack Obama's butt boy. That's the fuck you are. Okay. And you were chosen not because you deserve to be president, but because you would be easy to excuse doing the damage that they wanted to do in this country. All right. So that's the reality of Joe Biden. Now they realize, oh, we're in an election year and Trump's winning 70 to 30 or 75 to 25. Some crazy shit. Which by the way, if you actually look at the numbers, that's where we're at. It's not 44 to 38 or whatever, it's drastic. Okay. And it's a gap so wide that they would be they do not have the capacity to fudge it. They can cheat it. Yeah, the gaps too big. And so now they're saying, okay, well, let's bail this dude out. Let's reenergize the democratic voter base by giving them what we think would be accepted as a reasonable option, which could be a number of people. I personally now they're saying it's not going to be, but I personally still believe that Michelle Obama makes the most sense if they're serious about maintaining power. And they are serious about maintaining power because they understand that if they lose power, there's going to be accountability to what's going what they've done. Yeah. And that accountability is going to stretch not just from our government. It's going to stretch in the media. It's going to stretch in the financial institutions. And it's going to stretch into international alliances and I don't know what you call these interest groups like the World Economic Forum. All right. And NATO and things like that alliances and interest groups. And uh, yeah. So that's still how I'm reading it. I don't care what you guys say. Oh, Michelle Obama says she's not doing it. Yeah. Well, I'm sure that's what she's going to say until she does it. Exactly. Well, I think something too like for people to pay attention to that. I think the lens to the credibility of that statement, Andy, is that this cabal, this deep state that we talk about, they know what they can use against you, right? Like they know they knew this shit with with Hunter Biden. They knew this shit with Joe Biden. Oh, yeah. They help facilitate a lot of this. Yes. And they do these things as like a fail safe in case they ever like we saw it with Bob and Indes, right? And all the fucking foreign entities he was working with. But like they know the corruption. They are aware and that's why they're going to use you in the moment they no longer need you. They have enough on you to get rid of you. Oh, well, look, you know, I'm saying like they will completely own it. They know these things, which also further lends to the credibility of Trump. Am I opinion because it's like they don't have anything on them, which is why they have to create 94 bullshit. That's why they have this corp something New York, finance $300,000. Exactly. They don't have anything. They he's never been bought like that. You know what I'm saying? And so like that, that's what this like to me looking at it and I look at it like that and like through those lends, it's very, very easy to see the bullshit. Well, that's how I see it, man. Yeah, I agree with you. Yeah, guys, that's what you guys think. I'm down. I mean, the problem I have with this is that we are we not going to learn our lesson as people like we have independent media sources, people like myself who have been pointing this out for literally years saying this exact thing. And most people don't believe it until it shows up in the news article years later by the companies who have lied to you for years and years and years and years intentionally. What do you think? Do you think they know less than me? Do you or do you think it's more likely that they've been covering? And then you use that to validate that is true. So the American people have still not learned. They still have not learned that our media in this country is not about the news anymore. It is about propaganda. I don't know when that started happening. It would be impossible to tell, but I could tell you when I started noticing it was during COVID and a little bit before that. Okay, basically 2016 and beyond. Yeah. All right. It makes no sense. It should make no sense to anyone. Why every single personality and every single station hates Donald Trump. We like that doesn't make sense because in this office there's 500 people here. If I walk through and I say, okay, what do you think of this person? We can pick any person on a planet. We're going to have a number of different perspectives. But because this guy is not part of their shit, they have coordinated the media, the financial institutions, Hollywood, entertainment, social media, the biggest companies in the world, the most important government organizations in the world to attack this man in unison. And there are literal videos of people saying and using the exact same phrases. That's what scary. Yes. So there is a back end coordination happening amongst all these media channels. And it is very obvious to anybody who looks when these people all use the exact same framework of language in the same situations, like they did in 2020 with COVID, it should be very obvious that they're being coordinated behind the scenes. There's a universal message that is getting put down. Yeah, they're repeating word for word. Have a job. Have a job. Have a job. Have a job. Have a job. One of those videos where like the news they showed all the reporters and they're finishing each other's sentences. Dude, the American people are still not learning because this we've we reported on this fucking for the last four years. 2022. Okay. No, I'm just saying all the corruption. That's just this exact one. Yeah. And people don't admit that it's true until the people who have been lying to you say that it's true. So at what point are American people going to wake up and say, hmm, why would I believe or look at a certain organization as if they are the authority and confirmation of truth? When clearly they are way behind people who are out here on the front lines telling you what the fuck is going on. You understand? Well, it's very simple too. Like dude, like why is he going to be on this now is because they want to they want to build your trust back so they can tell you the next bullshit, the next for real, dude. So how how is it that most people will not admit that one of these quote unquote conspiracies are true until CNN reports on it. Yeah. How does that make sense? At some point we have to step back and analyze our thinking skills and say, well, they're lying to us and they lied to us forever about this. And now it's true. And by the way, all these other people, they said it was true the whole time, but we thought they were tin foil hat dumb fucks. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? People that said it was a lie. Just because I don't sit on TV with a fucking tie and feed you a bunch of bullshit and talk like one of these nerds or any of these other guys out here in independent media who are regular people. These people are way more credible than than these people. And you're still looking at these organizations as if they're the stamp of reality. And that's dangerous. That's why we're in this situation. So what's going to happen tomorrow or next month when they have the next emergency come out? Are you all going to believe that it's real again and fall for the same shit? Because if so, bro, we're going to lose this country. At some point in time, Americans have to wake up that are in tact. When they call us fascists, they are the fucking fascists. Fascism is the core nation of all of these things. Government, business, media is exactly what we're doing. To oppress the citizen. That is fascism. They are fascists. That is what they're doing. That's why when these blue hair dumb fucks come running up and they fuck you fascists. It's hilarious because they don't even know what the fuck they're saying. Anyway, fuck these people. What's with the sniffing? Why do they all do that? Rather world. Listen, these people think we're scum. They hate us. They're not acting in your best interest. If you support any of these people and you think that they care about you, you're wrong, you're deeply wrong. And it's a fatal mistake. We have to stop believing that these people in Washington, DC, give a single fuck about us American citizens because if they did, they wouldn't work so hard to make life so hard for us. They wouldn't have a plus 50% tax rate when you add it all together, income tax, sales tax, tax to buy gas, tax to sell shit, tax to own shit, over and over and over. That wouldn't happen if they had our interest in mind. They don't have our interest in mind. They have their interest in mind. And the American people thinking that these people work for us is what's causing us to go further and further and further down the fucking drain. So wake the fuck up. Yeah, guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think of that being said. That's fucking occupied, bro. This guy's taking money from China. This guy's taking money from other countries. And then take this is what people don't understand. Influence peddling is treason. It's treason. Yeah, let's call us pay to space. Yes, influence peddling is like that's like saying a child molester is a child lover, a minor attractive person. Dude, it's total sterilization of what we're actually talking about. We're talking about actual treason. We're talking about taking millions of dollars from the Chinese government and then making moves as president of the United States to destabilize our country to allow millions upon millions upon millions of military age males across the border to drain our strategic oil reserves to artificially lower the price to leave our military equipment Afghanistan and then how they used against us in other areas and theaters to create disruption with crime in the inner cities to create division amongst the races and the sex of Americans like bro, they are doing this on purpose. This is not an accident. And they use this man who is seen as fuck as the fall guy who's getting paid millions of dollars. If somebody's paying you millions of dollars, is it reasonable to expect that they expect some sort of action in return? That's the fundamental. Okay, now if China, if China is our enemy like we are told they are, would it make sense that China would want someone here to destabilize the nation for their benefit? Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Absolutely. Why else are they paying this man any money? That is fucking treason. That is not that is not influence pedaling. Okay, so let's get this straight right now. We are occupied by a government who has been paid by our foreign adversaries to make decisions that are not in the interest of you and I and the American citizen, what would you call that? What would you call that? Because that's what the fuck we have. Guys, open on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. And with that being said, let's head to the comments. Let's head to the comments. So I saw this comment. I'm like, let's kind of fucked up. Like, it's like she's talking about, but then I see a supporting comment. I'm like, okay, all right, let's see. Let's watch this comment. This comment comes from at Jeanette Moore 1167. She says such a shame. My son listens to this nonsense. Okay, but then I see this comment. Receive my first purchase from y'all blue, Raz Energy. Can't wait to sling it and crush my AM workout. Don't be a dusty clip by Andy shit. That's fucking funny, bro. Hey, go back to the, go back to the thing. Hey, listen, Jeanette. Let me explain something to you. All right, your sons are probably tired of your bullshit. They're probably tired of your stupid ass brunch conversation and you're stupid fucking woke shit. And that's probably why they listen to the show, Jeanette. So if you weren't such a dumbass, they probably wouldn't be listening. No, they still do this. Yeah. Like people are crazy. Well, here's what these people don't understand. They are pushing people the direction of opposite of their shit. They cannot understand it. So keep forcing your mask and keep forcing your, whatever, woke shit you want to shove down everybody's throat and you'll just grow our audience for us. Yeah, thank you, Jeanette. Yeah, thanks. We appreciate it. Yeah, your son's probably think you're dumbass. Just like you think they're a dumbass. Yeah, clearly because they don't want drag story out. Yeah, because they don't, they don't want people to speak the truth. You know what? This is America. We can't have opinions and you can't think my shit is nonsense, but clearly the people closest to you in the world, listen to me and not you. So what's that say about you? No, she probably, like listen, she probably, she probably, like how does she find this? Like how does you know fucking care? She's fucking like, what do you want to know on the YouTube? Listen, bro, we're going to start finding comments of dumb's comments on the internet and we're going to start fucking destroying them. Yeah, Jeanette. Yeah, your your sons, your flesh and blood would rather listen to me than you. Maybe it's a you problem. I've never met them. I love to meet them. Yeah, sound like a couple revolutionaries. Breaking free in the fucking power matrix of the oppressive woke mom. Yeah, guys, remember don't be a dusty clip by Andy shit. Captain America, I love it. Yeah, was he, he responded to her comment with that? No, it was just a comment. It's one like, man, what would make her say this? And then I saw this. Oh my god. Well, all right. Who cares? Yeah. Don't listen. Hey, here's the beauty of free speech in America. You don't got to listen to it. Mm-hmm. That's the beauty of the second of men. Second of it's weird like what they say. Yeah, it's weird to me like do think about this. You have your mom with two sons and your sons listen. And by the way, I give away free game, bro. I'm helping these motherfuckers win. I'm telling them what it really takes to win in the real world. I'm telling them the truth about what's going on in society. A common said, I'm not fucking far right. I'm just not with your shit. And you think I'm far right. Right. Okay. And people with reasonable amounts of common sense can infer that from consuming my content. So here I am making your sons better, teaching them the ways of the world, helping them understand how to build a life that took me 25 years to get my balls kicked in to build. And they want to go out and be successful. And you're stifling that because they don't agree with your fucking political views. So there's a reason they don't listen to your mom. And that's why. Welcome to the fan base of sons. Yeah, welcome in. We'll take you. I'll be a daddy. No, that's that's not what we say. You think they're the I was weird. Yeah. It's okay. We can move on. How's your papi? You know, that move? You want to be there papi? You know the movie? No, I would just say, you know, the movie. Welcome to the shows. My friends. Welcome to the dark side. Wait, but do you not know that movie? No, that's a fucking class movie. Life. Oh, yeah, life. I was a baby. Yeah. I didn't watch that one. I don't look at it. It's like history. Andy. There's no white people in it. Yes, there is. It was the only watch. She will. Don't you read the internet? Guys, you're not said so. Well, you know, Jeanette. Thank you, Jeanette. Guys, we appreciate all of you guys. An internet. We appreciate. I do appreciate Jeanette because at least she has, she could say whatever she wants. Bro, this is America. Free speech. If you don't like me, that's cool too. Just next time, leave a like too. Such a shame. Such a shame. My son's want to get better, get better and build businesses and be wealthy and kick ass. I'm not an NPC and be awesome. Such a shame. Such a shame. Yeah, such a shame. You should be counting your blessings. Your sons have ambition and drive and the desire to get better. Like that's the fuck you should be doing. But instead, you're so convinced with your fucking woke mind, virus nonsense, you can't even be happy for your own sons. If that's not an indication of what the fuck is going on in this country, I don't know what is. Well, not times I've said she probably fucking got, got, you know, impregnated by beta bitch. No, not able to fucking know. Obviously not or sons or champions. That's what we're doing. That story. You know, you hear that story of like the dad with two sons who's an alcoholic. Right. And one son, he grows up and he's just like his dad. He drinks every day, comes to alcoholic and then the other son never touches a sip alcohol. Well, listen, you got two sons that will never touch a sip alcohol because they've watched how the fuck you behave. So you might want to reconsider it. Jeanette. That's real man. Guys, we can remember if you come on my show and talk shit, I will fucking liberally destroy you on the show. So welcome to that phase of life. Yeah. Guys, we appreciate all of our real ass fans, guys. Keep liking commenting. Make sure you hit that bell icon on YouTube so you can get the latest updates for the new shows. That being said, let's keep moving. Got headline number two. You mentioned it a little bit, but that lawsuit in New York against Trump, that ruling $355 million lawsuit. Did you see this update? Truckers for Trump, the boycott driving to New York City after $355 million fraud ruling. Do you see this? I saw a video around viral about it. I didn't know if it was just a real thing or some guy or well, it's some real shit. Yeah. So a group of truck drivers who support former president Trump have announced they will not be driving to New York City as a means of expressing their disappointment with the civil fraud judgment have fined Trump more than $350 million last week. This all comes in response to Trump being barred from operating his business in New York for three years and being found liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump organization by New York attorney general, let's issue James. New York judge Arthur and Goren handed down his ruling Friday after a month's long trial that began in October and stemmed from James's lawsuit that accused the former president of inflating his assets and committing fraud. As a result, many pro Trump truck drivers across the country have not taken the rule lightly. Now, let's keep in mind with this lawsuit. There was no victims. The banks that they called into testify defended Trump in his businesses. All the money was all repaid. Get $355 million. That's the basis here. Yeah, so, so it's sparking some, some, some blowbackers. So quote, I'm just one of the many millions of truckers who believe in God and love this country, a trucker known as Chicago Ray wrote on ex-family Twitter. How, how long are they going to keep fucking saying that? I told you it would never catch. I fucking told, don't you remember me saying this? But like, how long? I said this when it happened. What did I say? I said, it will never catch people will always call it Twitter because it's ridiculous. So it's a year, what's a year and a half later at least. Okay, like holy shit. Like fuck, bro, when you guys gonna start giving me some fucking credit, man. He says, quote, I stand with Trump because Trump stands with me. Truckers for Trump ain't just the slogan. It's real, he wrote. Chicago Ray took ex on February 16th when the ruling came down calling on fellow truckers, the boycott taking shipments to New York City. Here's the video. Hey folks, you're all past Chicago Ray. I've been on the radio talking, talking to drivers for about the last hour, our 15 minutes. And I talking to the least 10 drivers going the other way. I'm heading down from South Wisconsin. And they're going to start refusing loans in New York City starting on Monday. All right. I got about three drivers that I drive with. They're ready, vibrant to boss, it's on them. They ain't going to New York City. So I don't know how far across the country this is, or how many truckers are going to start denying loans to going to New York City. But I'll tell you what, you fuck around and find out. Okay. We're tired of you, my fucking left this fucking with Trump. Okay. You know, motherfuckers are starting to get tired of this shit. And you know, our boss isn't going to care if we denied loans, we'll just go somewhere else. All right. You know, a fucking hundred is to get in the New York City when one of these motherfuckers man fucked that. All right. Yeah. So fuck that. Yeah. But uh, that's all I was thinking, man. I was like, dude, it's a pain in the ass for these dudes to get it. You ever driven anybody who's ever driven in New York City? You know, it is, it is, it's, it's terrible. It's terrible. And, and bro, I only driven in New York City one time and it was on Goal Rush Rally in 2014. I was driving a fucking Lamborghini and it sucked. So I can imagine driving a fucking 18. Yeah. That's what I'm saying, dude. Like these guys already don't want to go there. So like, I don't know, but it's going to take more than 10 people, right? Yeah. So this, uh, now you got this video comes out today and this, this video is trying to go viral. So let's, let's look at this. All right. I just received a call from a company that I was getting the loan from and they just said they don't have any loans going to New York. So if you end New York, you're going to be receiving anything from these drivers. I don't know if it's real, but I know that the companies are now saying that they're not delivering those, not just the truckers, just the companies also. Get yourself prepared, New York. Well, it may hit the fan in the next couple of days. Yeah. So I mean, depends on if it's real or not. Yeah. Depends on if enough people stand up and say, hey, we're not dealing with this shit. No, I mean, now, do you think this is a good move? I don't know, man. I mean, these epicenters of leftism and communism and Marxism, like New York and LA, you know, they rely on all of these people that they claim to hate. You know, we're the deplorable. So the working class is a bunch of buffooned dumbasses to that. And there's going to come a time where these elite people quote unquote, elitist leftists have to come to terms with the fact that you eat shit, breathe and survive based off the backs of the working class American man. That's reality. Okay. And they disrespect us. They talk shit about us. And I know you guys are going to say, oh, he's talking about us. This guy's rich as fuck. Yeah. Bro, where do I come from, though? That's where I come from. I'm from fucking Missouri. I come from a family of fucking hard working mother fuckers, electrical people, construction people, concrete people, people who work for a fucking living. That's my bloodline. That's what a fuck I come from. So when I say we, I mean, we, and these men support their lifestyle. And all they do is get on the TV and talk all this shit about all these hard working American people. And they talk about them like their dog shit, like they're not worth anything, like they're subhuman. Yet they don't understand because their brains are fucking wired. They're fucked up that the whole reason they survive is because of men like this. And if men like this actually would stand up and hold the line on things, things would change because these people would starve. Bro, one day, hold on. This should be an eye opening time for these leftists to wake up and realize you are weak. You are the most inept people. You are useless people legitimately. You are useless. You can't change the tire. You can't change your oil. You can't grow food. You don't have any guns. You have no power other than your bullshit voice. And when your bullshit voice can't eat or drink or survive because men are tired of supporting your bullshit, you're in deep shit. So is it a good thing or a bad thing? I think it is what it is. I think if you abuse people long enough, eventually they say fuck you. And if the working class American and the police and the military all said fuck you, this whole shit would be over in a fucking week. But it's not happening because not enough people are realizing that they have the power. Yeah. These people are weak. They are frail. They are inept. They are unskilled. They are incapable. They cannot connect the dots that the whole reason they have all these comforts and all this shit is because working class people take care of them. And here's the problem and this should scare people. This is one of the last opportunities for the working class men to stand their ground and make a change because eventually those trucks aren't going to have drivers. And eventually those policemen, they're going to be robots. And eventually it's going to be a surveillance state. So the power of the people to stand up against this level of corruption and actually overturn it is dwindling by the day. Why do you think they're trying to replace all the humans in every single sect of society? Because they understand where they are vulnerable. If you are doing some fucked up shit, don't you think you know? Man, well, we can do this as long as that doesn't happen. They understand what that is very well. We the working class red blooded regular red, white and blue American person. We do not understand how much power we have, but that power will dwindle the longer we wait to flex it because technology is going to replace that. So I do you you're saying, do I think it's a good idea? I actually do think it's a pretty good idea now that I'm talking it out because our ability to stand up to these people via strike or a stoppage or a boycott is going to dwindle when these trucks are just going to be automated and go into New York no matter what, then what what are we going to do? So I think it is important for people to hold a line while we still have the availability to hold a line. Otherwise, we're going to get so far down the path. We're not going to have leverage. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I would say the thing on this dude, like I mean, New York City is a massive epicenter and a lot of people rely on their system. Bro, I think like one day would really fuck a lot of shit up. It would set a whole lot of stuff back. It's like one day of like no deliveries, but that's going to fuck up a lot of shit. I mean, like I don't know what we'll have to, you know, keep an eye on this and see, you know, I have to develop something who knows about tomorrow at the end of the day. Here's the thing. Humans are at the end of their leverage. If technology continues to grow, our ability to stand up, speak up, leverage things through civil disobedience and strikes and boycotts and in action are dwindling because we are being replaced. And if you do not want to be replaced, you much flex the power currently that you have now. That's the bottom line. So, Ray, if you want, I have a suspicion that Ray might listen to show. So, Ray, if you do listen to the show, you're going to need more than 10 guys. You should be working on getting all the organizations like we saw in the second video to agree that you are no longer going to serve the people who disrespect you and don't value you and shit on you all day long. And I don't think that's unreasonable. Let them go drive the trucks. Let these fucking pussies go out and grow the food like the farmers have to do and deal with all these tariffs and taxes and fuel surcharges and make zero dollars doing it because they are just suppressed the death. So, a bunch of rich billionaires can sell you their fake fucking food. Let them do that because right now they're in between. They're in transition. If this shit were, if people were to stand up right now, there would be a massive collapse of their entire agenda. If you allow their agenda to continue because you keep delivering their goods and you keep eventually they're just going to replace you and we won't have the opportunity. Am I making sense? Perfect sense. Okay. This is an important thing for people to understand. Their goal is to replace us. Yeah. 100%. They're fucking saying how loud, dude. Bill Gates says it in a fucking TED talk. Yeah. And bro, there's going to be people in the comments are like, I'm from New York. I'm with you guys. I know, bro. That's why you got to get active because I'm not trying to hurt we're not trying to hurt people like that. But like bro, your leadership is so fucked up because you guys allow it to happen. You haven't said shit. And I've been telling you to stand up for four fucking years. Yeah. Yeah. This will be interesting, man. Well, we'll definitely keep tabs on this. I like it. Yeah. I mean, it's it's it's listen, if this is real, I don't like cancel culture or boy cots. I think it's bullshit. I really got one. I'm called a cancel culture. But in this case, like when we're talking about power structures. Yeah. That are highly biased. There's only one way to stop that shit. Right? Like canceling some dude because he said some shit you don't like or did something that was out of character or made a mistake in their life. I'm not for that shit. I have a lot of grace for people. People fuck up. It's called being a human being. Fix your fuck ups. Learn from them. Use them to move forward. Let's this ruining of people. Individuals need stop. But again, that's just more proof that what I say is true, which is it is a social weapon. The true way to use that power as a collective is not to turn it on your fellow citizen or the local business guy who made a mistake or the guy who you know what I'm saying? That's not how you utilize that power. You utilize this power against massive structures who are pressing all of us left, right? Gay, straight, black, white together. We worked together to flip the power of those power structures. Not your neighbor who sent some fucked up shit on the internet or did something stupid 10 years ago. Yeah. That's real, man. Yeah. Because people are always like, what you weren't against? I am against cancel culture against the individual, but I am not against cancel culture against tyrants and power structures and legitimate fascism. That's the only way you could stop it. Yeah. Tell us what you guys think. Let's get to our final headline. Headline number three. Got some troll action. Got what? Some troll action. This shit is fucking great. Headline number three. So you guys, you've seen the stuff about Alexi Navemi, right? The guy who died in prison in Russia. Yeah. It's been making a lot of headlines. Yeah. All the, well, from what I've seen of it, a lot of leftists. A lot of leftists are supporting him, even Joe Biden saying some stuff, right? Like all these guys saying this stuff about this guy. He's so good. So awesome, right? Well, it gets good. Well, I found, I saw some interesting videos of that guy last night. There you did. Yeah, but I'll let you finish your story because I don't know if what I saw was true or not. Yeah. So Russian opposition leader Alexi Nalvani, who reportedly died under murky circumstances in a brutal prison camp at the age of 47 on Friday. He was a fierce critic of strong man Vladimir Putin and the corruption of the Russian elite. And a lot of leftists have been saying, oh, you know, he's a dictator. He's Putin's killing these people who's killing his opposition to the point. You got even Bono paying tribute to Alexi Nalvani during his YouTube spears residency. This dude's still alive. I thought he did die. Like, I'm not gonna be a fan. I thought he did die like fucking seven years ago with his fucking amber glasses. Yeah. Who's a clip from his concert? I bet he's wearing some stupid ass glasses. Is he? No, no. They sound like they're like like like chanting some fucking like cult shit. You know why? Because they are. All right. So here's the thing. So, so, you know, Russia has been siren on this. And is that at the sphere? Mm-hmm. And that's the sphere is some cool shit. That is some cool shit. Yeah. That is some cool shit. One of these days I'm gonna do an event at the sphere. Y'all are gonna come. We're gonna fill that bitch up. It's gonna be awesome. Yeah. But so Russia has responded. You know, because it has been a little murky about how he died and what happened. He wasn't present when it happened, right? Well, Russia responded. You know what their answer was? Russia says Alexi Nalvani died of sudden death syndrome. He must have been vaccinated. Dude, that is great. That is familiar. I don't know. Lizzy. That is great. That is some good shit right there. I mean he started like he's using their own fucking chill. Yeah, that's true. What are you going to say? Did you see all the videos of this guy at the actual Nazi rallies? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, I mean that's not even my- is you all these fucking leftists up and tears over this Russian citizen died suddenly according to the official reports. You know, but we had an American citizen in Ukraine and Ukraine. And nobody said shit on that. Yeah. Right. So that's because he was telling the truth, which was against this against the narrative. Yeah. Look, man, these people that are cheering this like here's what people do not understand. It's them over there. Okay, that is not an unreasonable. This is what people got to understand, dude. Putin doesn't play. Okay, he done fuck around. If Hillary Clinton was a Russian citizen and Hillary Clinton has done what she's done, Putin would execute her. Okay, now if you think about the amount of damage that Hillary Clinton has done to our country, don't we sort of understand why you would remove those people from society for a betterment of the society? This woman made up literally made up Russia collusion allegedly paid a dude Christopher Steel. Okay, I'm saying allegedly because I don't know the actual details yet, but there is a shit ton of evidence that says she paid this dude to create a fake report that showed that Donald Trump was involved with Russia and that they stole an election when it wasn't even fucking true was made up. Okay, so this is the disruption that now we've argued about it. Now you even have Michael Rappapur coming out who is hates Trump saying, bro, they fool me on the Charlottesville shit. That was bullshit. The whole thing. So for eight years, we've had to deal with all these people saying all these lies about this man based upon this one lie that these people created. And then we have these people advocating for grown men to dress up as women and shake their balls in front of kids. I don't have a problem with drag queens, bro, but keep it in the gay bars or in the comedy scene where the fuck it belongs. Kids don't belong there. All right. So when you look at what how Putin runs his country, Putin doesn't tolerate that shit because he understands because he understands history. And if you understood, if you watched the Tucker interview, you would understand this man understands history very well is that he cuts the head off of this shit before it ever starts. Okay, which basically means he's preserving the culture of Russia and most Russian citizens love Russia because of the way that Putin runs it. So fuck, bro, this is what happens. You don't allow dissension at this level to destroy a society which we have done here because we have retricked for the last 20 years to tolerate, have tolerance. Remember all these conversations for the last 20 years tolerance. We acceptance blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then what happened when tolerance happened? Oh, it became the tolerance wasn't enough. What are you going to do? What I say or fuck you? You're a bigot. You're a racist. You're a piece of shit. Cancel them. Close their business. Take their shit. Ruin the reputation. That's where we are now because these people are not about tolerance or coexistence like they're a little fucking bumper sticker says. It's about dominance and authoritarianism and getting my way no matter what. And if you don't like it, then fuck you. And if you think these people won't kill millions of people like they have in the past, they're going to burn over and over again like they did in Bolshevik revolution, like they did in the Holy Nemours, like they've done in every single communist fucking revolution that's existed on the face of the fucking planet ever, they'll kill you. And people don't understand that. And they're like, oh, this poor guy. This guy, if he was to get his way, would grow a movement to a point where he would kill millions of people because that's what communists do because their practical application of their society does not work. It does not work in reality. And when it doesn't work in reality and they have power, they will do anything to maintain power, which means they kill the people who resist it. And these people are dangerous. They're not to be fucked with. And if these people continue down this path in the United States of America, there will be a genocide in America of millions of people. And they will be the people who are typically celebrated as red, white, and blue patriotic Americans. And that is what we are dealing with. It is dangerous to even think that we are dealing with anything else. That is what we are dealing with. It is a communist revolution that we are in the middle of and it is a very critical point in time. And if you do not speak out against it and they win, it will cost you your life. That's real. That's not some tin foil bullshit. What was the videos you were talking about? There's a bunch of videos of this dude being at Nazi rallies. And it's interesting because if you watched the Putin video, all of our money and all of our support went to actual Nazis in Ukraine. So isn't it interesting that these people want to remove certain people from society in this case, white patriotic, red, white, and blue Americans, deporables, fucking blah, blah, blah, embarrassment of culture, you know, neanderthal, like you know what I'm saying? Like bro, we're we're this is dangerous dude. This is not. This is not politics is usual. This is dangerous. And the reason this guy died suddenly is because in other countries who have witnessed this shit before, which Russia had it a couple times in the last hundred years, they don't tolerate, they don't play. So you know what? It is what the fuck it is. That the dope. Oh, so you're condoning the execution of political rivals, you're going to do it to us. Right. You just did it to us. And then we're still saying, if I listen to people don't understand, if these people maintain power, there will be a genocide in the United States of America. Yeah. It's only matter of time, man. And it won't be a genocide of black people or a genocide, it'll be a genocide of like they tell you, right? Black people are being a written, no dude, that's not true. We are getting the only people that are persecuted against in this country legally in every single sense of the word are fucking white patriotic Americans. If you're white and you fly a fucking American flag, they're happy to have you go fight their wars, but when they don't have the fucking wars, you're a fucking problem for them. Bro, ultimately Americans need to wake up to what's actually happening. This is not political ebbs and flows. This is communism. These people talk about it openly. They credit their favorite authors being Karl Marx and Saul Olinsky and all of this communist Marxist shit. We know we're gonna wake up and realize, bro, this is not left right. This is real shit. What the fuck do you think dude? Yeah, I just I just love how Russia's trolling shit. I mean, sudden death, sudden death syndrome. I mean, you know, I don't like to laugh when people get killed bro, like I don't think it's funny, but like here's the reality. You know, when they talk about the people in the Middle East throwing motherfuckers off of buildings and cutting off their arms and shit, those are people that molest little kids and those are people that do fucked up shit. They try to tell you, oh, they just throw gay people off the building. Know the fuck they know? They fucking throw molesters and fucking degenerates and, and chronic criminals and thieves. And you know what, if you go to the Middle East and you go to the markets during the middle of the day, there's gold out and there's valuable goods out. There's jewelry and there's all this shit out in the open air and you can walk right by it and you're like, why? And it's because people who touch you get their fucking hands cut off, which they should. This this softening of America on crime and on fucking criminals is bullshit. Yeah. And it's a lot of people who are addicted to keep ordering a society as is as you see this shit in Kansas City. Fucking with the mayor. Did you see what he was trying to claim that our fucking governor here in Missouri called the people who shot these people thugs and now the mayor of Kansas City is calling what's his face, the governor Parsons Parsons a fucking racist because he called them thugs. Well, I got some news for you, motherfucker. They are. And thugs isn't a fucking racial definition. It's a criminal. You're showing your own car. That's right. If you think that it's only black people or thugs, it's because you're a racist. Exactly. Yeah, you show your own cars, everybody. This motherfucker, these fucking turd shot up the kill the sink killed his mother and they're and you can't call them thugs. We should call them dead. Right. They should already be done. They should be all the way on the other side of the wood ship or fertilizing the earth. What the fuck should be happening until Americans come to the conclusion that we have to deal with harshness harshly. We're going to continue to all suffer. I don't know guys where you live. Can you drive in your downtown because we can't hear. Can't even go to a fucking restaurant without getting your shit fucked up. Is that the country you pay all these taxes to live in? That makes sense, man. Oh, but don't call them thugs. They're fucking thugs. Yeah, stupid man. I'm tired of the shit, dude. I'm fed up with the shit. I'm fed up with everything being a fucking justification for debaturing fucking criminality and nonsense and sexual deviance. I'm fucking tired of it. It's time to restore some fucking order in this country and its culture and it starts with you and me and everybody else calling shit the way it is. I'm not pussy fucking around. I don't want to offend anybody. Fucking they don't have any problem offending you. That's what the shit man. Guys, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up or thumbs fuck. Talk about not taking shit no more. That's a good topic. Hit thumbs up or thumbs fuck hell on reads. I like it. I like it too. I have to know anymore. Just give back to it, man. So a teen in Indiana is going viral after she defended herself against a rude customer who threw lemonade in her face inside of car wash. The video shows Anna. Her. Mm hmm. I pronounced that. I don't know. Who got the busting? Harry, her cheeky. Her cheek. Her fucking no man. Her name is Anna. Hey Anna. The video shows Anna 18 with a weird ass last name spraying water from a powerful hose through the open window of a rude customer's vehicle while working at the car wash. This ensued in real AF Andy for seller and DJ giving her a fucking trophy. So the 14 second. I like it. It works. It works. The 14 second clip shows Anna power washing a white sedan when this driver suddenly rolls her window down and chucks lemonade from a plastic cup at it in response Anna swiftly retaliates without missing a beat and sprays the driver with water from her power hose. Here's a video. I love it. Yeah. What the fuck was that exactly? And look, she's going to get. No, no, no, she's good. She's good. Anna's good. Anna safe. Anna safe. So she says quote, I was loading the car like I did with so many cars before that. Making sure they safely enter the car wash belt. Anna told what's the jam. A quote, once I pulled the car in all the way, I put the numbers into the system. So they got the car wash they paid for. Now many viewers have commented on the video, which has gone viral on Twitter. Uh, gone viral on X formally known as Twitter. We could cut out an hour and a half of fucking collective time on the show, just reading that one line. Just call it. Just call it. Just call it. Just call it. Fucking Twitter. How miserable do you have to be to throw a drink at a teenager doing a job? Another person said quote, what could possibly inspire someone to treat a completely innocent stranger like that? Another person wrote, there's no accountability for anything anyone does anymore. That's why these people have been raised to believe that there is no repercussions for their actions. And they have been raised that since they were fucking in kindergarten. Okay. So we're going to have to start punching motherfuckers into fucking face again. Do those fucking figuratively? Yeah, figuratively. Yeah, with our words. Yes. Those, uh, those fucking hoses hurt though, man. I hope it took her fucking face off. I hope it fucking caused permanent damage who throws a fucking lemonade on someone just trying to do a goddamn job. Yeah, it's fucking stupid. But uh, so Anna, who is a student, said her employer sided with her to ensure her workplace safety. She says quote, I told my managers who were not okay with the customer throwing a drink at me. She told the New York Post customer and her boyfriend have been banned from the Krawash for life. The Post reported. So what does Anna get, man? Anna gets a thumbs up, bro. She's 100%. It's under a trophy. I, I, I think she was too hot. That's dude throwing a lemonade on someone who's just doing their job for no reason. It's like these people we see going in the gas station destroying the gas station because they were out of a certain kind of cigarette or the person asked for something like bro, fuck all this shit. She got you know, those people should be shamed. They should be on every fucking website in the world. The people who threw lemonade. Yeah, fucking gross. It's real shit, man. Think of, think of doing that to someone. Think of pulling up to someone like think of the kind of person that would pull up. It's fucking trying to pull on bro would pull up to you know, like, you know, road workers. There's guys working on the side of the road. You pull up next to them. They're working and you take your lemonade and you fucking fling it on him. Think of the fucking piece of shit you'd have to be. I'm sick of these people bro. Yeah. Yeah, I fucking. Guys, Andy, that's all I got. Yeah, don't be a hoe. Try the shit.
