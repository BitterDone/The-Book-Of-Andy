Oh right yeah no man no awesome dude man awesome awesome dude glad to have you here brother. Well you guys want to do some cruising yeah. Let's get it. We want to get it into it. All right first well so before we get to our headlines I saw this video. And I just thought it was it was perfect. It kind of encompasses what we need right now in America. And what's what's really really important we talk about unity a lot on this show and I think it's very very important. So I wanted to play this clip because I think it just embodies exactly what we need right now. And it gets a little deeper to specifically about who who shared this video but here's the clip. Can't we all just get along at the Red House furniture. We can. At the Red House. I'm Richard aka Big Head. I work at the Red House and I'm black. I like puppet iron, a puppet furniture, and to people's homes. I'm Johnny aka Teen Gage. I work at the Red House and I'm white. I like deer hunting, bass fishing, and extending credit to all people. At the Red House. I'm black and I love the Red House. I'm white and I love the Red House. I'm a black woman and I love the Red House. I am white and the Red House is for me. At the Red House. This is real. This is a real person. Look at this sofa. It's perfect for a black person. All white person. This mattress is perfect for a white person. Or a black person. At the Red House. We're black people and white people by furniture. And expanding people too. You can't forget the Hispanic people. That's a real commercial. That's a real commercial. I like to give the white people the at the Red House. Why would we got to do that? They could have spiced it up a little bit more. They gave us white people the two cheesiest parts. It is what it is man. I was dying on his little handshake where you shaking it a little bit. It's so honored. That's a real commercial. I was able to factor in. I like it. And fishing, bass fishing. They call me Tangade. It's got to be a community service program. I love it. I mean, what about the community service program? I mean, a lot of people are in the neighborhood. I was thinking. I was, I was thinking of, who shared this? Who shared this? And it is from a couple of weeks ago. But Snoop Dogg shared this. He's the one to share this on his Instagram with the caption, just get along. And I thought that was interesting. I thought that was cool to see coming out of the left field there. He does seem like he's coming around, so influential, you know, and like that's what you choose to influence, you know. But yeah, it definitely is, he's definitely coming around. And the comments were overwhelmingly, very, very good. This commercial single handedly ended racism. Yeah, that's the most popular, or one of the most popular comments. Yeah, the other one I'm glad they included us to Spaniacs. I would love to lay on a couch like that. Yeah. Well, man, I thought it was because we do need a unity right now, man. And we need to get back to shit like this. Bro, I don't think that that's, I don't think that that's not how it is. Like, when you go out in the real world, everybody's cool. And everybody's looking at each other. Like, can you believe these dickheads are trying to make everybody hate each other? Yeah, absolutely. Like I don't, I don't know. I don't see any of this weird shit in real life other than on the internet or on TV. Yeah. I mean, one of us is see it. Yeah. I mean, you know, occasionally, but you're talking about what? One percent less than one percent of the time you'll see some some fucked up shit. Like, you know, maybe if you're a police officer, you see more of it. But the reality is, man, I think most people are on the same page. Most people are cool. They, they want to stop getting robbed of their taxes and stop being artificially divided and, you know, divided along racial lines or economic lines or religion lines. Like, bro, nobody's with that shit. And that's why this shit is so funny and people like it so much because they're like, yeah, that's that's some good shit. You know, and that's the good part about humor too, bro. Humor is universal, you know, and for a long time, you know, humor was, these young guys don't, don't remember this, bro. Like if you go back to the 80s and 90s, you know, these fucking everything was game, bro. Everybody talks shit on everybody. Everybody made fun of each other and it was funny. And then all of a sudden, you know, they ended desegregation in the schools and started making it. Gave it 20 years and called everybody racist and now fucking everybody's weird. You know, it's like, dude, we already fucking, this is not a deal. You know, well, what, what, what's your look on this? Because how are you? I'm 39. 39. I'm about the same age. Yeah. So I mean, what have you seen? What have you noticed the most? I guess with with your society when it comes to racial tension? I think something's like he's saying is like, everybody's cool until they get on the internet. Then like you're oppressed or you're offended. You're this year that like, and that's what bothers me about people that I know in real life that, you know, we'll be at the gym or we want to school. We have no issues with people at all. Like live good lives and have great friendships. But then on the internet, everybody's against you. Everybody's doing this. Everybody's doing that. And you're just a victim of this and that. And then you go go back to real life, see the gym or wherever and like, oh, hey, what's going on? Everything. And it's just like, hey, bro, you can't have both. Yeah. You either you're a victim or you're not, like it's like what's what's the deal? But, you know, obviously, you know, there's people that want us fighting amongst each other. So they perpetuate these things online or in the media. All the time. I'll take it back to when I was in like middle school. I'd watch certain movies like American history X every once in a while or rose with where which two movies I probably should have been watching or whatever. But high racial tensions and stuff like that. And every time I saw movies like this, I would make me angry. It triggers emotional response, which certain things are designed to. So it's like, I think they're just putting certain things out there to trigger these emotional responses and give people who are all up against each other. But day-to-day basis, people actually get along without the nonsense that they keep putting or pushing. Yeah, it's interesting. You don't see you don't ever see, you don't ever see why don't white crime on the internet. And you don't ever see black on black crime on the internet. Every single time they show these incidents, if we're paying attention, it's why don't black or black on white. That's right. And it's designed to stir everybody's emotions and get everybody pissed off. And dude, when you think of the millions of videos, the millions of crimes that are out there like literally every week, and it just so happens that it's always the same story, I think people have caught on to it. I think the first, when George Floyd happened, I think a lot of people were emotionally charged and that really stirred up a lot of shit. And I think as time has gone on, people have started to realize, oh, this wasn't exactly what we thought it was. And we saw guys like Snoop Dogg and these other main guys saying some divisive shit that I think they're starting to realize, hey, this isn't, we're falling for a play here. It's not a reality on an everyday scenario. We've got to become more like the Red House. That's all I'm saying. Well, sweet man, let's get into this crew. I mean, what do you think, dude? Yeah, I mean, I would like to start seeing what we know is true in reality to overwhelm the internet. I'm saying like more of this shit, you know, more like post this stuff. You know what I'm saying? Let's show online what it's like in reality. That's what I would like to see. Dude, I think humor is the key, bro. I think comedians are going to save the world. Like the content you make, how you make it like in a funny way. Yeah, dude, that's the stuff. That's the stuff that is going to make people like say, yeah, this is ridiculous. I get a lot of comments saying like, you know, thank God, some of my saying it and so like that. It's awesome. It's so many people that, you know, agree with you, but they don't want to share it, put it on their page. Yeah, yeah, they don't want to say it themselves and everything. We're like, yeah, I feel the same way. This isn't that. You know, but yeah, if people would, if people would say that publicly, we would solve a lot of these problems, man. Absolutely. Yeah. 100% man. Well, let's get into this cruise thing. Guys, remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find them. Link there. That being said, head on number one. Let's just do a little world global temperature check. Maybe. All right, head on number one. We got a couple of things to go through here. First things up is 911 call services. Mysteriously go down in four states at the same time hours before ABC reported DHS is concerned emergency services are target for cyber attack. So this is this comes out. Yeah, so so DHS released a bulletin saying that emergency services were being targeted for cyber attack. And then a few hours after that bulletin goes out, you got four states, who's 911 emergency systems go down. The states were South Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, and also Texas. Now, it's so interesting how they try to cover stuff up. But you left the roll over to CNN. They released this headline that says 911 service provider, Lumen blames 911 outage on installation of light pole. Two life pole. One light pole for four states. Four states. And even admit that in the article, how like, yeah, I mean, this doesn't make sense, but that's what we're going with. The article reads the outage of 911 system in several states Wednesday evening was caused by the installation of a light pole. According to Lumen, a company that supports some of those systems, quote, on April 17th, some customers in Nevada, South Dakota, and Nebraska experienced an outage due to third party company installing a light pole unrelated to our services. Lumen global issues director Mark Mollzen told CNN Thursday morning. And outage was also reported in a fourth state, Texas. Mollzen said Lumen, a networking company that provides enhanced 911 services to local communities in multiple states does not provide 911 services in Texas. So how is that affected? So wait, does it make sense? The fucking line. Um, you know, but criminals taking out light poles and that's what it is. That's what it is. It's, it's nationalist. That's what it is. It's fucking white people. That's what it is. That's what it is. Fucking I'm so fucking tired of what I'm just listen. I'm I've had it up to here with me too. Yeah. Oh, that's season chicken. Fucking gross. Um, fucking snow like baloney. Yeah. I got water. That's the actual no, but you know, it's interesting. So I mean, you know, I saw this, you know, I saw this when it came out last night, you know, it was interesting. So it was not much of this come out. I think the timing of everything is a little interesting. Um, but, but maybe maybe a little bit more to more to come on that one. Um, other things checking in on the global stage. Uh, Israel, they aborted their plan to carry out a retaliatory strike on Iran. Um, that night, I decided not to proceed following a discussion with Biden. Um, not sure what the discussion was, but I'm sure it had something to do with money. Um, either a package is being held or some type of something going on there, but it is interesting why the, the all stop was, uh, was given a no go, no, no go signal was given. Um, you know, I ran it launch more than 300 drones and missiles over the weekend. Um, in an unprecedented attack on Israel and, uh, Biden told Netanyahu to, to, to know. And so I'm sure has something to do with eight packages, um, which let's talk about eight packages here for a second. Um, House GOP erupts into name calling and fresh threats. The Johnson over effort to pass eight. So right now there's a single bill measure going on to put more money in Ukraine, right? And everybody's kind of up in arms, of course, because nobody wants more money to go to Ukraine. This is CNN's article. Um, they're actually trying to, uh, to threaten Mike Johnson, the speaker to step down. Uh, threatening they're going to kick him out of this position if he tries to push this through. Um, because for whatever reason, he's kind of flagship in this effort. Right wing lawmakers are ramping up their threats to remove speaker mic Johnson from his role. After Johnson supporters pushed him to make it harder to oust him from the speaker ship. CNN and other articles reported Thursday morning that according to multiple GOP sources, Johnson is being lobbied by his members to raise the threshold required to trigger the procedure to oust the speaker. Um, so they're really trying to get him out right now with that, um, because of this bill, um, that they're trying to pass to give more money to Ukraine. Um, now Major Taylor green, she just, uh, put in some some new amendment suggestions to this bill. Why do you always call her Majority? What is it? It's Marjorie. Oh, see that are in there for the J. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's fine. Yeah, you're saying they fuck up my name all the time. That's because your name is like Davi O'Neal. Right. Yeah, right. Isn't that what it is? Majority. Yeah. The R silent. R sound. It's like Evioni, only. Yeah. Marjorie. Okay. I'm sorry. MTG. Uh, but she put in amendments, uh, in this bill, uh, that members who vote for the aid would have to go conscript to the Ukrainian army. I like that. I like it. Absolutely. I think that's how it should be. Yeah. 100%. That's how it should be kids too. Oh, war. Go ahead. Yeah. So, uh, Marjorie Taylor Green is introduced in the amendment to a foreign aid bill to require members of Congress who vote in favor for of providing aid to Ukraine to join the country's military. The Republican Georgia Congresswoman proposed amendments to the long negotiated foreign aid bills for Ukraine and Israel on Wednesday night. Have the House Speaker Mike Johnson told representatives that they would vote on three separate bills. The further bill is being put forward by the endo Pacific region, including military funding for Taiwan. Green, uh, who has long argued against providing any further funding to Ukraine. Introduce three amendments to the Ukraine's Security Supplemental Appropriations Act. One of her amendment states that quote, any member of Congress who votes in favor of this act shall be required to constript in the Ukrainian military. So, my good past might not, I don't know, but that's how a fucking should be. Absolutely. Dude, I agree, man, you know, these people said and other people's children to die, you know, for these wars that don't end up meaning anything, they end up just making them a whole bunch of money and taking a whole bunch of money out of our pockets, which is double salt in the wound, right? You take their kids and you take the money and you make them poor and these people are out of control, dude. They're running wild. They're out of control. They, they are drunk on their own power and there needs to be some, some constraints and limitations and maybe if something like this would happen, they think twice about having to go to war. That should be for any, any war. I agree. Yeah, not just funding it, but like any conflict that we get into. Yeah, nobody supports this, man. Nobody supports this, man. Nobody. Nobody. Go back a few, a few slides. Back one more. Oh, the Netanyahu conversation. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think that, I think that didn't just have to do with money. I think it also had to do with Joe Biden's in a very unique position right now, because a lot of his leftist base is pro Palestine. So they got themselves twisted up a lot right now. You know, and it's interesting and I don't think they can navigate out of it at this point in time. You know, so I don't think those, like do you see any of these pro Palestine people voting for Biden? No, I don't think so either. I don't think they'll vote for Trump, but I just think they probably won't vote. Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, it is such a, it's so interesting how the left always finds themselves in these like, now I think a lot of pro Palestine, it's time people will vote for Trump. Yeah, but I'm just saying, which would might be kind of weird because he's very, he's pro Israel, but you know, it's going to be interesting. I think Biden's got himself in a in a pretty big bind with his own with his own. I would say, I mean, like I would say Trump's pro Israel, but I also don't think that means he's like anti Palestine. You know what I'm saying? He still doesn't believe that they should be fucking Trump's policy says he's pro humanity. Right. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, one interview where he said I'm tired of people dying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm tired of seeing people die and we try to pay him for it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Because like people, that's what other thing people don't want it. People forget too, like, you know, all those, those drones and all of those missiles that I ran just fired, guess who gets who gets who's got to get who bought that shit. Oh, yeah. Dude, we did. We're afraid. That was from that six billion dollars, right? That's right. You know, the Elliott Davis, you paid for it. You made it. That's our shit. And then we're also paying for the fucking shit to shoot the shit down. Yeah, right, right. We're paying for the American. The American citizens are paying for these wars that they do not believe in or want. And then, and then they, we go to the gas station, we can't afford gas. We go to the grocery store, do the average Americans paying like nine thousand dollars more to live than they were just two years ago. You see what I'm saying? And like, dude, we're paying for this shit that we don't want. These people are completely, and I'm not talking Democrats. I'm talking all of them. They're completely off the reservation and out of touch with what the American people want. And everybody should remember this come election time, not just for the presidential election, but for everyone. Yeah. Oh, man. It's fucking stupid. Yeah, guys, jump in on the conversation. Let us know what you guys think, Donald. Yeah. I want to know how many of you guys stink like legitimately. Tell me, how many of you guys stink that we should be paying for these wars out of our tax dollars at all. How many of you guys think that your tax dollars should be sent overseas for any reason at all considering the shape of our own country? I'm, I'm, please let me know because I would like to get a temperature check on that. Yeah. That's real shit, man. Well, speaking of the comments, let's go cruise on. Oh, okay. Yeah. Some good ones said that. Oh, do we? Yeah, we do. All right. This first comment comes from at I am DC 322. Okay. He says, I'll be honest, some of this issue you talk about is too toxic to listen to early in the morning, but do you, bro? And then one of our listeners reply, listen, a nice. I love our listeners. They're so fucking funny. It's great. Yeah, respectful. Yeah, bro. Hey, listen, nobody's begging you to listen. I'm not, I'm not twisting your arm, man. You didn't decline my invite. I don't really care if you listen or not. Listen, but here's the thing I will say to you, bro. As, as, as frustrating as it is for you to listen to, it's 10 times more frustrating to have to come in here for me, being where I'm at my life and have to talk about this. This is not what I want to do. I've worked my whole life to become successful in business. And honestly, it's hard for me to enjoy it when I know that the world is falling down. And the reason that I talk about these things is for people like you, brother, who are trying to come out here in the world and do things and create things and build things. And I'm an entrepreneur and I recognize that in the current state of reality, it's going to be that much harder for an entrepreneur to build what I've been fortunate enough to build. This country has treated me very well. And I want to protect that for guys like you, man. So I understand. Yeah, dude, some of it can get under your skin and some of it can be frustrating, but sticking our heads in the sand and saying, hey, it's just too toxic to listen to. I'm going to just go look over here. That's just going to ensure that we never get where we want to go. So I can understand that, bro, and I can relate to that because I got to come in here and talk about it. And there's a number of days that I come in here and talk about it, dude. And I leave here so angry that it really just ruins my day the rest of the day. So I feel that man no disrespect, but you know, we also have a responsibility of citizens to know what's going on. And that's why I do this, man. So I feel what you're saying, but, you know, we do got to pay attention and we got to take action. I was wearing some coffee first. Yeah. But I do love our guys telling them I have a first form. I needed to get you going. Now, man, that's not, you know, I get it. I get it. Yeah. I'll wake up early in the morning. I need this to get me through some of that cardio. Bro, by the time I wake, by the time I wake up, dude, you've already shared the show every day, dude. I look at Will is the first dude that shares the show. That's real shit. The first dude. And I, by the way, I fucking really appreciate it. Oh, I appreciate you. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we got one more. Gotta address some some bullshit. Oh, okay. Let's comment. This comment comes from at Ryan underscore Galka. He says, let's get DJ some recognition for his jokes. Now, I want you to look at these fucking comments from these assholes. Hashtag. Absolutely not DJ. Nice try DJ. Yeah, DJ. We ain't falling for it. DJ getting creative with the name. Okay, Ryan Galka. My name's homie. Quote, I'm not DJ. He's just extremely funny and deserves a trophy and a huge bonus. Man it on there. Pretty thick there. DJ. Listen to your guys. Like when Kevin, Kevin, Brian, that is fucking awesome. Look how long this should have. You need to hire Ryan Galka, AKA yourself to be your agent. DJ is going to come in and be like, I got an agent. That's right here. His name is Ryan. That's fucked up. That's fucked up. What is that? Man 23 fucking comments like that. Yeah. Get him. Dude, I love our people, bro. Like when people fucking smart off in the comments, they just bury it. Oh, I love it. And I do love how they got a set to humor about. I love it. I fucking love these guys. No, man. We appreciate all you guys being real ass fans. Yeah. No trouble. No trouble. I appreciate you guys, man. Keep liking, commenting. Make sure you hit that. Well, you can see DJ at home. That was hilarious. And he deserves a huge bonus. I don't fucking care what you guys say. Oh, 5000 likes. I get a trophy. Run it. Run that shit up. All right. Well, let's keep moving. We got to head line up to head line up to reach Megan Kelly's stunned by Katie current comments about jealous Trump voters. Megan Kelly is bad fucking ass. I love Megan. Yeah. Megan's awesome. And I did her show. Yeah, I remember that. She's a come on this one. Yeah, I love to have her on the show. She's bad ass. She tells people what the fuck is up. Takes no shit. Yeah. Yeah. Leave no prisoners. I went on that first time and I didn't know like, I didn't know like what the limits were, right? Like I didn't know if I could like say it. Like I'd ask her in the show. I'm like, can I curse? Yeah. And then like, because I didn't like watch much of her clips or anything. Yeah. And then I go to her clips. I'm like, Holy shit. Bro, she probably thinks I'm a bitch because I was so polite on the show. I thought you guys said he was fucking real. Hey, hey, hey, had me back on. I'll give you the full the full cannons. Yeah. Fuck. I was trying to be respectful when I go on other people's show because I don't know, but then I watch hers and I'm like, damn, all right. You left someone to tell you. Yeah. But yeah, so let's talk into this a little bit. So Megan Kelly was left virtually speechless by Katie Kerrick's recent comments describing supporters of former president Donald Trump as driven by quote, anti intellectualism. What's that mean? That means we're stupid. And oh, we so like like we hate smart people or intelligent people. Is that what that means? I, you know what? I'm too dumb to know. To get that. Uh, Kelly played a clip of a recent interview that Kerrick gave to Bill Mar on this podcast in which he described political polarization in the country. Quote, talk about not getting it. Kelly said on Wednesday's editions of the Megan Kelly. Show here is the clip. She's referencing Katie Kerrick who sat down with Bill Mar and said the following. Take a listen to this. It's not 30. And I feel like to your point bill that socioeconomic disparities are a lot and class resentment is a lot what and anti intellectualism and elitism is what is driving many of these these anti establishment, which are Trump voters. Anti-establishment voters. So I think that is a huge problem that we have to address. I mean, globalization and, you know, the transition from an industrial to a technological society. I mean, I, and I don't know if you've ever been jealous of some what someone else has or resentful. It is such a corroding and bitter almost byel feeling. Yeah. That's our first time. That's not Katie's. Katie's first time. She once said that Trump supporters need to be deprogrammed. You guys remember that one? The big tech media push to see conservative thought we did out of all the spaces they control is marching forward one day before President-elect Joe Biden assumes office. So this was back in 2020 with a promise to heal the United Americans during an appearance on Fridays on HBO's real time with again Bill Mar, a former CBS news anchor Katie Kerrick rebuked Republicans who failed to vote in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump and suggested that 74 million Americans who voted for the outgoing commander in chief need to be deprogrammed. Here's a clip. Okay. And as much as I'm worried about these loans who break into government, I'm actually more worried about the loans who did get elected because I mean, what do you do about these people? There's 147 Republicans in Congress who still don't concede that Trump lost the election. What do you do about people who are in the government who don't believe in our way of government? It is so shocking not only are they not conceding Bill, but there's thoughts that there might have been some collusion among members of Congress some are refusing to go through magnometers or whatever you call them to to check for weapons. They're not wearing masks during the siege. I mean, it's really bizarre when you think about how a wall so many of these members of Congress have gotten, but I also think some of them are believing the garbage that they are being fed 24 seven on the internet by their constituents and they bought into this big lie. And the question is how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump? Yeah, that's what I guess who's she's talking about? Who are the who who's she talking about? Well, she's talking about everybody that isn't in their little echo chamber class. Don't have purple hair. No, it's not even that. They don't care about those purple hair people. No, they only care about themselves. They use those people to get an outcome. You know what I'm saying? It's interesting though when you listen to her talk because she's so dumb she doesn't understand how dumb she is. You know, she's sitting here talking about the resentment of class and the jealousy of class. And those people created that intentionally. They're the ones that created class warfare. It is a fundamental element of Marxism and communism. And they're the ones when she mentions, you know, oh, the involvement into globalization, that is communism, which is why they fucking hate you. And we do hate you, by the way. And the reason that we do hate you is because you're a liar, you're a gas lighter. And she literally is sitting there on Bill Mar admitting that she is elite class and that everybody else is below her. And what do you think somebody who's been on TV or whole life who probably thinks she's the biggest celebrity in the fucking world? You know, how else is she see the world? You know, she sees regular people as people who clean her fucking toilets. She doesn't see it like when was the last time she pumped her own gas or went out in reality? When was the last time she walked the streets of middle America or one of these cities that is crumbling because of the policies that these people have put in place? And the narrative she fucking propensioned. And not only that, bro, the money that these people are making off of that plate. So it's interesting to me for her to sit there and think that she's so intellectual and reality she's just telling on herself. What do you think brother? I think that they're projecting, the projected. Yeah, they're doing. Yeah, to Trump and what they call the mega Republican. Yeah, like 100%. Then when she's talking about the feeling of being jealous and all that, she knows it. She knows she feels it every day, but yeah, I just feel like it's blaming the other side for what they're actually doing. Yeah, I know you are, but what am I? Yeah, but the thing is is that what they're trying to create, the division that they propagate in the division that they're trying to create has now turned their focus on to these people. And what we've seen over the last two years, at least, is that this progressive movement, this leftist movement, which is different than a Democrat movement. This is leftist progressiveness is borderline Marxist slash communist. It's the crazy shit. We're not talking about reasonable Democrats from 20 years ago. The overt and window has shifted so far left that when we say left, it actually means people that are off the spectrum of true democracy, or republic. So when we look at these people and what they've done and what they've propagated in terms of identity and class warfare and division, all that's happening is that it's starting to turn on themselves, which is what we've seen over the last few years. We've seen their narratives crumble time after time after time. The stories crumble time after time after time. The people who they've been using, who they used in 19, you know, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 to do all of this stuff, you know, make life super divisive over Trump, you know, the racial division, the division amongst gay and straight people, the division amongst, you know, wealthy people and middle class people. They've done all this intentionally. And now those people who have been continually told all of these things are turning their focus on the people who have actually done it. So that's really what it is. Yeah. I see it. You know, when she talks about these people who are anti-into-elections, they're anti-no, we're just sick of your shit. Yeah. We're sick of your shit. And it's not like there's, you can't just like look out into the crowd and be like, oh, that that person's a, you know, because they like Trump there. That's not stupid. We're sick of your shit. Right. And we all look different, bro. Like we don't, we don't look the same. Here's, here's an example of somebody that's sick of the shit. Yeah. This is a black woman in fucking Chicago. Yeah. The bluest of blue you could possibly get and they're having a mat. Look at her t-shirt. What does it say? Chicago red. Look at her fucking hat. Right. She didn't vote Republican before this, this year. I guarantee it. Right. But let's, let's possible, but probably not. I don't know. I'll show you. She didn't. Okay. You know, and so like, that's the thing. And so like, we're sick of the shit. We're sick of American, American people are sick of being treated as third-class citizens with the policies they put in. What they choose, what our government chooses to focus on and raise up. We're sick of it. We're fucking sick of it. And it's happening all over the country. And I love to bring awareness to it when it does. Now, this headline reads, Black Chicago voters ripped mayor on extra $70 million dollars from migrants as recall petition gathered steam infuriated black Chicago and showed up in force at a city council meeting on Wednesday to protest mayor Brandon Johnson's request for an additional $70 million dollars in taxpayer funds to be spent on tackling the city's migrant crisis while a petition that would give residents the right to recall the mayor is gathering serious traction. The progressive mayor, who has vigorously defended the city's sanctuary policies in the past, wants alderman to green light the extra cash and a vote on Friday despite the windy city having already poured $300 million dollars into housing, food and healthcare for the recently arrived illegals according to the city's latest numbers. Here is the clip that Fox News covers. Now, to align yourself with somebody who's obviously a one-term mayor, if he even makes it that far, you better be worried about your job, you better be worried about your longevity because we're going to vote and we're going to get you out because you ain't doing right by us. That's what time it is. Now, Johnston's planned attack on another $70 million dollars to migrant funding. Restoration building to the point that some voters are now working to get him out of office as you heard that constituent they're saying. Garrett, Tenney, live in Chicago with the story. Hi, Garrett. Yeah, Dan, good morning to you. This migrant issue has become an Achilles heel for Mayor Brandon Johnson so much so that there are now multiple efforts underway to vote out Democrats and the mayor. We saw that yesterday at the city council meeting where several groups of black voters showed up wearing red shirts with the words no more blue, go red and turn Chicago red. Many of these folks are lifelong Democrats who are now actively working to shake up deep blue Chicago specifically because of how the mayor and the governor have handled the migrant crisis, doling out more than a billion dollars so far for that. And here they are warning the mayor and city council about transferring another $70 million dollars from the city's rainy day fund to take care of the migrants. We need that money in my neighborhood. We need that on my block. So I'm asking y'all to use our tax money for our people. We need it. You've voted money for these immigrants today and we come and put them seats. You can believe that. The police are fighting with them in the shelters that you guys are funding. You guys think it's a great idea but yeah, your guys' officers are getting out of the house. You're welcome. It's getting attacked. Currently, state law does not allow voters to recall Chicago's mayor but after seeing how Mayor Johnson's first year has gone with the migrants in crime, a new group wants to change that by getting a referendum on the ballot this November that would pave the way to voting Johnson out. Now, you know, and the crazy thing is too is like, you know, speaking about these these illegals, they're asking for more. Like with all the sanctuary cities, it's been over a billion dollars right now that is when it's all these things. And that's not asking. They're demanding. They're demanding. They're demanding. That's right. I saw this yesterday. What you're about to talk about. The man, you know, let's get into it. Yeah, they're demanding it. What we got on this guys? Well, did you see the rally yesterday? The protest? There was a thousand migrants there and it was it was very, very, very similar to the Soros organized BLM riots. They had a migrant up there with a megaphone. They were doing chants. All the shirts, the signs. Yeah, dude, they had, they were all the same signs. You know what I'm saying? I still believe that what we're going to have this summer is a conflict of migrants. Similar to what we had with the summer of 2020. Only this time it's going to be migrants. It's definitely ramping up. Yeah, more and more, man. Like, yeah, cases of these these illegals that are, you know, killing American citizens and getting off or walk its got free or getting like, it's increasing for sure. Yeah, that's saying it nicely. Well, yeah, I think and I think they're doing that to raise the level of animosity between the two, which I don't know that you could really raise it anymore because people are sick of it. You know, and like that lady said, she's very, very, very true or very accurate. You know, our money should go to our neighborhoods. And I, you know, I obviously can't speak for the black communities anywhere. But if I were a black person in the black community, I would be more pissed than anybody else because they come in every fucking four years and they talk about how they're going to build schools and build infrastructure and fun things and do all these things. And they never do any of it. They just take the money. And I would say my only thing to this is, you know, anybody who's switching their perspective on who they're going to vote for, you have to be careful and don't be one of these people that just votes red. Right. Make sure you're just it. Yeah, right. Like I understand the same. But there are people who are Republicans also who are cut from the same cloth as these people that are Democrats. And so we have to be careful to make sure that we do our research. See who the real patriots are. See who the real Americans are. See who the people are that actually care about us and our neighborhoods and our people and American citizens. And, and, I mean, this is definitely nice to see. But, you know, we got to be careful not to just blindly vote for people either. Yeah. And I, I haven't seen those two before, but there's been different clips with one lady in particular who's spoke out of these town hall meetings saying, hey, crimes already high, you know, we need this money here in our communities and you give them this to the migrants, you put them up in places to stay, everything like that. Hey, tell Donald Trump to come holler this. Yeah, I see. Yeah, yeah, I saw that too. Yeah. And, you know, a lot of people are getting sick and tired of it. Just an unfortunate 70 million. Like, we're I think it's way more than that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, 300 has already adjusted Chicago alone there at 300 million. And that's an additional 70. And this is an additional 70 that's actually that's supposed to be kept for emergency situations. Yeah. For Chicago. And he and him been there that long. No, he hasn't even been in the four years. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Already. Yeah. What do you guys think the change has been for the black communities? Because it's definitely there is definitely momentum change happening. Yeah. You know, when we when we looked at 2020, I think it was only like six to nine percent of the black community voted for Trump. And now they're talking like 40, 50 percent. Right. So what do you think that is? Or what's spurring that? I know, I know you guys could probably speak for everybody. Yeah. I mean, isn't chairman. The black delegation. Yeah. That's right. I'm sure we'll, we'll just get to more than me for sure. Everybody come after me and again. Not again, hitting the pocket books. Yeah. Like everybody else. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, kind of forward this kind of forward that. And then, you know, inflation, everything else like that is like, damn, I was already struggling. Now I'm about to struggle even more. But now y'all putting these people up, y'all, you know, helping everybody else out, except the American people like, it's like enough enough. Yeah. I think I think that was a big deal. It was like, because like you saw this like string of the narrative switch it for like reparations. That was a big, big, big talk for many, right? And then immediately following that, this illegal immigration situation comes and they see all this money going in all of this money that, you know, black, the black community has been crying for reparations for years. And listen, I don't think we need it. Right? However, if we were going to do it, you know, I'm saying, like, if that was going to be an actual conversation that we laid out, it's like those conversations have not happened in decades. Right? But then, you know, we can get these illegal immigrants that come in and they get all of it. A billion dollars has already went to to to to to aiding these causes. Right? And so it's like, I think that was a major wake up for a lot of people like, well, holy shit, like we've been crying. And then the same people that, you know, are telling us and promising us all of this hope and change, you know, these new people come in and you immediately take to them and you're giving them thousands of dollars a month, free, like, they, they, I think a lot of black people just felt fucking abandoned. And I think that's what what sparked a lot of that change, man. Yeah. Well, you showing them you got the money is just like, right? It's like, hey, you have the money right here or whatever, but they ain't coming to you like we problems. It's going to be right in our face. Right. Right in the face. Absolutely. It's interesting to me because, you know, when they, when they, they met, you know, if you think back to when Trump was in office and he wanted to build that wall, right? The $5 billion. Yeah. For five billion. Right. That's it. And they made the migrant issue, a racism issue. Right. Right. And, and they, as a Hispanic issue, Mexico. Yeah. Right. Well, they made it a race, a race issue. And it's interesting because like, when they made it, it's almost like if you look back, it's like they made this a race issue so that the black community would, would not really tie the two together because when they hear racism, it's just racism, right? And, and it wasn't until these people showed up and they're fucking neighborhood and they're like, wait a minute. Yeah. Very fucking. Yeah. Now, suddenly racist. But look, dude, you know, like this is, this is, you know, for, for two years, DJ, and I got called all kinds of names because we were talking about this. And guys, this is what we were talking about. You know what I mean? And it's just, I, we just got to get back to understanding that America is for everybody, bro. And it's not for these people who come here illegally. It's not for the criminals of the other countries of the world. It's not for 10 million military age males that are going to come harass our women and fuck with our communities. Those people got to go. But for us who have been born here, Black, white, Asian, Latino, we're all the same, bro. We all bleed red. And we need to be working together in a unified fashion to keep our country safe. And that's, it's starting to happen. But, but dude, like, you know, if these people go to get deported, I don't think people understand like what that's going to look like. Yeah. You know, that's going to not be a, it's not going to be a fun thing to look at. And they're going to turn this into another big race issue because of that. Because like, bro, they're going to, they're going to have to put checkpoints and like, check papers. Yeah, dude. And they're going to tie it in. They're going to lose IDs. Right. When Trump starts doing that, they're going to be like, Oh, look, he's Hitler. You know what I'm saying? And we know that's what they call them in the White House. Did you see that come up? What? Trump's nickname in the White House is Hitler pig. I mean, that doesn't surprise me. I'm just saying that could have came over like something a little bit more zingier. Yeah. Well, dude, you know, and then they're talking about him banning books and but like in Florida, they're banning books. Yeah, dude, but they never, they ones. Yeah. They never, they never say they never say what the books are. Yeah. You know, they tried it. They tried to say, Oh, well, the, the books are like the life of Jody. Catcher in the eye. Fucking dick in that book. But we can't have it, dude. Not how to change your gender without your parents permission. Yeah. Dude, exactly. And dude, if you go back to the book burning that happened in the 30s and like, people get mad when you say this saying books, they got burned into 30s. Exactly. Books. Yeah. I'll do it. That's why they call them Hitler, bro. Because there's a lot of parallels there. There's also a lot of complete polar opposite viewpoints. But just because we want to remove information that isn't appropriate for our kids, we don't let our kids get fucking tattoos when they're three. We don't let kids watch porn when they're fucking three. We don't let kids drink alcohol when they're three. So why are we letting grown men go in there and shake their dicks? Why are we letting these people read kids books that have blow jobs and fucking, and then they say, well, they got to learn about it sometime. Bro, you learn about it when you learn about it when you start going through puberty. You fucking ass holes are stealing these kids' childhoods, man. When I was a kid, bros out playing in the dirt, man, I was like digging holes and fucking, you know, being a kid, you know, and they didn't, I don't know what you guys did, but that's what we did. We dug holes in it. They were playing outside. Yeah, through mud, pies at crack. Yeah, dude. We played, we played baseball in the yard. We played, you know, dude, we weren't thinking about like any of this stuff. I didn't even know, you know, like I didn't even know like anything until I was like started hitting puberty and shit, you know, and even then, bro, it still has to be done in a very responsible manner. Yeah, but dude, part of like these people's argument is, well, they got to learn about it because because if they don't, they won't know what this is. Well, no shit because it's not fucking natural, right? You're not allowing them to go out and like experience their first kiss or, you know, learn about what they are into or what they're not into or like what they like. Like, yeah, dude, okay, someone turns 13, 14 years old and, you know, maybe they are gay, okay? But they discover that they're not fucking told that from the time they're three. Or with some of these crazy abusive parents who hold up their infant, or infant is trans. The fuck I knew it. Yeah. I just posted a video the other day of a little girl who was eight, and she didn't want to go through female puberty and stuff like that. So her parents, like, okay, well, you know, you can go on the hormone blockers and shit like that or whatever. And she's eight. It's like, how do I say? You know what I'm saying? It's wild. And to go back to the migrant thing, not only, you know, is some of the stuff they're doing is slapping the face of black people, but also the immigrants that came over legally, you know, this is the right way. That's a lot of stuff I get in my comments when I was talking about this stuff. People be like, nah, we came over here the right way. Did this, this and that? Fuck all the legal shit. Like we need to come through like we had to. Okay. A lot of those people would take that should take years. Yeah. And money and they're paying, you know, paying for certain things or whatever kind of get through and everything and people coming over just to get and getting a check in the place to stay and all that one. It's like, fuck, I should have waited five years. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. What do you think, dude? What do you think about that having go through that whole process and seeing all these people come over? Yeah. I think it's a little bit unfair. I mean, even like I pride myself in being a hard working person and just seeing someone. I know the process it takes to get get the citizenship and you know, it's a long process. There's a lot of bullshit kind of that goes throughout the way and just seeing people come here and not only come here, but also disrespect the land. It's it's very disheartening. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I I'm with you. I think it should be harsh. I think we should just run them up and send them back to the school. Fuck yeah. No, let's do it. That's coming from our immigrant. Yeah. I mean, I'm legal. Legal. Yeah. Thank you. But I know I listen real shit though. I'm going to foreshadow some shit on this this Chicago stuff. Right. Because they're trying to do this recall that they're putting in, right? Here's the thing. There's already been president set for this New York City has already, I believe put the bill bill into to get this done. They're going to give those migrants the right to vote in Chicago in their local elections and hopes that they'll overwhelm whatever recall that, you know, the actual Chicago and American people are tired of. They're going to give those migrants the right to vote in Chicago. Mark my words. Oh, I think they're going to try to give them the vote, the right to vote nationally. Yeah. Yeah. See, like nationally, I'm not I feel like there's a pre-quote. We'll have jurisdiction over that, but they don't have jurisdiction over local, local level elections. So they're going to start there for sure. And then once they build up enough presidents, well, don't you think they're going to try to get these people amnesty and citizenship before November 100% 100% this could be a mass fucker. 100% yeah. They're hand in these people flyers along the way through Mexico, reminding them to vote for Biden. Listen, dude, Hillary, Hillary Clinton's daughter runs one of the NGOs that is doing this shit, passing those flyers out. Yeah. And think think about this from a fundamental like reality perspective. They ruin the lives of so many American citizens that they that the American citizens say, hey, we're not voting for you anymore. We're not with it anymore, just like those women said on on TV there. And then these people are such pieces of shit that they say, well, you know what, we don't need those people. We'll just import more people and we'll give them the right to vote. And we'll stay in power and we'll be able to continue to do these things. Like this is the level of arrogance and elitism that we're dealing with. These people think they are the rulers of us. And until people come together and unify and understand what we are up against, this is not left right that we are up against. This is an establishment of elitism and people who believe that they are better than us who are imposing their will, whether we like it or not, they are creating a scenario where our vote does not matter so that they can continue to profit and they can continue to stay in power. That's what's happening, dude. So like, doesn't matter where you come from or what part of you voted for or who you identify with politically, your vote's going to be irrelevant because of what these people are doing. And that's dude, that's to me, that's treason. Like you're ignoring the will of the people and intentionally making a situation where we don't have control over our own country anymore. These people are not Americans. These are, just seven out of 10 of these people are military age males. Okay. And we have these scenarios of women all, and it's this is another interesting sort of like how they used racism to let these people to create the social acceptance for these people to come here. A lot of these upper middle class white women who vote for all this progressive shit but live in their little m-matching out in the fucking, you know, and the burbs. Yeah. And they don't ever touch reality, right? And they think they're being noble and they think they're being kind and they think they're being big-hearted. Those are the people that are getting attacked by the migrants. And now they're like, well, where are the men? Well, remember what you did for the last 10 years where you ran around and said, you don't need any men and that men are toxic and toxic masculinity and me too. And all this shit to suppress men's opinions and their presence in general. Like do you remember that? You know, we see these these dudes, you know, swimming in pools with girls and winning championships and, you know, beaten girls up in sports. And we got these suburban night moms saying, where are the men? Well, you fucking silenced the men for 10 years. Now you want them back? Like dude, let us do what the fuck we're supposed to do and stop thinking that you're overly virtuous by voting for things that you have no reality or no concept of what's actually going on. You know, like if you don't actually know what's going on, then just don't fucking vote. You know what I'm saying? Like just choose not to vote. You don't know because you're vote and you guys that go to brunch and stick your fucking pinkies up and then brag to your friends about, you know, how virtuous you are. You're fucking creating these scenarios that you're complaining about and you don't even realize it. Yeah, it's real shit. Yeah, real shit. Guys, let's keep this show moving. We got headline number three. This is a this is a good one to see. This is a good one to see. We talked a little bit about, you know, our young generation of kids that are obviously being targeted. You know, and being having these narratives and ideologies pushed down the throats. There's a there's a pushback from those kids. Nice. This is good to see. This headline reads, furry infestation. Middle school students walk out and protest after school leaders allow furries to terrorize them. They bite scratch bark chew on sticks, have a kitty litterbox and bathroom and you got middle school students that are protesting this and they walk out of the school. This is this is awesome. It's diving to this. So middle school students at Mount Nebo School and Paisen, Utah held a walk out protest today against unhinged school officials that allow furries to terrorize them at school. Students report in the video below that the furries bite, scratch and bark at them. Furries also chew on sticks and clasps and have a kitty litterbox with set up in the girls restroom for them to use. So for those of you guys that don't know what a furry is, these are furries. These are people who dress up as dogs and cats would tell some not as creative as these costumes and they believe they are these animals. But these are grown people, these are adults and there's kids who do this as well. And so they're over it. They're completely over it. So in the there's a video this guy, his Twitter handle is life is driving. He did this whole expose they own the story. But he also noted that they are required to keep distance from furries whereas the same rules do not apply for the furries. So the school is telling these kids that hey if you don't like it just keep distance from them. But they're not telling the furries to stop fucking with the kids. The protesting youth believe that the school's tolerance stems from the principal whose child happens to be a furry. This is insane. The children are the adults here. Here's the clip from some of those protests that were students are calling this stuff out. The principal finally stood up and banned those stuff. But they still wear them every day. They ended up in trouble. The principal doesn't get to make them get in trouble. Oh the principal says it's just behind. It's nice. It's nice. What's the point of dressing up like a furry? I don't have things to get to. They have toys to get to. They have toys to get to. They have toys to get to. They have toys to get to. They want to get to. So people can come at them and just look at them and think they're so cool. Okay. Are you guys going to be in trouble for walking out of school today? No, maybe. We don't have to go back on school. If we don't, we don't get to help. We're not going to get to the school. We're not going to. We're not going to. We're not going to. We're not going to. We're not going to. We're not going to. This is wrong. We should fix this. We're not going to. The appearance. No, you guys are out here. Yes. No, no. Attack on. They fight us and we just kick them. We get in trouble. They attack us. They attack us. They attack us. They get in trouble. How else do they attack you guys? They fight us. They scratch us. They work out. They knock on you guys. They break us out of us and they hit us. They hit us. They hit us. And then they get us in trouble. Why are they spraying with fibries? Just because I'm sure. Because I'm a brilliant lady. And then it hits. And then it's remanded. We're putting litter boxes in the go back. They'll be like, where's the starting point? We're putting litter boxes in. They're going to litter boxes. I heard that. It was just a rumor. No, we're going to go. It's going to be fun. It's going to be fun. That happens because it's something you've seen. Yeah. We're putting litter boxes back. So we can't talk or say anything to the buries or even look at them, but they can come look at us and they can say stuff to us and touch us And we can, they don't know what we can't trouble them. Interesting. That sounds like a double standard to me. Yes. Okay. You guys stay on the sidewalk, okay? Yeah. Now, uh, KTVX, uh, I say something. Yeah. Yeah. I got a couple things to say. Number one. Now I know why I don't have fucking kids. Holy shit. How do you people with kids do that? That is how it is. Oh my god. That is how it is. Bro, I gotta go, I gotta go do a cold plunger. Holy shit. Is that giving you anxiety? Yeah. Second of all, if I was fucking furries, I'd stay 100 miles away from them kids. Or maybe buy them. Maybe that's why the Biden. Yeah, dude. Holy cow, man. Some people just built for it and I ain't one of them. Listen, it is tough. It is tough. Um, but yeah. So KTVX, they, uh, they did an article on this. They posted it to, to, to fight. I'm sorry to Yahoo. Um, this was their title. Students of a walk out of Utah Middle School to protest furries. Now let's see what the school officials are saying because they've every spined. Um, uh, I made, made a couple of statements. So, uh, let's dive into this. So, uh, quote. A lot of the information that's been put out there is completely incorrect in the accurate. Nibo School District Public Information Officer Seth Sorenson told ABC4.com. While Sorenson said, uh, there have been issues with harassment or students making others feel uncomfortable or unsafe. He said most of the claims online are false. Quote, the administration at the school addressed that with the entire student body. And they cut out a couple of emails. Sorenson said some of those emails were misinterpreted. And parents took to online formats to voice some of their concerns and questions. Uh, Sorenson said students are not dressing up as cats and dogs. Um, and because there is a dress code in place, he doesn't think videos that have been shared online from Nibo schools. Uh, Sorenson emphasized that the main goals of the district are open communication and student safety. Um, we continue saying quote today we had some students at parents choose to exercise. They write to assemble and do a little protest for what they perceived was something that was happening in the school. Sorenson said quote, it's actually, uh, it actually is not something that's been occurring. So the reports of students dressing as animals are quote a little bit inaccurate. Uh, saying students wearing headbands with ears are similar to students wearing bow, uh, but, but bows and sports jersey. Uh, Sorenson said dressing up is quote, just what students of this age do. Uh, quote interestingly enough, they really didn't address us with anything they wanted to change. Sorenson said of the protesters. Um, I think it is very clear on what they want to change. They're very clear. Even their, their, their, their signs like the kids weren't complaining about them dressing up. They try to get in bitten shit. Yeah. Very, very simple. Very, very simple. Like this one sign of the green one there says we just want to learn. Yeah. And even if it's a few, there's a few too many. Like I mean, you know, one is too many. Yeah, my kid to get in bitterschool is, it's a problem. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like where, where are we, what are we trying to accomplish with allowing this? Exactly. You know, part of going to schools learning how to function in real society. I'm going to tell you right now, yeah, one of these motherfuckers here showed up dressed like a fucking furry. They wouldn't have a fucking job tomorrow. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like that's it. That's real shit. Yeah. Like, you know, I'd say, hey, what the fuck? Well, I hear, hear and reality. We probably laugh our asses off for a day. Yeah. But like, if you show up, realize they were serious. Yeah, it'd be overdue. Yeah. You're going home. Yeah. You ain't coming back. And you could sue me or whatever the fuck you want. Right. And I don't care. You know, I think that's a lot of what drives this. I think people are scared. You know, for the last number of years, and I would say the last decade, the outrage, the selective outrage, and the canceling, and the social pressure has come from the far left group of people, right? And who include these mentally ill people that do this kind of stuff. And you know, it includes all these people that are Z-Zeroves, Zoos, Zoos and Wilt Wams, Boosies and Coosies. You know, like, what am I? I'm a little Debbie's. Yeah. A little Debbie slash hostess. Big damn bro. Yeah. Bro, y'all motherfuckers are mental. You're all mentally ill for real. All of you. Okay. Like, you're not in reality. And we don't have to play with you. We don't have to. You. You are a fucking weirdo. Okay. And we are not weirdos. Like real talk. Like there are men and there are women. And just because I don't want to play pretend with you does not make me a bigot. It makes me an understanding, an understanding of reality. An adult. Yeah. I just saw some shit today where people talk about the gender change with the seasons. It was that you the post that. Yeah. Yeah. Where were you? Where were you? Was it a seasonal gender? What was it called? It was a seasonal genderism. So like I'm gay in the summer. It's straight in the winter. It's kind of like it's all different. And the girl explaining to me. She's like, oh, this is new to me. So it was fucked up for her to. She was like, what? Yeah. She was. What do you think she looked like? Oh, yeah. You already know. What do you think she looked like, DJ? Describe her. Who were at the person under the camera? No, no, no, no. I'm being honest. Like, give me give me your best shot. Okay. All right. What she looked like. Where I'm going, she was probably about five foot four. We couldn't tell. Because it was just her face. That confirms it. That also means she's probably about five hundred pounds. She looked a little chubby. This she had purple hair with a blue or something. It was close to purple. Close to purple hair. Yeah. She had a really, really bad grease face acne. Yeah. Am I right so far? I mean, it's pretty close. City's button. White. She was white. Few piercings. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Yeah, she had a piercings. Hey, that's pretty good for her. She was right. Yeah. What I win. Come on down. That was pretty fucking smile on me. You, you win coming since. But like, we don't have to, we don't have to, like, here's what people don't understand, right? They say, they say to us, you're a big it. You're against these people. Yes, I am. And you're fucking weird. Oh, here's why though. If you want to be you and this and, and be yourself. And that's how you want to be cool. But realize that people are going to look at you like you're fucking weirdo. Right. And here's why because you are enforcing your preferences on every other person around you and people don't like that. Nobody likes being told to pretend. And there is a, there is damage that's done to the person that pretends. And people don't talk about that. Like when you lie to yourself or you pretend something is true that isn't true, you are violating your own integrity. You're violating what you know to be true to a piece someone else, which lowers your self worth and your belief in yourself and your trust in yourself. So I'm not going to play your game because I want to feel good that I have my integrity and check and that I am going to tell the truth about what I know to be true. And nobody talks about that aspect of it. It's not harmless. And on top of it, this is designed to remove all sense of identity in any situation, which is the beginning of removing reality in all in all cases. If a man can be a woman and a woman can be a man, then what else? What else is on the table for discussion? Everything else up is down. Right, exactly. So, you know, bro, these people, this shouldn't be allowed at all. School should be a place like there should be a dress code. You know, when I went to school, bro, you had to wear certain kind of pants and a certain kind of shirt. And if you didn't, bro, they sent you home. You know what I'm saying? Like there was this kind of shit wasn't allowed. We weren't allowed to, like we were there to learn. We were there to learn about life and learn how to execute. And dude, these people are being intentionally handicapped so that they're non-functional in the real world when they become of age so that they are one of these people that becomes dependent on a universal basic income in the government, which means they have to vote for the Communist Marxist progressive side to survive. So, they're manufacturing voters through creating people who are not able to function in society. And it starts with, you know, seemingly harmless shit like this that people can't connect three or four dots ahead. They just say, oh, what, what difference does it make? They're not hurting anybody. Well, actually, it makes a pretty big difference. You know, they're starting them early. They said the principal telling them, oh, just be nice to them. Just be nice. Whatever and growing them for later on in life. I'm like, oh, well, you know, I'm just be nice and just allow this person to just walk all over me with their beliefs. Oh, I remember this one. I was in the middle of the year. Exactly. The thing that kills me with a lot of these people is, you know, they just don't like me like this or they'll equate it to being like black. They don't like us like people. Oh, like, how do we get on with this? I'm saying the winters. It is interesting how that, bro, it is interesting how that, that LGBTQIA 7zuzaziz movement, like tries to include black people. Absolutely. I'm saying we got to own stripe on that fly. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, we come from who is gay? Why are you gay? I'm not gay. No, you are gay. No, I think I guess I think it's just cool to see the young generation. Like I think this is fucking cool from these kids. As hard as that was to listen to. I think it's awesome that they're doing it. I think every kid in America should go home and not go back to school at all. Every single one until this shit is out of their schools. Yeah, period. The schools will fucking they will they will fail. Yeah. You know what I mean? Because tax dollars growing to that school is just a small percentage. Like the parents need. Yeah. You parents know your parents know you're out here. Yeah. A few of the parents right out there. Yeah. It's good but like that. Yeah, 100% because bro, the schools they get money off of those kids actually being in the seats. Well, you know, the tail is wagging the dog. These people are not the majority. Right. They're a small fraction of the minority. And once the dog figures out that the tail is wagging the dog, this will end. And that's what's happening. People are figuring it out. They're like, you know what? I don't see any of this shit in the real world. Right. And it's one fucking weirdo out of every 10,000 people they see. Well, you know what? We don't have to listen to those people. We don't have to abide by their rules. They're bullying. Doesn't work online anymore. No one cares. You know, like dude, we get called every name in the book and it's funny. You know what I mean? Like, yeah. Well, what's wrong with you? Like, I saw this comment on one of our local newspapers pages. Dylan Mulvaney speaking at Slu. Did you see that? And somebody, you want to go? No. They, they, they posted, she is speaking at and someone posted he with an asterisk. And then the comment was, so you're a transphob and then come up back was, whatever the fuck you want to call me, I don't give a shit. And that comment got like 700 likes. Oh, that's great. No one cares. That's great. Like bro, y'all bullying everybody. Ain't working anymore. You need to shut the fuck up because the more you bully us, the more aggressive the backlash is going to be. Just leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Stay out of our fucking schools. Stay out of jamming the shit down our throat. You know, like all the gay people that aren't with the shit, you need to be extra vocal so you don't get tied into it. You know what I mean? This isn't, this is bullshit. It's crazy. Yeah. I always think it's funny out. I'll make a video on race or me saying, I didn't think that was racist and you never felt you have your white guy or white lady. You like, you uncle Tom. Yeah. I wait a minute. That's not racist. I like that. And people normally go after them and say, they should. Yeah, those people should be called out and abused and made fun of. Like bro, at this point in time, like, and look dude, I am against this fundamentally, but for a short period of time, these people need to be bullied back. They need to be bullied into fucking submission and they need to be made fun of and they need to be told shut the fuck up. And until we do that and mass scale, this will not go away. It's going on. Look dude, you know, people like to, like we talked about when Chandler was on, you know, people like to turn the other cheek because they have tolerance, right? They think the top, and this is why they have pressed the idea of tolerance on a society for the last 15 years so hard, right? And now all of us people who know what the truth is, we have, we have been tolerant, right? We've been very tolerant. We knew this shit was crazy and we first saw it. Like 10 years ago, we're like, oh the fuck this is fucking weird. You know, and we didn't say anything because we're trying to be tolerant and now look where we are with it. Now we're the bigots. Now we're the bad people because we've tolerated them to have enough social traction, enough power to start to suppress our voices and not care what we want. And the reality is, is you guys are the minority, we're the majority, we're tired of being bullied and, and for people to stop it for good, it's time to start destroying these people on the internet. That's the truth. And I'm not saying go to their house. I'm not saying, I'm not saying beat them up, but I am saying that when they come online with their dumb shit, they need to not come online again with their dumb shit. Yep. Yeah, jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. What being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck. This is where we bring something up. We talk about it and get one of those two options. And so with that being said, our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline is just a tweet. We got a clip. A tweet reads, a Philly man arrested by twin brother. Hmm. Got the video. Alright, here's clip. Only in Philadelphia. Look at it both laugh. Who got on that guys? I mean, it's probably just showed up with some other officer. He's like, hey, you fucked up. You know that right? Yeah, I know. Yeah. They were probably on the inside of it, but they were like, hey, you want to take me out? Right. Yeah. I was like, fuck, I would hate to do it. But if I had to do it, I would want to be the one to do it. No, bro, listen, they seem like it was. Of course, beat up black people. So it's like, I would make sure that it didn't happen. I'm not going to take care of them. Huh? What? Dude, I don't know. I think that's pretty funny. Yeah. Yeah, hopefully it's not the two series. Do we know? Yeah, do we know? Do we know what it was for? No, no bodies just laying in there. Yeah. And then come out from my mouth. Oh, no, it's worse. Hopefully, I was not the crazy. That's going to be on the fucking Christmas car. Oh, man, with the caption, too. Right. Oh, dude, that's some, I think that's thumbs up, man. That's fun. Yeah, two thumbs up. Two thumbs up. That'll work. All right. Well, guys, Andy Will. That's all I got. Yeah, Will, thanks for coming through, man. Thank you for having me. Yeah, I appreciate everything that you do, dude. Likewise.
