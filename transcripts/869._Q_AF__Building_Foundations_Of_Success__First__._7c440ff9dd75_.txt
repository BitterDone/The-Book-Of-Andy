I know you go for like three hours. Well, I mean yeah, where's DJ? You know rush it. You can't rush those things. Yeah, you know, I'm saying it is funny though because I was reminiscing the other day and like When when we first got around each other got together I don't know what that's the sound you know, almost a beer But when we first got together, bro, we were like synced up on everything You know, I'm saying like we we like time to poop suck. We worked out. You know, I'm saying like yeah, everything was insane Then we grew apart Then we grew apart You know, it's natural happens in relationships. Yeah, we kind of this man. Yeah, I agree I mean, I already did my poop. Well, I don't know it didn't work the first time, you know when you mean We grew apart. So like how are we gonna? Is it really gonna work? I think we do a poop tomorrow together. Okay, we start there all right I'll go right now small. Yep play bad. We used to play battleships. Yeah All right, just a little reminiscing there. Yeah So what we got today we're gonna make some people better. Yeah as we always try to do here on Monday's We got a young buck for you. Yeah. Oh before we get into this We are within probably a week or two of launching the MFCO project Just letting you guys know you guys are asking me about when that's gonna launch I'm really excited about getting that going. We have a lot of cool stuff that goes along with it That you guys are gonna be thrilled about so I just wanted to put that out there being asked a lot about it It's gonna be some killer content. It's gonna do the whole thing is awesome. Yeah, yeah excited for me Yeah, we got a young buck here Got a question about early early on decisions and habits. So let's get Coleman on the line. Who Coleman Coleman Coleman All right, it's a strong name. Yeah, that's good. Let's get Coleman called here is Hello, Coleman. What's up, dude? Hey DJ how's it going man? I got I got Andy here. You were alive on the show Coleman What's up, bro? How are you dude? What's up? Good. How are you guys good? Good just just Trying to figure out how we can help you today brother Yeah, so my question was I am 21. I'm almost out of college and what is the best for most important habit that I can Develop right now to develop real success, you know, not the stuff they teach me in school Yeah, look dude That's a good question, but at the end of the day, it's very simple Discipline is the foundation of every single area Your life, okay, whether it be your fitness, whether it be your business, whether it be your relationships If you have high discipline and you're able to cultivate discipline and then keep it sharp You are at a tremendous advantage over everybody else, bro because most people will go through their lives and they will Wonder why they can do things sometimes and why they can't seem to do things other times Which makes them reactive to the environment And if you really want to be successful You have to learn how to control the controllables and that is only done through Developing the skill of discipline meaning If you can make conscious choices that align with your long-term outcomes When it is highly inconvenient or seemingly impossible You are in a tremendous advantage over everybody else because when everybody else has to make these hard decisions They're gonna flake or they're gonna falter or they're going to Make an easier decision and they're gonna compromise or they're gonna cut a corner That's what our culture has become our culture has become Everybody's figuring out how to Do it the quick easy way Not realizing that the quick easy way is actually the hard way and If you can figure that out at 21 years old brother You are gonna be at a tremendous advantage over everybody else I didn't figure this out until I was in my late 30s and I can tell you this it's made a massive difference in my life So if I was 21 again What I would do is I would recognize that the foundation of all my success in every area life is gonna come down to me Making decisions that align with the outcome that I have set forth for myself and And if I could cultivate the ability to adhere to a plan when I'm 21 years old Then I could set any plan because I have really unlimited time where as much time as any humans going to have at 21 To create the outcome I want so dude. This is all about understanding Discipline is a skill. It is not a trait. It's not something you're born with It's something you have to develop. It's no different than Playing guitar. It's no different than shooting pistols. It's no different than any other skill It's no different than taking a shower. Okay. It's perishable If you don't take a shower every day, you're gonna fucking stink All right, and that's the reality of discipline too if you don't practice your discipline Day in and day out in an intentional manner It's going to get rounded off and it's going to get weak and that's gonna put you back amongst your peers If you want to excel amongst your peers, which is what you're asking, okay? You have to be able to make these decisions when it's inconvenient and if you can figure out how to do that Which by the way, I don't know somebody that you know has developed, uh, you know, the most famous program for that in the history of earth uh If you could develop That and keep it consistent and accept that that's what it is and it's in your control right now bro You're gonna be so far ahead of the game. I would trade places with you in one second real talk so All right, thank you. Yeah, bro. I mean is that good or what do you got anything else? Yeah, what do you go to school for? What are you about to graduate with? Uh, studying computer science and math Yeah That's cool. Yeah, yeah We're like what are you gonna do with that though? What do you want to do with that? I don't know yet. That's the problem. I feel like that's it like oh, that's a lot of young people's problem man Well, dude, that's why I'm saying so that's why I'm saying this is such a fundamental foundational skill because Bro, like look When you're in business You've got to make decisions that are inconvenient that are correct When you're choosing to be fit. It's the same thing in relationships It's the same thing in any area that you want to excel at in your life the foundation brother is always going to be Your ability to make the decisions that align with the long-term vision of your life and in the short term It's that's just what it is um And if you could accept that reality, bro, and really work on that right now Whatever path you choose is going to be obtainable and easier Because you have you have the understanding of of how to make the right decision in the in the short term So most people lack this ability, dude, and I know I know you know, you're 21 and You kind of just getting out there in the world, but dude. I could tell you as someone who's double your age uh Most people don't have this bro. They just don't have it even now. It's what you know, they don't fucking have it at 40 They don't have they don't have it. They don't live their life with that They live their life on the ebbs and flows of the momentum that they happen to catch Because as humans we all catch momentum sometimes and uh it's usually when times have gotten pretty bad And we're desperate against the wall and we start to act with urgency well If you can act with urgency all the time You could make a lot more progress But if you just make the proper decisions As you go you don't really even need that much urgency. It'll just be the progress will be steady It's just the way it is. Yeah, so bro if I was you That's what I focus in on man All right All right brother, well, I appreciate it. Coleman. Thanks dude Hey, make sure you bring a poor dt next Sunday. I'll be there. All right. I will Which one I don't know We'll see what we can do bro. I appreciate you All right. Thank you guys. I see Coleman Yeah, that's such a I feel like that's probably one of the hardest things for for the young younger generation to do It's like they just spent four years You know in school and it's like I what now you know I'm saying it's like You gotta go but like well, I mean look dude. Yeah, what now? But whatever you choose you want to be able to execute it on like dude The problem most people have is not knowing what to do It's being able to do what they actually want to do and so they don't pick things That they actually want to do because they don't believe they have the skills set to follow through and make it happen So they end up choosing something that they believe they are capable of which ultimately makes their life turn out in a way that they don't want And that's what we hear from all of our friends and our parents and our teachers Hey, you need to be a little bit more realistic. At least that's what I was told. I think we're all told that um And if we were able to realize that if we could just Develop the skill set to adhere to a plan Nothing's impossible man, especially when you're 21 years old and you have all this time to do it You see what I'm saying? Appreciate the question Uh, let's get to question number two. This is a right love hearing those questions from young guys. Yeah, like I love talking to the young bucks it's my Bro if I was if I was if I was 21 years old And I could develop what I just told him Holy shit bro. I'd murder fucking everybody. I mean there it would be it like you know what I'm saying Like just thinking of the progress I've made in the last you know six to eight years living this way You know, it's just My only regrets. I wish I had figured it out when I was younger You know, no one ever told me the discipline was something you could develop I thought it was something people were born with or is that important? Yeah Yeah, that's right dude, and it's the it's the foundation of everything It's the foundation of being a good parent. It's the foundation of being a good a good husband or wife It's the foundation of Making money. It's the foundation of fitness. It's the found it's the core principle of Achievement and fulfillment and success in every area of your life and the people who don't have it They make up all these excuses as to why their life ended up the way that it ended up when in reality They just couldn't make the decisions in the short term that they needed to make to get where they wanted to go and so they didn't And that's that Well guys, any question number two Um It might be a little older bug maybe uh, let's get uh, let's get question number two guys Andy I am a combat veteran Father of eight with one on the way former congressional staffer Went to night school after the military earned an MBA while working full-time not a flex because higher education is a joke But I but to prove to myself Um, and to prove that I could see something to completion I am thinking about walking away from a 10-year insurance career where I handled high net worth clients including Uh, being responsible for coverage on your car collection at one point Um, I am in the process of launching a solo cleaning business stars and stripes cleaning company Um, to take control of my future and build real freedom for my family. Wait, it's guy He say handle insurance on my collection Or I think it was just an example like oh, we got it big car collections I'm gonna say No, um But he says I've got grit. I got discipline uh in a service first mindset If you were me How would you attack the first 90 days to gain traction Dominate my area and scale to something meaningful first 90 day checklist I guess for a brand new business to clean business um What I would do is I would find the most prestigious most active voices on social media in your community I would go and clean for them for free in exchange for an honest testimonial On social media and I would say hey, I will come clean your office or I will come clean your home or whatever Do you say is like what is that home home or off whatever They got whatever you need me to clean your shoes. I clean your fucking shoes You need me to clean your dogs but hole after a fucking takes a shit I'll make sure it's sparkly. Okay, whatever to fuck you got to do To make sure that those people Say holy shit. I have never ever ever had someone clean my office this way or clean my home this way or clean my car this way And do it for free to the loudest Most known people in your community that you can and You know tell them to give me an honest review on social media. That's all in an honest one not hey A positive review or a five star review or no, hey if I do a shitty job say I did a shitty job Okay, and if you make an honest offer and good faith one people are gonna take it To if you do the job to the level that I know you're going to do you don't raise eight kids go to night school Become all this shit without high levels of fucking discipline So when this man says hey, I have high levels of discipline and grit. I believe it. Okay, because The record shows that what he's talking about is hard. Thanks. It's okay. Yeah, so Let's Be real you have the skills and that that's what I would do for the first you know a couple months I wouldn't quit my career. I would not quit your job. I would Transition over I because like dude look that one most people fuck up at well Look you got to make enough money to pay your bills. Okay, when you're transitioning from a career to a new business You've got to do it in a way where you are covered which means for most people that means decreasing their lifestyle Cutting all the waste and this is what I'm recommending for this gentleman cut all the waste out that you can Get real tight on your budget start to do these cleanings uh to the point where you're starting to get paid and Transition over when you start to make enough money to survive doing the cleaning Not saying enough money to buy a fucking Rolls Royce when you can transfer your Life from the previous career to the new career and support it That's when you make the jump okay, and so I would uh, you know, give the first 90 days as a crossover period to create testimonials and word of mouth um And uh Yeah, and I would make sure I would tell the only stipulation of the testimonials that I would be working to create like I said Would be to for them not to tell anybody that you did it for free And that's it And then you're gonna have a you'll have a bunch of testimonials on your page You'll have a bunch of good word of mouth going around And you'll be off and running yeah, and that's that yeah What do you think when it comes to like people just getting going I guess I guess I guess my question is like how do you And not to say that this person would get like the paralysis by analysis thing right but like you know somebody that has You know high standards and once the best how do you make sure? I guess like self audit to make sure you're not getting stuck in the in the actual going piece of that Well, look entrepreneur ship has a very common uh Theme amongst it uh and amongst high-level entrepreneurs It's it's the mentality of going and then adjusting okay, you want to launch when you're not ready and then make it better As you go as you go which by the way I've been working on this fucking thing with mfceo guys for two fucking years I could have launched it a year ago But guess what I wanted to make it better and I wanted to make it perfect and I want to do this thing and When I should have just fucking put the motherfucker out and did it as we go and I know all of you guys would be like all right Cool, but we what my point saying this is that you sometimes you know matter how seasoned you are no matter how Many times you've done this you have to remind yourself that you have to go and then make the adjustments as you go You know, it doesn't become perfect and then you launch you launch before it's fucking ready And then you listen to what people say you make the adjustments and then you continue to improve and you know Everybody falls back in that trap because as entrepreneurs When we represent and people don't think about this a company that we create represents our fucking name Okay What do you want your name to say do you want it to say you do things half-ass or do you want to say I do things fucking perfectly I'm of that camp so when you are a person who wants a high level Of reputation success built around you your name and your brand Stalling until it's perfect becomes perfectly natural, but the problem is is sometimes those people never launch anything Right, and then the market passes them by and then the opportunity goes by and then all the sudden They're saying I could have would a shudder and that's where courage comes in that's where the courage aspect of becoming Courage is one of the biggest things that people got to have to be successful dude It's you you got to be willing to go and then Build it as you go. Yeah, well, I think and then like I think the key difference is you I guess what I was getting towards is more people who are just now started I think your situations I think we could safely say it's a little bit different like no It's a reputation my point DJ is that we all do this. It doesn't matter if you're at day one or if you're at 26 years in Struggle with paralysis by analysis and you have to You you have to recognize that's what going on and then you have to force yourself to go do some Yeah, I love it man. I love it. Well guys, let's get to our third question. We got another uh got another caller here um This is Jackson who has a question about complacency when it comes to success. Yeah, so let's give Jackson a call Jackson what's up dude? This is DJ you live on the relay up show with 80 What's up? Guys, how are you good bro? How are you? I'm doing fantastic. I appreciate you guys uh taking my question. Yeah, so so what can we do for you brother? So I uh, I guess let me let me fold it up because to be completely out of the deal I don't remember what the fuck I submitted to you guys it's too weak to go but uh Hi, there to was there a point early on when the first taste of success money recognition for any of that almost made you Slow down And if so what snapped you out of it made you double down instead You know If I'm being completely honest dude, I spent so much time struggling and so much time broke That it sort of traumatized me Which I think is a good thing Because I don't ever feel that way. I'm always urgent. I'm always on the go. I always want to go and the minute that I start feeling Like I'm not moving I get very anxious and I have to start moving in fact. I would say The people around me probably get super annoyed about it because I'll come in out of nowhere and be fucking hyped up And all it is is me me getting afraid that I'm going to go back to being Where I was and so You know my first 10 years bro, and I'm sure you know you've heard me say this. I didn't make any money You know, I didn't make any money the first three years the next seven years. I made 60 695 dollars a month for a total of 58,380 dollars the first 10 years. I was in business. So For me dude That was such a long time to spend grinding And then when I started getting some money. I I appreciate it so much that I never want to go back so For the most part That's how I've always operated now have there been times Where I felt myself get a little bit complacent absolutely and those usually came after the times where I had a big level up in personal income um and in those times When I started to feel that way usually how it came across to me was I started to feel like it was put what I was doing was pointless past the point of what I was doing it at so um For example, you know like I made a lot of money and enough money for me to be happy for a long time But when that started when I start to feel that way I look around at all the people who have helped me get in this position and I start to put my responsibility To take care of them and their families and I create external pressure Based upon my responsibilities to my employees and the people around me. So when I have gotten complacent I very simply Remember that at this point in my life. This is not about me anymore. This is about everybody around me And that when I look at it like that and I view it as you know I'm just a member of the team and I have to do my part no different than You know, Tom Brady has to show up for his guys to get paid right like if Tom Brady doesn't show up and play His fucking football game his offensive lineman don't get paid his the rest of the team the coaches everybody so When I when I feel complacent, I just remember the position I'm in Uh and and how much I love the people around me and how much I care about him and and and What I want for them and that snaps me out of it and gets me going again I got you so you know, I hear Ed talk about this all the time too in terms of you know Falling back on it seems like and correct me if I'm wrong It seems like you have a set of of habits and rituals You know that are important to you He talked about that all the time and in that same thing and that's because he's nothing to fall back on in times of stress and Maybe complacency What you're saying there to yeah for sure dude and and when I do get in that place where I have to go back I always go back to the fundamental systems, you know, I'm a systems guy. I create production systems That's what I'm good at that's what I'm good at in business. I create systems Um, and I'll go back to the fundamentals, you know, the live hard program the power list these types of things Um, my visualization routines um Those things help snap me right back into that productive the best productive Andy That that I can be so when I do get a little off track bro I just go back to the fundamentals, you know, it's it's no different than Michael Jordan dude He stopped uh, he started every practice with chess passes, you know And then he moves to dribbling and then he moves to free throws and it didn't matter if he had five rings He still started that way so um What I found is that when I just find myself, you know Straying a little bit or getting a little bit complacent or a little bit off course I just go back to the foundational systems that have gotten me here and I've never failed To lose that way uh, once I get back into those those habits and those belief systems and that accountability system for myself The progress starts right back. So uh, you know that that's definitely how I do it brother Absolutely yeah, and I appreciate everything you guys do. I'm uh Monday 29 is 75 hard right now. Definitely changed my life done it every year for the past five years and uh Thoughts of so I feel the same way about that kind of creates systems and and it's just awesome to hear that that's how you view it as well Yeah, bro, bro. I really appreciate every deals do well. I appreciate you man. We wouldn't be here without you So thank you for all the support and trust me bro Uh, I got to work at this just like you and just like everybody else. So it's um You know, we're all doing it together brother Absolutely. Yeah, well thank you guys so much. I appreciate you guys taking the question thoughts on the get to talk to you and uh You know you guys have a great weekend. All right brother. You too. Thank you so much for everything Absolutely. Yeah, thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Jay. See you brother I think I think that's a it's a it's a lesson of like the delayed gratification like you almost went through it unintentionally You know i'm saying because you had to go through the struggle like you didn't struggle by fucking choice You know, it's just it's like that the gratification was delayed for so long. Yeah. Yeah, dude for me You know, I'm just being real like I I was so embarrassed Like dude when I when I didn't have any money man like you know I just never I never saw myself in the frame of someone who didn't have money Like even when I was younger or when I was like in high school or even when I was a kid Like I always fucking saw myself as like I'm gonna be successful like that's how I saw myself. Yeah, so like when when When we were running the business in the early days, you know 99 it let's say, you know 2013 or so um That first 10 years of that time frame were really really hard for me Because it was embarrassing. It was like embarrassing like all my friends We're getting degrees and they were getting jobs and you know, they were making remarks to me and they were going on vacations I couldn't go on or buying cars. I couldn't afford and And it started to like It started to really wear on me Because I'm like fuck dude. I'm like the one person out of all these people that Once that really wanted to be successful and it looks like I'm gonna get passed by and I'm gonna end up being The opposite of that is the more alive you know, yeah, bro, but you know what was crazy is when I humbled myself and And And I said okay, maybe I'm not gonna be wealthy, but I do enjoy helping people And I focused on helping people. I got wealthy You know what I'm saying? Well, it's just humbling yourself and realizing it's not about you. It's about them You know, so that's real We got our final question. We got one more for you Andy. This is another write-in Um Guys any question number four? Andy What are some true warning signs for a business That would suggest a pivot needs to be made I'm four years in and I just like you just went and started my company About two months ago. We brought a new service to market Um, this is our second true offering Forstandal loan service. We put a lot of effort and energy into launching this And nothing happened nothing happened compared to our expectations at what point and what criteria Should conversations and plans start happening to change the course when you make the pit Wouldn't you know to make the pivot or that a pivot and how long he says been doing it? Uh the new product two months Been in business for you and what's the product? I didn't really clarify Is a new service he brought to market about two months ago and they're not it's not getting Uh the expectations Well, fucking nothing gets the expectations when we first launch at mother fucker like fuck dude You think I didn't fucking want to be uh fucking Jeff Bezos to fucking year after I lost my shit like fuck dude. That's welcome to business Shit doesn't go the way you want it to go Sometimes things take longer than you think and I can guarantee you this if you give up on every idea after two mother Fucking months bro. You're gonna be broke as fuck your entire life. Okay, so I don't know what the fuck this month I should have called in I don't know what the product is okay, so I have limited uh, but here's the thing I don't care what the pro I do not care what the product it. I don't care. I don't care what the you could be selling fucking the coolest product ever And if you're presenting it wrong or your um Advertising it wrong or you don't have a market or you don't have people that are listening to you That nobody can know that it's a great product nobody knows about it. So My point here is that like 60 days is not enough for fucking anything It's not enough. Okay, so you have to ask yourself Why is this product not hitting is it because the product's not good? You got to be honest with yourself too. Dude. This is a big problem with entrepreneurs They really good entrepreneurs are very very honest with the quality of their product And I actually think they lean towards Thinking their products not as good as it is because the mentality that you have to have is to always improve all right So true kick ass entrepreneurs, you know Everybody thinks that they walk around and they just let their dick swing and they think they're Bro, most of them guys are like fucking run and scared and they're like fuck. I don't know my shit's good enough I got to make it better But that's what makes it better because you always feel that way But bro, you can't give up on something that you haven't explored the reason as to why it's not moving after 60 fucking days And less like you know like for me I have millions of people on my email list. I have Millions of millions of customers on my businesses emails list I could figure out instantly if there's a demand for it But dude if you're just starting there's no way to know that you know what I mean So why is it not hitting is it the product? Is it how you're presenting it is it The the ad copy is it you know what it what the fuck is it? Yeah, what is it? What's no? He says that he has a fucking attention problem, you know and You have to go through Point by point by point by point And figure out why it is that you're not getting what it is and I would bet that you probably don't have The messaging right I bet it's a little bit of everything. I bet your messaging is off. I bet your products a little bit off I bet the way you're presenting it is probably a little off I bet who you're presenting it to is a little bit off and these things these are not big switches to flip These are little bitty tiny turns of the dial that you need to dial in to see and by the way you might find out no one gives a shit You might find out that it's it's it's not a good product and You know if that's the case, you know you you you could pivot but Micro pivots along the way or would actually create great shit, you know, I'm saying like do when we first launched first form The first product we came out with was called level one light all right. It was a low calorie low-car protein powder designed for women and If you know how you know what happened? I heard that's right. You know why you know why you know why nobody's heard of it Because it didn't fucking sell Okay, so that was the first product of first form it did not sell product did not sell If I had said well fuck dude nobody wants first form Where would I be? You see what I'm saying? So what I did was I Huh you be like yeah, yeah, no shit so So This is a common trait Amongst entrepreneurs and people in general and business guys you got to understand This is the concept that we talk about about aggressive patience, okay? You have to give enough time for the cake to bake Before you start fucking with the the the the temperature or the recipe or the this or the that You can't do it time is a factor, okay? Like we have to understand and I use the analogy of baking a cake all right You get the best cake recipe from fucking Martha Stewart her award-winning cake recipe That's one every award across the world from then across the universe it's the best cake ever And she gives you the exact ingredients, okay? And she tells you Every single input that needs to be made what what what the temperature of the oven is how long you put it in there What the ingredients are and what amounts and what order to mix them in and you have every single thing lined out Here's the mistakes that entrepreneurs like to do One they think that they are the chef and they think that they can change the ingredients even though they have no Experience baking a fucking cake. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna add a little more of this. I'm gonna take a little of this out Okay When you have a recipe for success and you have no experience in success You do not have the understanding of what the change in the recipe, okay, so that's first thing They fuck up. That's the first thing The second thing is What they do is they think like this well If it takes 40 minutes of 400 degrees If I turn it up to 800 I'll get in 20 minutes, okay? So they think they can out hustle the time All right, you can't out hustle time What happens if you throw the motherfucker in there 800 degrees for 20 minutes? What do you get back? Oh, you get a crusty piece of shit, okay? And that's what that's what you're gonna get in your business too Okay, you're gonna get you're gonna get burned out. You're gonna get frustrated You're gonna get a product that does not resemble anything of what you set out because you lack the patience, okay? This is this is very common amongst entrepreneurs We try to manipulate things that cannot be manipulated, okay? You can't take the struggle out of the recipe You can't speed it up by going twice as hard So you now you can make an maximum speed by going as hard as you can But you can't go any faster than that because there's time aspect and product adoption Customers had to become familiar. They have to see it nine ten times before they ever want to buy it Like there's all kinds of things that you just can't get around and I'm gonna tell you right now. There's fucking nothing That you can make work in 60 days like that nothing. So my advice to you would be very simple Tell yourself the truth is the product actually good Is it a product that you made that's trying to like sort of trick people into buying it or is it a product that delivers tremendous value to one's life If it's not a product that delivers tremendous value How do you pivot it and turn the knob a little bit to make it become that so that people will be more likely to use it If you can't do that Then maybe it's time to develop something else But a lot of the reason that a products don't work for entrepreneurs Is because they try to do this shit like they think of it like this It's a fundamental difference in the way you think If you ask 90 fucking 8% of you observed 98% of entrepreneurs They try to operate from this place of I'm gonna make a product And I'm gonna try to make the value Per the perceived value as high as I possibly can Without actually making the product as valuable as it could be Okay, and it's almost like they're trying to trick the consumer All right, and this comes from old advertising big business old old days are doing can't do shit like this anymore because the feedback loop is instant So The entrepreneurs that are winning today are saying And have one for the last 10 15 years since social media came about when that when the feedback loop became instant Are people who say how do I develop something that actually Delivers tremendous value? How do I make something that when people use or consume or share or you know Talk about It's going to be something that they're they're saying holy shit. This is the best thing I've ever done This is the best app I've ever used. This is the best food I ever ate This is the this is the best service I ever had this this helps me tremendously If you create products that do that you you really can't lose Okay, you can't you can lose because you're stupid and you quit on things at 60 fucking days but If you develop a product that is along the lines of actually contributing to someone's life It's really hard to fuck up. Yeah, so It sounds like there's an emotional investment here because I mean even talking about you put a lot of effort and energy Of course, that's an fucking matter. Yeah, doesn't matter. Yeah. Did you have a lot of emotion? I guess tied to that No one gives a fuck how much work you put into shit Okay, no one cares. Did you see the clip from wallow talking to black entrepreneurs Wallow who is a fucking smart motherfucker the rapper? He's a social media guy. Okay. He's I think he's a rapper and entrepreneur and all this shit And he was he was go this this clip went viral this week about him talk He was talking a bunch of black entrepreneurs. He goes nobody gives a fuck that your business is black owned You know what they care about they care about if the products good they care about if the service is good They care about if it's actually something worth You know buying or using or consuming. I'm paraphrasing what he said But he's right Okay, no one gives a fuck about you. No one cares who made it. No one cares What race they are no one cares what's a man or a woman no one gives a fuck about anything other than how Good is the product and How much does it benefit me how much do I enjoy it? How good is the service that goes with it? How does it make me feel? It's there's no other way to sustain yourself In business other than being great And everybody wants to hack their way around that everybody wants to make it easier everybody wants to trick the system And then they look at the people who have built the craziest shit who live these big lives and they're like how they trick The system by creating a great fucking product with a great fucking service that people enjoy and are proud to share with their friends And when you do that It doesn't matter what the product is people will talk about it Okay, so we have to get this focus off of how much effort we put in or who we are or what group we belong to and we have to realize No, it's a fuck about that they care about what fucking points you put on the board bro They care about what you create what you build who you become and how they can do the same so Let's don't like that you know when people I agree with you. He's emotionally attached. Yeah, it's emotionally I put a lot of work. Yeah, that's what the fuck you're supposed to do You know like you have to let go of that shit That's real man. The things you care about are not the things that your customers care about bro. It's our own egos We all have egos, you know, we'll I don't have an ego the fuck you don't everybody has one And you need a big one to be successful in business too because you need to fucking believe in yourself more than other people believing you so Yeah, I love it, but you also got a balance that with humility How do I improve? How do I get better right you got to have the balls to put the product out there But you also have to have the wherewithal to question is the product actually what it could be and should be You know what I'm saying? Absolutely man. Absolutely what guys, hey, that's not a little way to start a Monday Yeah, guys hey, there's only one way to win bro, and it's being undeniably great at what you do I could answer 50 fucking thousand questions. It's gonna come down to that same Principal every single time so go out there do the best you can become the best you can Create the best that you can And things are gonna work out
