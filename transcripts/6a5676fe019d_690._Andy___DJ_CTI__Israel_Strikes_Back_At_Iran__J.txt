Like I mean I like I will but like let me initiate it. Let you initiate the hugs. Yeah like don't initiate a hug on me. Let me do it you know what I'm saying does that make sense? Is that weird? I don't know. I mean is that weird? People's got their own preferences about how I don't like people touching me at all. That's what I'm saying like I mean you know I'm just like I like it. Like if I want to be touched I will initiate the touching. Yeah. I kind of get that. Yeah I mean it's normal. Yeah you know what I don't like dude is that when people here's what I really fucking know. Oh let's do this. Yeah. Pepe's let's get it out. When people grab me from behind. Oh yeah. You know because like getting stabbed from behind like that. And then like when people grab my shoulder or they're like I'm walking and they're like hey bro don't do that. Yeah. You know what I don't like. I remember that time that fucking happened to me. I'm not gonna say who it was. I almost fucking killed him. Yeah I remember that. Yeah. Yeah I do. I do remember that. I'm not gonna say who it was because of the public figure. But I do remember that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what else really grinds my gears is people that don't know when to let go of a handshake. Oh man. Like they keep going bro like they won't let go. They won't let go bro I cannot stand it like I feel like it's awkward. There's like a there's like a three seconds. No I don't know how long it is but there's like a clear delineated moment where it gets weird as fun. You know what I'm saying? Like it goes from normal and then all of a sudden it's we as well let go. Yeah. Yeah. And then what happens is you like looking their eyes and they go like oh this is a little this is a little gay. Yeah we just made eye contact. Yeah. I'm about to. You know it's a weird thing. Three seconds. Yeah. Three seconds. Yeah. That's all you get. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can agree with that one. That's a weird one. Yeah man. What's going on with you everything good? Yeah. Just doing the thing man. Yeah. Just doing the thing. You had a tornado come through yesterday. We did. We did have a little tornado bro. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was quick. I mean but that that shit was wild. Yeah. That was that was. I mean we see a lot of weather here. That was pretty serious weather. Oh yeah. And I'm about. And like I mean just it just came so quick. Because like I remember like I was watching. That's what you said. Yeah. Yeah. It's typical. But I was watching the radar and shit man. I'm like oh like this thing is like here. It's here. Yeah. And then it's gone. I'm like. Yeah. Yeah. Sweet man. Well. So we decided to do CTI this week for Saturday because real talk. There's a lot of shit going on. You know we realized that we didn't get to in this week. I like to. I like to get to in a week. We might be moving that up. You know maybe making some changes in the rotation. I know everybody likes the Q and A F and all that. But. You know I think I think CTI is going to get a little bit more love and love the other shows. Yeah. Moving forward. Let us know what you guys think. Let us know down in the comments. Yeah. Yeah. Oh man. Sweet. You want to do it? Yeah. Let's do some cruising. Yeah. Don't forget. We got a fee for the show. All right. The fee doesn't mean send us money. Although we'll take it. What it really means is support the show man. We're constantly dealing with all these issues on the internet. Where they don't want us to be seen and heard. You know all the little tips and tricks they do to suppress what's going on. You know if you want the message to be heard you guys are going to have to share it. So when we say pay the fee that's what that means. You know we don't run ads on the show. I don't talk about all this shit that I don't use. I appreciate that you support our companies. But show the show. You know what I'm saying? Like get the word out. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. Oh. Let's get into it man. I thought I thought it'd be cool to bring back. One of our segments because we haven't done it a minute. So this is a great segment. Doesn't matter. All right. Don't ask of the day. Don't ask of the day. Let's do it. This one should come at no surprise. Hold on. Come on Harris. Close. Yeah. I right. Yes. I mean listen, like he might get the yearly award for this. We probably should do gr See I'm sure it's almost like. It's almost like, it's so obvious. like it's it's almost not fair it's not fair I mean like listen is not right we're picking on a Evil tyrant who's just you know getting in his old you know Centuries of yeah, but I like picking on him. So let's do it. Yeah, Biden dumbass of the day How long read Biden says a child gave him the middle finger it happens all the time Well if you stop fucking sniffing bro, it's got that shit He can't help that though you start doing weird shit like walking off the stage and trying to sniff all these little kids And you're a weird motherfucker bro. I don't know if you noticed like you ever watched yourself on TV I don't think they let them bro You wander off the stage to go find like 10-year-old kids and then they look at you like you're like you're a great creepy old man Cuz you are he sniffs out the Gerber fucking baby food. Oh Fucking weird, but yeah 81 million votes Joe Biden this week said a child gave him the middle finger Quote it happens all the time. Here's a little mega child Never thought I'd see a time I'm going through a neighborhood rural town is in the west just and it's a big science Have a trump sign the middle of says that Biden A little kid standing with his middle finger seven years old eight years old Well, I promise it happens all the time Yeah, but you know what it's a wrong for them to give the finger but let him cut off their dick Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's completely fine. Now the funny thing about this though is that like just It's all the time. Well, maybe it's you man Maybe it's you you know something continues to happen over and over again Sometimes we got to say hey, maybe it's me maybe it is I'm the problem. Yeah What the funny thing about this though, man is that like I think just that day before this Or maybe even no, I think was actually earlier that day Cuz this was at In Scranton, Pennsylvania, but earlier that day He was asked a very interesting question and let's see his response so this This clip is before the middle finger situation and just listen to this When you drive around the area you see a lot of trump signs not very many Biden signs Do you feel like you're in trouble here? You have the drive in the right place So he says that yeah, but then he says he sees it shit everywhere That's cuz he's a compulsive liar. Maybe they had to remind him. Oh, he lies about everything These people have no problem lying about fucking anything. They don't care They don't care if you believe him. I don't know if you guys have figured this out But like you guys are all on the internet saying I can't believe this How long are you gonna continue to say I can't believe this or they think we're stupid or they think we're You know not smart enough to know what's going on you aren't smart enough to go. It's know what's going on because They don't you haven't picked up on the fact that they don't give a fuck if you notice what they're doing Yeah You know, so yeah, you're not you're why do you continue to be surprised? Yeah, why are you continuing to be like oh? I can't believe they're doing this believe it when he's up there talking about the economy saying Oh the Biynamics is work. It is working because they're all getting filthy fucking rich and you're getting poor It is working. It's working perfectly for them That's what you're not understanding you're not understanding that they are not serving our interests at all They could care less. They don't care if you know that they're lying They don't care if you lose your house or lose your money or lose your career They don't care all they care about is making sure that enough people vote for them that they can cover the gap that is between The people that run against them and them In the way that they fudge the election so they can continue to steal your money and continue to enrich themselves That's what they fucking worried about and you guys think oh You guys just make a fatal mistake thinking they represent you they don't represent you at all There's nothing about them that represents you and that doesn't matter if you're Republican or Democrat. No black white gay straight It doesn't matter. They don't care about you Anyway, yeah, have you ever looked at the faces on this picture? Yeah, they're all like what the f's laughing He's like not again. Yeah Those are those are secret service guys. Yeah, he's like shit. I'm getting fired again Well, he's laughing bro. Why do we continue to elect these elderly people to run the country? Why do we why why we don't have better leaders than guys that are eighty something years old This is the best we got listen dude. It would make good sense for us to elect younger leaders because younger leaders have to live with the repercussions of their decisions These motherfuckers gonna be in a hole in fucking two years, right? You see what I'm saying. I don't give a shit So like why not elect people who are in the middle of their life who are intelligent who have accomplished things who understand how to build and create things and operate things and have displayed so in their private life so that The consequences of the decisions that they make They are worried about because they have to live with them right these people don't have to live with these consequences They'll give a shit Because they won't be here to do that's right precautions man It's real shit man. It's real. Well guys dumbass of the day goes by good job Good job. He's a weekly regular With that being said, let's get into some of these cruises man Guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com You guys can find them linked there that being said headline number one. Let's dive into it This is a talk of the town today. Um, got to cover a lot of interesting stuff happening around this So let's try to connect some dots This headline reads israel strikes back at Iran five key questions So this is a Fox News reporting on this There's some inconsistencies here. There's some weird things happening. Let's dive into it So israel carried out limited strikes in Iran early friday in retaliation for tyrant firing a barrage of missiles and drones at israel last saturday Here are the key facts you need to know about the latest escalation of violence between the two countries No. One. Where did the strike hit so Fox News confirms That there have been explosions in irons is phahen province Which is where? Natanz one of irons nuclear facilities is located a well-placed military source told Fox News that the strike was quote unquote limited Here's an image of that facility The second thing they covered is how much damage the did the attack cause They say following the attack Iranian state media stated that the nation's atomic sites were quote Fully safe and had not been struck by the missiles The international atomic energy agency United Nations affiliate watchdog organization later confirmed quote. There is no damage to our rants nuclear sites There's been no reports of large scale damage or any casualties. I'm how will Iran uh ran respond A senior Iranian official reportedly told rota rota's on friday that tyrant has no immediate plans to strike back That official said quote the foreign source of the incident has not been confirmed And the discussions leans more towards infiltration than attack That's a very very interesting statement Right while everybody believes is obvious who did this I ran saying that they're still trying to confirm who did it in the first place Now that is interesting all right. We'll hold on to that thought Um Iranian state media reportedly has been downplaying friday strike a well-placed military source It's whole fox news that the strikes were limited Quote the explosion this morning in the sky of is Is phahen was related to the shooting of air defense systems at a suspicious object that did not cause any damage Iranian army commander general Um Was quoted by the associated press is saying Um, what is israel said about the strike israel and its government have been notably quiet leading up to and the Following the retaliatory strike on Iran quote Israel will do whatever it needs to defend itself prime minister Benjamin that not none yahu said in the statement before the israeli strike Foreign leaders have all sorts of suggestions and advice. I appreciate that But I want to be clear our decisions. We will make ourselves now. Here's the goal question Um, and I thought this was interesting that fox news included this as well But here's question number five was the us Involved in the strike in Iran United States has denied any involvement in the strike having pleaded with israel for days to respond with restraint against Iranian strikes Um secretary of state Anthony Blinken when asked about israel strike on Iran friday said quote I'm not going to speak to that except to say that the United States has not been involved in any offensive operations Now when I heard this It sounded familiar. I feel like I've heard that somewhere you know what I'm saying Like I feel like I've might have heard that once or twice. Yeah, no shit Like at least a couple of times. Yeah, I've heard this same like line of statement. Oh, that's slavery. Sorry. Um, Nord Stream 9 11. I've Feel Clinton You hear that quite often. Yeah, I thought I just thought that was interesting now. Now here's here's the catch, right So this this article comes out yesterday Um, and it's titled the helen reads iran's foreign minister. I'll respond to israeli attacks quote will be immediate and at maximum level Now this is before the strikes on iran just happened, right? So he he got interviewed by CNN Um, and was quoted in that uh in that interview Uh saying quote in case the israeli regime embarks on eventurism again and takes action against the interest of iran The next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level he said Quote it will be decisive our response will be decisive through the Swiss embassy in to ron Uh continued saying quote we have announced to the white house since a message to the white house in lachensen dc The administration in which we reiterated that if the israeli regime commits the grave error once again Our response will be decisive definitive and regretful for that he added quote we do not seek to create tension Uh in crisis or increase such situations in the middle east and we sincerely hope that the israeli regime does not repeat the previous egregious error Now he also went on to say that the over 300 missiles and drones at uh ron And it's proxies fire to israel that was just the minimum that the country could do Uh, he said quote uh, why do we call it carried out at a minimum because it was geared towards two military targets One in an over team air base and the other one and intelligence and information center We did not target economic and financial centers civilian centers only the two locations from which f 35 aircraft were flown Took off from there and targeted at the embassy building in the go-long um and uh, he said that the again the 300 missiles that was the least that they could do um, so it's very very interesting while all of this is happening again So you know israel has not yet taken responsibility for the three missiles that were fired into iran they've yet to claim full responsibility for it anywhere in any statement um You got iran saying they're trying to confirm who actually did it And by the way, yeah, we passed through another uh, a bill in the house to give more funding to proxy wars both in israel and ukraine as well Um, Andy, where do we got on all of this? What does your immediate heart say? Who does and after while I was watching this last night and so were you we were going back and forth about it, you know We saw the launch from iran to israel right that was sad today and then biden called netanyahu And then called iran, okay, and they had a conversation where biden asked iran If they would allow israel To make a retaliatory air strike That was benign meaning it was not going to kill anybody to save face In the world uh, view, okay, so that's what biden was trying to tell iran and after watching this on full last night Israel shoots over it around iran's first response and I sent you the screenshot of it here It said uh that they denied that there was even an attack they said an attack didn't even happen these people are lying They said there was no missile attack at all right And then like 10 minutes later They came back out and they said there was a missile attack But nothing got actually damaged so There's some This bullshit regalia. Yeah, there's some bullshit happening here and my gut you ask what my gut says my gut says that Israel intentionally launch these attacks to save face And they intentionally did not destroy the bases that they shot near right No, I was gonna do that. What they they targeted a lot of their nuclear facilities and their just shy of yes But they didn't hit him right okay, and that's a message that says hey We can fucking get you all right, but we're choosing not to And so that's how I'm reading the situation as to what's going on now to who did it I couldn't say um, but you know you know that the us is involved if biden's calling iran and saying Hey, let them strike back to save face, but they won't hurt anybody That means the us is involved Right at some level by the way they're using all us equipment us armaments the same thing is going on in Ukraine and You know, I've done by the way, I don't know if you saw that huh, they're finally like all mainstream media is finally Emitting that Ukraine's done. I mean if you heard anybody talk about all these men killed in Ukraine. No, yeah That's what I'm saying nobody's talking about it. Yeah No one's talking about the the amount of children that have been killed in Palestine No one's talking about that and when you do talk about it your anti-Semitic and you're a piece of shit Bro, that's not okay Okay, okay, that's not a that's not a logical argument No, no because it's not anti-Semitic to observe facts. Right. It's not racist to observe facts It's not bigoted to observe facts of the matter You're you're arguing is a justified or not that's not what I'm arguing what I'm arguing is did it happen or not And it did happen it didn't it's not happening. It's happened right So we have to like look at this and what does this mean and why are they doing this and what's going on here? And here's what I will say Is if this escalates which it could this could escalate this could become a full-blown War and it could get to nuclear right away if that happens We're in deep shit here everybody loses no, no, no, we're in deep shit here Because if a world war comes around and you got Russia and China and all these other bricks countries back in Iran and We've only got a bunch of fucking neutered NATO countries in Europe that are getting taken over by migrants and fucking Climate weirdos it kind of feels like dude. That's what I'm saying So we're over here, you know thinking we're bad-ass and Israel's bad-ass and we're bad enough to take on the entire world Real we'll lose that fucking war Okay, and that means that shit's gonna come to your doorstep So there should be no American citizen that think this is okay to go to war And we see all these warmongers on TV Hannity and fucking Levine and all these fucking guys who keep saying you know We got to stand with Israel and fucking bro my fucker. We got we got millions of homeless people on our streets We got people that can't pay their bills legal legal ones That's what I'm talking about the migrants. I'm talking about veterans I'm talking about people who are addicted to fucking drugs because they've legalized hard drugs and these weird areas Which now they're reversing because their cities a shithole You know people are like the cities are a fucking disaster because of crime We have people that can't pay their bills. We have people that can't pay for their kids education We can't feed their fucking kids. You know how many of these kids are getting their only meal at fucking public school It's a shitty one at that. Okay, but we're sending billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of dollars To a fucking already wealthy country, which is Israel, okay, and then Ukraine and by the way When we send that money over there It's not going there. It's going into the packets of our own politicians via kickbacks and All this crooked shit and these people who are up in washer are so fucking greedy That they are breaking the backs of the American people to get more and more and more and more and more from us And they're ruining the middle class They're ruining Americans lives. They're ruining American cities And it's also that these motherfuckers can take more money and get more control over us And this is a big problem and and they've done such a great job when you play this out over the last few years Look how they've intentionally divided us along every single line They divided us around race with George Floyd. They divided us around Gay and straight people with the trans bull shit They've they've created these absurdities that have created massive division and the massive division has been created Intentionally so that we can't get together and say hey What the fuck are these guys doing to us? You know what I'm saying and dude we need to come together as Americans and realize What's actually happening here and what's actually happening is they're stealing your money They're making you go to work You're working your ass off you're getting taxed half of your money and that half of the money is going into pockets to these politicians Oh, and by the way, they're printing money on top of this so they can steal more which is reducing your buying power and making you poorer by the day It's taking your dollar and making it worth 75 cents since 2020 You know hard that is to do it's really hard, bro And these guys are doing it and we're all sitting over here pointing at each other thinking we're it We're the problem. No, we're not the problem our tyrannical government is the problem and these people are out of control. They're fucking They're the most greedy disgusting pigs on the planet and it's not Democrat Republicans. It's all of them We need a complete replacement of our political class Meaning we need to vote every mother fucker out and replace them with people that aren't these people We need to make reform we need to create a situation where there's no insider trading Every law that's passed by Congress has to be a buy-to-buy buy the Congress, you know We need tax reform. We need crime reform. We need real reform here in America to get this back on track And that cannot happen until we figure out that it's us versus them Yeah, you know, that's real shit man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments.

Head on number two reads. Jury selection completed on day four of Trump Hush Money Trial. The five more alternate jurors have been seated in former President Trump's Hush Money Pavement Trial on Friday, completing jury selection. The individuals join the other 12 jurors and first alternate who were sworn in during jury selection proceedings on Thursday. An alternate juror listens to the testimony just like all the other jurors, but doesn't join in the deliberations unless one of the main jurors needs to drop out or is removed. Judge Juan Merchand said the opening statements in Trump's historic criminal trial can begin as early as Monday once jury selection was completed. The judge instructed jurors not to discuss or research the case before sending them home for the weekend. Here's a facts. Yeah, right. Like that's going to fucking stop it. Fast facts. So former President Trump is the first president in US history to stay in criminal trial. He has pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Those charges levied against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg are related to alleged hushed money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in an effort to silence her during the run up to the 2016 election. The trial is expected to last nearly two months. It is currently in the jury selection process. Seven jurors were sworn in as Thursday morning. The two of those were later excused after they feared their identities would leak through the press. The trial is not being televised. Instead, news reporters and producers will have the ability to sit inside the courtroom and deliver information to the public. So you can't see it for yourself, right? But our non-biased media sources will definitely tell you the truth about what exactly happened. Yeah, exactly. It's like they always tell us the truth about everything. Why would they lie to us? They never lie about anything. Why would they lie to us? Why would they? Why would they want to lie to us? They wouldn't. It's not like they try to push the ulterior motives or narratives. It's not like they just got caught lying about an entire fucking pandemic. It's not like they lie about racial division. It's not like they lie about the economy. It's not like they fucking lie about everything. You know, if they did, I mean, I definitely wouldn't trust them. I wouldn't trust them. They don't do that. Yeah, they don't do that. No. But yes, the criminal trial in New York is the first of four Trump could stay in this year. Trump has been charged in three separate criminal cases. So special counsel Jack Smith's classified records case, special counsel Jack Smith's 2020 election interference case, and Fulton County, Georgia district attorney, Fannie Willis's case. So that is the four. Now, something in question happened here. And this one's weird. OK, because I don't know if you saw this, but a man set himself on fire outside the courtroom outside the courthouse. Yeah, why? Let's dive into it a little bit because there's some weird shit with this one. So this is New York Post reporting that a man set himself on fire outside man hat and criminal court Friday afternoon. As former president Donald Trump's hush money trial was underway. All enforcement sources told the post. The shocking incident unfolded in a barricaded park just across the street from the 100th center street courthouse around 130 pm. This was just today like an hour ago. Yeah, just happened. Damn, just happened. Just as the jury was finalized in the horse store case, disturbing footage showed him in a seated position while completely engulfed in flames. Then his black and body twitching on the ground as people rushed over with fire extinguishes. Police sources say said the man is 20 years old and possibly homeless. He had been sitting on a bench inside the park when he suddenly threw his belongings on the ground and doused himself in something before growing up in flames according to sources. Quote, I heard this clattering and it was these papers that had flung up and they clattered to the ground. A witness only identified as Dave to the post. Now, the post has obtained footage. The burning is separate, but they have the team this footage that they claim to be an Instagram post from the individual that did this back in January. He recorded this footage and I want you to see this. Let's see this. You got to see it first. Yeah, really. Here's clip. So this is the guy. Start a fucking revolution. You've got nothing to lose. Start a fucking revolution. So, so yeah, so that's the guy. Does he look 20? No. Okay. He's got gray hair, man. And I know he got his mid 30s. I know why people age a little different, but like he's not 20. No, no, no, that guy's definitely not. He's got gray hair in his beard and his hair. That's not 20. No, not fucking 20. Yeah. That's interesting, right? Now, again, you can these next clips, they may be disturbing to watch. You guys can find them on any any for sale.com link them there for you guys. Here is the first video. This is kind of just an overshot of of the scene. It's blurred out, but you can get the idea of it. You die. Not sure as of right now. I'm not sure they rushed them to the hospital. Now, you mentioned our media doesn't like our media doesn't. A lot of us. Right. And we haven't seen, you know, where things happen that, you know, don't really have any real explanations or anything like that. Let's go to CNN real quick, because I want to show you a video clip. Okay. This is from CNN. And so this is one of the journalists that were reporting live right outside the courthouse right when this was happening magically. Just tell me what you guys think. Let's watch this clip. CNN. Oh, what do you say? We also are seeing this to an active shooter. An active shooter is in the park outside the court. We have a man who is let he attacked fire to himself. A man has been blazing himself outside of the courthouse just now. Our cameras are turning right now. A man has now lit himself on fire outside of the courthouse in Manhattan. But we are waiting his history to be made. A full jury panel is gone. We are watching. Hold on. Let's remind about today. Did you watch multiple fires right now around his body? Anderson, we have seen an arm that has been hit. Why would she say that? Well, I think someone's telling her that in her ear. This is an active shooter. An active shooter is in the park outside the court. We have a man who is let he attacked fire to himself. A man has been blazing himself outside of the courthouse just now. Our cameras are turning right now. A man has now lit themselves on fire outside of the courthouse in Manhattan. Should he just sit there. The history to be made a fullgoing panel is gone. We are watching a man who was fully impaled in Buttercy the courthouse today. We are watching multiple fires around his body and person. We have seen an arm that has been visible and engulfed in total flames. There is chaos and it is happening. People are wondering right now if people are in danger. I'm looking across the courtyard. There is a man racing to his aid. There's coal coming off. to put out the fire. We have members of securing details. NYPD is rushing to the scene. They are trying to come now. Officers are on the scene. A fire extinguisher is right now present being put on this man to try to put out. People are climbing over barricades to try to separate the public to put out the flame on this man. He has lit himself out in fire in front of the courthouse right now. We are watching as the flame, we can smell the air. I can smell the burning of some sort of a flesh. I can smell the burning of some sort of agent being used as well as an excelling to put that fire. I smell an actual fire extinguisher having been displayed. I see a person whose body appears to be on the ground being surrounded by officers. I have multiple officers. I kind of about it doesn't office. There's arms still burning. The fire is still burning. It's now in multiple locations. It continues to continue to blaze. We right now have officers removing their codes, trying to surround this person to adopt their body, to prevent them from further going into flames. You can smell. I'm seeing it with Evan Gred. You can smell burning flesh. You can smell an accelerant. The flames are continuing to engulf his person. I hear shout that are coming from across the courtyard. I have people multiple other folks running over out of fire with a machine being brought out. You can tell by the way they're acting. To be engulfed in flames, a portion of his body is stuck in golf and flames. A yellow smoke is billowing from on top of his person as it engulfing the officers who are continuing to try to put out these flames. But are continuing to blaze in. Now the officers are not visible through the golf and the cloud of smoke. Pretty good play by play by her. I mean, yes, PN. Yeah, I was like, say, say, steal it. My higher her. It's just, probably, it's weird. It's weird. It is weird. All right. What's even weirder is that there was some photographs that New York Post also was able to capture these panthlets that witnesses said were thrown up in the air right before this happened. Here's a picture of one. Here's a picture of one. The true history of the world, Hunted Carnival Edition. We all know our disinformation campaign is complete when everything the American public believes is false. CIA director Bill Casey, 1981. An Occupy Returns booklet. Our only goal abolished our criminal government and replace it with one that serves all. Man, I feel like I might have just said that. Now again, I don't really know what to make much of this. It's just weird. I don't know. Some things are what they are, dude. And like, I think a lot of people are feeling hopeless about what's going on. They feel like they can't do anything. And this is maybe his way of, you know, trying to get the word out about what he thinks is going on, which, you know, I look at that cover and I agree. You know, the true history of the world is not being told to people. People are like the best example I can give for people to look at when we talk about the lies that have been told over the course of time. Because you'd say that to someone and they're like, what do you mean? You know, that what do you mean they lied about history? Well, if you're two generations removed from an event, how do you know that it even happened? How do you know that it happened the way they said? How do you know what about the other side of the story? You see, our education system only really teaches us one side of the history of America, not all sides. And they do that for the world too. So these world conflicts, World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, we are only told part of the story. And that's very hard for people to accept. But if you want to see how this works, all you got to do is go back and Google the January 6th anniversary candlelight vision, right? And you go find it. And you have Kamala Harris comparing it to 9.11, comparing it to Pearl Harbor. You have all these Democrat Congress people out on the steps with candles and shit. And we're all looking at it like, fuck you, I talked about that. Yeah. And dude, what people fail to connect is that they don't care if you get it. They don't care if you think it's fake because they're playing a 100 year game. And when they do these things, they're not doing it for you to believe it. They're doing it for your kids and their kids to believe it. And that's been going on over the course of time for who knows how far back. We don't know. So our history has been disrupted and intentionally changed so that we can believe certain narratives about certain things. And it's hard for people to really accept that as truth. It's hard for people to step outside the realm of what they know to be fact and say, wait, now, how do we really know? You know what I'm saying? No. And there's a lot of stuff that happens that is done for the history books ahead of time that we, they don't care if we're going to get it bro. We're going to be dead in 30 years, 40 years. They don't fun care. This is for the next fucking however many years past that to have a cause for why they do things the way they do them. Like when they finally introduced this digital currency and when they finally, if they get total control over people with a social credit system, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, there's a very good chance that they point back to Trump and they point back to that insurrection and they point back to the COVID and they say, the reason we have to do this is because all these people did all this crazy shit and we have to shut this down and all their little minions will be like, yeah, not realizing that it applies to them. And as it applies to them, when they start to wake up to the truth, they won't be able to say or do anything because they champion this surveillance state, the suppressive state to come in and take care of the opposition not realizing that it will apply to them as well and ruin their lives. So to me, this could be a lot of things. It could be a siop. It could be bullshit. That dude's definitely not 20 years old. But when we look at the pamphlet that he's got here and we look at what he did, you know, this could have been done straight up for the attention to get this little thing out there. You see what I'm saying? So who knows, man? Well, I'm sure we'll find out more, it just happened an hour ago. Yeah, it's definitely interesting. Guys, jump in on this conversation, let us know down in the comments what you guys think. Let us know with that being said. Yeah, I think people got to come to the reality that we've been lied to about our history. Yeah, and it's very evident. It's very evident. Like you can look at very recent things. Like I mean, even when, you know, I remember when the, the, the, the Hamas, Israel conflict started, right? And all of the propaganda, you know, atrocity propaganda that was coming out. That was immediately recanted. Yeah. But just think if they were able to do that with the capabilities of social media that we have today and they still push the propaganda, what could they have lied about in the past without social, without social, right? Without the spread. There's no limits. There's no limits. When the truth is whatever we actually tell you is the truth. There's no third party verification. Now, there's no fact checkers. It's what we tell you it is. You know, so I, I think the short answer to what, what could they have lied about? I think the short answer is all of it. Yeah, and not only that, I think people are starting to realize it too. Yeah. Yeah. So guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know what you guys think. With that being said, let's get to our third and final headline, headline number three. Now, again, I know this has probably been a little bit more of our heavier, you know, CTIs. But I mean, we got to talk about this because I think this is probably going to be another big, big thing that happens within the next couple of weeks to change and alter American demoralization, right? And it's, it's, there's not a ton out there because this is another fresh topic that just came out. But I really think it's important to cover this just to foreshadow what's about to happen. This is, this is a big deal. And I believe that this is probably going to be Afghanistan 2.0, if not bigger, all right? So this report, this headline reads, nightmare in Niger. Exclusive Biden administration leaves hundreds of US troop hostage in Niger. Niger. Shit, man, fuck. Is that really how you say it? Yeah, Niger. I feel like black people always say Niger, or you don't white people say. I know where, yeah. I know where. I know where, I know where, I know where, I know where. I know where. Okay, oh fuck, I'm good. Allegedly Here bro, hey bro listen, it's this year. That's a w any that was good. Hey man. That was good. You leave it to me Pick up your slack. Damn New year right Okay, why people why people allegedly say that? Oh Shit, okay, but we're shit. Yes, this is a heavy thing right so the article reads more than 1,000 US troops are Effectively being held hostage in the year with medical supplies running low stuck between the military Military junta controlled governments demand for them to leave and the Biden administration's refusal to let them go home After the end of their deployments according to a report prepared by representative Matt gates and obtain it exclusively by by bar news in addition The report accuses Biden administration officials of trying to cover up the situation to lawmakers as well as to troops deployed there And their families anxiously awaiting their return Quote our troops are currently sitting on a powder keg caused by political indecision at the top of the department of state And Department of Defense with a military junta in charge who detest our presence and considers us unserious and predatory The situation seems to be setting the groundwork for catastrophic diplomatic collapse like we saw during the 2012 Benghazi attack additionally These troops are already running short on necessary life-saving supplies such as blood and medications the report by gates is office said quote They are in effect hostages of an indecisive commander in chief the report said the report is based on interviews by gates is office with troops currently stationed in Niger Who reached out to gates office after they did not receive assistance from the departments of defense and state the service members are currently deployed to air base 101 AB 101 in the capital of Niger and Naimi It's part of the 768th expeditionary air base squadron Or 768 E ABS Which is comprised of active duty and reserve forces air national guard airmen army special forces and contract support There are about 450 personnel at the air base 101 Until the takeover by the junta The base was a major hub for US intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance Against terrorist groups al-Qaeda the Islamic State in West Africa, Bahqohuram, and on Suruh It was also a hub for US military advisers supporting Niger's forces The US troop presence became threatened after the military junta Known as the Conceal National Poorless Summer Guard Dylipatri or the National Council of the safeguard of the fatherland declared it had been taken over by taken over the country on July 26th 2023 Just months before secretaries of state Anthony Blinken had praised Niger as quote a model of resilience a model of democracy a model of cooperation And that kind of interesting wherever we kind of you know touch our hands Fucking just collapse and coups and fucking and not interesting and that weird So the Hoots declared in March 2024 a cancellation of the military accords with the US I'm after a series of meetings with assistant secretary of state Molly Fee and US Africa command or africom commander Marine general Michael Langley according to the report Now here's the thing we are spending a million dollars a month supporting a B 101 another million dollars supporting a B 102 Which is another base that's close by and Basically what the junta has done is completely closed off supply chains to both of these bases All right airspace is hard to get into right now especially with the situations that's going on a little bit further north We got a thousand troops that are pretty much stuck sitting in these fucking bases with no supplies They're not being resupplied in the Biden administration DOD there just kind of Leaving them there with no plans to bring them home This is this is not looking good. This is not looking good and again um They are very very adamant and very vocal about not wanting them there And Biden is not getting them out It's weird. It's not weird. I bet I would not be surprised if they let those people get overrun and killed Just like they happen in fucking moga d-shoe just like it happened in mangasi I would not be surprised if they do this again. Bro and you know here's the thing and so like there's a few other countries that are operating in that area right Russia has some undisclosed fobs located in an area they're having no issues Um, they actually have great diplomatic relationships with nice year Oh, yeah, that's because they're not coming in and overthrowing the people's government I mean that listen dude people don't understand this uh Most places around the world hate the US and the reason they hate the US is because they walk it What if someone walked in your house and started eating your food and then decided you know what you don't run your house right We're gonna run it like this from now. I'm gonna bring this guy in yeah Yeah, and this guy's now gonna He's gonna tell you what to do. He's gonna tell you when to mo the grass. He's gonna tell you when you can eat And you don't even know this guy democracy though, but yeah We know for sure that the way you were running it was completely fucking wrong See that's what's happening and the US does this everywhere And if we want to know the truth then this is the truth and people get super pissed when you say this But the US is the iron fist in the white glove for the global communist and Israel That's the truth when they when they want something they they Strum up this patriotic message around young US men And they say you're doing it for freedom. You're doing it for democracy They send them over there. They fucking fuck up the local shit a lot of them get killed And then nothing nothing nothing good happens of it And then these guys come home and they live the rest of their life all fucked up because of the shit that they were asked to do That had no real purpose and they don't figure out that it had no real purpose until they're in their 30s And they're home or they're in their 40s and they're home and they're like what the fuck was I doing that for why did I do that? You know, I had a buddy of mine. I had a buddy of mine Tell me he's like he was telling me stories about Like the shit that that the US did And he was like look man And he was being real with me. I'm not gonna say who it was you guys don't know him But he goes look dude. He goes we did some fucked up shit over there He's like I remember one time that Shit was going on. He's like I broke into this dude's house He was sitting at his fucking kitchen table. I fucking shot him in the face and ate the rest of his dinner Shit. Yeah, so like what do you think we do there? You see what I'm saying like work that what if what if Russia came here and treat us like that? Like Americans don't get it and then they cheer the shit on and then they wonder why the rest of the world is like fuck America Death to America. That's why we're not minding our own business. We're sending our troops over for Causes that do not benefit us but only benefit these elite fucks and the Raytheans and the Lockheed Martins and the War Machine You know the the military industrial complex those people all get rich. So yeah, they want to start wars But they want you to go fight them for them Yeah, this is apparently the guy in charge right now. I'm over in Nigeria Isn't it doesn't it kind of look like It does look like that Why are you gay why are you eat? That's what he's saying but uh Yeah, but what makes you think I'm gay? Oh you walk in But yeah, so I mean it's just It's very weird and during a congressional hearing on this past Tuesday Gates slammed army leaders for leaving us soldiers and harms way quote I will tell you that I'm not tracking that anybody is somebody in Niger is not getting their medicine or their mail But I will follow up after this said army chief of staff general Randy George on Tuesday under questioning by gates quote We've received reports that they've run out of medicine in May gates Retorted quote and you know why you don't know that because it's a cover-up because United States Embassy in Nigeria is covering up because of the secretary blinkens embarrassment because blinken went there in March of 2023 And said this was the centerpiece of our African strategy I'm looking at what could have rubbed as another Benghazi Gates gates so we'll keep this on the radar man. I think I think something's Yeah, I would not be surprised bro if they let these people get overrun and fucking killed Yeah to demoralize us even more in the eyes of the world Yeah, I think it's coming people don't understand what's why they're doing that They're like why would they make us look stupid in the rest of the world's eyes because they don't want enemies to be afraid And they don't they want us to have as much trouble as we can because they need us to go from You know world power world power back to down to third world So that they can have a complete World government system set up that's you know headlined by the world economic forum and all the plans they that these Very rich very out of touch people make for the rest of us. Yeah, and they're not elected They're not we don't want them. We're not we didn't choose them But they have decided that this is what needs to happen and the this is what they're trying to accomplish So you know, they're they're gonna run the United States into the dirt as far as they can as far as the people will let them And until people stand up and fucking make their voices heard and make their presence known and in a unified way Meaning like in a very strong show of force It's gonna continue.
