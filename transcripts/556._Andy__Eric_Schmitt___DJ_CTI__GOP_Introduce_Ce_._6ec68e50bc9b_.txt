What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realest thing about the lies, the faintings and illusions about our society and welcome the mother's fucking reality guys today. We have Andy and DJ Bruce the mother fucking internet. That's what we're going to do. We're going to cruise the internet. This is your first time listening and we have a special guest I'm going to introduce you in just a second. It's your first time listening. This is CTI. This is where we put up current event topics on the screen. We speculate on what's true and what may not be true. Then we talk about how we as individuals can work to fix some of the problems going on society. Other times we tune in we have Q and A app. That's where you could submit questions and we give you the answers. Also those questions have to do with entrepreneurship, personal development but they can also be about anything else you want to talk about too. You can submit those questions one of a couple different ways. The first way is guys you can hand right those letters and send them in and mail them straight here which checks right. Yeah. Yeah. The DJ. Yeah. You can also just email them in too. You can email them in to ask Andy at Andy for sellin.com or you go on YouTube and drop your questions in the comments under the Q and A app and we'll answer some of those. Other times you tune in we have real talk. Real talk is five to twenty minutes and me just giving you some real talk and then we have seventy five hard versus seventy five hard versus is where people come in who have completed seventy five hard or live hard. They talk about how it changed your lives. We interview them. We talk about the struggles, what they overcame and where they are now and how you can do the same that they did. So if you want to know about the live hard program it's up to two or eight on the audio feed. It's a free program that will help you get your life together. All right. With all that being said we do have a fee. As you guys know I'm heavily censored on the internet. I can't really post without getting it shut down at this point in time. So I'm need you to share the show if you think it's good. To make you laugh and make you think if it gave me a new perspective, the entertaining if it wasn't a waste of your time if it gave you some information that you otherwise wouldn't have had. Don't be a hoe. Share the show. All right. So hey. What's up dude? Yeah. So we have a special guest United States Senator and a good buddy of mine. Mr. Eric Schmidt. What's happening bro? Man it is good to be here. It's great to have you on the show. First time long time. Yeah. Yeah. It's long overdue. Yeah. No, I mean we're both kind of doing stuff. Yeah. He's doing a little stuff. Yeah. Now I'm glad it worked out man. It's good to be here. Yeah. I got to ask you first and foremost. You know you were the attorney general Missouri did a great job when you were here. What's it like being a senator now? It's pretty crazy. It's a historic thing man. It is. No, it's wild and you know the swearing in was in early January and my parents were both alive. Came up along with a lot of my family and for most everybody in my family it was like the first time they're ever in Washington DC and I had only been in the capital like once or twice my whole life. Yeah. So you know I grew up in Bridgerton not too far from here man in a really blue collar part of town and my dad worked midnight and seven days a week and that's not typically the people who are in the United States Senate. I love them. You know Harvard, Yale all that kind of stuff. So it's just it's humbling you know it's an important spot and I'm not sure I ever thought that's where I would be. But I just try to keep in mind the people here you know that you're fighting for because DC can be this sort of the stuff they talk about there is not the same stuff you talk about when you're here. You know so you try to bring that perspective there but it's great man it's it's honorable lifetime to fight for the things that we believe in. You know I talked about the stuff a lot. Yeah. And to try to bring that fight to Washington is something that that definitely motivates me. It's why I did it. It's why I'm doing it. But it's been great so far so good. That's cool. And working on some good stuff. Yeah. I know you are like let's talk about a couple of those things that you've been working on. Now you you did something pretty significant just today regarding censorship and social meet or is that topic number one? That's topic number one. Okay. We're going to move right into it. Get into it. All right. Let's go right into it. Headline number one guys. All right. Yeah. What is it? GOP lawmakers introduced bill allowing federal officials to be sued for censorship. But on their own back yard man doing the good work. So this article reads Senator Eric Schmidt. That's you. That's me. He's right here. Holy shit. And representative Dan Bishop out of North Carolina. They introduced legislation that would allow citizens to hold officials accountable if they attempt to censor online speech. The latest push from conservatives to protect free speech online. The censorship accountability act introduced in both chambers of Congress would permit lawsuits against federal executive branch officials believe to be participating in censorship for damages. In his previous role as Missouri's attorney general Schmidt filed a lawsuit alleging the federal government overstepped in its efforts to control how social media companies addressed posts about COVID-19 during the pandemic, including the efficacy of vaccines and the lab leak origin theory. The lawsuit has led to a preliminary injunction announced last month that blocks almost all contact between Biden administration officials and social media companies with exceptions for matters related to criminal activity and national security. Following the ruling, Schmidt sent letters to Biden and 18 other administration officials reminding them why they were barred from contacting social media companies and seeking further information. The letters ask for confirmation that the officials are committed to protecting free speech. A list of steps being taken to ensure compliance with the court's orders, all communications with big tech firms over the last year that could lead to censorship, a list of any non-governmental partners, partner entities engaged in the effort, and steps being taken to instill confidence in the federal government going forward. That's a lot there. That's a really, really, really big deal. It comes at this weird time and we talked about the Twitter files here on the show multiple times. We've been kind of like looting to it, Facebook files. Where are they at? We know they've got to come sometime. Now that stuff is starting to roll out. This headline from Biden White House wanted Facebook to change the algorithm, boost New York Times content over right-wing media. Jim Jordan has been on a big push of this leading this Facebook files portion. He's releasing all these different type of emails and communications between White House officials and social media big tech firms. Like this one came from April 14th. It says, quote, rob, if you were to change the algorithm so that people were more likely to see New York Times, Wall Street Journal, any authoritative news source over daily wire, Tommy Lauren, polarizing people, you wouldn't have a mechanism to check the material impact. I think they're talking about us. Yeah, that's us for. That's why I highlighted that. I highlighted that. Yeah, that's us. Yeah. Congrats. But I mean, even going to the stuff about Facebook, about COVID. So like this was another, I guess, release from the Facebook files. This was an email. It says, Mark Cheryl, quote, we are seeking your guidance on whether to take more aggressive action against certain vaccine discouraging content. The Portland piece here is saying, quote, we are facing continued pressure from external stakeholders, including the White House and the press to remove more COVID-19 vaccine discouraging content. And it goes on. So we got all of this going on. I guess let's start with the censorship accountability act. Where are we at with that? So I think it's important to like take a step back and realize how all this started. So when I was a G last year, well over a year ago now, we filed this Missouri versus Biden lawsuit, which is, and you mentioned in the headlines, there was a judge issued the order basically stopping them from this activity they've had with social media giants to censor speech. So we filed a lot of people, of course, we're like, oh, this is ridiculous. It's frivolous. It's conspiracy theory stuff. Right. And all its stuff has been proven to be true. Like all the allegations prove to be true. And it came at the time, if you guys remember, when the government literally had started a disinformation governance for, I mean, this is like Orwellian stuff where the government is going to decide what you can hear, what you can say, what you can see. And so for me, it struck a nerve. And you know, somebody had to do something about this, right? And so we filed the lawsuit. One of the things we were able to get in discovery before the judge ruled, which turned out to be huge because once we did that and you saw emails and text messages from people like the surgeon general to Facebook officials and Twitter officials saying, take that down, they're also threatening legal action. So the government can't censor speech, right? That's what the First Amendment's all about. But they also can't outsource that speech to big tech giants. I mean, some of the biggest companies in the history of the world. So if you think about it, if you're somebody that wants to express a point of view that isn't the whatever, the regime's narrative, right? What chance do you really have against the big, bad federal government and then some of the biggest companies in the history of the world, right? And so we wanted to go to bat for the First Amendment and people who have been censored. And I think for me, the First Amendment is just fundamental, right? It's the idea, but here's what the founders knew. The founders knew that most people in the world, and still to this day, resolve differences through violence, right? But they devise the system where there's pressure release felt, right? Where you have your show and somebody can also have another show and somebody can listen to what they want to listen to or say what they want to say in the town square or now the virtual town square. It's sort of like this beating heart of the Constitution, right? It kind of gives life to the Republic. And if you start to narrow the bandwidth of what people can see or what they can say, that leads to a lot of frustration. So if you want to understand a lot of the frustration that's out there and I run state to item is very three times and six years, you get around, that's a lot of it, right? They feel like, hey, wait a minute, I don't need to be looked down upon by these people a thousand miles away for what I believe or what I want to hear or some, you know, I don't think masks are effective by the way they're not. Yeah. But like if you say the truth, right? Nobody's punished for like saying wrong stuff, but they get punished for saying the truth. And it's terrifying to these people who want to control what you say. So we filed the lawsuit. The stuff came out. Twitter files happens after that. And then of course, you've got these hearings. So today we filed the censorship accountability act. So right now we've got that lawsuit and you can stop it. But what's the real penalty, right? Like what is the hammer on the back end? So what this would be, individuals can sue individual government officials in the, you know, administrative state or their first amendment rights being violated. And all of that is meant to deter these people who by the way, nobody's ever heard of. Most of these people, you know, you hear a Fauci. But there's always agencies like Sissa, who knows what Sissa is? Nobody knows what Sissa is, but these people were in charge of monitoring your speech. And then they try to get around it. They'd have Stanford or the University of Washington do it for them. And then they get on the phone or they get on an email and they'd have weekly censorship meetings to shut people down. Like millions of posts, you know, hundreds of thousands of Americans, not just the famous ones you know of, right? But just regular people who have a point of view. Those people might be famous if they hadn't been censored. Right. Yeah. I just think people ought to be able to make their own decisions, right? Like take it in. It was my, when I was soon schooled us for a mass, that was the point of view. It was like, let parents decide what they want to do. They can decide if this is helpful or not, you know, they can judge it. But you get this kind of mindset, where they want to control things and whatever it is inside of me, maybe it's being a Missouri or whatever it is or how I grew up and kind of a contrarian. Man, I don't, you, you give everybody the information they can make their own decisions. And by the way, people can say what they want to say, even if I disagree with it. That's right. You know what I mean? Like you fight speech, you don't agree with more speech, not censorship. Right. And I think that's getting lost in all this. Yeah, for sure, dude. We've lost the, because of the, because the censorship didn't just start during COVID. That's what people have to understand. When you take free speech, okay, the open society dialogue that happens amongst human beings. And then you create social media, okay? And this happened around, you know what, 2000, 2000s, we'll just say. And now you take what's the speech that was happening out in public and you put it on this online forum and that online forum grows and grows and grows and grows where it does become the actual town square of where ideas are communicated about it. And the censorship starts with their algorithms, right? There is no free traffic on the internet anymore. And it hasn't been way before COVID. Part of the reason I started my Andy Graham, which is an email list, was because I was being censored for profanity, all right? The shaking. Yeah. Like if you would say something, a four letter word, they would take your traffic down. And, and, and then it got really noticeable to everybody else, you know, during COVID. But the question should be asked because there's a, there's a, there's a number of points that are, that are being brought up with this discussion. The question that I think should be asked is, do these people even have the right to delegate where the attention goes in any way, shape, or form inside their own platform if this serves as the public square? Right. So that's a great point. So what I was just talking about was sort of government actors. Then you deal with what are the private players? What's their role, right? And so I've got another bill called the collude act that basically says, if you're engaged in this kind of censorship, you lose your section 230 protections. What, what is that, right? That means you can't get sued. Like Facebook can't get sued right now. Twitter or X can't get sued right now. I love what Elon Musk is doing, but like they're shielded because when that wall went into effect in 1996, the idea was, the internet was kind of emerging, right? That this is an open platform. It's different than an organization, like a news organization that can get sued for libel or whatever, right? And so you got to kind of pick a team here. Like if you're a social media company, you want to fall into that category, right? You start altering your algorithm or you start making editorial decisions on content, right? Like then you don't get those legal potentials. You're not an open platform anymore. So we ought to take that away. So I think it's a one to punch, right? You deal with the government side, you deal with the private side, but you're right. And you've been talking about this for a while. COVID to me, like so people talk about power corrupting power reveals, right? So what COVID did is it put enormous power in the hands of people who should never have it in the first place in a revealed what their true intentions are. And by the way, it gave a playbook. Like it's not just COVID. You look what's happening now with climate alarmism. The idea is declare an emergency, right? Start telling people, and because of that, then you have these emergency executive orders. So bypasses all this stuff that we're people are supposed to have a say. And then all of a sudden, you know, you're not allowed to do X, Y, and Z, right? And that's the problem. And that's why I think this fight's so important. It's not just COVID. And you know, I was in the middle of all that stuff. We sued on the vaccine mandate, Missouri did. We wanted the Supreme Court, right? We sued on the head start trying to force vaccinations and mass on kids. We took that to the Supreme Court. We took that to court and won. We've got this Missouri versus Biden. So you kind of, you look at the tail of the tape there, man, like pushing back against all this stuff. I just really believe like there's nothing new under the sun. This stuff has been done by every tyrant since the beginning of time to aggregate power and exercise it on people who don't have that power. And we have to push back against that in this country because there's nowhere else to go. Like America is this kind of last best hope. So we got to hold on to this in the first amendments, like right in the middle of the fight. Yeah, dude. People don't, like you guys who listen, you don't realize like if it wasn't for the suits that Eric put through, things would have been a lot different right now for all of us. Well, I applaud you too because he could have very well did what many other AG's at the time did in other states, even red states where they just kind of, yeah, it's easy. Look, it's easy just to go to like these ribbon cuttings and do whatever. Yeah. You know, a lot of that. That is not why I decided to do this. Like I think you got to want to do something. You got to want to try to protect something. So for me, like as much power is, because people want to be in these positions and continue to aggregate. Like man, get it back to the people so people can live their lives and pursue their dreams, whatever that is, whatever that is. And I'm not going to tell them what to do, but they get to do it. You touched on something that I think is important to note, which was the national emergency. And DJ, if you click back on a few of these slides that we talked about, not that one, keep going back. No, no. No. Right here. That one. If you read the last sentence here, it says, the lawsuit has led to a preliminary injunction announced last month that blocks almost all contact between Biden administration officials and social media companies with exceptions from matters related to criminal activity and national security. Now correct me if I'm wrong, Eric, but this is why they keep trying to claim all these emergencies. Yep. So they can suit, they can circumvent these, these rules. Well, think about it. There's one of my first votes to say that the COVID emergencies over. That was in January of 2023, right? You're right. The reason why they hold on to this stuff is because there's different powers granted. Now look, if you're like Pearl Harbor happens, right? Like some, you know, there are certain things that need to happen when you're like going to war. The problem is a lot of these people put this, try to put this stuff into that box, then get away with it. Yeah. And you mark my words. I said this three years ago. The next thing will be, you want to know why they're talking about climate lockdown? Yep. Yep. You want to know why they're talking about daughter said it two days ago. She said there's going to be climate lockdowns, whether you, this is her exact quote, they're going to be climate lockdowns, whether you people like it or not. Yeah, because they know better, right? Yeah. And California is, you know, you're not going to have gas powered vehicles in five years. Meanwhile, they don't have enough power to charge the electric vehicles there. They're like right now. This stuff is, it's totally insane. Yeah. And so I do think though that like you guys have lend a voice to this, people are waking up to this. They see it. It's a playbook that's been tried before. Just not at the level it's being played here in the United States. What do you think the reason for that is because you know what I think, man, I think they're trying to destroy the whole entire world intentionally, especially America. Well, I think that there is this, what look at DEI, right? Or CRT, all this stuff. It's super divisive. Yeah. It's super divisive. It's like based in this Marxist ideology, right? Where you separate like you and I go out, we'll find all kinds of things we have in common. But that's not what this ideology is all about, right? Like even the military now, so I'm on the armed services committee. A lot of the questions I ask some of these political pointies who want to push this divisive diversity, equity, inclusion stuff is, you know, it's essentially racial quotas. It's these struggle sessions and it is divisive. Like think about the military. These guys, man, are willing to put their lives on the line. They wear uniforms, same haircuts, all of that is meant to build cohesion, not divide. But you see right now from the left, man, they want to infuse this into our schools. They want to fuse this into our military. And it's all about sort of indoctrination. Because if you can create that kind of division, if you can create that kind of demoralizing view, that's the only way they can ever sort of have a foothold in this country where we kind of fundamentally in our DNA believe that people should be free. You know, that's kind of you say, they mean to communist. Yeah. All right. Good. No, it didn't work. Like it didn't work. It didn't work with economic policy, right? Like it failed. And people saw it. But if you can infuse it now into race or something like that, that's new. That's the game plan. And if people are being honest, that's what they'll just call it out. And you know, one of the reasons I think why you and I have built such a strong relationship is I don't care, man. I care about this country. Yeah. And if all is whatever you want. Yeah. And if I'm up in six years, if people don't think they can vote for me or vote against me. But man, we got a country to save. And I mean that. Like we got a country to save where it's the last best hope, man, where people can pursue their dreams. I don't want to be like, you know, we want to see the blueprint look at Europe. Yeah. I mean, that they're completely like energy dependent on countries that aren't friendly to them. Right. They don't have the same kind of freedoms that we have in this country. A lot of people on the left are totally fine with that, right? Because the government then is the is replaces all the things that the things you believe in that God size hole, right? The people talk about gets filled with something. Yeah. And a lot of people on the left, they want it to be government. And people don't understand too. Because like you have to have something to lose to be fearful of losing it. And a lot of these people on the left, on the far progressive left, if we really break down that demographic. Now, I'm not saying that we can't have reasonable discourse with with a Democrat. That's not what I'm saying. But the reality is is that Democrats, most of the Democrats are not aware of how far left their party has moved. And most of them are actually more conservative by today's standards anyway, before being real. Like most of those people agree with every single thing that I say outside of here, or every single thing that like you would stand for outside of maybe the pro life stance, right? But I think that's also changing. I think people are waking up to how that's affected culture and society and how that's been used to legitimately, especially in the black communities, keep the black communities from reproducing and actually coming out. So it's genocide. Yeah. It's a mis-euthanasia. It's what has been used as. I mean, but I think a lot of people are changing. And these people that we talk about on this far progressive left, if we really examine that demographic, those people don't have anything to lose. These are people who are not really paying into taxes. They're screaming and yelling about everything. They want what you have, but they don't want to work the way you've worked. They deserve, deserve, deserve, entitled, entitled, entitled, and screaming, yelling through temper tantrums. And because we've listened to those temper tantrums at all, now they've gained some momentum. The reality is, we should look at those people just like we looked at them in generations past and be like, bro, your opinion isn't valued the same way as these other people's opinions because you're not contributing to the system. Yeah. Well, I think that a lot of those people, and I think people are waking up to this, that going to the left, man, they've been super involved in a lot of these cultural institutes, whether it's universities or these bureaucratic positions or in, you know, school administrators, whatever. They've kind of populated this, for sure, this kind of, you know, force that they have. And that's why I think we got to be fully engaged and sort of push back, right? Because there's no, there's no Calvary, right? It's, it is us. It's us. It's us. And you just like look, John Kerry flying around on a private jet, telling everybody else for people who, what they can't have. Bro, you know, were you in the room when they did that? No, I was like, no, we laughed so hard. Dude, when he's like, we never a private jet. I'm not owed a private jet. I don't have a private jet. He gets pushed out of like toy ties. Finally, he's like, my wife on the private jet. I know. Bro, bro, bro. Yeah, meanwhile, you can't have your AC on when it's 100 degrees. Yeah, we got your real hard stoves. Like, dude, get the fuck out of here, man. It's nuts. It's insane. You know, the only hope is that people are seeing this. But I think what this, you know, getting back to the headline, it's like, this has opened this thing up now. Yeah. If, if, if we went into file the lawsuit, and Elon Musk doesn't buy Twitter. Yeah. Oh, it would be totally different. All the stuff would still be in the dark. We be Canada right now. Yeah. Is he in Canada? Where they shut the news off social media? Yeah. Dude, Canada is getting no news on social media. On social media. Done. Like, that's what we would be dealing with here. We'd be dealing with anybody who had an appitent, actually here it would be CNN would get to say whatever they want. MSNBC gets to say whatever they want. And nobody else would say, which we're not far off of that. We'll see a name and be on there. We're like, everybody's dead. Because I was talking to Eric. We're going to have like a death count, like during COVID. It's like, that was, they had like this just. Everybody is dead. Did you guys see the thing they did on the high temperatures? Like last week, they put the same ticker up there for high temperatures, dude. Like, because here's why it hasn't worked for them. Most people understand that this is something, you know, that's that's that's far off. And people disagree about the extent to which humans have anything to do with controlling weather, but they got to make it like an immediate concern. Because it's the only way that they can kind of try to con people into this scam. Yeah. It's also just giving up stuff that they shouldn't have to give up. It's also a distraction too. Yeah. You know, but the common stuff is if I can stupid. Um, I do want to actually one more question on this bill. So how what's like the line of attack on this? So like as an American citizen, right? And I feel like I've been censored. I feel like my first member has been violated. And I'm going after these federal officials. Is it just bait? Like I mean, what's the damage is based off of? You know, the harm that you've realized it could just economic. Okay. But I think by the way, the other piece of this, especially since the Facebook files that came out, these companies have now opened themselves up pretty dramatically. So and it could just be them violating their own terms of service. And what the the unspoken thing in all this is when we were trying to prove, like, we had to prove that the government was not just colluding with, but sort of coercing, right? That this wasn't a voluntary thing, but the media companies who would go along with voluntary, but felt some sort of real pressure. And they got them to not just take down posts to change the terms of service, like, of, you know, like whenever you're on one of these sites, there's a terms of service that you agree to. That's changed. Three hundred pages of work. And then also these algorithms now, right? Like pressure to change the algorithm. So think about it if you're, if you're a conservative business owner. Right? And all of a sudden, you know, you were seen and you're no longer seen. Dude, dude, Eric, that happens all the time. I know, I know. And I know people who, like I could tell you, five or six people, I had their business ruined because of that. Yeah. And so there has to be, and the part of the reason why I'm doing this is there has to be a disruptive event because these folks are too powerful. So you have to have, it can't just be one attorney general. It's an army of people who say, you're not going to allow us to, you're not going to, we're not going to allow you to censor us anymore. And that pressure, whether it's litigation or something we do in Congress is the only thing that can bust this thing up. And that's what we got to fight for. What, what, what about, I mean, what do you, what's your personal opinion? Like shouldn't, like, should the social media companies even be able to create, to curate an algorithm or should it just be open traffic? I mean, for me, I think if you're going to have an algorithm like that, you have to be really a front about it. You know, and that's, that's the part that nobody has any idea what that is. Because people are talking about censorship in terms of getting post-remover, getting de-platform, but that's not really where the censoring is. The censoring is in some person behind the scene saying, I don't like DJ's content. So I'm going to turn the dial all the way down and not tell them anything of anything. And that happens every day and it's been happening for a decade. Well, I know, I know somebody who's got who had a business where they were, you know, they had t-shirts, like second amendment related t-shirts. Was doing great all of a sudden. You are on the naughty list or whatever the hell they'd come up with. And you can't see anymore. And by the way, the other thing about Google too, we're not even really talking about Google. I mean, but Google's a worst of heaven if you're on page 10, not on page one. You know, the Google search. You're relevant. And so when I was a G, we also filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google for that. So for me, it's, man, you got to bust this stuff up and because they're way too powerful, they can, they control way too much of the flow of information. And it's wrong. And by the way, it's all a lie because they claim to be this open platform, right? Where it is sort of like, hey, anybody can see anything where you can come post your stuff. That is, that is not how it works. So that's, so you got the government piece of it like we talked about. And then also you got this private piece that you have to attack. And it's going to be hard. Like these are, I mean, it's going to take a minute. Yeah. What's been happening to, to your point, you know, I don't think people realize because the argument always is, well, it's a private business so they can do what they want, right? But what's happened here is the federal government has outsourced the censorship. They are leaning on these, yes, these creator or these, uh, these, these, these entrepreneurs, bro, listen, this is why you're two thirty percent. This is why Zuckerberg was on Rogan saying, hey, man, the FBI fucking basically told me to do this. By the way, do you know, he, the reason I'm convinced we had filed a lawsuit, the discovery on this stuff going back and forth was about to drop the next week. I'm convinced he goes on Rogan to get out in front of this because he knows, look, all this other stuff now is coming on the Facebook files. They knew all this stuff was going on. Yeah. And they know how exposed they are. I know how terrible it looks. It's going to look real bad. And I also think that's what the PR thing about him, like being jujitsu and all this shit's about too. So that he looks like he's this innocent dude who didn't know what the fuck was going on. Yeah. When in reality, in my opinion, these people got a little taste of power. They thought they could rule the world. They were able to for a while. And now they're not. Well, I'll tell you this. So in that lawsuit, it took, uh, Fauci's deposition in, it was like the last thing I got to do as a D before I got sworn in. And, um, I remember that phone call. That's incredible. And that's be pretty imposing because he's like a tiny little dude. Yeah, we expectable man. You know what I'm saying? We look different on a line. But he's like, oh, man, that place was like getting into Fort Knox. And you could tell this guy has just lived a really sheltered. It's almost like a cocoon. He's in there. They got all these lawyers from the department. Justice there. And he's sitting there. And, um, no shit. In the middle of the deposition, the court reporter sneezes. And he looks at her and asks her if she has an upper respiratory infection. If she is COVID and tells her to put a mask on. Like, this is the guy. This isn't like in March of 2020. This is in October or November of 2022. This is the guy that was, you know, claiming to be the science. And he was that sort of like a hypochondriac about this thing. Yeah. And, um, so anyway, it was a little bit of an insight into this guy. But his daughter worked at Twitter. So like, these communications were happening all the time. They were taking down anything that might lead people. And they did it under this justification that everybody needs to get the vaccine or everybody needs to wear a mask. Meanwhile, Fauci, in March of 2020, a friend, we uncovered this email. A friend emails him, say, hey, I'm getting, I know COVID is happening. I'm getting on a plane. Should I wear a mask? He's like, no, not effective. Don't worry about it. They knew it wasn't. He knew it wasn't. Yeah. But think about it. It's sort of like what happened locally here with sand page and others or in other states you saw. Think about the power. You're a con executive that your main job is like naming streets and stuff like that. You can go up to the microphone every Monday and say, I got you. We're going to protect you. Still need to wear a mask. Be vigilant. This is the science. There's a lot of power in that. Yeah. And, and I think that people, we, you know, I was certainly part of it. Other people were part of it. You guys were part of it. And we got to push back against that. And, and you can, and if people want to wear one man, like, you want to walk around Forest Park with 10 massing your face in the summertime. God bless you. It's America. I mean, I think it's nuts. So I say shame them. But like, people will do what they want to do. But it's not, I don't give a fuck. It's not based anything. But think of the power they had of telling you, we know what's best. And people bring some relevance to their measurable existence. Yeah. So, but man, it was, she's on the cover of like, Vogue and shit. Yeah, he's getting commencement addresses. That's these foul chequettles. Next to a pool and a suit. Yeah. Come on, man. Yeah, he got Fouchy Candles. What the hell, you know, Fouchy Candles. They're crazy guys. Well guys, that was head line number one. Let's keep this show moving. First of all, bro, before we get on other things, thanks for doing this shit. Oh, yeah. Because like, without you doing this, people don't realize that you're a key figure in all of this stuff. And you don't get enough credit for it. Like, I see a lot of these guys who are getting credit for like, you know, Senator Cruz gets a lot of credit and TV time and Rand Paul and like, all these guys, which, you know, I like Rand Paul. But, you know, you're not getting the credit you deserve yet. And people don't realize that you're the key figure in protecting what is essentially free speech in today's America, which is on social media platforms. Yeah, well part of that is because they don't probably censor them. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well, thanks. That was our first headline. Let's keep the show moving. If you guys want to join them in the conversation, hashtag, scents or these. Let us know in the comments, guys, what you think. And also, if you have not yet, and you're still watching this on YouTube, and you have not yet subscribed, click that fucking subscribe button. Yeah. And if you're listening to an audio and you haven't subscribed, just go to subscribe. Yeah. Do it's a solid. No hose on here. Yeah. All right. Let's keep it moving. We got headline number two. headline number two reads, World War Three Watch. Poland sends combat helicopters, extra troops to border after Belarus, military violates airspace. Yeah. Yeah. This is happening. This is by bar, you guys, reading, Poland accuses Belarus. Is it in Belarus where they sent a Wagner group? That's why I thought. Yes. Yeah. Yep. So Poland accuses Belarus of having flown two helicopters into its airspace, accusing the Moscow, allowing a line nation of escalating tensions and responding by deploying more troops in its own helicopters to the border. Two Belarusian helicopters flew into Polish airspace on Monday, a statement by the Ministry of Defense said, revealing the aircraft entered Polish territory at a very low altitude, flying below radar, making them quote, difficult to detect, end quote. Locals spotted the Belarus colored wearing helicopters flying low over their houses and posted the images to social media reports state. The helicopters were on a training mission, which the Belarusian government had notified Poland in advance is taking place. But nevertheless, Poland said the incursion was unacceptable and summoned the Belarus ambassador. The Polish Defense Minister, Maruz Blaskatch, said in a response to what the government called a provocation. He had ordered extra troops and combat helicopters to the borders. Belarus says denied that any such incursion took place. Deutsch, well, reports they called the claims, quote unquote, far fetched, and that Poland had invented the incident to give a pretext for building up their military deployment on the border. Now, we all know the significance of Poland. There's a lot of moving pieces going on in Russia, Ukraine. 1999 Poland became a NATO ally. They're claiming that Wagner forces are trying to destabilize NATO, push on Poland. And that's all good and well. We got that going on. That's interesting. But I want to know if you guys have seen this, this shit's happening in Africa. All right, let's move continents a little bit because I believe they're all tied together. We've got seen the stuff about the coup de taille in Niger. This hell, I'm reads why some people want Russia in and France out. In a sign of growing hostility towards the West since the coup in Niger, a businessman proudly shows off his outfit in the colors of the Russian flag in the traditional heartland of the post-President Mohammed Bosim. Since the coup, there has been a war of words between the military and the West. Niger hosts a French military base and is the world's seventh biggest producer of uranium. The fuel is vital for nuclear power with a quarter of it going to Europe, especially former colonial power France. Since General Abduhame Tachini, sorry. You guys making this up. Yeah, I don't blame you. That's pretty tough. That's my best tip. Just keep going. Hey, forever. Yes, this guy overthrew the president in a coup on 26 July, Russian colors have suddenly appeared on the streets. Thousands took part in a protest in the capital of Na'ami on Sunday with some waving Russian flags and even attacking the French embassy. It seems now this movement is spreading across the country. Here's a picture of that business owner. You guys got, I mean, like they're waving the Russian flag all over. It's pretty incredible to see Biden, we actually just evacuated our embassy in Niger. And of course, that came after the Pentagon said there's no threat. So we got all of this stuff going on. And I want to pose this question because we talk about it on the really I have quite often. They have a, they being the elites. They have a couple of different options. Right? There's World War Three. There's another pandemic possibly being released. Climate lockdowns, right? They have a few different options. And all of these disastrous headlines from the coup in Niger, they're all popping up. And to no surprise, COVID hospitalizations are on the rise again. Politico put it out. What's the new COVID-19 search? My question is, do you guys think like these are really just temperature checks, right? They're trying to see what the public's going to react the most to. And then maybe that's how they make the decision. What do you guys think on this? You're meaning like, you mean from an aspect of like test marketing? Correct. Like we are scared. Are they more likely to react to COVID-19? Are they more likely to react to World War Three? Exactly. Is that what you got? I mean, what we got? I don't know. I don't know that all those are related. I think you might have. Yeah, I would put those in two different buckets. Like first one, what's happening in Europe right now is incredibly dangerous because you know, so I'm somebody that I don't, you know, sending $115 billion to Ukraine and we don't do anything about Southern border here in the United States is unacceptable to me. Bro, that's treasonous. It's unacceptable and it is a very dangerous situation is going on. And there's a lot of people and I'm not one included, including in the Republican Party and all the Democrats are supporting all this. And it's a blank check. We just had votes last week on the National Defense Authorization Act. Just have an audit. Have an audit of how that money's being spent. I got voted down. Jesus. I was one of the few people that voted to have the audit. I was also one of the few people and it's kind of a weird mix of people Republican Democrat that voted for this. It said, it ran Paul had a amendment that said before, you know, as a NATO country, before we would ever, there's an article five, like a Russian, Vades, Poland, right? Before we would actually go to war, Congress would actually have to be the ones to go to war, to clear war, like in the Constitution. There are like 12 of us that voted for that. So there is this, I think, people are really invested in this thing and it's clouding the vision because they're real threat. And I'm telling you, I'm on the Armed Services Committee, you get these classified briefings. I'm not going to obviously divulge anything there, but China is the real threat. Like, Russia is proven itself. It's not that what's happening over there isn't real, but it's a third-rate military this point, right? Russia, Ukraine, there's got to be a way to sort of figure this thing out. But China, man, they have built islands in the South China Sea. They're fully weaponized with anti-aircraft, anti-missile systems. They have hypersonics that can take out, potentially take out aircraft carriers. They have a bigger navy than we have. They have, we have four naval shipyards. They have 12. Each one of them, each one of them has greater capacity than all of ours, combined. They're playing in space. They view themselves as the last 150, 200 years has been a blip historically. There are thousands of year-old kind of civilization. America's new. They're betting against us that we can't hold on. That the last 80 years has been an accident of history. And they are hell-bent on world domination. That's the truth. And so there has been this focus now more on China. But I think a lot of what's going on over there, that is not our biggest America's biggest threat. It is China. And they're playing with fire over there right now. If you get into this NATO conflict, that is World War III. And I don't want to see that. And there's a way to diffuse it. Some people don't want to engage in that. I don't think, which is wrong. What's your take on, because my theory is this, dude. And I'm definitely not privy to any information. This is just me watching what's going on, what I think is going on. And when I see the President of the United States being shown to have taken money from foreign interests to make policy decisions about foreign interests. And the probe, which as you know, a probe is just the beginning of what's actually going on. And we see these connections that he has to China and the things that have been going on. And then we see the decision about the border, right, where the border is wide open. We see the printing of endless amounts of money. We see the sending of all of our military equipment and assets and all of this money to Ukraine. We see the crime in the cities going crazy. We see the propagation through the media, which China has also heavily involved in, of identity politics and division and the ability to keep America from uniting. And we look at all these things, the draining of the strategic oil reserves. I mean, we're in my opinion at the most vulnerable that we have been in my lifetime. And I personally believe, and this is by no way, am I saying that you believe this, but this is what I believe. I believe that this dude is acting in the interests of himself and not in the interests of our country. And we are being served up to be conquered. I think he is compromised. That's what I think. I think he's compromised. And the more this stuff, it's sort of a drip, drip, drip. I mean, I out of line thinking all that stuff. No, look, and by the way, when was the last time you called your dad when you're getting ready to close a deal? It's like, you're down the phone. I've never called my dad, like, get him on speaker phone. I mean, it's like, it's all this, it's just insane. But yeah, look, and I think a lot of people try to make this way more complicated than it needs to be. If we are energy independent and dominant, half of these issues go by the wayside. There is no reason the world why we should be depending on China for these supply chains. There's none. And when that lend more to my theory, though, because that was the literal first thing he did when he came in on day one. I know he did that. And has done nothing about the board. I think he's sort of trying to appease his base in many ways because he thinks that you know, from a political perspective, it helps him to have an open border, I guess. It's like, there have been, you know, Missouri has six million people in the whole state, right? 6.2 million. There have been over seven million people. We know of that have come here legally just in the last two and a half years. Think about that. And by the way, we don't know who they are. We don't know who they are. We don't know where they're at, by the way. We have. And we don't know where they come from. We don't know what like we don't. These are a lot of these are military age males from different places all over the world. Like, and I see this all as intentional, right? Like I don't. You have a different perspective. Well, in it. Yeah, so look, man, here's the truth. Like, like, there's a perspective of these guys are just idiots and they're doing shit to appease their base. Or there's a perspective of everything they're doing is intentional. And they're trying to like literally serve our country up to be conquered. Well, I think that if they had their way, and this is this is really scary, and this isn't like making this up, like they've said this is what they would do. If they had the House of Representatives is like a, you know, it's a, a razor thin majority right now. Let's say that changes. If they had 52 votes in maybe just 51 votes in the Senate, they've said that they will end the filibuster, right? Which means it takes 60 votes to move on something, right? Which is hard to do. And it should be for big stuff, right? Yeah. They would in the filibuster, they would add states to the union, they would pack the Supreme Court and you'd have open borders and amnesty. You'd federalize elections too. They've said they'd do that. So if you think about that, like how we're teetering, that's why when you said this early about Democrats, man, I grew up in like I said blue car neighborhood, most of my friends, parents are different. There are a lot of, I have friends who are different, like that's not the thing. Yeah. But this isn't that. This is a radical view that has somehow infected like where the movement on the other side is. And it's really dangerous. And they're not that far away from, again, packed. Okay, let's say you go from nine to they want to go to 13. Well, why not, why not 26? Yeah. After that, why not 50? Yeah. Why not 100? And then you go down this like banana republic road. And it's so it's really, it's dangerous stuff, man. And and we're not having the same debates that we had like 30 years ago. It's like, you know, sort of fiscal policy or what's the best tax rate. I mean, they want to fundamentally change the country forever. And we just can't let them do it. And that's why you got to be in this. And we talked about earlier, the Calvary's not coming in. It means I'm going to do everything I can do. But it also means like man, run for school board or show up for something that's important. Being engaged. That's the only way we're going to change it. We can do it. Yeah. We can do it. First off, use your voice. Yeah. Second off, get engaged. Third off, live to a standard that represents what you believe America to be. Yep. Those three things will make all the difference in the world. Yeah. So we're that's where we're at. And so that's the dangers. But I think the other the second bucket on the COVID-19, I think they know there's been this severe backlash. And people see that headline. Nobody's buying that. Yeah. Yes, right now. Nobody. Yeah. But, but hey, what if we tell everybody it's the hottest day in the history of the world? You know, I mean, like maybe they get away. Maybe they think that's going to move people. So I do think that this is and to take a step back, this is all about, man. So my other passion on the free speeches. That's hard. This is so stupid. I laughed at the hottest day in the history of the world. That's what I was like. And miss Omar, how long have we been tracking this data? Exactly. She's like 17 million years old. Who were the fuck was tracking the lady? They're fucking cavemen. Yeah. And meanwhile, we didn't have indoor plumbing. Yeah. Like you tell me, we knew how hot the hottest day was today. This is lady. I don't know where you come from. But what you know, we call this around here. It's called summertime. Right. Right. It's called July. Yeah. That's right. So, but it's like if the other thing happening is it's this administrative state. And we got to bust that up like the when the founders you think about it, they wanted to spread out power, right? Because they didn't want people to in fringe on. It was all to protect liberty. So you had checks and balances, separation of powers and federalism states created the federal government, only agreed upon to do certain things, all these protections. But the way around that is if you have a bunch of people who are making big decisions that aren't accountable to anybody. And that's what we got. Like the deputy under secretary of the EPA, who the hell is that? But man, if they send you a cease and desist letter or a guidance letter, your farming operation might be over generationally over. And so we got to get back to a place being where Congress is having a vote on this stuff because all this bullshit wouldn't actually be happening. Yeah. It wouldn't be happening because nobody would vote for that. Yeah. So that's another big fight that's longer term. But you see it like COVID like we said was the playbook. I think another important thing that I would like to see addressed that I think is important for our republic is that the, we can't hide bills within the bill. You know what I mean? We can't have these 4,000 page bills that get introduced at midnight, right? That have, you know, they're called the anti-inflation act. When anti-inflation act. Yeah. And everything in there is designed to create inflation. Yeah. You know, like that's a big deal, man. Yep. I agree. And what people, most people probably don't know, I didn't know until I got there. And when they do these omnibus bills, there's, that's, you know, hundreds. If not thousands of pages of a bunch of stuff that's not related to anything, like you got to like have 13 appropriation bills that fund different things and let people vote yes or no or offer amendments and change things. Like you think that's actually what happens up there? It's not. And it empowers a few people, just a few people who were in leadership. And so I think there's a movement to try to pull that back. And so that, you know, you know that your senator from Utah or Missouri has a say in this stuff. And it's not just a few people getting together to backroom deciding on this stuff. So can I actually, so just just for my sense, how exactly does a bill turn into an omnibus bill? Like what's that process? Like it's just like, okay, hey, Eric, we need your vote on this. You know, main bill and you say, okay, cool, but I need, I need to throw these initiatives in this bill. Is that kind of, and then so if you pass it around the way it should, the way it should work is, like this, let's just take that bill, the censorship accountability act. Like run that bill. Now what happens is then people put a bunch of stuff on it, whatever, and it stays on it. That's one thing. But what happens is like we're supposed to pass a budget essentially in the next couple of months. And what if you can't, what if you, you, Schumer doesn't put it on the floor or something like that, right? Then what happens? They say, well, we got to fund, we got to fund the government. So we didn't do it the way we were supposed to do it. So now we got to put together all this stuff. And it's a yes or no thing. Man, I voted against the debt, raising the debt ceiling because they had a bunch of stuff in there that didn't get to the real problem. Yeah. And then when they say in the debt ceiling thing, like, oh, well, wait till it's time to do the budget bills. And when you get the budget bills, like, well, we got to do this because we got to fund the government. So it's this institutional way of getting people to go along with a bunch of stuff. They don't really support. And I'm just, you know, I'm not going to do that. And I think there's a group of people coming in now that are, that are, it's some of this generational, right? Like, I'm 48. The average age in the Senate is 67 years old. Yeah. And there's some newer folks that are coming in that have a different view. I work with anybody. But I think you just got to have accountability, right? Like, make us vote on stuff. They can be hard votes. But then that's fine. Like, you know, when people are going to agree with it or disagree with it, but at least people know where you stand. Yeah. And, and I think that's one of the things that I didn't know what I got up there that's one of the things you really got to work on. So, great. Guys, that was head line number two. Trim in the comments. Hashtag World War three. Let us know where you stand on that. That being said, let's get on to our third and final headline headline number three. Gotta talk about it. Headline number three reads. Donald Trump to appear in DC court Thursday on January 6th indictment. Talk of the town. Everybody's on it. So, former president Donald Trump is set to make his first appearance in federal court in Washington, DC. On Thursday, that's the day when we were recording the show. In special counsel, Jack Smith's prosecution of January 6th. Trump was indicted by a Washington, DC grand jury on Tuesday on four counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction, and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights in relation to the January 6th Capitol riots. Trump is set to appear in the e-barrett prettyman federal court house at 4 p.m. US Secret Service announced their quote, maybe short-term traffic implications arising from Trump's court appearance. Of a statement from Anthony Glemi, he said, quote, while the Secret Service does not comment on specific protective means or methods, we have the utmost confidence in the dedication and commitment. So, security shared by all of our law enforcement and government partners. We are working closely with the Metropolitan Police Department, US Marshal Service, US Park Police, US Capitol Police, and the Federal Protective Service to ensure the highest levels of safety and security for the former president while minimizing disruptions to the normal court process. Now, Smith's latest indictment marks the former president's third indictment in six months. In March, the Manhattan District Attorney charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records. In June, Smith charged Trump with 37 counts over his handling of White House documents. However, Smith charged Trump with new counts in the White House documents case last week. Trump's arraignment on Smith's superseding indictment is set for August 10th at Florida Federal Court House. Now, in the January 6 case, US magistrate judge Maxilla Upataway will handle Thursday's hearing, but Judge Tanya Chukkin will preside over the remainder of the case. Now, Chukkin was appointed to the US District Court for the District of Columbia in 2014 by former president Barack Obama. Chukkin donated to Obama's campaign multiple times and is well known for handing out some of the harshest sentences for January 6 defendants, as Bitebright News reported. Smith announced he will seek a quote-unquote speedy trial in the January 6 case against Trump to ensure the Department of Justice, quote-unquote, evidence can be tested out in court and judged by a jury of citizens. Now, I want to bring up this screenshot. This is an image that has been circulating throughout social media. And it's basically this this timeline. Okay, and I want to just kind of go through this and then you guys tell me what you see. Okay, so it says June 7th FBI releases documents to Congress alleging the Biden's took a $10 million bribe from Berizma. On June 8th, the very next day, Jack Smith indicts Trump in Mar-a-Lago documents case. Okay, on July 26th Hunter Biden goes to court and rejects sweetheart plea deal after it was revealed DOJ tried to give him blanket immunity from future prosecutions. Then the very next day on July 27th, Jack Smith adds more charges for Trump in the Mar-a-Lago case. On July 31st Hunter Biden's former business partner testifies to Congress that Joe Biden was on over 20 calls with his son's business partners and that Berizma execs pressure them to fire the prosecutor. The very next day August 1st, Jack Smith indicts Trump again for January 6th. What do you guys see? I mean, this is no bias. These are just timeline dates. What did you see? I'm sure it's just a coincidence. Yeah, dude, of course. This is demo attention. They don't know that you know, all this information is coming out and while they know this information is starting to be formulated and coming out, they're surely not building this case against Trump to have something to hit with the media immediately. I mean, they wouldn't do that. There's no. That's good. No, Joe Biden is a sweet old man. He just loves his son. Yeah, he just forgets ice cream sometimes. Yeah, he just you know, shits his pants in front of the Pope. Yeah, farmers on cheese. So, so yeah, this is clearly corrupt. Yeah. And it doesn't and shouldn't matter what you think of Donald Trump at all. And going back to what we were talking about just a few minutes ago, actually inditing a former president such in the way that they had is opening up. It's it's fundamentally changing the country people and that's the point people don't realize. It's setting up your put in this on the table now for every single regime to ever come in whether it be right or left. And I'm going to tell you guys, the conservative people are going to get their place back in the White House. And now you Democrats, your people, the people you voted for that because you hated this dude's tweet so bad and you hated his great economy and you hated all the other shit that was awesome when he was in power. Because you don't like this guy, now they've created a president where the next time your people lose power, you guys could all be indicted. Like, this is bad shit. And this is not what America is about. And it's not a Donald Trump thing. This to me, this scares the fuck out of me. This, this in my opinion is the the mask of communism coming off saying there's nothing you can do to stop it. That's that's what I said. Yeah, no, this is a, I mean, you said it. This is a really dangerous road to go down, man. This is like, this is third world banana republic stuff, right? And so all the thing, what's ironic about all this is all the people who were hysterical when when Trump got elected in 2016, all the things they claimed he was going to do, right? Like this administration, Biden administration, they're doing it all. Yeah. And like, you know, they're think about this. They're starting to start World War three China. Right. Sensoring Americans on the version, you know, potentially World War three, protecting your kids from prosecution, you know, jailing political opponents. I mean, if you were like 10 years ago, read this stuff, you would have thought it was like some third world country. Yeah. And they're perfectly willing to do this, which is dangerous. It's scary. And like, you said, whether you voted for Trump or you like Trump or don't like Trump, man, this is a different deal. It's completely unprecedented. And you see two tears of justice here, one for Trump. And by the way, like they, they've got one of these indictments as forward like the documents at Mar-a-Lago. Peelery Clinton literally had her staff when the, when it was under subpoena, take baseball bats to cell phones and bleach hard drives. They had, they right. She had them make up a document that said that this man was colluding with rush. They made it up. And for seven years, have rubbed it in our faces. Can you imagine, Andy, if, because the rush of thing was a total hoax, right? Total hoax made up. Obama, Obama gave the green light. Hillary Clinton's team was in charge. Can you imagine if Trump, when he was president, had the Department of Justice arrest Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and tried to put him in jail for the rest of their lives? Can you imagine the reaction? Like, and so we're supposed to just sort of like accept this. Isn't that the problem? Yes. Isn't the problem is there is there isn't the appropriate reaction? I mean, like, dude, like, it's like at some point in time. Look, man, and I'm just speaking frankly, all right. At some point in time, violence is going to have to come on the table as a reality to resolve this situation. Because if we had to have this situation happen 20, 30, 40 years ago, those, these people would be arrested. The military would have arrested these people for what they're doing. And, and, and, and, and dude, in my opinion, and I know this is true, and because I'm on every fucking watch list, there is, I don't give a shit. He's probably seen the list. Dude, the, the fucking every single veteran in this country, every single like true red blooded patriot, American that, well, that's watched Braveheart a few times is like, is it time? Like, I don't think they realize what, or maybe they do. Maybe that's a new insight. Maybe they're trying to incite a situation where people rise up and they crush them and then remove the resistance that way. I think we look, we can't justify political violence. I think that we got to, we have to be the good guys on this thing, man. But dude, it's getting us crushed. No, but we got to fight back. There's no doubt about it, right? Like, this, this cannot, to your point, man, there's no end to this. There's no, if this is the way that we go down, right, then we are, we are not who we say we are, right, which is where, which again, we talked about earlier, like this pressure release, fell, man, people have to feel like they can vote for a candidate they want to vote for, they can say what they want to say. But when you start criminalizing politics or speech, you know, people are going to get really frustrated with that. And I just think this timeline, man. And by the way, the other thing that people don't talk about is Jack Smith, or, yeah, Jack Smith, in 2014, when this stuff started was the head of the DOJ's like anti-corruption stuff. So like Jack Smith, like when these payments are coming in and there's all these shell corporations, wires coming in, he knows about it. He's in there, man. Like he's in there. And so we had that ridiculous January 6th committee. And they got their guy to go do their bidding now, which is, this is a political prosecution, man. It's a disaster. I don't know what else to say. It's like. But bro, my point is, like I'm not trying to put you in an uncomfortable position, but like real talk. We've been sitting here and we know all the conservatives and we know the politicians, the Matt Gaetz's and you and Holly and all these guys are Rand Paul and we can name 50 other people, push back on this shit, but it's still happening. And at what level, like, are we going to allow him, are we going to allow these people to execute Donald Trump to make a point? That's floating around. That's one of the things that I think is like, so I'm supporting Trump. I was one of the first people to endorse him in 2024. And by the way, this thing isn't about 2020. It's about 2024. This is about not allowing Americans to vote for their preferred presidential candidate because they hate this guy so much. I talked to my friend, one of my really smart friends that you might know, Mike Glover. Mike Glover has been on the show a couple of different times. We were talking yesterday on the phone. And he he lifted up a point that I hadn't thought of yet. But he told me that there's five or six key states where he's under indictment for these crimes. They can actually remove them off the ballot so that he cannot win the election no matter what. Yeah, that's like, like, it's going to come down. The election will come down to like five states. I don't know what what those are, but it's going to come down. I'm not saying Arizona Nevada. It's it's the five that are all in question. And we have to come. We have to make sure then. And like I said, people make their own decisions, but come out and vote. I think Trump's going to be the nominee. I'm supporting him. And one of the main reasons I'm supporting him. First, why didn't get us any foreign wars? That's a big one. And two, man, we had a great economy. In three, I think if he gets back in there, he can only serve one term, right? He has four years. He is going to totally dismantle this administrative state in a way that we have never seen because we've seen the we've seen the underbelly this thing, man, and it is ugly and it is nasty and it is about power and control. And I think if you get him in there, man, he's going to be the ultimate disruptor. And people aren't going to like it. And that mainstream media, they're going to lose their minds. But that's what we need right now. We need somebody to come in and just totally shake this thing up. So, man, I think all this stuff is also meant to be a distraction because they're trying to just like have a count of how many indictments and how many times you've impeached. I think his strength and some though, like my gut is like it. Dude, listen, I see the same way you see it. Like there's all these people in the conservative land and America land that are like, well, what about the Santas or what about this or what about that? Look, dude, they tell you who to vote for by who they attack. All right. You just you just watched the New York Post attack me for telling people to drink water. Like dude, listen, people magazine the post fucking inside all these motherfuckers coming at me for telling people to be fit healthy, independent, strong, wealthy human beings. Why do they attack that? Well, they attack that because that is the way that you answer their suppression of us as citizens. You become you become the opposite of what they want. If they want you unhealthy, you become healthy. If they want you hate for you, become someone that doesn't hate. If they want you poor, become wealthy. If they want you sick, become healthy, it's the opposite. And so the reason that they attack Trump is the same reason they attack me for this little or stuff. They attack this dude because they understand that he's the fucking sledgehammer that will bring their entire operation of corruption to the fucking ground. 100% but at least that looks at the question though, right? It's the golden question. We know that they know that, right? And so no, we don't know that. We have people on the ground all over the world right now in social media arguing for Ron DeSantis or whatever bro. Look dude, Ron DeSantis is probably a cool dude. I don't know him. He's done a pretty good job. And like Trump doesn't do himself any favors by attacking him like bro, you're you need an advisor like me on your fucking payroll, bro. Real talk because he goes out and attacks DeSantis and DeSantis did great shit during COVID and it makes him look stupid like stop doing that. You're hurting your cause. And so we have all these people supporting these other people and it's like bro, like the media is all behind DeSantis. Like they understand the media understands that people are not voting Democrat in 2024. So what are they trying to do? They're trying to position DeSantis as the candidate. Fox is doing it. MSNBC is doing it. CNN is doing it. Now why would they want DeSantis and not want Trump? That should be the only question that you should have to ask because with the amount of corruption that we have and like you said, the underbelly that's been exposed and we understand the ins and outs of how corrupt this shit is, why would you even think that anyone else should be the person? And here's the thing man, you touch on this too is that it's easy for people I think to lose hope, right? And these kinds of situations. But here's the truth. We are one election away, one election away from fixing, I don't want to say all of it, but taking a sledge in because if they keep the house and one vote and West Virginia's up, Ohio's up and Montana's up, we should win all three of those states. So Republicans would take the majority of the Senate and you get down Trump in the office man, you're cooking with gas and you start to fix all of these. Everything we've talked about on the show man, everything and more, we could spend three hours doing this thing, right? For sure. You get in there and man, you just start to, you take this stuff one by one and go do it. And it's, that's the thing. Like in art, that is the thing. But you can't, we can't keep doing the same stuff we've always been doing. We can't just sort of go along with this stuff because think about the administrative state, man, it's gotten so much bigger the last 80 years no matter who's been in office, right? And so I think Trump is the ultimate disruptor in this election cycle. And that's why I'm supporting him. But it's going to take people, look, half the country sometimes doesn't vote, right? Half the country doesn't come out to the polls. Yeah, well, that's the other thing. We have all these people saying, I'm not, I'm just not going to vote this time. Bro, you have to vote. Yeah, you have to vote. You have to vote for who you think is the best. Whether they're exactly what you want or or 50% of what you want, you got to vote for what the best option you think is. Which like, and that's the scary part too, right? Because like, have you, I mean, do they're talking about like, but like, dude, hold on, hold on. Yeah. Let's talk about the vote. Okay, there's a whole big section of America now, Eric that fucking believes that the vote doesn't count. I know. And so, so like in our constitution, does it not say that we have a duty to protect the America from all enemies foreign and domestic? Doesn't it say that we have a duty as citizens to overthrow the government if they, if they go the route that this is going? Like, at what point in time are we supposed to say, okay, well, that's, this is the time. Like, what I'm trying to figure out is when do we fuck these people up? No, real shit. Because like, I've been on this show for three and a half years talking about what we can do culturally, right? Like, we could build, we could build ourselves into personally excellent humans. We can get engaged, like you said, we can, we can, we can live to a higher standard. We can be the opposite of what they want. We can lift our neighbors up to our left and our right. We can stop hating each other over identity politics. We can come together. We can unite that's still not going to give us the power. That's going to give us the culture to support the power if the power structure is intact, which the power structure seems to not be intact right now. But so like, I'm getting nervous. I'm just like, well, you listen, you got, you hear, here's what I think people miss, but you got right is politics, man, is downstream from culture. Yes. It is a reflection of culture. It's downstream. It happens afterwards, right? So if we fix, and this is why I think, you know, you're very uniquely situated. What you guys are doing is got it right. Like, it's not just about like the votes or all that stuff. It's about this mentality of what do we believe in, right? Like, start there. What do you believe in? And what are you willing to get engaged to fight for? And if you believe that America, and I believe this, man, when they, when the founders started this country, like, nobody believed in individual rights. They thought your rights came from a king or a queen. And they said, no, everybody's born with this stuff, right? And we're going to create, we're going to, with the right to, you know, pursue happiness. Like, whatever your version of happiness is, and governments only job is to protect those rights, not in fringe upon those rights. So if we start there, right? And then people are engaged in their community, living a good life. They're taking care of their family. They're, you know, they're, they're helping their neighbor, all that stuff. We win. We win. Now, the way, we have to be America before America is America. That's, that's what it works out to be. We got to make America great again. We, yeah, but we have individuals have to live that. Yeah. Like, these things that you and I love about America, which are the same things, by the way. You know, we grew up 15 minutes away from each other, went to the same kind of high school. Like these, these things that we love about America, man, like, you have to live those things as an individual for that to exist. And I don't think people understand that. You got to be, people have to, I think they got to see, they see you and they say, what, okay, so what is the about that guy that makes him, and then, and that's how you begin the conversation. It's not like talking down to people and they got to see you live it. And you also, like, we can't accept that we're talking about a presidential race, right? We also cannot accept that we would teach our kids in grade school to hate America. Like, we can't accept that anymore. Like, we can't accept the idea that you're going to divide students and have privileged walks at Winsville. Like, we just can't accept that anymore, right? None of it, dude. So, and I think that if there was anything that came from COVID worthwhile, it was this, I think this realization of what was going on in schools and culturally, like, what are kids are being exposed to? Because all the cultural wins are coming at us, right? You know, we've got Hollywood, the universities, you've got these CRT people, you've got DEI, all this stuff. But they can only advance as far as we let them. And that means people standing up in their communities and fighting back and finding people of like mind and going doing something, right? It's being engaged. And so, I think your podcast man, the stuff that you're doing is a, he's a great avenue for people to do it because they see it and it actually does matter. Like, it does matter. It's the only thing that's going to save us, honestly. I just think on top of that, man, it's just like, dude, I think it's the only thing, bro. It's going to have, like, these dudes that I just mentioned besides you, these guys are going to have to get aggressive. Like, they're going to have to get, like, you've been aggressive. Like, I said this on the show before you came on. Like, I'm super proud of, like, I've said this on other shows you may not have heard, but I'm super fucking proud that I supported you in the campaign. Like, when I see what you do, it makes me proud. I said, okay, that was the right move. We did the right thing. We got a guy in there that's actually fighting. You can't say that about many people up there, dude. A lot of these people are sitting in, they're sitting on a cold seat when they should be standing up. And they should be talking and they should be executing. And they should be making changes because the constant thing, the real demoralization that's happening in America right now amongst the street level citizens is this. Nothing's going to happen. Nothing's going to happen. We see this stuff happening and they're not going to do anything about it. Bro, there's pictures of Joe Biden's son doing cocaine, putting skittles on his weiner, like, with all kinds of, like, hose and like all this shit all over the internet, bro. And this guy's taking money and he's they're making decisions to get and like, dude, this is people see it and then they don't see anything happen. And they're like, well, well, this, this is bullshit. And so like that blowoff valve. And I know this because I fucking, I'm in the conversation. If these guys don't do the work, the work's going to get done one way or the other. Well, we got to get the right people into right. It's not just about. And so yeah, like, and somebody like me, you can't get there without people helping out either, right? So it's this thing of, I think finding the right people. But also it's not just about the people you like, man, it's about it's about what you do in your daily life. I mean, think about this, dude, like, you're a regular guy. Like a lot of like, yes, you're a senator, but you're a regular guy. Okay, I'm a regular guy. Look at this fucking guy. Okay, let's just look at him. He's a thousand years old. He looks like the grip keeper from from the grip. Yeah, from when no, from when Indiana Jones went searching in the last crusade and they found the cup of Jesus Christ. And there was this old man the old night. Yes, you know, it's a thousand years old. And he can't stand up. And he's the like, that's Joe Biden chosen. Yes, yes, he chose poorly. Right. This is the guy that chose poorly. Like if you, if you watched that movie, there's the Nazi army that goes in and they look at all the cups and the Nazi general picks this like cup that's encrusted with jewels. And it's the most beautiful cup. And he's like, this is definitely the cup of Jesus Christ. And he takes a drink. And if you take a drink from the wrong cup, which is supposed to be the cup of life, it kills you. All right, you age immediately. And in the movie, the guy starts to age. And if you play that part in slow motion, okay, Joe Biden actually played that character. He was in the credits. Yeah. Bro, I want to side by side. Like we're going to side by side this shit. Okay. So, so he find the clip, bro. We got to throw it up there. So the point is, this is the oldest, these people are the oldest, like think of our grandpa's like think of our grandpa's like my grandparents are dead. But before they died, they were close to dead, right? And we had to take care of them and we had to walk them around and we had like grandpa would say some crazy shit and we were like, yeah, that's just grandpa, like right? Like, but this not just Joe Biden, this is, you didn't have his your grandpa didn't have his finger on the like the nuclear dude. Like grandma would have had a she would have nuked everybody, bro. She hated everybody. So, but the point is is we have all these super old people who are calling the plays for all of us. And we have very few young people like you or like me or like some of these other people that are like even resisting at all and like dude, it would make no sense for us to a lot like, bro, if you and I let's just break this down, you and I are going to start a company. We're going to go find the oldest, most mentally handicapped person we can to be the CEO. Like that's a losing strategy, right? And we have that right now. No, that's not the right one, dude. Yes, from the Indian Jones last year. The last crusade. Final scene when you go. Yeah, when he goes into the into the thing. But are you saying the night or you're saying the guy is the ages? I'm saying the guy is the ages. Yeah, right. Yeah, no, because Joe Biden's hair is like a demon. I know that movie well. Yeah, there you go. You know how his hair gets like straight off the back of his head. Yeah, bro, that's a great group. You got to go. So that's when he's saving his dad. There he is. Yeah, there he is. That's him. That's Joe Biden. But like a few frames before that. So like if you see that that clip, he starts as a normal human and it starts to age. So if you just reverse it back, that's a few frames, it'll be it'll be Joe Biden. I'm confident. I remember I've seen the movie a thousand times. I know me too. Yeah. It's one of the last great real action movies. I actually went and filmed it. Yeah, it was like a movie you had fun watching. Yeah. But like dude, we have the weakest oldest, most corrupt people call in the place for our future, man. Like we wouldn't allow this in any other situation. And we're allowing it with the president of the United States. Well, I mean, you want you to go back and remember one of the stories of COVID that nobody really talks about is Bernie Sanders who's also super old. Bernie Sanders was going to win their primary. Yeah. And they cheated. And then they were like, well, we can't let that happen. So Obama cuts his deal. Kamala Harris gets on the ticket and like he wins South Carolina. And then there's a couple of other ones like we then they then everything like shuts down. If think about it, if that COVID would have happened like three weeks earlier or something or whatever Bernie Sanders would have been the nominee. I mean, it's and so they put Biden up there is thinking he was the most like whatever appealing because he was going to be some moderate or something. That is not who that guy is, man. He is whoever's pulling the strings behind the scenes. Oh, he's for sale. These are radical leftists, man. And all this stuff we've been talking about today is because we have an administration that's just like on hyper speed on the wrong way. So ludicrous speed like in space balls like I see your shorts as as big as mine. Space balls. Yeah, I know you're old. Yeah, you're audience. You know the same fucking movies. I know. I know. Yeah. Oh, man. Yeah. Sweet. Well, guys, that was our third and final headline. It is time now for our final segment of the show. As always, thumbs up or dumb as fuck. That's when we bring a headline up. We go through it, talk about it and get one of those two options. So with that being said, our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads Georgia police officer gives boy PS5 after receiving a call to take him away. Take the take the kid away. Yeah, we're having. Yeah, well, it's not into it. So a Georgia boy was giving an unexpected gift by a hap feel police officer after someone reported him for trying to find work around the neighborhood. The boy in a suburb. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah, someone reported him for trying to find a work. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So the boy in a suburb just south of Atlanta intended to do yard work such as pulling weeds, cutting grass, trimming hedges for neighbors. His goal was to save up money to purchase a PlayStation. A nearby resident contacted police regarding the kid and tended to have him taken away. Officer Collarand of the hap feel police department arrived to speak with the boy who expressed his desire to earn money to purchase a gaming system. Quote, the young man was polite, respectful, and truthful officer. Collarand shared. Here is the video of their interaction. Oh, man, that's cool. That's awesome. It's pretty cool. Yeah. So Collarand shared that he too is a passionate gamer and offered to assist the boy in achieving his goal. The officer coordinated with his department to present the boy with the PlayStation 5 and an online gaming gift card. The two plans to continue their friendship online where they will band together in the gaming world. What do we got on this guys? I mean, I think that's amazing. I mean, it's obvious. That's what thumbs up man. The headline was misleading though. I didn't understand the headline. But yeah, that's an awesome story. Dude, this is the truth. Yeah. And this is what really happens. Right? Yeah. This is not this is the truth about police officers, man. Like police officers are and dude, it bothers me because the Democrats hate to police. The libertarians, you say anything nice about the police. You're a book, bootlicker or some shit. It's like, bro, these are people who are paid very little relative money to serve our communities at a very dangerous job where most of the calls that go on are dealing with people who are drunk or drugged up or misaligned some way that we don't want to deal with. We don't want to deal with those people. And they consistently do amazing things like this in the community. And it never gets talked about. What's it gets talked about? Oh, the cops shot a criminal. The dude, the dude was a criminal. Yeah. Like we shoot criminals here, bro. Like this is America. When I was a G, somebody was asking me a question like what's the thing that keeps you up at night? And my answer was all the men and women that'll never go into law enforcement now. They will never know who they are because of all the stuff the media pushes about what they do. And we need we need the sheep dogs, right? We need people who are willing to stand up for their community. And this is like a great example what they really do. Dude, remember when you and I were growing up, bro? And like police officer was like a thing you wanted to be. Yeah, I want to be a police firefighter. I want to be a firefighter. Like that was like you wanted to be a police officer. You know, it's it's what do you think of this? I mean, this is obviously amazing story, but while we're on the topic, what do you think about like shrinking the government massively and reallocation of funding? Yeah, hell yeah. Tores things like police officers getting paid a reasonable salary and attracting a higher level of of human beings to do this incredibly dangerous and stressful work. 100%. 100%. 100%. In fact, yeah, and what we ought to be doing more of is the federal government ought to be block granting more money to states to do stuff that works in their own communities, right? Recruitment pay well, pay police officers better, play pay firefighters more, pay teachers more, like the stuff that we we know has a lot of value, right? And but that gets lost, right? We spend all this money on like I'll give you a perfect example. We have people calling our office all the time now for passports. Like if you're traveling, a lot of people are traveling now. It's really hard. The delays are like a couple of months. We've had over 500 people call the office. That's just people who actually picked up the phone who just didn't give up. It's they can't get a passport come to find out we're investigating this. The State Department has been in, you know, tens of millions of dollars. I think it's $30 million on DEI trainings in foreign countries, right? Like just think of all the money. And in countries or taxing their citizens and sending the money to us. They're not. We are in. So like, it's just it's that kind of stuff. And you know, a lot of people up there, I mean, you know, like $30 million was $30 million. A lot of money. You do. $30 million. You know, this cop what he's worth. Yeah. So anyway, it's a misalignment of priorities. And I think some people just think it's just like this bottomless pit and, you know, what are you ever going to do? Well, how about starting there? How about making sure people get their passports instead of DEI trainings in France? Do you think that this, do you think that we can recover from the level of like misappropriated funds and an over taxation that our government is like doing to our citizens right now? I can't. I do, but it's going to take like I said, it's going to take some real structural kind of reform, right? Because what's the chances of getting these guys like bro, you're an attorney. You know how the attorneys work? You know, oh, I'm going to sue this guy. And then you start talking and you guys go to dinner, you go to go to go. And then it's like we get them to do all this shit. Like, like, how do you get attorneys to vote for something that's not in their own personal interest? Yeah, no, it's a good question because a lot of people just they'll spend money up there because they think it's, but that's again, man, what I told people when I was running was look, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to make us, I want us to be energy dominant. I want to, you know, control the spending, cut the spending. I want to dismantle the administrative state. I want to take on big tech. Like that's that's the how I'm hired. And you're doing every single one of those. Yeah, but you got to have people who are actually like, like people have to be responsive to what people want. And anyway, so. Well, bro, look, man, again, dude, first of all, thanks for coming in and giving us the time. Yeah. And more importantly, thanks for doing what you're doing because if it wasn't for you, that like real talk, bro, I'd have a little very little hope, very little. And I don't see very many people doing what you're doing. If any, and it just gives me like, I'm less optimistic than you are, but the fact that you're out there doing it, it makes me like pause for a second. So, okay, let these guys do their work. So it's just very much appreciated, bro. And I don't, I don't know that you, I know you don't get the credit that you deserve for what you're doing. Well, listen, man, I appreciate that. And you guys, thank you for what you do. Like you, you're the number of downloads and so like anytime you're, you know, liking something on Instagram that I'm doing or Twitter or Facebook, all that stuff, we just got to come together and fight for the things that we believe in and make it work. But you guys are on the front lines too, in a different form, but it's going to take all of us together. So thanks for what you guys did. And I think, well, dude, thank you, man. But like I think, I think what you just said, it takes all of us together as the point that we should really hit on at the end of this show. Like you, yes, you're a Republican senator. But by no means are you some far right crazy, you know, like we're like reasonable dudes for like 2005, bro. You're saying like, like I want everybody who's common sense to like let go of these political titles, man. Let go of these affiliations that you've had in the past. Assess the situation for what it is right now and work together to solve it because dude, America is the best place in the world. Simply because we have been the only experiment of a country that's ever existed where people from all different cultures, all different religions, all different walks of life, all different levels of melanin in our skin or whatever other differences have been able to come together and create the most free country that's ever existed in the history of humanity. And yes, there's a lot to complain about. Yes, I don't agree with everything that everybody says on the right or the left. We all have our own opinions, but bro, if we want to have anything that resembles what you and I love and what you love is America and what I think all of you guys love is America, we are going to have to get over the intentional division that these people put on us day in and day out and work together to solve some of these problems. And so, and I know that's what you stand for as well. Absolutely. And so to the people that the millions of people who listen to you every week, yeah, that's what they believe too. And so I think that we're, you know, we can do this. Yeah, I think so too, man. Yep. Well, brother, I appreciate you. Hey, you too. Yeah, thank you so much. Yeah. All right, guys, well, that's the show. Don't be a hoe.
