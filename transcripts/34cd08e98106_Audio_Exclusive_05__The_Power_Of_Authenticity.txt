What's up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about the lives of fitness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today we have audio exclusive might put on YouTube to you. I'll do audio YouTube. It might be just a regular podcast. It's probably but DJs here hey we're gonna keep this short and sweet I think for a little weekend message. What you got I don't know what the fuck we're doing. Well I mean you know I was thinking about this Andy so there are eight billion people on this planet. Yep okay that means there's eight billion different gifts ideas potential pursuits of success. Why do so many people have a problem being authentic? I think that being authentic is something that most people are very confused just about what it actually means. I think that people believe that being authentic is typically pretending like you don't give a fuck or maybe adopting somebody else's style or the way they speak and they say man that's some real shit and they think that like if they do that that will be portrayed the same way and it's not it's not real and most people have a really hard time getting any traction on social media because authenticity is the currency that's traded on social media. The biggest stars in the world the people with the best podcasts the people who are most well known they are generally very authentic to who they are in their content and it's not pretending to be something you know like when you go to buy something and you deal with a salesperson and that sales person is clearly a cheese dick salesperson and they're like oh hey DJ I got this for you you look wonderful in that like if you've ever been to the fucking buckle in your entire life it's the worst place ever to buy clothes because you just want some fucking jeans and you go in there and he's my fuckers you throwing shit over the top oh you look great in this and it's like a fucking fishnet tank top you know like I'm like oh really like it's just throwing shit over the fuck it bro you know how it is is a big man yeah not everything looks good all right I look like a well in the fish yeah so like you go to like my point in this is that we know when we're being sold and just like we know when we're being sold we know when someone's not authentic and this is what holds most people back from attracting the attention that they seek for their personal brand or their brand or whatever they're trying to do and they think that being authentic is pretending to be authentic and it's not and people can sense it and so they have no competitive advantage because the biggest competitive advantage that you're ever going to have is who you are there's nobody like you there's nobody that's ever been like you you are a unique individual with unique gifts unique thoughts unique ideas and when you suppress those things you're actually suppressing the part of you that would attract all these people which is the goal that you're trying to accomplish so and by the way a lot of you guys talk about imposter syndrome well one of the biggest reasons that you have imposter syndrome is because you're not being authentic to who you are so you know that you're being a fraud and maybe everybody else can't tell they probably can but maybe they can't tell and so you feel guilty for not being who you actually are and this comes from fear of judgment this comes from imagining things that hardly ever happen that we think in our own brains you know we tell ourselves stories like man if I would just be this person or I would be that person so and so is going to say this and this and this fuck with so and so says okay they didn't say it you're imagining that they said it and so what that means is that you are actually your own biggest hater all right so how many times do you really get the hate that you think about it's not very often no okay so we imagine these scenarios they cause us to not be authentic well we're not authentic we suppress our competitive advantage and then we can never actually do things that resonate with other people so authenticity is very very very important in the world of business now and and per because business is driven from personal brands at this point in time unless you're a big company like Coca-Cola right or a big enough company to afford a name of stadium or do mainstream media advertising that shit still works it's just nobody can afford it so when you're a little company it's driven from personal brand and and we've seen over the last number of years personal brand can create some fucking huge companies okay look at prime they're doing over a billion dollars in sales and 18 19 months because of the personal brands behind the brand right and we could go on and on you know you got Mr. Beast his chocolate company you got these different personal brands driving all this shit that goes out and becomes successful and so what this means is is that if you don't authentically present yourself you lose your competitive advantage which loses your ability to attract a following which creates a situation where you can't grow anything from it and it becomes a feedback loop loop of a relevancy so authenticity is a huge thing it's the biggest tool on social media and most people don't have it because they misjudge what it actually is that version of yourself that lives inside of you that is in your heart that you are afraid to even speak about because you're afraid to get laughed at or made fun of or joked about or talked about that's the version of you that is meant to be the real version of you okay and you're afraid to bring it out because you fear what a bunch of other fuckers who are never going to do a thing in their entire life might have to say about it they might have something to say but you don't even know because you're not going down the path because you're afraid and all of the things that you're looking for the success the the fulfillment the self esteem the confidence all of these things come from authenticity and the courage that it takes to live an authentic life all right and so you know it's a requirement at this point in time the way the world works and you guys are going to have to figure out how to get over that yeah it's it's almost like you know so what you're saying is and this might be a you know a very dumb down example right but like if you like ducks just own it and don't worry about well I don't know if everybody else is going to like ducks if you like ducks and you fucking like ducks right you just got to own that part of it right now when you when you first started you mentioned you talked about you know this this this copycat mentality that some people have well you know that guy he just cusses a lot so I'm gonna be honest with you I see this a lot okay I see this a lot with people who who follow whoever they're their their main person is right like let's say they follow Alex Hermosi or they follow my leg they grow their hair out put a tank top dude no I mean it's okay or follow me right and these are the people that they look up to or they follow let's say Jordan Peterson okay and then they come out and they try to make content that's all philosophical and they're you know trying to emulate his style and it doesn't fucking work okay and no no views no likes and you're like you start these people start telling themselves a story well you know the algorithms fuck no bro you are not fucking being authentic and your content isn't watchable because everybody else realizes what you're trying to do everybody else sees that you're trying to emulate and with me you know you get a lot of people that start yelling and shit and like use curse words and they think that's what makes them authentic no bro I am this way all the time you know saying like I walk through the office and I got a lot of intensity I fuck around a lot I do curse a lot I talk a lot I'm me and that's what makes it work and what makes it work for Alex is Alex is Alex and what makes it work for Ed is Ed is that way like if you talk to Ed in real life he's a deep thinker he's a smart guy he's a caring guy and uh there's passion that's who he is and so when we think of the biggest personalities on the internet when you meet these people in person they're almost exactly the same as they are on the internet so what does that tell you that tells you that authenticity is the driver for the content that you want to create and a lot of people right now they believe that being authentic is being vulnerable right so this plays into what's going on with victim culture so what happens is they see everybody being vulnerable and then they make that first vulnerable post they say hey this is what's going on with me struggling with this and that's fine because it is authentic but what happens is they get a shit ton of traffic on those posts because people have empathy and people say oh man we're praying for you we care about you which by the way they don't they just say that shit on the internet and then the person gets all this extra metric traffic and then they start saying well fuck this works and then their whole brand starts to become there's sad story and they think that's being authentic that's not being authentic you're falling into victim culture and when you fall into victim culture what happens is you create a box and identity around yourself that you can't escape from so you're constantly living in this sad difficult hard place because that's who you've you've made your identity around and then you actually become this victim that you pretended to be just so you could get the traffic so and that's not authentic okay authenticity is not getting on the internet every day and crying about how hard shit is now if you're dealing with something that's you know very difficult it might be for a little bit you know but you have to snap yourself out of that otherwise it becomes your identity and it really fucks you up in real life and we see this because how many people now you know like legitimately like their whole fucking message is about mental health all day long every days I'm into health yeah dude shut the fuck up man nobody wants to be around those people either real talk now like you guys don't realize that when you complain you're likely complaining to someone who has way fucking worse problems than you at some point in time and dude if you actually knew what they were going through you'd be embarrassed about bitching about this made up shit that you're fucking dealing with because you want attention all right so we have to realize and by the way when you when you become like this one of these perpetual people you will destroy your brand like dude I know people who became like this they were getting fucking thousands of comments on their post now they get seven right people don't want to hear it bro they got their own shit they got their own problems I'm not saying that you shouldn't talk to someone if you're having a super bad struggle I'm not saying you shouldn't seek help if you actually need it but what I am saying is if that's all you ever talk about you're gonna find yourself alone because nobody wants that shit dumped on him all the time and the minute you walk away that those people are like fuck all that guy does is bitch all that girl does is complain fuck and then you end up alone and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that you're miserable because you've pushed everybody away because you thought it was a good idea because the first time you did it you got traffic okay so being authentic is not being a victim it's it's that's not what it means it doesn't mean be vulnerable every single day it means be you okay and you has enough uniqueness to it that it becomes a competitive advantage when you become really good at being you and the only way to get really good at being you is to start by being you and then be you more and more and more and more just like anything else right like if you want to get good at running you've got to suck at the beginning right if you want to get good at lifting weights you're going to be weak in the beginning when you first start being yourself for the first time in your life it's kind of weird right but the more you do it the better you get you start to realize who you are you start to like who you are because people are giving you external validation because they're liking who the fuck you are because you're being a real mother fucker so dude it's it's not about cursing it's not about emulating a style it's not about pretending to be anything it's about who the fuck are you inside who are you why are you so afraid to bring that out and then having the courage to bring it out regardless of how afraid you are and then your life is going to change it's going to open up relationships are going to happen you're going to be happy you're going to be more fulfilled you're going to have less anxiety you're going to have more confidence and you're going to feel better about yourself in your life and by the way people are going to celebrate you more because they're like fuck dude DJ is a real dude man can't compare him to anybody oh dude that's right you become a unique personality there's only one Andy for seller I think we can all agree okay there's only one Joe Rogan that's it there's one fucking Jordan there's only one Jacque there's only one Peterson okay there's a there's a reason that all these people are well known okay and it's because there's only one of them and there's only one of you two but you're hiding what that is because you're afraid that people might say some shit like that doesn't make any sense so you're going to give up your entire life you're going to give up your entire existence because you're afraid of something that may not even happen that makes no sense and it will cost you everything
