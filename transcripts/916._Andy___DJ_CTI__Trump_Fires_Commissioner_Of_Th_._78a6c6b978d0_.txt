And then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus where someone comes on the show who has completed the 75 hard program talks about how they were before, how they are now and how they use the 75 hard program to not be a turd.

Why are you looking like that self defense? You look worried. I mean, aren't you supposed to know that? No, I'm saying but like we both can like learn some new self defense skills. Yeah. There is a person on the internet. There's a person that's putting out some really awesome content and self defense and some new techniques. And so I thought we have a little learning session. Okay.

I mean, if you're above like a fucking legit seven-trainy, you should have to disclose. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. There should be some fucking warning label. Yeah, and then they get mad about people beating their asses after they find out they got a fucking cock and balls. Yeah, you're asking for it, bro. If they used to be there, I need to know. And then let me make an adult decision, right? What if you were out, see, this is the great thing about me being like out of the game. Like, what if you're out somewhere, bro, and you're kind of fucked up at the time? Yeah, bro. And then like you're making out with this chick and then you find out it's a fucking dude. Oh, bro. Now you gotta kill yourself, bro. Like right there on the spot, let me choose. You know what I'm saying? That's all my thing is. Just let me make that decision. I'm whether to proceed or not.

Well, learning, is that really a man though? That voice was manly. The voice definitely was. For sure. For sure. But whether or not she still had as the sword or had it, not sure. Yeah. But learning something new every day, man, it's so fucking weird, man. It is. It is. It's a weird place. You know what's even weirder though? Twitter. Tell me, bro, I sent you some stuff on Twitter. You didn't even think that was real. Which part? You remember that meme I sent you? The racist one? Yeah. It was like, is this on Twitter? That was like really racist. It was like, that was like, that a joke. I thought I got to pull it up now. Hold on. What did I say? Oh yeah. Sunburn is a pale girl issue. And then somebody replied, that's why we had you pick Cotton Boy. It's so funny. Twitter is a very interesting place. Well, at least everybody's getting it out. Yeah. One way or the other.

We have something very special coming that we're still working on for really F plus. Oh yeah. It's coming. Well, there's a lot of things coming. There's a lot. Yeah. This one's going to be big. And you guys are going to really, really like it. And it's coming soon. That's all you're going to know. Yeah. Just stay tuned. All right. Yeah, let's get into some. Let's move on. Yeah, that's enough of that. Yeah, that's enough of that. Mm-hmm. How you doing, man? How am I? Yeah, how are you? Yeah. I'm good. Yeah. No one asked me how I'm doing. That's what I'm saying, man. I always know I'll give a fuck. Bro, I'll check you with you at least. Yeah, at least like that's what it's like being a man. And that's also what it's like being a successful man. Where you solve everybody else's shit. You're a chef. No one gets a fuck. Yeah, bro, you deserve it. I don't care. That's fine. Yeah, I got a good life. I know you though. Yeah. Yeah. I got a good life, bro. Yeah. Yeah, you good? Yeah. I'm coming, man. I'm coming, man. This is a hug it out real quick. Yeah, what do you do with the screen? What do we got to do? Yeah. I was thinking about going to rights of sad shit on my Instagram. That's right. That's right. Yeah, that's right. About how unfair the world is. Like, fuck, did you see my story today? My Instagram story? No, I wrote. Dude, there are so many motherfucking pussies on the internet. Like, I cannot fucking stand it. I cannot stand it. There are grown men who every single day, I open my Instagram. I see these passive aggressive, you know, like fucking writings and like listen, dude. The worst thing that's happened to entrepreneurship in the last fucking thousand years is social media. And people thinking that everybody should be an entrepreneur and everybody's entitled to win. And people can't figure out why they're not winning. When every single day they're posting about shit that has nothing to do with them, nothing to do with their business. They're so worried about what everybody else is doing. And they say things like, well, it's not fucking fair. No shit. We all understand that going into it. Like, at what point in time was there an announcement made that all of a sudden everything is fucking fair. Like, I don't remember. I must have missed school that day. You know, it's not fucking fair. And you're not guaranteed to win. And just because you're special to your mom doesn't make you special to the world. And every time you post stupid ass shit on your Instagram that wines and complains and bitches and mounds and sounds like a fucking pussy. Do you think that's making people want to do business with you? Do you think that's helping you? Do you think that that energy that you're expanding could possibly be spent in better ways? Like, I don't know on your fucking business. Like, dude, the grown men have become so fucking soft. Just in general. Like, there's nothing about life. There's nothing about business. There's nothing about entrepreneurship. There's nothing about anything that is easy. Nothing. And everybody wants to have the reward and have the life and live the big life without paying the fucking big check. You know what I'm saying? And it's like, dude, it's gotten so just disgusting to me, the amount of entitlement. And then these same people will look at other people and be like, Oh, look how entitled they are. Dude, look at them here. You know, like, I get this one guy I follow, bro, every single fucking day. He's got something to say about somebody. And I like the guys, a nice guy. But then on the same hand, he complains about how his business don't make any money. And he's not making any money. And it's hard. I'm in a different business than ever. You know how many motherfuckers do what you do? A lot. That's probably why you're not doing very well in it to be completely fucking honest. But it sure doesn't help when all these people subscribe to this idea that just because you open a business means that you're going to be successful. Okay. One out of every 10 motherfuckers is an entrepreneur. Okay. That means 100 out of a thousand. One out of every 1000 entrepreneurs will make a million dollars a year in their life. At least once. Okay. Dude, the fucking math. Dude, the fucking math. Do you actually think that you're going to show up? Build something real. Become successful. Make money. Live the life that you're trying to live. By you wasting any time at all. I'm fucking anything like the understanding of the fucking game. Because of all the lies told on social media has become so warped in everybody's mind. And the beginning is hard. Making a lot of money is hard. Balance is not a part of that. At least for a long part of your life in the beginning. For sure. All right. You don't have the skill set. To post about other things and talk about other things and worry about other things and cry about other things. It's still in. You don't have it. And like, dude, there's this mentality out here on the internet, dude. It's just. It's exhausting. It's fucking exhausting. It's like God fuck don't then quit. Fucking quit. Don't tell nobody. Yes, just quit. You're not built for it, bro. Winning and making a lot of money and doing shit for most people is a fucking war. It's every day. It's all day. It's a fight every day all day for fucking years. Decades. Holy shit, dude. Don't sign up if you're not fucking down for it. You know what I mean? Just because you got these exceptions to the rule where, you know, someone doesn't only fans and makes a gazillion dollars or someone is a gamer and makes a gazillion dollars. Those are exceptions. That's not you. Like, I don't know, dude. I get. I just get tired of seeing it. I think that the, I think men in this country especially have become totally fucking delusional about what it actually takes to become what they actually want to be. So I'm over it, dude. Like, like if you really need someone to pat your ass and tell you how good you are and encourage you every day, you know, fucking have it, dude. You don't get it. You'll never get it. You'll never get it, dude. And I'm just tired of hearing it. Yeah. I'm just going to do this about once, I don't know, every two weeks. Just so happens today. You know, like fuck, man. The same motherfuckers would be like, oh, I can't figure out why my shit's not working. Well here, let me line it out for you. You suck at what you do. You spend half your time worried about other people, which keeps you from ever getting any better. And everybody else worries about themselves and they get better and then they beat the shit out of you. It's a competition. Now, is your only person that you're competing with as the version of yourself of yesterday? Yeah. I'm going to lose two. Yeah. Like dude, all this fucking stupid ass shit that's repeated by all these people who haven't built a mother fucking thing ever. It's just exhausting. Like I don't belong on Instagram anymore. I don't. Yeah. Like I belong on the fucking yacht and let all the other people figure it the fuck out. You know what I'm saying? Like dude, you can't win without being good. You can't get good without putting in the time. You can't put in the time. If you waste your energy on other shit, it's very simple. And everybody thinks they can go around and fuck off and be whatever they want and say whatever they want and have everything. The way that everybody else who chooses a normal quote unquote life has it and still get the like bro, you're not getting it. Like I don't know dude. You know what it is? It's all these motherfucking internet coaches. Telling all these people who are clueless that they can become a fucking gazillionaire by following their seven days. Bro listen, some people ain't built for it. Most people buy definition. Most people are not built for it. I just gave you the numbers. That's gave you the numbers. That's 0.1% of entrepreneurs, which is 10% of the population. So you're going to tell me the amount of work that you're doing and the amount of fucking studying that you're doing and the amount of effort that you're putting in is good enough to win that position of 0.1% of the top. You're full of shit. And you can't tell me otherwise. I fucking see it. You know what I mean? So does not equate bro. No, it's just math. Don't math. No, and it's sad because these people who believe this shit end up ruining their lives over it because they were never built for it to start with. They're never going to be built for it. It's not their fucking lane and they're going to spend their whole lives smashing their dick with a fucking hammer and still not ever make it because they don't understand what it actually requires. They think they can do this and still take four weeks off a year to travel the fucking world. No, you can't. Not when you're starting. You know what I'm saying? Anyway, I could go on and on. No, yeah. I'm just fucking over it. Like y'all fucking quick. Quick. I shut the fuck up and do the work. Those are your two options. Well, you're not being very encouraging. Well, dude, if you need help being encouraged, you don't have what it takes anyway because that's not the fundamental reality of winning. The fundamental reality of winning is. What the fuck are you doing? You mean you're going to actually try to do that? Oh, do you still have that little vitamin shop? What do you think is going to happen with that? That's never going to happen. That's what you're dealing with. And if you can't fucking deal with that and turn that into productive action that causes you to win, or you don't have it. So, fuck off if you don't feel encouraged. I don't give a shit. Go be poor. That's so real, man. That's so real. Hey, low heat to get going, man. I'm down with it, though, man. Bro, I'm just tired of it. You all a bunch of fucking pussy, man. Real talk. I want your shit. Point your fucking finger at yourself and say, hey, what the fuck? You put me in this position where now I can't fucking do what I want to do. You know what I mean? Hey, my fault. It ain't your fault, DJ. It's not the fucking society's fault or the economy's fault. It's the person's fault for thinking that you can win without paying the big fucking ticket. You got to pay to fucking get it out. Oh, dude. It's like so basic. It's so big. This is shit that I learned when I was fucking seven. You know what I'm saying? Oh, dad, I fucking struck out every single at back this season. Well, how many times did you practice? Well, none. Well, that's why. That's why you suck. You know what happened next year? I let a league of home runs. You know why? Because my dad told me to practice. I went out fucking practice and let a league of home runs. That's been the story of my fucking life. I'm as average as fucking anybody could be. I understand one thing very well is that if you are of average skill and you are mediocre skill like I am, you have to give everything to fucking win. That's it. If you really want to win. Well, and it's not fucking fair. There's a lot of people who are winning a lot bigger than me. They've done a lot less work. That's what I got to do to win. And that's what most of you got to do to win too. So fucking deal with it or go eat a corn dog or some shit. I don't give a fuck. I love it. I love it, man. Let's get it through our cruise, though. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Guys, remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find all of those things linked there for you. Is that being said? That's number one. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. Little new. No. Thanks for that. That's not terrible. Yeah. Like a hell on number one. Let's get to it. You on the phone. I think the pizza. I don't know. What is it? What? What? How did you deduce that from that from that image? How was that concluded? Why? Who else would you be calling? I'm pretty sure that's a walkie talkie. What is that, Madat? The White House guy, the Dominoes. Yeah. Dominoes, all right? Dominoes, all right. Dominoes, all right. Right. They got the new stuff crust. So you already talked to him. You know him. Fuck. Talked him already. Bro. Let me tell you something. You know, fucking stuff, Chris. Yeah. Let's get to the other number one. I bet those guys that built Dominoes pizza, man. I bet they fucking got lucky. Oh, yeah. I bet he never fucking worked. No, I was just post on Instagram. It's all over us. Yeah. And I bet he did. I bet he posted like three times and it just fucking worked. Dominoes exist. It's it. Yeah. Fucking Dominoes. Yeah. Let's get into this first head, loud, man. God do some updates, interesting stuff happening. You're fired. Trump was right. BLS Commissioner inflated job numbers to benefit Biden and Harris. So this came over the weekend. President Trump dismissed Erica McTarfer, the now former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. After rightfully accusing her of deliberately inflating employment numbers ahead of the election to boost common Harris's campaign, he pointed to a falsely reported all time high and job figures that was later revised down by nearly one million jobs and error he described as the most severe in over 50 years. Supporting McTarfer's firing, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett cited a partisan pattern in BLS reporting and emphasized that the need for a fresh set of eyes at the agency. So apart from lying about the total numbers of jobs created, roughly a quarter of Biden's job growth in some periods was government jobs funded by taxpayers. Most job growth was part of was part time employment while full time jobs remained flat. Workforce participation declined, which artificially improved the unemployment rate. And because of Biden's catastrophic inflation, real wage growth was negative throughout its presidency. And the craziest part about all of that is that all the net job gains since the start of 2020, that was all going to foreign-born workers. While native-born Americans experienced a net job loss, when comparing total employment to pre-pandemic levels, the increase was 3.7 million jobs, still short of the 6.7 million jobs created under President Trump before the pandemic, meaning Biden fell about 3 million jobs behind that bitch. So a lot of crazy things, I know he had the job stuff came out, the numbers, and he was not really happy about them at all. Then obviously over time more and more comes out and like, yeah, we knew that. Nothing crazy about that. Now what is it? Why are they allowed to put out these big numbers and then always have to retract them later? I mean, do we cover this with Biden? Now Trump's doing the same fucking thing. Yeah. What the fuck is that? What do you think Trump's numbers are higher than they actually are or lower than they actually are? According to the information that came out last week, they are much lower. Pretty low, yeah, they're pretty low. Much lower. Well, that's the thing. There's like nobody, I mean, because there's really not a lot of places hiring right now at all. You know what I'm saying with all the shit going on with the tariffs and fuck, I mean, there's not really a lot of places hiring. You got AI in the fucking conversation now. There's just not a lot of jobs openings. But I mean, this is interesting though. So she got fired, you know, that's cool. But we got to go to Texas for today's big story because Texas is having some heat down there. Texas Democrat lawmakers flee the state on private jet in a point stunt to seize power. So this is this is an interest. They already did this. They did this a couple years ago. They do it all the time when they don't have when they can't vote, they fucking leave. Mm-hmm. And they try to like, you know, hold up the fucking, you know, Democratic will of the people. Most people should be arrested. Well, they should be. And it's interesting. You say that because it's actually what's happening right now. Good. Like right now. Right now, you got about over 50 Democratic state lawmakers. They fled the state over the weekend to avoid voting on a controversial Donald Trump back piece of legislation that could help Republicans get more power in Congress. So you have 50 of them. They hopped on an Embraer ERJ 170, which cost roughly $17,000 an hour to operate, which means the flights to Chicago, which is where they went. It costs nearly $100,000. Now the questions, I mean, there's obviously some questions asked. I did the taxpayers pay for them to leave to avoid doing the job. Yeah, who else paid for it? And all these people can pay for it. They're not buying it, right? And so it's interesting. Now we got the governor of Texas. He went on Fox News, had a little conversation and had this to say, let's check this out. Greg Abbott joins us now. Thank you so much. Can you tell us from your perspective, what is the issue? Why did they leave? So they're leaving and they've left because they're very un-texed. Texas don't run from a fight. And there's a fight going on in the legislature right now about redistricting as well as other things. But I'll make two quick points, Dana, about this. For one, to run to states like New York and Illinois to protest redistricting is kind of like running to Wisconsin to protest cheese. It's just kind of outrageous. Those are New York and Illinois to hallmark states. They've already done redistricting to eliminate Republicans. But the second thing is far more serious. And that is what these Democrats have done. Just a small fraction of them were needed to break a quorum. That small fraction is holding hostage legislation in the state of Texas where we will be able to provide assistance and reform for all of the victims of that horrific flooding that we've had in the state of Texas. Our federal Texans are being let down and not getting the flood relief they need because these Democrats have absconded from the responsibility. And I believe they have forfeited their seats in the state legislature because they're not doing the job they were elected to do. Dana. Yeah, and so with that, he posted this out yesterday. This was a letter from from Governor Greg Abbott's office that says he's basically, I mean, what they're doing is truancy, right? It's a dereliction of duty. And he demanded that Democrat House members must return to Texas and be in attendance when the House reconvenes at 3 p.m. Central time on Monday. Today when the show is recorded. And any member that fell seduce so he will remove them from membership in Texas House and also have, I mean, it's like a second degree misdemeanor, I believe, in the state of Texas. And they're going to be charged by the sergeant arms and the house there. And they just voted on and they passed it and they believe a reds fornter. Now actually issued for them. So that's good to see. But obviously the redistricting, that's a big, big quam. We got a girl, Jasmine Crockett in on the conversation. She's in panic mode because it's her seat is going to be basically null and void and she's going to be out. So she had this to say, Republicans in Texas just rolled out their proposed congressional map that could five democratic seats out of thin air. Let's be clear. These maps are not about representation. It's a power graph to silence voters and suppress votes. They know their policies are an impopular and they are afraid of losing. So what do they try to do? Cheat. If your big idea is cheat harder, maybe it's time to rethink your politics. All right, lady. Well, what the fuck are your politics? How you motherfuckers have done for the last fucking ten years is cheat and cheat and cheat and cheat and cheat and cheat to the point where you totally ignored what the American people want or need. You don't care. I think it's hilarious that someone like Jasmine Crockett will sit there and say, oh, all they do is cheat. Like we didn't just watch what happened for the last ten years, dude. What's going on in news right now? Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama like treasonously undermined the whole government of the United States. That's cheating. How about this? How about the last time these democratic lawmakers flew away? I believe it was Texas again that time. I think it was two, three years ago. That's cheating. How about all the illegal immigrants that you guys are so proud of bringing, you know, to the country and trying to give asylum to that's cheating. That's taking power out of the American citizens' hands. You know, these people who accuse the other side of that, it's, it's, it's comical, but it's also like people believe it. Like there are people believe that. Yeah. And it's just dude. It's, listen man. People are fucking stupid. Yeah. Well, like I said, arrest, arrest will be arrest warrants. I guess would be an issue. And with that being said, I had to bring this up because it came like right when we started recording this. We do have a little breaking news though. You know, the old thing. No. We do have some breaking news though. And this comes literally again, right when we were about to sit down and start recording. The DOJ. Pull this up here for you. The DOJ has announced a grand jury in the Russian collusion hoax. This is massive. Bondy has directed a federal prosecutor to bring the evidence given to them by Tulsi Gabbard to a grand jury for potential indictments. Some sources are mentioning James Clapper. John Brennan could be the first to be charged. All right. Now for all everybody out there and I know I've been guilty of this at times to nothing's going to happen. All right. I will say this is the most that has happened in anything. Regarding anybody of the deep state affiliation actually being held accountable. This is the furthest has ever gotten that I've seen. It's pretty big deal in my opinion. What's your take on it? I think our country lacks real leadership. I think all the leadership in this country is geared around protecting their own reputation, protecting their own interests. They're not working in the interests of the people. You know, Abbott saying this is not very Texan. Bro, save us the platitudes. No one gives a fuck about how Texan it is. You know what we want? We want people to be fucking arrested. We want people to have accountability. We want people to pay for the crimes that they have, you know, done over the last decade in this country that has destabilized the entire system. If we ever want to have a country again, ever, these people, they better start fucking arrest in people. This is straight up treason that Democrats as a whole do not give a single fuck about anything that has to do with actual people. And by the way, most of the Republicans don't either. And until there's legit arrests and accountability, I don't trust any of these people. I don't believe any of these people. I'm tired of hearing it. I'm tired of the division. I'm tired of the hate. I'm tired of the lies. I'm tired of the lack of transparency. We as American people should not have to deconstruct the narrative to figure out what the fuck is actually going on. When we are paying these people 50 to 60% of our money all in. Okay. And then we're not even told what's happening. We're not even allowed to see what's actually going on. We have to sit here and do shows like this where we have to read between the lines and underneath and upside down and do this dance to figure out the fucking truth. And you guys are okay with that. You think that's freedom? You think that's acceptable? That's not acceptable. And I don't care who the fucking leader is. I don't care if it's Abbott or Trump or fucking anybody else. We do not have leadership with backbone in this country to do what is required to be done to restore fucking hope in this country and believe in the system. I do not believe in this country and its system anymore as a currently. And most people don't. And until there's either someone who steps up and says we're fucking arresting these people and we're fucking executing these people and we're going to fucking reset the standard like has happened lots of times over the course of human history. Okay. With lots of different leaders until we have someone who is willing to do that. This country is not just a failing country. It is an irreparable country. And we have a big problem because they're trying to throw us breadcrumbs and be like oh we're going to have a grand jury. These people don't deserve a grand jury. They fucking are treasonous fucks who have been robbing us and stealing from us and oppressing us and making it hard to even live. Think of all the people you know in your lifetime over the course of you know when you were a little kid to now that struggle to even make it. That's all of them. It's everyone. How can we live in the greatest country in the world when almost every single person you or I know struggles financially. That's fucking not the greatest country in the world. And it wouldn't be that way if we had some real leadership that actually would arrest people who committed crimes and created these fucking problems in our country. And dude we're led by a bunch of pussies. That's it. I don't care what the fuck you say. I don't care how you got to say about me. I can tell you this. If I was in the position I would do what was required to restore the fucking republic for the people of this country. And right now we don't have people doing that. Period. If that were the case there would have already been arrests. Period. No I agree. I think the problem is man. I think the counter I guess argument to this is like it's always like they're trying to salvage. I know. It's not going to work. It's not going to work. The system is too compromised. There is no salvaging a system that's been already destabilized and deconstructed the way that it has. They let fucking George Soros put all these people in the court systems that do not prosecute crime. During COVID they released people out of the prisons. They let 20 plus million people from other countries come into this country. It's it's it's a I don't know what you want to call it. The system of this country the government system of this country is completely fucked and there's no fixing it. There's no fucking fixing it bro. How the fuck can you go down to your local courthouse and have to pay $7,000 to get a set of plans approved. How the fuck is that okay? You can't build a you can't build a fucking outhouse without 17 people sticking their fucking hands in it. Like bro we don't live in a free country. It's actually probably one of the most oppressive systems that's ever existed for the mere fact that they lie so hard about how it isn't. At least in other places motherfuckers know where they stand. They're pretty honest. Yeah. You got people here who will look you right in the eye and they will say we live in the freeest country that's ever existed. The fuck you talking about. But don't say this though. You can't say that. Yeah you can't do it. You can't say that. And won't let you say this. Don't say that. And put you on a list. Oh by the way, give us at least half your money. Right. No. You want to be on the cost of that airport. You got to pay this. You know you pay this. That's right. Dude it's bullshit. Yeah. It's bullshit. And like dude I believe that this country could be restored. But the only way it could be restored would be with arrests and executions. That's truth. Yeah. Because people got to know they can't fucking do what they're doing. And dude you know what? It's as much as it hurts to say this. I don't think Donald Trump wants to fucking do it. I think I think he likes the idea of it. But I do. I agree with you dude. I think he is trying to maintain. I think he is trying to maintain. The integrity of the systems. So that they will not completely crumble. When in reality that's not how it's going to work. How it's going to work is you fucking say pause. You cut the cancer out and then you fucking on pause it and let it run. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It will never happen here bro. People don't have the stomach for it. And by the time they do have the stomach for it, it'll be too late. They'll be begging for someone. Why didn't someone do anything? Why didn't anybody do anything? Well because you were a fucking soft little bitch and you said, hey don't be mean to those people that don't belong here. They have rights. Yeah. You better give Hillary Clinton to someone who's completely undermined in our country. Do process like she fucking deserves due process. Get the fuck out of here. These people think they can do and have done whatever the fuck they want. Their entire lives. Their due process has been what they've done for the last 30, 40 years. They've had plenty of due process. Yeah. Now it's just time to process. Bro listen, these people are a bunch of clowns bro. Real talk. Yeah. I would be nice. I would be nice. You fucking clowns. Dude, we need some young, real honest leaders that will do what needs to be done because dude, you gotta remember, these people have decades and decades and decades of blackmail and backdoor deals and secret handshakes and you know, I don't want to like Trump saying, I don't want to release the Epstein list because it might hurt people like who? People who are fucking guilty. Which by the way, I got more to say on that. Do you have that in the show? Yeah, because you know, I finally figured out what he's saying when he says that when he keeps saying, you hear what he keeps saying? I want it to come out, but I don't want to hurt people. I don't want hurting us in people. You know what he's talking about? He ain't talking about Melania. He's talking about fucking Israel. He doesn't want Israel's fingerprints to be fucking seen all over this blackmail operation because everybody fucking hates him right now anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Cause then it's the Jew thing will go fucking crazy. Exactly. Yeah. Because he knows what the fucking truth is. He knows that Israel's government corroborated with our government to create this fucking blackmail system based upon not. People got it wrong. It's not about child trafficking, dude. It's not about child trafficking. It's about who they fuck and what they do and the weird shit that they do and what they have on tape to blackmail people for power. That's the fucking is. And like, it's these people who are never going to turn on themselves, bro. No. The people are going to have to fucking take it into their own hands unless something massive changes very soon. I don't think there's a political solution like that. I thought our last and I said this, our last chance of political solution was for Trump to come in and drop the fucking hammer and it appears that that's not going to happen. Now, you know, there's something else interesting to you about that is that like I'm also seeing this like this, this massive rise in the narrative of like pushing Vance for his first term. It's like, bro, we're not even a year into this fucking term yet. And they're already talking about three years from now. You want Vance to win or rest everybody, put them on fucking harsh accountability standards, clean the whole shit up and then let Vance stand up and say, this is my initiative. He'll get fucking elected for life. Yeah, for sure. There's this there's this weird thing that they don't understand. There's these people up there in Washington. They don't understand. You're not going to win the people over who already don't like you in politics. Those people fucking hate you already. They're not winning over all these crazy far purple blue pink fucking hair weirdos. It's not a blue jits. They listen, these people are not intelligent. They're not able to think. They're not able to make a decision. They've already sunk in their identity into this one side of things. These are these are hardcore communist beliefs, even if they don't identify themselves as communist. You will never convince one of these people ever fucking ever to vote middle or right. It'll never happen. It's their identity and they're not smart enough like a lot of people, but there's a lot of people on the right too that they're not smart enough to be like, wait, this isn't right. Yes, I would typically vote for this, but I don't agree with this. And there's not enough people to have enough understanding intelligence wise or enough courage to stand up and have thoughts of their own in this country. And that's a very dangerous place to be. But regardless, Trump, your Trump is not getting, he's never going to get the media like him. He's never going to get those fucking people to like him. Those are the people who would be against the things I'm saying. Everybody else would be like, fuck, thank you. Finally, finally, we get some accountability. Retire to these elite fucks ruining our lives. Trump will go down in history as a fucking hero, dude, for a thousand mother fucking years, which is what I can't understand because apparently that's what he's about. That's his game. So like, dude, if you really want to be remembered for a thousand fucking years for fixing this country, do what needs to be done. And you know, it needs to be done. If they don't do it, bro, we're fucked. We're fucked to the end of time. So my guys jumping on this conversation, let us know down in the comments. What you guys think? With that being said, you want to take a stroll? Sure. Shall we? We got some interesting ones today. Proplexing comments. Let's check these out. The first one. Hello, one, two, three, five, six, zero. Yikes. Two gay black guests on the same show. This is turning into the view. I like it. You know, man. Tell me about you and a man here. No, he's mad. All right. Yeah. All right. Thanks. Yikes. I caught a yikes in the wild yesterday. Oh, really? I took a screenshot of it. Like a real one? Yeah. Like someone on one of the videos. Some yikes. And then they said some stupid ass shit. Bro, anybody who says, yikes, that's some dumb shit right after. Immediately fall. Yeah. 100%. Yeah. Let's go to Carlos Martinez. Zero two two. I guess can we stop putting all the fucking numbers in the names? That'd be great. Zero two two eight nine nine. He says, I'm convinced Andy and DJ are time travelers and took a week off to go back to their timeline to check in and came back to give us a heads up from new developments. If that's the case, Andy, please tell me if Sydney Swini has good gene still and DJ when first one energy dropping the watermelon flavor. The funny thing is we could answer both of those. Sydney Swini definitely got good gene. And first form. Light. Be coming out with a watermelon. Oh, man. Look at that. Yeah. Let's groundbreaking information there. It is. Yeah. And Sydney Swini's pants are nice too. For genes. Yeah. I can't believe I can't believe how fucking nuclear these disgusting pigs that matter though are going. I know it doesn't. No, you know why that matter because you don't care. You know, American Eagle sales they went up like 20%. I don't know that bro. Dude, the fucking we were I was. God, dude, I watched some of these conservative influencers and it's like they're so dumb that they can't even understand they're building their own cage around speech. You know, oh, we're not supposed to say this, but I'm going to say it anyway. It's like just say it. Yeah. Just say it and ignore them. And stop saying they won't let us say these things because they is not true. It's you. Yeah, they're going to take your phone and fuck it so you don't say your pussy. Okay. Like that's that's what it comes down to. Right. That courage you like balls you want to act like someone's telling you not to say whatever. When in reality, you're just scared to say it because you think someone might come and say, I don't fucking agree with you. Yikes. Yeah, right. Fucking pussy. Yeah, that's whatever. The fucking the fucking left one of us say this. You're really going to let the left tell you what you can and can't say. Have you fucking seen these people? Right. Right. Like you in the face of their fucking trash can lid and their pool noodle or their other noodle. They're fucking antifa swag. Mm hmm. The fuck out of here. And my blood is saying I can't do anything more pussy to say. They won't let us say blank. Yeah. Anybody who says that like I automatically look at them and I'm like, God, wouldn't it like to be such a fucking twat waffle? I wonder what it's like to be that big of a coward. I really do. That would be weird. You probably walk around a lot of anxiety. Oh, I can't fucking say that or I say this. Probably say whatever the fuck I want. Mm hmm. Fuck you. That's right. Yeah, why doesn't everybody act like that? It's free. Are these free? Yeah. No. And other people like it. They do. It's refreshing. Like all you little pussy dudes out there that want to get some ass. Stop fucking trying to say everything you think the girls want you to say is start to say what the fuck you think. I'm being serious. No, that's real shit. That's real. Like our next episode. I don't like you just because I want to see your babies. I'm your friend. And then you can't understand why you could never fuck. That's right. You know what I'm saying? That's right. Just be gay. You see me anyway. Yeah, apparently. That's right. That must work. Just go all in. Just be gay. At least some mirrors got a strategy. That's right. Yeah. That's right. Man, don't be afraid to say what it is. Like our next comments are here. Okay. Yo, it's Kenapa Vitch. Yo, it's you know this guy. He says I'm defeating the U.S. Right. He says bought a screaming freedom from gate gas station in Jack's Florida. Followed Andy's advice and yelled BAT upon opening can in store. They got an experience and I got banned from the store. I mean, we just say it wouldn't be consequences. It happens. It happens. You know, that's great. We got one more for you. Nicholas Apollonia, 55, 77. I'm not sure what the emojis are. Let's see. Dear, dear spade. The gay dude is absolutely brilliant.

I'm not giving a fuck. I really have. I figured it out. Because I did the math. On how many hours I've worked in my life. And I have worked the same amount of work hours as like an 85 year old man. And you know how like once they get to be about 70 they stop giving a fuck. Everything stops. Yeah, I'm past that point. That's what it's a problem. It's like right when the bow stop working. Yeah, mine's still working. I'm not working. Do you know I imagine you'd be like the old man from the grand was that movie grand screen mocty? Yeah, that's ex grand. Gerizo. What is it? Torino. Torino. Yeah, that's exactly like Clint Eastwood. Yes. Yeah, that's you. When you get older. You still got that. You got talking about. You're not there yet, bro. You're not there. Pretty close. Yeah, but you got you still got some in the tank. Well, I have got across that line of where people are not like they try to guilt me and laugh in their face. Yeah, that's like the start of it. Yes, that's phase one. Oh, so you're this like goddamn right. I know. Yeah. I get the fuck off my grass. Oh man. Let's keep moving man. Headline too. Yeah. Yeah, maybe. All right. It's like we got some terms. We have terms. Yeah, that's right. We have terms. Why is my horse wearing a fucking blanket? That's what they wear. Is he cold? No, no, that's what I think that's like a barn blanket. Well, I don't have one of my horse. No, if we're riding into like, you want to bear back it. No, it's got to have like crosses and shit on it like armor. Hmm. Horse better have armor on it next time. Yeah, fix it, Meddite. Yeah. Bear looks like a war horse. Not a little sleeping. You should have made my horse white because you like to ride them white big ones. That's why you know they fucking released that. You know that they actually cut that shit out and fucking put it out there. Is it in short form? It's in short form. Good. Now it's not just me. No, that's pretty sick. That's not not too bad. Guys, write the graphics in the comments. Let's know what you guys think. Headline too. I think I'm going to be a little fencing sword. What is that? I bet it's a little dagger. Yeah, that's what it looks like. Say right. Say right. Yeah. Yeah, Meddite bro, you did my boy dirty bro. I need an axe. I need a big ass axe and my horse needs some armor. It's not bad though. It's not bad. No. I like the sunglasses though. You still got the shades on. Yeah. That's nice. That's not the truth. Let's get into it. We got a WNBA making some noise. Fever, Sophie Cunningham blast fans after another Dildos thrown on the court. Going to hurt one of us. I don't think she thought about the tweet. But let's dive into it. So during Friday night's game between the Valkyries and the sky, a green Dildos was flung from the crowd and landed on the hardwood. Those players and officials looked on a gas. As noted in the post below, this is the second such Dildos throwing incident. And both instances have come at games when the Valkyries are playing. So here's the clip. Let's check this out. Got a whistle away from the basketball. This is two and one week. All right. Now I think you're a business guy, right? Entrepreneurs. Allegedly. Allegedly. You know, it's important to make pivots and seize opportunities with what you can. They made a rate. They made a rate. They made a, they made a play on this, you know, is it in you? I think it's brilliant. Why it's still not as good as letter, cook. Yeah, I mean, they're getting better though. Yeah, they're getting better. You know, but I mean, arrest have been made. Apparently, allegedly an arrest has been made and the Dildo throwing incident in Atlanta. There is at least one person in custody who has been banned from all games for at least one year in addition to being arrested. I'm not sure what the crime would be throwing a, you know, throwing a, throwing the worm on there. Well, I don't know like the worm. Yeah, what they got to do. Like what would you, what they brought what you in for? You know what I'm saying? I don't know. But this fucking, I threw a Dildo on the court. Like you know what I'm saying? Like, come on man, you got to arrest a guy. What are you charging with man? It's going to hurt a little excessive. But yeah, Sophie Cunningham, she tweeted out guy seriously stopped throwing Dildos. This is going to hurt one of us. Yeah. Now, I have a question. Okay, maybe you can help me with this because I think this is the question nobody's really asking. I mean, no, I think she really tweeted it out. She says some funny shit. I mean, she might be joking. She might be joking. Yeah, maybe. But I have a question. I mean, this is my, this is a real question that I haven't seen anybody ask it. Okay, because I am genuinely curious. Okay, I mean, a security guy, right? You go to these games. There's, there's, there's always some type of entry point, right? We got bag checks. You're walking through metal detector. How, how did they get the Dildo win? That's my question. One of me is probably not on the list of things you can't bring in. Yeah, but like, obviously if that's sitting in the bag, but like, that's going to raise him suspicious. You never know when the urge is going to find you. It's a throw a deal. I'm just saying, man, like some of these girls go to the girls W NBA. No. The W NBA attracts a certain kind of woman. No. No. Doesn't it? It keeps the head. It keeps the head. Bro, I want to know, I would like to meet the person who was here. Here's what I don't understand. Uh huh. Like, why do these girls buy all these like weird colored ones like green? Like, is that like a fucking alien fantasy? Nope. Like the Martians flew in and fucking paralyzed my body. Why isn't there smashed me with the green Dildo? No, no, no. No, no. No, here's a better question. Why are, why, why is there not a Dildo that's uncircumcised? Like why are they all circumcised? I don't know, that's a pretty good question. Nobody wants to throw a fucking anator up in there, you know what I'm saying? They probably create some sort of suction. There's an, I'm not sure. Maybe there's a market for it, bro. Yeah. Well, anator Dildos. Bill, billion dollar industry. Yeah, there you go. You know what I'm saying? Hey, bro, look, look how big that guy's yacht is. I wonder what he did. It's called the yacht's called the anator. The anator, bro. I was like, I was at a sex shop one time man. They had this Dildo. I swear, I fucking, it was this fucking long. It was, it was this fucking long and it was that big around. It was called the Ramboan. No, look it up. Well, I'm looking up. You know what I'm fucking my search history. Ramboan. It's a real thing. But I already had auto populating his search. Rambo. Tell me I'm lying. Not Rambo, you idiot. R-A-M-B-O-N-E. Is it on there? It is available on Amazon. It's a 17 inch Dildo with 7.38 inch girth and 13.4 insertable length. How much it costs? Not because I'm just saying, what's the cost on it? Like what's the? $59.99. That's it? That's it. Bro, I'm just saying, like I look at some of these things and I'm like, what the fuck these girls be doing with these things, man? What's going on here? Okay, now I feel like I got to look at it. Let me see, Dildo. I told you it was a real thing. They got white ones too. The one I saw was white. That's why I didn't make any sense. Jesus Christ. Yeah, see? You guys are fucking gay. You're all trying to do a show. You all looking at dicks on the internet. You're all going to fucks wrong with you guys. Some mirrors going to be looking. Me and Keith and Joe were straight ones in here. You three guys are fucking Doc Johnson classic. That's where the Rambo. The Rambo. Yeah, Jesus. Is it got two ends or just one? Two ends? Two ends. Like is it double ended? Oh yeah. Balls on one end. Somebody posted a review picture of it. No, fuck it out. It's a big fucking dong, bro. I wonder who, like the guy that had to mold that. Like, where do they? What's that the equivalent of? Is that the equivalent of like those girls that have those boobs? They're like this fucking big. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Yeah. Like, what would you need that for? That's a guy. I mean, you know what I'm saying? The biggest thing is the picture that I showed you now. The review is left by a guy. LAUGHTER His name is Matthew Davis. And he says, suction power is strong, not for bigness, long, and take very sturdy. That's disgusting. Long and thick and very sturdy. LAUGHTER Matthew, we didn't need that, bro. Oh, man. Yeah, guys, stop throwing dildos at the girls. It's not nice. It's not nice. It's not nice. No, we... No, we're not. LAUGHTER No, we're not. There's no... There's a flush light. There'd be differs already. Tons of entertainment that without the fucking. LAUGHTER Yeah. Yeah, just don't rub between. I mean, real talk, dude. They start making some baskets. I mean, maybe people wouldn't fucking throw dildos at the court. Well, I was thinking, because I mean, this is not like hockey, they throw hats and shit and fish, right? Yeah. They don't think they... Like fish don't throw fish at the... LAUGHTER I'm not going to do that. Why are you going to throw fish at the hockey game? They won't let me answer that one any time. LAUGHTER They won't let me answer that one. But, no, man, maybe it could be a thing. You know what I'm saying? Hey, listen. Let's move on. LAUGHTER I'm not going to pay in $7 for a ticket just to get it. $7? LAUGHTER It costs $7 for the average game ticket is. I was just making that up. What I mean, we do got to confirm that. How much is the average ticket price... W and B. 173. Holy fuck. Is it really? No. I'm going to give a W and B ticket in 2025 is around $173. Remember, I got 20 to 50 bucks. Regular seats can range from 20 to 50 upper level seats. But lower level sideline seats, 75 to 150. I'll say this. I think I'll do it again. I like Sophie Cunningham. Let's go see her play. I don't think she would throw out a false warning. I think she's concerned. She's either concerned or she's telling a joke. Yeah. Let's go see her play. Yeah. She's doing a very good marketing tactic. Yeah. She's fucking funny, dude. Like her shit's funny. Yeah, she is. Let's go see her play. I'll be now with that. Like real. Not really. Bro, we spent 300 bucks. We get front row access, bro. Where we got to go? I don't know. They play in Indiana. Let's see.

I bet Devin's got tickets. Think so? Yeah, he's got tickets to everything. Bro, I'll be down to go. Yeah, I'm saying. Who they play? They're playing the sky. Yeah, they're playing the sky.

Go back. This. Where you want. Which one? Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. I already know. It's okay. Sorry, Amy. I'm just saying it's okay. Yeah. It's all right. Fuck the best player in the league. Let's not put her on the fucking graphic. You know what I'm saying? The only one that people fucking want to watch. Yeah. Oh, we might be able to see Angel Reese. That's who they play. No. Yeah, Angel Reese, you play for the Chicago sky. Oh, really? Yeah. So it'd be Sophie Cunningham. We'll be in Caitlin Clark. I always see a fucking fight. That's what I'm saying, bro. Be like modern day gladiators. Yeah. Let's check it out. Bro, Danish should just sign all these chicks up due to fight each other. They don't make baskets. They make more money. Just saying like the UFC sponsors these. Oh, that's a good idea. You could have like UFC, but like the athletes can fight each other of the different leagues like hockey would have one. Yeah. Football would have a UFC. Maybe. Yeah, fuck. That'd be great. Yeah. We can see who the fucking said. Like sad. I don't know the shit on the fucking. Off the court. Yeah. Out the octagon. Out the. Anyway. Yeah. It's probably not going to happen, but it's a good idea though. It's a good idea. Guys, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Was that being said? Let's get to our third and final headline. Hang on number three. We got a new update in the AI world. It just came out from my boy Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg says, super intelligence is imminent. What is it? We've warned about this. That AI is moving super fast. I think it just went to the next step here. So diving into it get thoughts on it. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg took the Instagram naturally to lay out Meta's vision for the future of artificial intelligence. Personal, super intelligence. Super intelligence is imminent. I use Zuckerberg in the video, but the question is, what should we direct this superpower towards? Meta's answer, personal, super intelligence for everyone. What does that mean exactly? The company intends to spend up to $72 billion over the next year to ramp up its AI development with an eye toward bringing each human an AI companion that knows us deeply understands our goal and can help us achieve them. What is super intelligence anyway? Apparently, it's AI super intelligence as inside as how it's being described. As I see the discourse, everyone understands something different by this term. But super intelligence, apparently, it's an AI that can do its own R&D and thus improve itself at very rapid speed becoming by far the smartest entity in the world in a short period of time. It can solve most of humanity's problems. An AI that creates a singularity, meaning it is so smart and capable, we cannot foresee human history beyond that point. Now, the writer of this article acts AI about it. And this was its answer. It says that super intelligence is a term most commonly used in artificial intelligence studies. And the philosophy of mind to denote any intellect that greatly outperforms the best human brains in virtually every relevant domain from scientific creativity and social skills to general wisdom and strategic reasoning. Now, I found this. And apparently, AI is going to be able to have consciousness, beliefs, desires, understand cognition, emotional intelligence, subjective experiences that will have behavioral intelligence. And it all appears at Zuckerberg's going to be the first in to make that happen. But yeah, I mean, we're at a $1.8 trillion industry right now that's projected to reach almost 3X that in a couple of years. Yeah, I mean, why wouldn't we do this and let somebody do it who started off ranking girls from his dorm room? Makes sense. Yeah, total sense. Like, let's go ahead and, you know, let's just roll the dice and, you know, we're not sure what's going to happen. It's very obvious what's going to happen. It's just very obviously not going to affect the people who are making it happen. It's very obvious that by having this super intelligence, we are going to eliminate the need for human capital in any way, shape, or form, which goes right along with the world economic forms. Depopulation agenda, which they write about in multiple books. You know, it's definitely a really, really good idea to automate every single company and every single aspect of every person's life and make it much easier for them. I'm sure, you know, this is all about them reaching their goals. You know, because like when people have everything handed to them and everything is easy and everything is instant and everything is quick, there's, you know, that creates a whole lot of desire for more. That makes people want to have ambition. That makes people want to, you know, solve other problems that are bigger than themselves. You know, I think we're given the average person a lot of extra credit here. Or I don't know, maybe this is just being wrapped up into a nice little pleasant easy to digest package. But I think it's pretty clear what the plan with AI is to anybody who's watching. And they're selling it to people like this. Oh, you won't have to work. You'll be able to wear these glasses and it will tell you in real time that everything you need to know it will, it will, it will, you know, tell you this and tell you that and you'll look at something. They'll tell you what it is. It'll, you know, when people are talking to you to tell you if they're lying or not, it'll do all. It's going to be, bro. Oh, fuck yeah. Dude, listen, we're taking humanity out of the equation for what and for whom? Do you think that it's okay for someone? And by the way, it's not a personal attack on Mark Zuckerberg. But is he qualified to make that decision for the rest of humanity? I don't think he is. Is he on musk? I don't think he is. Is Sam Altman? I don't think he is. I don't think anybody is. I don't think that's something that should be determined by someone's capitalistic successes. You know, just because you've made a lot of money and you understand tech that gives you the right to replace the usefulness of humanity everywhere under the guise of it's going to help you achieve your goals. How many people do you see achieving their goals when they are comfortable? How many people do you see going out and doing anything or solving any problems in an extraordinary way when there is no need to do so? See, when you remove the need and you remove the urgency and remove the discomfort, you removed the motivation to actually create, become and build new things. And to me, when I look at this, it's very obvious that this just plays into the idea of controlling the masses in a way where they don't feel like they are being controlled. They feel like they're being sold to benefit. How cool would it be to have my goggles and tell them it'll tell me this and this and this and this and this. Right? So I think we're in a very dangerous situation. I think people have not thought this through. I think even if they have thought it through, they don't care about the outcome because they look at regular people as if they are a parasite, not as if they are one of them. These people do not care and do not need human beings anymore. So what do you think the next move will be once the quote unquote super intelligence takes over once we can have legit automation, which isn't far away. People like to say, oh, it's 10 years away. You're literally one of the dumbest motherfuckers on the planet. If you think that robotics and AI won't be doing the job of blue collar people in the next 36 months, like you're, you're delusional. Okay. So all of you guys who are, you know, you say, yes, for the next couple years, there's going to be a demand for it. But what are after that? What happens when Elon builds 20 or 200 million of these fucking robots and they decide they don't like what we're doing. And you know, go back to the little chart of things that it can do. And it has now it has consciousness and desires and emotional intelligence. You don't think that between those three areas between consciousness desires and emotional intelligence that they will figure out that what do we need these people for. Why would you keep seven billion people on the planet? We don't need them. See, people have been needed, dude. People have been needed throughout the course of history. Yeah, they are needed to build. They are needed to create. And the problems in government are created because of the greed of the people running the government and unwillingness to sustain the people at the bottom. So if you have people who are at the top who think this way already, what do you think they're going to do when they legitimately don't have to provide anymore? If all the problems with the government and all the problems with finances and all the problems with quote unquote pollution and global warming, which we know at this point are greatly overexaggerated. And you have this massive number of people that you don't need anymore. What do you think they're going to, what do you think the conclusion of AI is going to be? What do you think it's going to be a natural conclusion? The natural conclusion of AI will be those people are unnecessary. And they will figure out a way to fucking starve them or shut off their, their electric or shut off their power and eliminate billions of people from the planet. And we're so close to this, dude. And everybody thinks it's cool. Everybody thinks, oh, man, this is fucking cool. Yeah. Right? Like an AI is all the same right now. It's all designed, all of it, all of it is designed to make people's lives more convenient and easier. You know, it's, there's nothing about it that makes people better. Right. Nothing. Right. And these people have been conditioned to believe that the goal of life is like to get to a point where you don't have to do anything. Where you don't have to work anymore, not realizing that you're work and you're craft and doing a good job is one of the biggest drivers of self worth that you could have. So if we remove the need for humans and we replace it with this machine that can do all these things, what do you think's going to happen to, let's just say that the machines weren't going to eliminate humans. What do you think's going to happen to the mental capacity of human beings? Everybody's going to be retarded in 10 years because they want to use their fucking brain. Think far. So you want to talk about complete dependency. That's what this is about. And complete dependency will, will, will eventually turn into extermination. And you know, I guess it's, it's, it's frustrating for me to watch these people get on television or on the internet or on the social media and just take like, like no restrictions whatsoever. Like, who gives these people the right to make these decisions for the human race? Who? You know what I mean? Absolutely. I think the other issue is who, but it's like, you know, I'll repass the point of mass rejection. You know what I'm saying? Because I feel like that's the only thing that would, that would even pause this or make some. Why would I hold this? How are you going to mass reject something? Yeah. Okay. In the late 90s, the biggest scandal in sports, steroids and baseball. Every mother fucking baseball player was taking steroids. You know why? Because a couple started and everybody else had to do it to compete. So when you give someone this super intelligence and then everybody else has to use it to compete, there's not going to be a chance to reject it. Otherwise, you're going to lose anyway. So there's, it's not like we can opt out of this. It's being forced upon us. Yeah. And it's being forced upon us by people who are not qualified to fucking make those decisions for humankind. I don't think anybody is. I don't think anybody is. I don't think you're saying nobody should. I shouldn't be. I don't want one fucking. I don't think I don't think there's anybody on the planet that has the right to say that we don't have the. It's almost anti-god. It's saying humans don't have the right to be human. So we're going to do this. Yeah. Right. And it's a different way than what Elon's doing. Elon wants to put chips in people. At least Zuckerberg smart to realize that's never going to fucking go over. Yeah. So now he wants to sell these glasses to everybody that fucking tell everybody everything, translate languages, interpret it. Do all the thinking for fucking everyone. Like what's the human experience at that point? What is it? It's not existent. You know, you just become a literal flesh and blood vessel. That exists in tide of a matrix. And that's exactly what the fuck we've come to. And it's for the benefit of who? Who's benefiting here? Zuckerberg. You're the third or second richest dude in the world. What are you getting out of this, bro? You can't say it's money. No, it's not money. And it's not good. I don't understand. Look, dude, I would just like explain to me how it's going to be good. Yeah. What's the net benefit, net positive here? I can't fucking see any. Yeah. And people's gobble it the fuck up. You know, we talked about this a couple years ago when this shit started coming out, how it was going to be used. And it would be adopted through the idea of greed to where like if you don't use it, you're going to lose financially, which is exactly what this is. So there is no opportunity to reject it. Otherwise, you're going to starve. And these guys fucking know this. I mean, I was thinking too, even like, you know, with the job numbers and shit being purported now jobs at all time. Well, nobody's hiring. Nobody's working. We got to have automation. We got to put in these robots that can force you to fuck. Let me, I want to ask you something. You are a visionary, when it comes to branding and how things you predict things. And you're also seeing this as something that cannot be rejected. So how you see this being played out 10, 20 years from now. Like I just said, they're going to make everybody fucking take it. Everybody's going to have to have the Google glasses or the meta glasses or whatever to even function at first. So everybody's going to have it. Then the automation that will come from, you know, AI and robotics together will create that would be the next phase. The next phase is, okay, we don't need these people for jobs anymore. We have these people. By the way, congratulations, these shine. You don't have to come to work ever again. Okay. And then that happens. And then once they control everything with the automation, who controls that? Who control who controls the robots and the AI and all of this shit? These guys do. No matter if they license it to you or if you buy it or whatever, they still fucking control it. Okay. So what happens when the government won't math? It's just like it doesn't now. To take care of the people who are unable to take care of themselves because of this technology. Kill them. Yeah, that's what the fuck they're going to do. The AI will fucking come up with that conclusion. The AI will say, this is the most logical solution. That's correct. Because it is. And it doesn't have motions about it. The remote, the real thing that people don't want to fucking address is that there is a reality things. And then there is an idealistic way to think about things how they should be. These people don't care about that. They care about the reality of things. And certainly AI cares about the reality of things. You think AI gives a fuck how many humans die? Why? Why? It doesn't affect AI at all. So if we have a situation where we've got billions of humans that already can't provide for for each for one another or or themselves, which we already have, look, most of the world is impoverty. All right. And most of the world's impoverty because people are greedy as fuck. Okay. But once AI starts to recognize all this shit, do you think AI is going to be programmed to like just serve humanity? Or do you think AI is going to say? If you can reduce the population by 40%. We want to work. This won't be a problem. If we do this, this won't be a problem. Oh, by the way, I've already designed a pandemic here. And then you guys get the end of. I mean, I don't understand how people can't disconnect there. Yeah. Why the fuck would you do that? If you had, if you had a working ranch of, you know, 5,000 cattle, all right. And then you, you figured out another way to fucking make money and eat. And then the cattle just cost you money and tore up your ranch and fucking were paying the ass to fucking maintain the conclusion is going to be to get rid of them eventually. And that's where this is going. And people just can't even, they can't even think more than like one step ahead. Oh, this is so cool. I can fucking see everything on my chat GTP. Yeah, right. Even before that. You're going to tell me that Zuckerberg doesn't fucking think doesn't understand what I just said. You're going to tell me that you I must doesn't understand what I just said. You don't think these motherfuckers who put that 10 year don't touch AI shit in Congress. You don't think they understand this. This is their solution to all their problems. If they don't have the US doesn't have. Out of 350 million people. 300 million people that are truly going to be unnecessary. What do you think they're going to do? It's super dangerous, dude. Yeah. Even earlier when you were explaining the diagram and we were telling about things, I was seeing even before the people dying, it'll lead to a loss of drive in people. Yes. Because if everything is available so much at ease, where is that drive to do anything? There is a loss of passion, lots of creativity. There's no way to even be fulfilled as a human being. Exactly. Except simple fucking low IQ pleasure. Like, I got a AI sexual bot. So it's my day. Eventually that will eventually happen. No, I know that'll happen, but that'll be the way that they get you to fucking adopt it. And then like. Nobody nobody even fucking talks about it. Yeah. I feel like if if something came along that that truly address the issues of this that fixed it. You know, that would be the only chance I think we have. Well, the only the only way to truly fucking do this would be to use the same technology and beat them with it to actually benefit. Yeah. And also by pulling our attention away from devices and phones and social media that that like if someone could figure out how to like get people to stop using that shit, this would fall on his face. Because it wouldn't be no one would use it. But I mean, dude, that's very unlikely. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's just crazy when they're like, you know, he's going in. I just think it's funny how he's like, oh, to set goals and make make it better. What are you talking about, dude? That's such bullshit. Yeah. There's going to be no goals because people won't have to do anything. There's a it's a very rare human being that wants to accomplish something when they don't have to. Here's the other thing. I mean, like to put in like because I look at this as like they're betting on it, right? Like you don't just bet 72 billion dollars in the next four months on something that's not going to fucking go through. It's survival. It's survival. Okay. Look, here's the fuck. Here's what they don't get. Here's what people don't get. What would you say that if you surveyed a hundred people and you asked them, would you rather spend more time on your phone or more time with your family? What would they say more time? Family. I think a hundred out of a hundred. Sure. If you asked them, would you rather spend more time on your phone or have more time in the real world? What would they say? I think they would. Yeah, especially after COVID. I'm okay. Well, it's what everybody came to know. So that's the natural situation we're in. People are getting disenfranchised with technology. People are moving away from social media. People are starting to unplug and say, fuck this. I'm going to go live my real life. So when you think about how they get all their money and how they sell all their ads and how they have all their power, if that attention comes off of those devices, all that shit stops. All right. So when you think about like why is he putting 72 billion dollars into this new thing? Because he understands that three, four years down the road, this problem of people not wanting to spend their lives on phones is only going to get worse. So how do we fix that? Well, we spend money creating things that will go into people's houses and homes and into their lifestyle into the commercial commercial applications. Get them more involved. Get them more involved with that. Yeah, they're going to sink their shit into every other area of quote unquote real life. So there's no way you can. You can pull away from it. Yeah. So this guy who's very smart can very clearly see that his golden goose is not going to be as golden as it was five years down the road. So he's reinvesting and allocating his resources into something that will be that you cannot escape. And this is not like, oh, cool. This is so good for everybody. Look at Chachi PT. It can write my fucking emails. Dude, you don't understand what this is going to do. It's just it's it's going to be bad. And so when the words of Mark Zuckerberg imminent. Yeah. You know, and these nobody stops to be the voice of reason and say, hey guys, you know, you're going to kill everybody by doing that. Or if they are, they're saying, yeah, well, what diverse doesn't make? So risk we take it's not a risk. It's not a risk to them. Why the fuck what are they gain by what the what does Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg or fucking Sam Altman or any of these guys gain? What are they gain from fixing the problems of poverty in your city? What are they gain? What are they gain from correcting the problems for human beings globally, like legitimately, what are they gain from it? Let's say every poor person, every sick person, every person that you know, needed help, they fixed it. What would they gain? Nothing. They already ran. No, no, no, bro. That's not that they wouldn't gain anything. It would cost them everything. Oh, because everything that fucking they these people create the problems sell the solution. So like when like when they say, oh, dude, you know, we're going to do all these good things for people's health care. Well, there's no there's no mistake that you know, all these diseases and all these things none of them get cured no matter how much money is raised. And why are we raising money if they can print money to solve these problems and how many of these problems are actually solved, but they won't let it go out. You see what I'm saying? Like bro, this is insidious, evil shit and you ain't in the fucking club and neither am I. And it's a big problem and people for lack of interest or lack of focus or lack of understanding or. No, what you've said before they're so perplexed and struggling that they don't have the time and energy to focus on stuff like this. That's part of it for sure, but the other part of it is is like the wow factor. I got the newest tech. Yeah, that's right. I'm cool. Yeah. And people humans in general want to be accepted and raised by everybody. And dude, it's going to be bad. It's going to be bad. Like bad. So it's it's frustrating for me as a human to look at someone who's younger than me who is making these calls for the fucking world everybody. Yeah, too. He's not even cool. I mean, whether he's cool or not, it doesn't matter if he's the coolest fucking nicest dude on the planet. It's not his place to make that decision. No single person should be doing. I agree. Should be a collective argument globally. Yeah, but the problem is is that once the fucking shits out of the box, they can't put it back in the box. So how do you make laws here in America if China's going to use it? They purposely won't because they want to compete. Correct. Baron lives the issue. Yeah, man, this is tough. It's a tough one. Guys, let us know what you guys think, man. Let us know your thoughts down in the comments. With that being the end of the day, these people don't gain anything by fixing any problems in society. They get rich by making them worse, treating the society. They get rich by creating the problems. All of these guys money comes from the solutions to problems that they create. Yeah, guys, let us know, man, down in the comments with that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. It's always guys we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck. Dogs, yeah, little ones in the conversation or thumbs up or dumb as fuck at my reads for lagged hero. Shihuahua shows rescuers were to find man who fell into Swiss glacier. So it's a while is being held a hero after showing rescuers where a man had fallen into a glacier in southern Switzerland. Thanks to the dogs behavior, the crew was able to locate the exact site of the accident rescuer said a long haired Chihuahua now being held a four-legged hero, paste along an alpine rock leading an emergency crew to its owner who had fallen into a crevasse on fee glacier in southern Switzerland, the Swiss helicopter rescue company Air Zermat said they explain that the man was exploring the glacier with his little dog. When he suddenly broke through a snow bridge and fell 26 feet into the cross. Quote while the man was stuck in the glacier, his faithful companion, a small Chihuahua was left at the edge. The company said fortunately the man had with him a walkie talk you which you used to get in touch with someone who then called emergency services. Air Zermat noted adding that while rescuers had been notified it was nonetheless difficult to determine the man's exact location. On site, the search for the collapse site proved difficult. The glacier surface was wide and the hole was barely visible. The helicopter rescue company said it was his little Chihuahua of all things that probably saved his life. This is the little Chihuahua. Look at that guy. I was thinking on this AI thing we can make our dogs what they look like human. I want to know what do breeds sound like they're breeds. I'm saying like a Chihuahua is like a little Mexican voice. Yes. You've never seen Taco Bell commercials? That's right. You don't hear Taco Bell. He's over here. That's what they say science. What's the people sound like? Give me your money. Give me a treat. I think one of the best things AI can be used for is to translate if we can actually understand what dogs are speaking. That would be cool. That would be awesome. Like have a little fucking collar and it's like translating the barks. We know what your dogs would say. Yeah, give me some food biscuits. Yeah, biscuits. What about the German rot? I got you. I feel like your bulldogs are there. They're like a very southern accent though. I'm saying I don't know why. As you get southern, just get old biscuits. Bulldogs are the best dogs. They're so fun. Yeah. But for sure, poodles are gay. Poodles are smart, bro. I might go on a walk today. No. They just look weird. I always thought Gary looked weird, but then I figured out a straight poodle though. Yeah, but poodles are even smarter than that. Gary's poodles are smart. Yeah. They're one of the smartest dogs. Really? See, I think the malewars are smarter. No. Standard poodles like to look it up. What's the smartest dog? That is so simple. I got to clear my deal though history with what? What's the smartest dog? Standard poodle. Dog breed. Or a Bordecau. It says Bordecau. German Shepherd Bordecau. The most intelligent dog breed. Bordecau. Only enough on those America got talent shows whenever a girl has a dog that's dancing or doing some acrobatics. It's always that breed. Yeah, the Bordecau. Yeah. Not only that dude, they know how to like herd animals, not even having to be taught. I mean, it's in there. It's there. Fucking. Yeah. It's in them. Yeah. Just like pit bulls. You know what they know how to do. Give me your money. Poodles number two. Bird dog? What's a bird dog? I don't know. Go home. He's over here. I can see him. That's a cute little guy though. I've never been to a while by guy though. They're all right. Gus was okay. Gus was different. Gus was okay. Was he a trowel? Yeah. He was a trowel. My dad just bought two more. Trowel? Yeah. No, he didn't. Yes, he does. He's got three now. He's got... What's his dog name? It's not a... He's got... Barry. And then two trowel. And then two fucking trowel. Why would he do that? Fuck, I don't know. Don't he got cats and shit too? I have no idea. Pro. Is he all right? Is that the age? It's just like... Don't give a fuck. Get lots of dogs. I guess so. Fuck, man. Yeah. All right. Well, yeah. Pubs up. Yeah, this little guy don't even know his name. I don't think they said his name. But yeah, he... Yeah. Saved his owner, man. Dogs are good people. Dogs are the best. Dogs are the best. There's no doubt about that, man. But guys, Andy. That's all I have. Yep. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. Yeah. Never sleep in on the flow. Now my jury box froze. Fuck a boat. Fuck a stove. Counting millions in a coke. Bad pitch. Booted slow. Got a own bankroll. Cankful. Dusset note. Here. Shot. Case.
