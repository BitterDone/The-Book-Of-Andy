What is up guys it's Andy for Sella and this is the show for the realist show before he's been instrumental in changing hundreds of thousands millions of lives with the example that he sets he's otherwise known as the iron cowboy he's done some incredible feats in life he's a tremendous human being some of the things you might know him for is he did 50 Ironmans and 50 states and 50 consecutive days he also ran 101 full-length Ironman races in 101 consecutive days I mean he's raising amazing families amazing dude I mean what else what if what else have you done man we're going to cure some stuff like water yeah I mean oh yeah we got another guy over here we happen to have my brother sell you guys you guys ask for Sal fuck man it's every day yeah every day they say the biggest DM I get they said replace DJ with Sal I know this is going to be Christmas and I get to do Andy sale Andy J all the one goes like this is a person listen listen you could cut that audio clip and turn turn some weird stuff James in the day and I yeah there we go they said I need somebody make fun of DJ so here we go oh man yeah it works yeah I still got his Christmas lights up too easy for target so so what's been going on man what do you what you got going on yeah man life's been interesting since the the hundred and just pushed in a million directions been doing speaking really happy and thrilled to announce that I'm I'm back to racing back to competitive back to feeling myself yeah doing some world championships later this year in fact in a couple weeks I'm headed to South Africa correct Cape Town that's called Cape Epic and it's the largest mountain bike stage race in the world and team race eight days long how many you done this one before I did it in 2000 yeah yeah yeah it's what I thought yeah and I was kind of new to mountain biking yeah and so I'm super pumped to go back same partner guy that we coach in South Africa in Mario and and we're gonna we're gonna attack it this year yeah it's gonna be a lot of fun you fly your bike over I'm assuming yeah for sure yeah you know you don't want to tackle an all-mountain wicked terrain on a rental that's something you want to go on your steed something you're really familiar with something you've done a lot of training on how do you train for that well it's super tough in the winter of Utah you know because we we got to do a lot of it inside but we train a lot with power and so you know you just try to get your numbers way up and get as powerful as you can do you see that video I think it's like power power generation yeah watts that you're producing so just like on the just like on the core bike or a peloton or anything else on yeah so so we have we have power meters on our bikes and it tells us exactly how much power generating to the to the drivetrain and but yeah you send me that video last night so true cyclist go power per kilo that's that's like the that's the dick measuring contest yeah pounds per kilogram it's just like cars power to weight pretty much yeah yeah it's right because the video he sent me was Lance Armstrong and it was back in his heyday and the interviewer said how many what what what what's called an FTP functional threshold power and what was the what was your 30 minute power during this time frame and this number will make sense to some people not to most but it was five hundred watts for 30 minutes and at what he waited the time that is insane the average general guy walking around you couldn't do it for 10 seconds no I mean if I get this is five minutes straight 30 30 the way 30 minutes straight 500 watts output and I'm gonna that's a professional cyclor that's Lance Armstrong okay it's heyday it's insane like that that number like when you go so I was just messing around in a peloton just trying to hit it just to see what trying to hold 500 would be to James point if you can hold it for 40 50 60 seconds like you got a pretty good like you're getting in it especially if you're in the saddle like sitting down mm-hmm that little guy to be able to put that down for 30 minutes it's like it's unbelievable actually like it's a number that it's unwirled yeah and so you think about these guys like these little guys that are running the tour de France like their machines they're not and what people don't realize is the bigger you are the more watch you can push yeah so like you could probably get on a bike and push some heavy numbers for a short period of time right but those guys are 140 pounds yeah 35 pounds pushing that such your pounds per kilogram formula that you're talking about once you get above like four point something like you're in another class and he was running seven right oh I know that's stupid for a three audience he was not even on it on the chart of where I think it shows you though the feats that you know these elite athletes that have to train you know they're not professional sports and you know baseball football you know hockey the things we watch on TV but when you really start finding down like looking at the humans the ability and the level that these guys can get to and that they train for and the amount of power that they can generate based off of training it's insanity it really is something special to watch yeah they're on a whole nother what what when you like I mean James you you know as much about mental toughness is anybody on the planet in my opinion you know like you've done some of the most incredible human feats that have been done by a human being ever you know when we talk about when an average person thinks about doing one of these events like like they're gonna go run a marathon or they're gonna go from zero to doing something that they're gonna prove to themselves what do you think the first thing is that these people have to get get in their mind to get right to go on that journey yeah I think the biggest mistake people do is they try to go from zero to an Iron Man or zero to a marathon and yeah most people can do it in a survival state but the biggest thing they had to do is they got to start small and build those foundational blocks and get that experience and you know it's interesting because people see my headline and they're like oh man I can't do what that guy did you see the 50 you see the hundred or whatever it is we ran across Greece we've backed across the country whatever then realize my journey started with a four mile fun run that I struggled through and then my wife called Panipathetic and signed me up for a marathon and said figure it out and I was like dude running stupid like I don't understand what's that sunny thanks sunny yeah thank you well and now every time something she's like man why are we still doing this stuff and I'm like hey it's your fault yeah I started this whole thing but and then we found triathlon we started getting together but it was those foundational blocks and I did I did really fast intense racing short distance before I ever started to lengthen it out and if you look at every single world champion today both in the half-iron man of full-iron man distance they started with foundational short distance power explosive and speed and then started to lengthen out and so really for anybody that's getting going and wants to tackle something big like let's start working on the fundamentals and the foundation so like any sport or any business like you got to really bring it back to the basics to start yeah and that's I mean I think that's a commonality across life in general I mean at here at HQ or first form you know one of the one of the biggest things is you know setting people up for success in their in their fitness journey you know I want to lose a hundred pounds it's a great goal but you know they have to learn the foundations 21 days 28 days of building these small habits that they can stack on top of each other in order to get there and you know and I always tell people like hey you didn't put on a hundred pounds in 30 days you're gonna lose a hundred pounds in 30 days and so you have to put one foot in front of the other and start stacking these wins and stacking these behavior changes these habits to create the change that you want to see and then you got a cross time you got to give yourself some time in that saddle if you will to be able to get to where you want to go on the concept that people really need to like figure out or imprinting themselves as invisible progress yeah because there's a lot of stuff that's happening behind as you're showing up as you're doing the work and then all of a sudden one day you get that tipping point to where like all that progress like loads on and then you go okay that's why I was showing up and yeah this parallel life or business or anything you know there's a lot of times you go through times in your business where you're working real hard you don't think that things are happening and and then all the sudden things start going real fast and it's not that they weren't happening you just couldn't see them happening well it's like your story nobody saw that that foundational work and then boom oh first form came out of nowhere yeah no it did not like and people like me oh you got you did a hundred iron man's well that started with a pathetic four mile fund right it's just that that that work that nobody that invisible progress that nobody's seen what is the time frame from run one to hundred and a hundred and one iron man's so 2004 to 2000 20 21 17 years wild yeah so 17 years of foundational sacrifice to get to that moment and one of the biggest concepts I talked about is you can't go from zero to 100 you can't go from zero to where where this company's at now like there's so many steps in between but I think that's the that's the part that a lot of people back down from right because when you look at when they compare themselves in business if you have somebody who's 17 years in business in front of you and you're comparing your journey your startup to their 17 years or like what everybody does it is and it's deflating as hell you're like well look they got this or they got that or you know how can we can't do that it's like because I got 17 years in front of you you know and and you know we think about that in the finished journey life all the time is you the comparison is a thief of joy and so when you're constantly comparing your journey to somebody else's or you know your business to somebody else's or you know whatever whatever it may be you know you have to realize that it takes time it's investment it's time in the saddle it's time under tension and and realizing you have to learn and adapt and make the changes to get to where that person is and that's the journey right that's what most people don't like because the work's uncomfortable and it's not fun all the time. You're comparing yourself to their end result compare yourself to their inputs no shit to their actions yeah compare your work to your work right yeah like you're doing the end result that's gonna get you every time. How many like I'm curious to what both Sal and James what you guys think on this but like you know you said the comparison is a thief of joy in your opinion because I have my own opinion when do you think it's right to compare? I mean I think in general it's okay to be consciously aware but when you're looking at you know your journey everybody has a different starting place right so to look at the measurement of success I think you have to understand where is baseline where is zero and where have you made the progress to and if you started at let's say zero and somebody else started at 50 and our goals to get to 100 but you made it to 70 or you know I made it 75 and you made it to 100 I made 75 basis point move you made 50 so who's better the guy that got to 100 or the guy that got 75 and so when I think about it it's like you know we all compare ourselves specifically now in social it's like oh everybody else has this and this is what happens everybody robs each other of their own joy it's like how far have you come you know how much weight have you lost how many how many races have you done yeah you might not done 101 Ironmans but you did one you know I mean most of your goals 300 pounds yeah or most people do zero you know I stopped people immediately when they come up to me like oh I didn't do I didn't do it you did but I I did a 70 point three and I'm like dude don't say that just awesome I did a 70 point three and pound your chest and shake my hand and I'm gonna tell you that was amazing and it's interesting that you're wrong with that too that is that is yeah I just want to see people win yeah we're in this day of social media where everyone's the coach and everybody's the expert and every is the mentor and it's literally paralyzing society from starting because of fear of this judgment yeah we don't want to look stupid starting like we're beginning right yeah it takes maturity and humility to not compare yourself be okay where you're at in fact I had this really cool experience where I got to fly in an F-16 jet no shit yeah it was incredible and you know we hit that's bad ass dude I will send you the video it is so freaking cool we hit we hit seven G's on takeoff who we went from zero to 20,000 feet in 15 seconds and on takeoff the video is hilarious because I'm like you can't see my face but I'm like eyeballs are massive I'm freaking out I'm milliseconds away from blocking out and the pilots like having a Sunday dinner conversation with a tower James you with me yeah no for sure like I'm just like freaking out the suit is it's plugged into the jet it's compressing it's sending all the blood to my brain and we we finally level out and we're upside down and we flip over and I just thought to myself man I am so glad it's not this dude's first day on the job surrounded himself with this amazing team and then later I thought about it I'm like dude every journey has a humble beginning yeah and he didn't like he spent thousands of hours in the simulator and all this and then working with his the tower and the team and the guys on the ground and all that and I'm like I wish people had more courage to just like start and be humble and be okay with like sucking when you first start something because you're gonna be terrible in fact I any my stage presentation I put up the salarious picture of me in the pool I'm I'm it's my first triathlon I'm gripping to the side of the edge of the pool I'm gasping for air I'm wearing a nose plug I'm about to get out of the water to jump on a borrowed bike and I'm like I'm so grateful I had the courage to start because nobody looks at that person in that moment and says that's the guy yeah because I wasn't the guy yet but I was okay now they were laughing they were laughing they were laughing they were like they're gonna do the nose plug on right but I was so glad that I had that a little bit of humility in me to like to be made fun of in that moment because it completely changed my life like that was the starting point of like a trajectory that I would have never predicted bro isn't that the starting point of anything great though right but but so it is paralyzing people yeah taking that step it's definitely a fear of judgment and it's so sad to watch this new generation be like frozen in their footsteps because they're they're missing out on the whole point of life which which which is the experiences in the journey and the growth that you that you have through that and so for me like I've got five kids and I'm I'm so grateful that we gave them a front row seat to like embarrassment humiliation and growth because I have five unbelievable children now that are like fearless mentally tough and I I stack them up and I'm not being a a braggadocious dad but like my kids are better than yours and I like do a straight up comparison against their peers and I'm like okay I'm not worried about my kids anymore did you use it I know you want to talk to me you want to talk to me I get over there you know I'm saying you're a little bit west of that ass no but my I mean that's a great way to look in this while for me this is you know I'm so fortunate that I was able to play baseball and you know the reason being is because like when you look at the sport of baseball you have to fail seven out of ten times to be the the great like the guys who hit 300 they go to the Hall of Fame and so you become so comfortable with failure like I'm so used to walking up into a stadium it's got 10 15 20,000 people and you know if you're at home there's cheering for you if you're on the way they're yelling at you and screaming at you and you fail and if you know if there wasn't a progression of the fail like when you're a little league you strike out you could come to with and you get high school you strike out you come to get the college like I was this kind of normal you know and then you start working your way through it you're like well this is how life is yeah if you went up there on day one dude and struck out in everybody's cheering you be like what the fuck is that's what happens in social right yeah yeah yeah five thousand of their friends are looking at them they failed well they're mortified and me I'm sitting there thinking like oh yeah so no any different yeah I think I think social media or this generation has normalized or tries to normalize perfection and to me I will cheer I will shout it from the rooftops that like the greatest gift is failure yeah but you don't win through success you don't learn through I mean you went through success you don't learn through success we know what you meant you learn through those missteps those those stumbling blocks those like okay I I'm gonna intentionally take this opportunity to learn grow and become better I mean how many missteps did you guys take the building this and fucking all of them all of them yeah every every single every single every single spot that says don't step on that we fucking stepped on it yeah and probably sometimes three times that dang it that's what that's what that's what this generation needs to learn and understand is like it's okay to fail and just build up that thick skin and just not care what anybody thinks about those missteps because that's that's that's the that's the gift yeah and I though I think the word that you use there is grow you know like what does it take to grow and failures part of that process you know because you learn if you're if you're failing correctly right and you continue to put yourself in a position you know to your point it's not about perfection it's about progress like how do we learn from some of the mistaken how do we get better how do we next time how do we get a little bit better you're not gonna go you know from progress to perfection either it's as you continue to get a little better than the bar of perfection gets a little higher you know you start perfecting the skill and so you know one of the things I try to instill in my children is the confidence to be able to go like when they're you know whether it's at gymnastics or it's baseball or it's whatever it's like hey go like go lay it on the line go just go like you're gonna go out there and learn like you're gonna be all right dude I'll be on the phone with him he'll be at baseball obviously we're talking about work and if I get all I hear was you better run that out you better run run I'm a believer like you're gonna work hard like kids today will not be lazy you know my kids are gonna be they're touched align type kids and I promise you that's gonna happen and you know it's fucking awesome yeah I love it and I treat everybody's kids the same I just Joe bid I was like yeah for real though like you know I tell you you know we had we have a great group of parents that that ends up plays baseball with and then we make them play soccer and they do you just I've learned that it's what you expose your kids to is extremely important you know you go system yeah just the entire because who are they interacting with and what type of qualities to have and that's why it's you know very important like the schools and kids schools in today's environment like what are you leaning your kid into because this these formative years these are where you teach them those principles about you know touching a line and running hard and you know finishing what you started and making sure you're good teammate like these things are all learned now and so I draw the line hard man and I don't give you know it's like I am here I'm like this is what it is you know make them have fun right well I was I mean is that what the world needs right yeah we're saying same thing yeah I wish my parents did that like played it a more active role in their kids' life because those kids are products of their environment a man their sponges and as parents you may not think your kids are watching you and like they are watching every single move move and I and I just like I have a problem with the parents that are like do as they say not as I do yeah that is never gonna work that is never gonna work like the greatest gift I could give to my kids was was both sunny and I like being open when we hit rock bottom and lost everything being open when they knocked on our door and took away our home being open when I had to stay up all night long and change the wood on the the fireplace because we couldn't turn the heat on like we got they got to experience that out with us and then they got to see us show up every single day not an overcoming and overcome yeah and that front row seat for my kids has done like the biggest thing in molding who they are today and I've got some damn resilient children like it's bro you got an amazing family yeah they've all been here yeah oh yeah 100% done good buddy yeah man yeah they're proud I tell you right now the proudest moment of my life like despite everything and I've done the finish lines I've crossed and that mountains I've climbed like that moment when your daughter walks up to you on wedding day and just says thank you Danny you know just like waterfalls I can't wait for you to have those experiences with your kids I'm sure your dogs will get married to one shit yeah I was I think we should stay on this for a second though because one of the things that I don't have the perspective on that we talk a lot about is the next generation of kids and I'm sitting in front of three fathers who are all concerned about what is going on in the world and what's happening in society what's it what's it make you guys feel like when you see what's happening in society and then you think about Enzo when he's 30 and you think about you know what's gonna be in the world and how things are gonna look I mean what what do you guys think about that yeah it's it's super scary until you know he's got some unknowns coming up because he's still in that really that phase where they're super young and it's like okay hope I'm doing enough and I hope they're they're they're sinking in and they're getting it and I kind of that phase in my life now my kids are 15 to 21 whether egg you know they're leaving the house are going into the real world and my wife and I just kind of have that moment we were sitting on the couch were like we did a good job man yeah and we got our like we did we sacrificed a ton we were very active in the process and now we're to the point where we're comparing our kids to their peers and other family members that have kids because early in the process we were like man Sunnie's got Sun comes from six sisters and we're like man this they got very different approaches to this and I kept saying to Sunnie I was like Sunnie's my wife I kept saying it's gonna be interesting to see how all these kids like this is like 40 grand because like how they all turn out and man it is very apparent today so yeah so what you're saying is don't compare in the beginning but once you laid it out out there we can measure up the giver of joy that's right that's right that's when it's right to compare it yeah that's right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right dude I'm scared shit I'll be honest like I don't for me is weird man I because you know I don't have I didn't have the best examples of like you know parenthood or fatherhood or like what exactly should I be instilling right and thank God I do have a few good examples now right but like I'm still scared of shit cuz you're saying I'm a dad yeah yeah no but it's like I mean because you don't really know like I'm you're just praying that you're making the best decision in that moment and you're praying that a fucking works out you know and it's like you know I've always looked at things you know in the aspect of like okay I don't know what to do I know what not to do and let's just do that like let's just not do this and we'll be all right you know and I've always had that approach but it's like man like when I think like fuck what what's what's what's going on doing 30 years but I was like man I just pray I'm giving her everything I got right now and that's why we got to win the revolution but I can die our hair and you know 20 years and fuck some shit up you know I'm saying like that's all I can fucking hope for man yeah I don't know that's that's the hard part too is like when you're parent like you're new to you're new to do you know you don't know it and a lot of things that we learned it's like every generation is like okay I don't want to do what my parents did with me and sometimes it's for the good and sometimes it's for the bad so it's like where's that line of what I'm gonna do what I'm not gonna do because you were just like I know what I don't want right but now how do I figure out what I do want and then we're all just like it's just big to be experiment I think it's like that story you hear her that story about the alcohol the alcoholic parent that had the man that had two sons okay and one son never drank a drop of alcohol and when they ask him why he never drank a drop of alcohol he said because I've watched my dad the other son became a drunk and they said why did you become a drunk he said because I watched my dad so at some point we have a choice to take our circumstances and make the the better result out of them whether you had a good parent and say hey my parents were good I want to model that or hey you know I didn't have shit but I'm gonna make sure that doesn't happen here right I mean that's the scary thing too man it's like you can do everything you you possibly want you can put your kids in the best school you can you know surround them with all the right things and there is still a chance that they will be a fuck up yeah I get still a big chance yeah so it's just that risk and you like I mean dude you know I pray my I just I pray every single day man that that you know my my little one is just I don't think there is a chance bro I think I think you do I think you like James you know you got the oldest kids here I mean yeah there's a chance but like really like you put your hands on you're you're working every day you're setting the example you're setting the standards of the chances are much higher that yeah for sure for sure for sure yeah more five for five baby yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah still a couple years left in there yeah dude I just think it's an important I just think it's an important thing to think about because you know right now there's a lot of people who are you know I don't know we're gonna either see the continue downfall of culture and society or we're going to see it come back real hard and it seems like parents are understanding that there is like a failed generation in between you know I think we're I think we're going to fight the fuck up yeah somebody's yeah we're we're in that phase right now where we're like oh this needs to course correct immediately we're going to be in a really bad spot yeah I mean I do you guys see that with like other parents and stuff of course of course as it's like moved you know I mean so like in my brain like you know I don't want to say I'm not worried at all because that's pretentious and just not true but I like anything else in life and this is how I think you're doing all you can not only I'm doing all I can I it's not that I haven't failed it much it's that I understand when I put my best foot forward we usually win right or at least succeed and in that case like there's no negotiation I don't negotiate with my kids but meaning I'm doing the best and everything that I physically possibly can to push that cart in the right direction and under those pretense I say okay I'm gonna raise the best children and I can how do I do that well I understand it starts with the example that we set and the rules that we tolerate and and the example that we're putting forth every day in the community in which we raise them and so all those decisions I try to make sure that I don't even I don't even compromise even the baseball team like it's not a compromise it's not a activity for them it's a purposeful decision I'm like there no he's playing there and I think I'm under at least my experience when you control the variables that you can control and you put your best foot forward the odds are you can do well doesn't mean that it's gonna happen every time but the odds are you can do well and I understand to DJ's point like there still can't be these outliers you know that happen and and I'm trying to minimize those to every degree but I think from a society standpoint I think there's extremely positive to it competition's gonna be lower yeah that's right opportunity for success can be much higher you know well and to teach him how to work hard he was mentioning he's terrified and I'm to that point now where my kids are going into the re world and I'm doing a direct comparison to what's out there and I'm like oh my kids are fine yeah they're fine I'm looking at the competition and my kids are gonna handle the kids are bringing their parents to the job interview yeah exactly man did you guys hear that stuff I saw that one out of one out of four or one out of five Gen Z first jobbers is taking their parents to their job interview that's so great that's insane dude maybe it's smart though right like maybe we should start doing that because we get to see the the example set we're like all right we got mom and dad and we got the kid here mom's got to pack a marbles in her sleep yeah dang omega you know right staying a lobby all right you you know so like maybe there's an advantage there this is what was shocking to me is my my daughter was a supervisor at a local pool for the lifeguards and and she came home one day just frustrated because these kids weren't showing up for their shifts and I was like oh that's too bad they lost their jobs and she's like no we have a no-call no show three times before you get fired and I was just like how how did that become the norm standard the standard that you're allowed to know like you I remember back I remember back in the day you think about not showing up and your boss is like no sorry I I know your intention and you're fired oh yeah and now it's like you're a no-call no show three times before you lose your job I was just like I do not understand what's happening well that comes from people not wanting to do their jobs themselves and not wanting to go through the hassle of trying to find another employee because they're all trash that's what that's they dealt with well that was that's the problem that's why they are having that lenience because there's nobody stepping up that's right that spot and then they fail as a business because there's nobody to do it bro peaches why it's so remarkable but you guys I mean you know don't down dude people think people think people think there's like an employee tree you have to like there's a whole lot that goes into that man it's not like you just go out and pick these people you got to work with them yeah just like just like we got to assume they don't know anything right we got to teach him we got to show him we got to work with him we got a second example you know these are these are things that other business owners just don't do they want to plug and play and unfortunately plug and play is not working right now because the talent pool isn't really yeah that's what I talked to this group about yesterday the day before it you know you know there there are no bad employees only bad leaders right when and when you think of it that way the responsibilities on the leadership and yeah it might be difficult to train those employees to get them to the stand that you want to but that doesn't mean that it's impossible and you know when you start taking on that challenge in a similar manner and saying okay well if I know that the difference between winning and losing is our ability to be able to cultivate these youth into becoming career driven professionals that becomes the game it's not selling supplements it becomes how do we cultivate culture how to develop people yeah through development of yeah you know making professionals because if everybody else is struggling to do that and we win at that that means it will have a better culture and a better team you know and it doesn't mean that we're absolved from it and forever and you know we have them flow too right good times bad times but when you start looking and just kind of refocusing the game and say well wait a minute maybe the game's down here and the easy thing to do is to point the finger and say well it's the workforce because the hard thing to do is go look at the mirror and say well it's us yeah yeah maybe it's us you know what I mean yeah we've had to have that conversation you know sit everybody down and say hey guys you ever think maybe it's us like we're failing what do you think about that you know the term that I heard that like really hit me was like we're in a talent crisis right and and to me that means we're in a leadership crisis dude it's right because that means the leadership is failing because like they don't know what they don't know and they're just products of their environment and so we've got a talent crisis I think well no we've we've got a leadership crisis and that will fix the problem again it's from the top down which is what we see here well people want to belong people want to win people want to know that their life matters people want to know all these things right you have to put them in a position to do them that's your job yeah and I think that's where I mean even we struggle with it because it's not like you can't just set the place and hope that it scales itself right and I think that's where a lot of people struggle well I have you know one store that does well so I should open the second store and it's just gonna automatically do well no you know what I mean like you have to go back into the process and you have to you have to constantly be in that you know if the process is one through ten you have to constantly be in the one two three phase constantly you know one two three one two three one two three teaching and showing and setting the example for what success looks like because you know that piece of of the journey is for us is the win you know mastering the one two three I tell you what I'd like to be one of these 20-year-olds right now yeah I would love to be one of these 20-year-olds man because they're you you would if you are a driven hungry motivated there's no competition discipline individual at 20 years old right now you are going to kill everybody else that's what I'm so excited about my kids or I'm going to have the rear world because I'm like yeah pick your spot yeah what do you want to do because you're you're so resilient and you you've learned and had a front row seat like go be the top at any game you want to go be at the top and and you'll do it because of the principles that they have and frankly the competition is just like well she want to move to St. Louis I mean I was just a new top so I can see why maybe she doesn't want to but yeah you know St. Louis is super pretty we're always hiring yeah it's not park city I can tell you that yeah man I don't park here you know in parks it is it do not park you do not park you will not have your car city it is what it is we've got to have a little street smarts who live in St. Louis that's right yeah competitive advantage on the streets that's right yeah so I got a confession gotta have it when you came and asked us for money and you said you were going to do 101 101 Iron Man triathlons and we got to be real honest here because Iron Man banned you from using Iron Man which is totally unique which is totally honky like that was like boo on Iron Man but do you say honky this is a honky honky I was raised or I got excited I did that's your favorite word don't get it DJ's eyes lit up dude I thought to myself there's no way this dude's gonna do it there's no way this guy's gonna do it and I remember sitting you sitting in my office looking at and it's not that I didn't support you I thought to myself and my man this dude like that's literally impossible having watched the documentary having known you haven't done all things and we were putting up a lot of money to do it right and I'm sitting here looking at him I'm like so we came up a deal hey I'll pay you half foot front and half when you finish it was I'll tell you this I I laughed chuckled a little bit on the inside when I went to get the second half of the the check and you're like I didn't think we're going to have to write that check yeah yeah no but I mean it's when I say this it's as honorable as a confession I could ever make because you know we went out and and you know I only ran the marathon with you for the hundred and I remember do you remember seeing me you probably blacked out at that point in time now I remember you being other yeah I remember seeing you and and it was like such an overwhelming sense of pride to why you were broken I mean you were damn near delirious I mean I'm looking at this guy I'm thinking this guy is you want to talk about putting it together like he pounded your chest and you're looking at me and you're got a big hug you're moving you know and and and when you cross that finish line it's one of the coolest moments that I've had in my life and I didn't do I mean I didn't do anything I was just experiencing it watching it and it cost us a few hundred grand you know it was not like like oh here we are it's like we write the check and the guys are winning you got to pay it but it was like one of those things it was such a cool moment but I have to say like you know sitting in that and I don't want you to be confused it was doubt I was more looking at you like man it's dudes nuts right I'll make a confession too I knew you're gonna do it yeah I fucking knew it I knew you're gonna do I wouldn't have committed a hundred grand or whatever it was a couple hundred grand whatever fucking I don't remember what it was I would I thought I'm like bro this guy can do 50 fucking iron man's in 50 states in 50 days there's fucking nothing this guy can do I still believe that that's true well and for me it was a kind of a surreal moment because I had I had a couple big goals in that project one make it past 50 reset your own history prove everybody wrong make it to 75 because I was like dude I want to prove to everybody that like do 75 hard but do with an iron man yeah and then I was like I don't get to see Sal and the crew until day 100 and so when you showed up on day 100 and I'm like this is the day I made it because Sal's right here and Sal's not showing up on any other day but day 100 that was our whole thing can text me come it's not come on 100 and I was like damn Sal's here and I'm here and that's why I was like kind of like I said you're a big hug and I'm like holy shit we made it it was cool man because that you kept text me you're gonna come no I will be the 100 there's like you know my brain is like 100 I 100 or die that's where I'm at you know and there he was man running on that trail behind your house overlooking by the way the trail is beautiful yeah you go out on it still every day do you really yeah I figured you'd never want to see it again you know I that that that comment has been made a lot but for me I choose to look at the the really great moments and the memories that had there and and I even look at the suffering as that was part of the journey that that molded the memories that I have and the struggle that existed there and and turned me into who I am and so I I have a lot of pride on that trail yeah because it was blood sweat and tears and it brought people from around the world together and in fact when I got into trouble early like day five starting to get stress stress fractures like can't walk waiting for the step my legs gonna break and it was just incredibly almost embarrassing or humiliating for me to have to like slow down and walk because part of my thing was like I'm gonna do 100 and I'm I'm gonna show a level of athleticism that's never been seen it was a little bit arrogant yeah and then when I got to have it yeah you have to walk into something like that with a little bit of swagger because if you if you don't you're done anyways and so when I had to slow down and and was starting to get criticism for walking and my I mean my my legs were really literally gonna break and then we started to hear people say I'm so grateful that you're hurt and going slow because I wouldn't have been able to join you otherwise and and we had a lot of life changing moments out there where people got to participate with us because we were throttled back and and it became like my my pain and my suffering became this greatest gift for people to come and have this experience with us and do we we raised over a million dollars for sex trafficking for you know and and that wouldn't have happened had it just been like this athletic showcase of whatever but it was like the humility and slowing down and then the community coming in and just be getting to be part of something so big together and and obviously it doesn't happen without you guys and your generosity now now now we now you shot our documentary on this full documentary yes and we tell us about that I'm super pumped about it it actually drops on March 21st we're doing a private showing at the Sundance ski resort in Utah and then it's going to hit all the streaming platforms and I I gave the the producer we we turned over thousands of hours of footage it was an incredible editing job and I said look you've got you've got four jobs you got you got to leave people with a sense of family because we're family first this has got to be about community and everybody coming together for one cause people have to get the sense of hope dealing with the things that they're dealing with and you can't make me look like an idiot they nailed the first three hey batten 750 exactly that's right there but I think what you said is is extremely important and not to take away from the documentary momentum but that perspective that you have about being grateful for the opportunity is extremely important you know because a lot of times you know there's a choice standard point on the the the child who goes one way versus the other it's how we see things and how we look back on them and how we see the perspective of life like where there's good there's bad and where there's bad there's good but you got it's you find what you're looking for and that piece you know to somebody who's seeing you go through the struggle yeah it might not be you're going to do a hundred you know Ironman's but that struggle that you're going through is the same struggle of somebody starting day one of you know lose in 10 pounds right the the struggle the mental struggle the physical struggle like where do I start what do I do and that perspective that you have to be able to you know extract from that that that incredible feat that you went on is just simply showing up and competing every day you know like hey if I show up one more day what happens if I stand on my if I stand you know committed to myself for one more day what am I capable of and that's a piece about success in life whether it's physical whether it's finance whether it's personal it's like you know stacking those wins and showing up to compete day after day after day after day is how you make that's how you make life that's how you make the big the big movements make and yes the question about comparison and I hate it when people compare you know they're joining to mine or I couldn't do that or I'm I just did this and and I'm I'm huge on on people just recognizing that like everybody's heart is different and you just have to be okay with meeting yourself where you're at and and and just getting that momentum going and and just being okay with your at I'm gonna stop comparing yourself against other people because truly we have no idea and you talk about perspective I love this topic but we have no idea what somebody's background was and where they came from and how they got to where they're gotten and what were the experiences they had that shaped that perspective and and what gave them their belief system and so man I just try to have so much compassion for people that are either struggling or have lost their way and just trying to get them back on the path of like just just meet yourself way you're at and get back on track and going and start creating you know the powerless or small wins or every single day that is such a big big impact we gotta start man we're in that position I saw a video last night that really like touched me um it was a video a guy on Instagram sent me of a woman in his he has a Facebook group where he trains people and I guess she you know I mean she was she was overweight but she made like a four minute video where she was talking about like how powerless she felt how how hopeless she felt and that she was posting the video because she actually had committed to doing 75 hard and wanted people to know that she had committed um and was basically talking about you know how she knows she's gonna really struggle through the events that she has to go to and she can't enjoy herself and just hearing that like it's bit I would actually comment into the to the guy I said bro you know it's good to see these videos because one it creates perspective for the people who have been living uh a disciplined lifestyle for so long that they have forgotten what it's like to feel that level of powerlessness and hopelessness and um I think it's always good to really remember what it's like to be in that position because dude like when you're in that position you don't even have control over what you put in your mouth or what you don't put in your mouth you know what I mean physical objects like food or alcohol or anything have complete control over you addiction is scary dude and it's it's it's it's it's something that we really everybody like everybody out there because we have a very uh I would say you know go get our audience right everybody here is ambitious everybody here wants to win everybody here wants to create but I think it's very important for everybody to remember that like once you get it together it's your job to also pull other people along with you and help them understand you know that they do have hope and they do have the capacity for change and it's really not that hard you just feel like it's that hard because you haven't been able to overcome it in so long and so um you know perspective for us you know guys who have done things in their life or people who have done things I think is super important man because a lot of people you know what's common sense to maybe you at this point in your life or me at this point in my life or you may not be common sense for the average person that has never been able to say no to french fries or as silly as that sounds I was that person I know what that's like dude I know what it's like to say hey I am going on a diet I am gonna I am fixing this shit this is the last day I'm done with it and then like two days later be like I can't take it anymore you know like I know what that's like and um I think one of the most important perspective switches for me when I was in that position was to think of it as a mental test and not a not such a physical test you know get your brain wrapped around hey that if other people can do this I can do this you know what I mean I think that's where comparison is good yeah yeah that's what I'm that's what I'm that's what I'm getting to so when we talk about comparison and we talk about not comparing yourself there are times where it is really good and you know for example like if you are a high level competitor it is necessary for you to compare yourself against other high level competitors uh to keep sharp and to progress but when you're just getting started the way that you use comparison to your advantage is by remembering that like all these people that have done all these things that you admire created these companies done these amazing ridiculous human history making difficult physical challenges like you have these things people did these like people like human beings just like you they you cut them open they bleed red man you know they're not different than you and the only thing that makes them different is that they were willing to your point to be humble enough in the beginning to say hey look I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna suck at it in the beginning but I'm gonna keep going I'm gonna keep showing up and um I think if we I think if we as a culture would recognize that like we need to really do a good job you know we talk a lot about American society on on this podcast but it is our obligation that once we get ourselves out of that difficult spot for us to pull other people and show them that they can as well and I think that's um I think that's something that that we need to like really really really remember you know what I mean it's not just about us it's about them too yeah and when you're at that point and I think just a quick change in perspective is is not comparing but shifting it to modeling and you find someone who models it just like the the format mile for impossible to do until they did it until he does it and two weeks later another guy does it now high school people get now high school kids do it every single year and so it's impossible to somebody does it so I think we need to stop comparing and we need to like leadership like you talked about uh so and then modeling finding someone that's done it and go okay I'm at the beginning of my journey I'm not going to compare myself to them I'm going to model myself after them and then start to create those small wins yeah and that creates that momentum and that's to me that's just a different feeling of comparison versus modeling and now that's going to that create that momentum well and I think that that piece you know like when you look at you know finding great role models you know in society like finding people you look up to it and mine and have a humility to be able to reach out to him is hey man I guess I'm help like I'm gonna I'm gonna spot yeah help with me out and then the second side of that is everybody else you some people have different gifts you know for you to build a 10 million dollar business might you I mean I don't know if it scares you or it doesn't scare you might think to yourself like how the hell would you start that and for me to go out and run an Iron Man scares the hell out of me but for me to build a 10 million dollar business in my brain I think well that's pretty easy you know I mean for you to go right now there are skill sets associated to and so you know being able to understand be self-aware of hey what am I capable of what's gonna happen what can I be realistic with and then attack you know being able to have that humility to show up and compete for yourself every day yeah and in terms of modeling like you know we've all heard a thousand times like you are the five people surround yourself with and you know you get those individuals you know that are like why don't I don't really know five people like I'm stuck in this kind of community or environment and I'm like that is one of the gifts of social media like my five guys that are in my circle they don't even know that I'm in their circle because I'm like modeling them on social media like you're in my circle and Ed's in my circle and like these guys are you in my circle too I'm telling you that right now I appreciate it but like there's guys out there that like okay I don't I need to find my five guys dude find the five guys you want to be like it's on social media and then just start modeling them and yeah until they really become part of your show that's the real fake it till you make it that's what fake it till you make it actually fucking me 100% what it means is fake behaving like them until you become them you know it doesn't mean ran a lambo and fuck a dick picture front of it literally it's exactly that and you know fake it till you make it has kind of got this like bad stigma nowadays but fake it till you make it means like start acting like that person exactly to become a habit not into it like the result acting like the work yes do do the habits the characteristics the traits the the execution part of it like you can't tell me if you don't if you start to do the activities that Andy's doing you're modeling like we just talked about that behavior and now all of a sudden oh I'm starting to become that person or like that but it's right making it it's actually putting in the work and doing those action steps but you've just created the pathway for me not I got to just model that I don't think people understand I think when people think about themselves they think about themselves like they look at their life right now and they say this is my life right and I want a different life but they don't stop to understand that what you're looking at now is the result of decisions that were made by a different you that existed in the past and if you want a different outcome the current you has to make decisions now today even though the result isn't what you want especially because the result isn't what you want that you have currently you need to make decisions today that produce a different outcome later and so what if you really think about it dude like if you really dig into it you're not even the same person that's created the life that you have in front of you that you're dissatisfied with you're not even that person anymore you're already somebody else right now even though the result of your life says differently you have made a decision to make the change now which means you actually are somebody else right now you're just dealing with the mess this other guy creating yeah and if we if we could think about it like that there's less shame there's less guilt there's less embarrassment there's less you know worry about looking stupid because we're like yeah well that guy was an idiot I'm not an idiot anymore I learned by lesson you know I'm gonna make some better decisions and I think when I think about things when I'm dissatisfied that's one of the things that's like one of the little mental hacks that I use to I guess make myself feel better about it you know but maybe that'll help you guys too you know I think the result of what we have now we have to acknowledge that that was that guy that was not me right now you know the greatest calm good I've ever received good and bad yeah good good I'm bad right even the good shit you got right now that ain't from what you did right now that's right correct keeps keeps you in check on the other correct greatest compliment I ever receive is you've changed you changed that's the point and like good yeah I hope I'm not the same guy was when I was 20 or 30 or 40 like I'm I'm creeping up on 15 I'm like thank you yeah but they didn't they didn't mean it as a compliment but I'm like dude I'm a rock I'm on a rocket ship and if you're not on board like that's fine we'll part ways like our time to get us over but like it's so important and I'm gonna I'm gonna tell people the secrets of life right now it's one forgive yourself for your past like learn from those lessons but like leave stop carrying that bag of rocks it that's hard bring the lessons with you but like learn from those and then stop catastrophizing and worrying about the future have your dream and and reverse engineer to the path but then like the hardest thing and it's totally cliche but like it's right now it's this moment because if you take care of today tomorrow takes care of itself you know the vision you know where you're gonna get to but what's holding people back is those two things catastrophizing about the future and living in the past not forgiving it yourself for the for the turd that you were what would you say to someone who spell catastrophizing please yeah see a testifying yes and a g such a so I do get a lot of messages from people that talk about the forgiveness of self and they they're very much so struggle with that so talk about that for a second what do you think on that man it takes a ton of work just like that you know mindfulness is I'll see a cliche word to it's so funny so clip on Instagram the other day they were like mindfulness dude the phones have ruined mindfulness like back in the day just sitting on a bus mindfulness taking a shit mindfulness like doing all these things is not mindfulness but now we've got to like set time aside to do mindfulness but but really that's what it takes down to you've got to have that practice of like disconnecting sitting down really dissecting what's happening have open real conversations with your spouse with your parents with your kids with with family have a trusted circle that you can do a deep dive into stuff and then like reset those negative experiences with positive ones and that that's the beauty of the brain is you can totally reset your brain which changes your perspective through different experiences and so if you're if you're stuck in the past all the time it's because you're not progressing you're not showing up you're not trying to learn adapt evolve and change and so like you want to get over your past start creating a new future for yourself because that's the biggest thing we're seeing with people if you're if you're talking with old with friends and whatnot and all you guys talk about is the past and old memories they're not your friends yeah and that they're holding you back from progression and you're not getting the route to get yourself over whatever trauma it is because we all have trauma and it's all unique to ourselves but you have to take that effort just like physical effort in in in in transformations in business whatever it takes effort and mindset and getting over your past takes effort it's not about shoving it down it's about facing it overcoming and creating a new future changing the perspective in which you see and approach your life that's that's the only way to do it and it's it's work and sometimes it sucks and you're gonna you're gonna have those moments of love tears and fear and and apostro syndrome and all these things but you have to unload that bag of rocks in order to you have to actually become someone else 100 percent you have to shed those people and again I just I said it moments ago like the greatest compliment I get is you've changed I'm like thank you I'm doing I'm doing the work would you say that also goes to because okay so hold on to your past you're saying that that's one part of it but what about but about the people who refuse even admit that they had they are responsible for that past right like is that is that also a part of that as well 100 percent it's a lack of maturity lack of accountability and like just being honest with those people those people are kind of off the table off the ring like until you're willing to accept the reality of how the world works which is this it is inputs and it is outputs it is math it is one input equals one output if I put this in I'm gonna get this out if I put good in I'm gonna get good out if I put bad in I'm gonna get bad out this is the reality of life and for someone to make any progress at all to not the first step is to always take accountability and if they can't do that there's they're gonna be stuck there forever yeah they can never change you can't drag them through it well I was to to your point like you I just really learned because we do a lot of coaching like you can't you can't make somebody change and and they have to show up with with humility with accountability and then a willingness to work and shed they've got that's where they got to put it now they're the play now they can be mold yes now now now you like okay now let's start to rebuild and have experiences to change what it is and so yeah to you to your point like you can't you you can't work with someone who's not willing and in a in a space where where they're wanting to change in fact I I come across people and they're at rock bottom and the first thing I say to them is congratulations like this is the start of the next part because most people don't really change until they've had like a significant event in their lives to where they're either stripped of everything everything was taken away a traumatic accident a major illness or something and then they're like okay something needs to change but it takes I hate to see it but it takes that moment for someone to have that realization to like start to reclaim themselves into it something new something different yeah I had one of my one of my best friends you know growing up and then through college he became a crack addict of all things right like here we are like regular people that we would think college athletes and somehow this dude gets wrapped up in crack you know and you're thinking no way no way and it was a long path it was a long process three four years and you know I would call anybody and ask for help and I would drag this guy out of the inner city I mean I was any anywhere I could find him I go get him drag him fight him you know tie him down the whole deal and saw a therapist one time and and she's like hey listen like you're not here's the truth and you're gonna have the faces he's either gonna you know overdose or get to a point where he wants to change like he has to change where he's gonna die but you you going in and get him you're not getting him out of that he's gonna have to do it and I'm so hard headed I'm like nah I ain't gonna happen you know but after another 18 months of battling it he went through the process you know hit bottom you know he went through the you know woke up in the hospital went through the whole deal you know and there he was and he hadn't make that decision he made decision change and I think he's 12 or 13 years sober now you know and has gone through it but built a great business for himself yeah it's not a huge love but it's crazy like to that point like you had to James do you have to get not people think rock bottom like oh they got to be doing bad no you got to be on the brink of death no so now what you think rock bottom yeah yeah so to your point like one of my best friends in high school like graduate high school we both won the state championship in wrestling we both went undefeated in our way we're standing at the same point at the same time mass of future ahead of us what are we gonna do wrestle what's that they're gonna wrestle we're gonna wrestle we're both on the beat yeah and take your shirt off fast for 20 years and he got addicted to cocaine and went down this road and I his brother finally called me and he said I don't know who to turn to will you please take him in and he we moved him to Utah we took him in our home we got him working out we had him reading books and he was massive progress and six months go by and we send him back home gets off the plane straight to his dealer and hasn't come out of it yet yeah and so we're like you just can't they have to get to the point where they are wanting to make that change and I'm literally waiting for that phone call to where he's either dead or in prison or he's turned his life round and I hope it's the latter because there was just nothing we could do because he has to be the one to want and make that change yeah and we can actually you know consequently we we get this a lot in in our business in the diet business you can want better for somebody else but until they want to make that change and they kind of hit you know that moment they won't make a change and you know people say all time I want my spouse to do it or or you know I want my mom to do it or any my kids to do it and having you know hundreds of thousands of reps at this point like you have to you have to want it that's what I've learned and for me and for a lot of people it's a picture right or they have a moment where they're in a suit and a tie they're with their significant other and they see it and they see the wedding photo and they look at their photo now and they look back and they can holy hell that's me and then they have this internal moment where they make the change but that you know that drastic kind of situation that you have to go through mentally to see is what it takes to require to take the action to go make that change and you know at least in the in the diet business and I think a lot in life too right like you have to kind of hit these walls and get to these points of where you I don't want it anymore well people ask me all the time like how do you with what you've accomplished what motivates you to keep showing up keep striving for new goals keep trying to raise the ceiling and I'm like I just feel I have a responsibility to set an example for those that aren't in that place yet because we may not know it or recognize it but as leaders like people are watching us and like strangers we don't even know and I I feel a responsibility I have to keep showing up in my life and execute at a super high level because those people are watching and at some day it's going to it's going to click for them and without my effort directly with them you saved a person right and and they they gain that confidence at momentum and they finally they go okay that that's what I want I'm at rock bottom and that's what I want and so I just like you guys you want to be this the the nor star for people and and that that excellence in your life doesn't go unnoticed and and it's some day those those individuals are going to do it they're going to make the change and guess what they're going to turn to you you're going to be their mentor their coach and you're going to be able to help them through that but you you can't be that person if you're wishy washy you're not consistent you're not showing up you're not trying to be that that like standard of excellence that people are striving for so that that's what motivates me every single day like who's watching because on day 80 of the conquer 100 I was broken like broken like I'm spiritually mentally physically and when I first started this journey in 2012 the world record for the most Iron Man's in year was 20 and I'd done 80 consecutive I had 20 more to go and trust me the last thing I wanted to do was 20 more 140.6 mile days and I look back at it and I'm like because I made the decision to keep going and I just need okay today I just have to show up and and do what I can and the lives that we changed just over those last 20 days is staggering because we hadn't hit our our fundraising goal yet and from that moment to the end it was at $750,000 bump and so you always I always ask myself what would have happened if I quit on day 80 and it would have still been a world record it still would have been a new standard in endurance but what what opportunity did I lose to impact somebody because I because I chose not to quit on that day I've changed my legacy for sure right and that's what we need to strive and that's where our mindset needs to go like what's what's my legacy and we'll never reach it right it's this constant moving benchmark right you know you hear you hear people talking about I got me to chase down the ultimate version of who I am that's that's not possible because it's possible chasing it's not possible achieving correct yes because as we evolve as people the the potential expands yes the version of that person changes so that like to me it's the most fun thing on the planet is to try to chase down this the the the baddest version of me because it's an endless pursuit and I'm like who am I going to be in 20 years try to chase the sun of a bitch down you know what I mean and that just fires me up well you're not bad me I can tell you that I'll tell you right now I'll be the first person to do 140.6 miles at a year of I'll be by on it get that point I'm going to do an Iron Man I believe that I have zero doubts about that I'll be there on day you know I'll be there for the run get for it I won't be there I'm shooting for 80 all right I'm here to have fun good time I hear for a long time all right the dude I'm really glad to hear you say that because I first of all I agree with you on the pursuit of one's own potential being the literal definition of a successful life because by pursuing your potential even understanding that you'll never reach it so much good happens from that that is residual because you're continuing to evolve over and over and over and over again and when people see that they start to understand themselves differently and I think that's what separates if I guess what I'm trying to say here is that you know you said what gets you up when you're sore when you're tired when you've had you've already proven everything you've you've done all the things bro like what you know I'm sure you'll come up with something crazy again and do it again I know you will and probably a lot more things that's the truth I think you're just getting started but if the whole world understood what you just said how different would the world look meaning if everybody got up every day and understood that their life was literally crafting other people's lives that is a switch in perspective that will keep you in check if you're having trouble you know getting it going or understanding what the point is of this or like the woman we spoke of earlier who's very powerless you know try switching the perspective a little bit tried making it not about you it's not about you it's about everybody around you and it's not just because you wear leaders in this room everybody's a leader that's what we're failing to realize is a culture and a society the average guy who's got a blue collar job who's going to work bro you're still a leader man people are watching you they're observing you in the example you said look at camhains camhains is a regular guy who's changed the I mean he's very not regular but in general terms he's a normal guy and he's decided to live his life at a very high potential which in turn inspires millions of people to do the same and just by a simple guy who you know works construction and builds things and loves to bow hunt calls himself a bow hunter that's his identity this guy because of the standard that he holds he inspires millions of people and if he can do that then why can't you do that 100% why can't you the listener do that why can't you live at a higher standard and show the people around you even if the people are just your spouse or your kids or your neighbor or in your neighborhood you know like these are the things that actually matter it's not who's in political office it's not it's not what's going on in the news it's what example are we setting out here in society because we all complain about society but we fail to acknowledge that we are society and the example that we set does matter and if everybody took what you said and really listen to it and really thought about it you ask a man who's done I mean dude you know like we said 50 Ironmans and 50 consecutive days and 50 states 101 straight Ironmans I mean dude you ran across Greece you've biked across the country you've done all this really I mean bro one of those things is legendary much less all of them and you ask him what's he's still doing this for why is he still going and he says because I want you to see it because I want you to be better if we all have that attitude what would the world look like and dude it's one of my favorite things about you bro real talk like you you you totally understand what it means to be a man that is being a man people say what's the difference between a man and a boy being a man is understanding that how you live your life is going to dictate how other people turn out regardless if you have kids or not or whatever your circle or spirit of influence might be that is what a man is and right now when people say oh we're lacking men they're correct but not for the reason that you think not because we need more beards or more tattoos or more talking shit we don't need more of that we need more real examples that's what being a man is all about and that's what's going to get this fucker turned around for the for the better and I just want to acknowledge that bro like I think that's to me that was the most impactful thing you said all day awesome yeah I think I appreciate that too honestly and I truly believe that if if if there was a mindset shift in the world and everybody tried to attack life with this relentless pursuit of excellence and the the measure of success was how many people you could bring to the top of the mountain with you dude I think that that would change the world and my my goal now is to see how many people I can impact give hope and and start to win the conversations they're having with themselves to get out of their own damn way and I've just learned that the pursuit of excellence it's lonely and you don't want to be standing on top by yourself you want to bring as many people with you as possible and that's what I see happening here at first form of the culture you guys create it's not a bike what can I get it's how many people can I help well brother that's what we product it all happened that's why we love doing things with you real talk because you do the same thing in your life every day like you're out of all the people I met which is thousands of them dude not only are you like a relentless aggressive competitive guy who can pull out that you know that fuck you that you got to have to win right dog yeah he dude this dude this dude has the biggest dog in him real talk and and then also be the guy who's encouraging people to come with and be humbled it's just a really incredible comment combination of personality bro and I I know we I'm speaking for all of us here we all fucking love it that means a ton yeah yeah certainly not common we wish it was more the norm yeah so it's it's always nice to have you around thank you man yeah so you're you've also got this other thing that you're working on you got a book coming out yeah yeah about the book yeah this has been an exciting project for us only because again it's what we just talked about it's it's trying to get the the greatest amount of people to the mountain top and get out of their own way and winning the conversations and the the reason the title of the book is going to be called iron hope and and I I've got the worst gift ever Andy I have this this gift to suffer and and I thought to myself man this is the worst gift ever like why why didn't I have this like incredible baseball talent like Salah why didn't I have this like business savviness like you to or why good looks like DJ I did like this like how can I be this position or this artist and I was like given this gift to be able to suffer and and over the 20 years that we've been doing this thousands of stories have come into our team and through email and messaging that like your ability to suffer has given us hope on our journey where we didn't ask for the suffering whether it's addiction or illness or trauma or whatever it is and that was just like incredibly humbling for me and so that's why we named it iron hope and and the purpose of the book is to to give people that hope that the regular every day person the hope to deal with and overcome the adversity and struggles that we're dealing with because it's it's crippling today and it's it to me I mean it's it's been a lifelong journey to put this book together the lessons that we've learned and and and just the things that I think we could impart on people to to give them that hope to start winning those conversations to create that momentum because I truly meant myself my wife our kids it's a team effort and we just want to see as many people win and and and have success I I believe I have found pure joy in my life and it's it's through family it's through community it's through struggle it's through doing hard things it's about reaching finish lines and mountaintops together and and I just want to give that gift to people so I'm really excited about the team we put together the book that we've written it's going to come out January of 2025 and it's going to it's going to be awesome that's awesome about yeah so let me ask you this so people see things like the amazing feats that you've done and they hear you speak you've been speaking I mean for 10 years you've been a professional speaker you want of the best too one one of the best you guys ever need a good speaker to come speak to your organization in any capacity I would highly recommend James he's spoken our organization he's amazing not good yeah he's great great great um maybe a better speaker than a than a Ironman runner athlete right I'm pretty damn good at it I'm pretty damn good yeah yeah I heard it too too damn James is good yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's crazy it's been it's been the greatest gift for me I've now spoken to 56 countries around the world yeah and just been unbelievable to speak from NFL teams to account in century Lanka but what's what's amazing is that's that's what fills my bucket is I'm I can move a room and for me to watch a room like that and every person in their haven't experienced because I'm not I'm not talking to how to improve your bottom line at your company I'm talking to the individual and I'm talking to your mind and your heart and we change the way somebody feels and thinks it changes every aspect of their lives in terms of home and relationship and then business so in fact it does increase business is bottom dollar because we're talking to the way somebody thinks it feels and is that your pitch it's got who to make you money I hope so yeah I need to I need to I need to I need the the guys to pull that clip out specifically yeah we got it so people see you do all these amazing things and they assume that you're a superhuman guy and and you have struggles and you have things that you've been through and let's talk about some of the things that you've had to overcome yeah I think it's so important to realize that like you said flesh and blood yeah cut me I still bleed yeah I put my pants on one leg at a time like everybody else in fact I woke up today and I'm like dude I'm not good enough to be on Andy's podcast like just that bro you're like one of the main reasons I have the podcast without me meeting you 75 hard wouldn't be a thing it's so humbling yeah say that it's real truth it blows it blows my mind but but I'm like I'm like everybody else and that's the real struggle that's the thing that people struggle with most is that Impostor syndrome and again it's just straight up the conversations that we're having with ourselves and after the after the 100 Iron Man's I'm in 100 days I was broken mentally yeah and and it like just from concussions and PTSD and it took two years of really hard work and resetting those neurological pathways because it's real and and some days I woke up with incredible anxiety incredible depression they did these tests on me where they were testing my eye movements and they were in the millions and they were supposed to be in the thousands and they they questioned how I was functioning and when they did my brain scans they were like we don't know how you get on stage and and and do what you're doing and it was just at that point share will to be able to do it because I'm like I have to keep going I have to keep showing up I'm not I'm never going to quit on myself and through a lot of work and struggle and teamwork and love for my wife and family we did a recent brain scan at the end of last year and they said 100% clear no signs of PTSD no one would know you had a concussion so you literally fixed your brain fixed my I broke my brain and then I fixed it and that's that's a message that I want to get people to know and understand like even these guys that you look up to and all like we we struggle oh yeah I've heard you talk about all the time you and I talked about this exact issue 100% because I've had lots of actual physical trauma in my life you know I got stabbed in the head my head was swollen for a year and a half yeah I played football I played all kinds of contact sports I fucking didn't have to chronic stress 24 hours a day for the last 25 years so yeah we've bit there's some shit I mean I went to the world championships last year for the swim run race it's called Otillo it's in Sweden and for the first time in my career I didn't make the cutoff and and I left that race and I was so embarrassed I was humiliated and and I was just like and it's because I was I was literally broken yeah and when you when you establish yourself in society as like the toughest dude and you're incredibly mentally tough and you're you're unbreakable and then you you miss it you miss a race cutoff in your last place and that was a moment for you where I'm like that's not okay yeah and something's going on something's going on yeah and I was so grateful for the team that I had the support that I had literally fixed my brain yeah and I'm so fired up this year like yeah dude I could tell bro we said at the beginning like I'm going to South Africa yeah got a couple world championships on this schedule this year like I'm I'm almost 50 you haven't seen the best of me yet I did I believe that I'm really and I'm so fired up like just my perspective like we've talked about today like it's so wide open the possibility I'm going to PR in most modalities that I do this year so when we talk about overcoming hardship and we look at society you know you and I spoken a lot through through by the way I could tell you're different I could feel it I could feel it in your presence this time versus the last time I saw you in real life I know I and I know what that's like I know what it's like to fucking step up and have to do your talks and do your job and and pretend like everything's cool when it cool I know exactly what that's like I just went through a very difficult physical situation with my health as well which I tell you about off the show but it fixed a lot of my a lot of what was going on with me and it was physical physical I fuck I just say it here so I had I had a bleeding ulcer in my stomach for the last four years and then I had two bleeding polyps in my colon for the last four years without so I had a little blood in the toilet when I would go poop and and I thought it was from lifting because I would always get like little hemorrhoid issues from lifting weights well turns out I've had this blood issue this blood in my gut and in my intestines for the last four years which is causing my intestines and my gut to flare up which means I can't absorb any of my food but what it also means is that because my blood is I actually caused me to be anemic which was causing massive anxiety so I'm in fight or flight all the time because I'm bleeding and I can't see it right I can only see it in the toilet my god that's no big deal I know that sounds crazy to you guys but like that stuff doesn't phase me out like I'm just like yeah whatever I got a fucking broken finger I don't give a shit you you get it so but dude I went got a fixed and within three days my brain was fucking right like it was crazy all it was was I just didn't have much oxygen and that signal was going to my brain it fixed a lot of stuff which is why I'm excited about this year for me physically too because I can now absorb food but the point is you know we go through these times where we know we're not right and it's not because we can't push through or we're weak or we're not tough enough like bro you're running across fucking grease bro you're pretty tough you know what I'm saying at some point we do have to stop and say hey there is a real problem here but you know what would you say to because like right now in society I struggle to talk about these things because I feel like our culture is so geared towards manufacturing problems that aren't real versus addressing problems that are meaning I feel like a lot of people have built their identity in being a victim and saying I got all this stuff wrong with me I can't do this and for attention and likes and shares on the internet and it's almost hard to like differentiate differentiate real real situations from non-real situations now and I think that keeps a lot of people from addressing situations that could be real right like I don't feel good I'm not feeling right I'm I'm fucked up but I don't want to be a pussy because I don't want to be like one of these guys on the internet that's just crying about all this shit all the time so like what do you think what like what's your take on that yeah I mean we just have to everybody has to have their own unique experiences and then you've just got to know and understand your body and yeah it's reacting and and be honest with yourself like okay is this an injury or is this just an acre or pain yeah and is this a moment where I push through and I grow or do I need that recovery right because as as guys were like push go grind all the time right yeah and but we do need to respect that like recovery and downtime like people don't understand because they see my really intense moments but at my home I got a hyper bear chamber at my house I've got a red light therapy bed I've got a PT and massage it comes in every single week like the Braun James spends a million dollars a year on his physical health so that he can perform and so really those individuals that are just sitting at home like questioning should I shouldn't I they're not getting the knowledge and experience they need to in order to make those those decisions right yeah it's it's it's it's again humility like you're saying okay I can either grind this out but what type of long term damage are you doing by not by not checking that out yeah and like dude I I crack like on day day 59 of the hundred I crashed and I broke my back yeah and I cracked my L5 vertebrae and had to do 41 Iron Man it's with a broken back and so a lot of people would be like whoa that's that's like dangerous to like put your body in that position but I really know my body because I've had a lot of experience in doing this stuff my wife knows me in like all these things like we know by showing up and having experiences like where our limits are am I injured or am I smart yeah through and all these things and so frankly for those people that are just like not engaging and experiencing in life like that's what you have to do to be able to get to know oneself yeah and surround yourself with people too that like know you can understand you because like my wife was the first one to say hey something's wrong yeah with your brain yeah I know you we've been married 23 years like we need to address this and then for me as a man to be humble enough to say okay what does that look like yeah you know and so again it's just like knowing yourself and then surrounding yourself with unbelievable people that also recognize that and and we'll put their hand out and help you I think also to add dude I think you know you have to push yourself to a certain point to actually create awareness of what is wrong you know a lot of people oh I've stuck to my diet five days I deserve three days off my diet because I got to recover bro that's not what we're talking about yeah we're talking about the other end of the spectrum we're talking about pushing yourself to the point of literal destruction and then having to step back and say all right this isn't good what do I got to do now how hard was that for you to to address mentally yes super hard to to get to that point because you because when you're because like bro you're that you've done all this shit right in your brain you're like fuck I can do anything well dude I'm telling you remember like know where so many red flags and a pop up the other the brain is so powerful like somebody asked me on day 98 how many I could do and I was like 200 yeah like that's where my mind was and I was in that state of grind and push and I was just in that really protective state and then like day 102 and three I was like broken and so again recognize like how powerful the mind is but what we need to do also too is like we need to you know we've talked about in the past like showing up and doing hard things intentionally that was kind of the line yeah that created yeah yes and I went and did this race this jungle race in Fiji backcountry it was a mark brinette production bear girls was the host 67 countries from around the world teams of four and it was actually called the world's toughest race I remember yeah yeah it was on Amazon Amazon Prime and they kept trying to convince me and they wanted me to say on camera this was the hardest thing that I've ever done and we came into every camp and everything we were smiling we were laughing like the other teams are so so miserable and suffering and they just couldn't understand why we were so happy coming into every camp and they they they just badly wanted us to say it was the hardest thing we've ever done and we basically laughed the whole time because we're like no you have we've done 50 days of impossible this is eight days like yeah and that's the point even believable is he right and so that's the point here is you you have to show up and do hard things to move that bar through experience to know what's good what's wrong and what's easy and what's hurting you and what's not but you have to change where that that bench that benchmark line is so do things really hard all the time so that when general society says this is hard to like no this is easy and I know because I've had experiences and I can navigate it differently and that's really like you you got to the point where you're pushing yourself and you're like okay this is this is serious yeah and it takes a humble person yeah when I looked in the blood and there was a gallon of blood or looked at the toilet there was a gallon of blood in there and it was black and red blood and I'm fucking puking have a feet I'm like yeah I'm fucking yeah this is no longer me this is no toughness yeah for sure and it takes a ton of maturity and humility to be able to do that yeah and to go okay I'm now scared to share out of me dude I'm like fuck I'm gonna die tomorrow I better go right now we got me that's what it takes me dude it takes me that far to like take action like that yeah and we hope that most people don't go that far but well I think but I do think people error on the other side of it I think we live in a culture now where people think they're doing something when they're not really doing anything you know and so I just want to clarify when you hear James talk about these things and we talk about you know wind it back off and wind to push bro if you look in the mirror and you're fucking a hundred pounds overweight and your bank account is empty and you're living in the basement in your mom's house bro this is push time this ain't fucking you need to rest you've been resting your whole life all right so I just want to clarify that statement of well I can't in the reality too is when somebody starts on a journey where they're in that point where the 300 pounds and broken everything everything's going to hurt and be disc uncomfortable when you start back doing something because your body's so used to being in that comfortable sheltered state and but then as soon as they start they feel that discomfort and they're like whoa I'm arrest I'm already myself I gotta back on it and you push through those ones right exactly those are the times when you push through and so yeah again it it's through experience to know when to push and when not but people like this happens all the time with new runners they run they feel knee pain and they're like I can't run I have bad knees and I'm like no your knees are hurting because your quads are tight and they're pulling up and it's bringing the suck in the kneecap in because you just started a new activity that's foreign to you and the reason you have bad knees is because you don't run and so there's so there's you gotta I start to like understand the difference of when to show up when to push what not and it's it's a valuable lesson that everybody needs to learn but again just like success and everything you have to show up in life have these experience in order to know where that push and not push line is yeah it's the only way to do anything in life as it's through experiences brother I have as always greatly enjoyed our conversation I know you've got a plane that you're getting ready to catch so if you could leave everybody with one piece of advice or a couple pieces of vice there's just some words of encouragement with everything going on in the world and all the disruption and all the frustration and you know it's difficult times for a lot of people you know what would you say yeah I would say number one show up every single day with honesty and integrity I think I think the world's lacking that right now and and I truly believe that it's a gift to first show up with that honesty and integrity but then not care or internalize what other people think about you and the way you're operating and and if you just continue to show up and chip away at the task at the dream at the whatever it is you'll win because the only way to guarantee that you'll fail is to stop showing up and I'll just share just real quick that that race and Fiji the Fiji and team was given a spot just because they were the host country no training terrible coaching terrible equipment Mark Burnett walked up to him no chance you guys finish they beat every single team that quit and and I was standing on survivor island when the Fiji and team crossed the finish line with huge smiles on their faces now they were dead last but they beat every single team that quit because they understood movement and time and if I just keep moving times going to keep ticking and eventually I'll get there and they were gritty out of necessity because they grew up in that in that life and they they developed that skill set and so really my message is meet yourself while you're at give yourself some grace everybody's heart is different just start learn as you go be gracious in your mistakes and just keep chipping away and eventually you'll get there surrounded by amazing people bro I love it man I um let's hit the dates on when you're documentary in your book
