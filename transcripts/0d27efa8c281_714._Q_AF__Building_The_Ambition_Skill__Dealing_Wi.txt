I think that's gonna be fucking fire. That's why we're doing it We're doing it because I've recognized that like the the fucking young people and the young people and bit We need this shit that the the entire Information space of entrepreneurs has been taken over by fucking morons who have never built fucking shit all right and when I was doing this content when I was doing MFC O people were very careful not to get into there because there was Legitimate people teaching legitimate shit and because I stopped now there's this there's all these people talking about I made $5 million and fucking one week and all this shit and it has all these kids confused bro Yeah, on top of it They're going to college and they're not getting taught any skills and not being taught how to communicate with people or how to win Or how to sell or how to manage or how to build or how to create Dude and they need it dude. It's not that we don't have more people trying to win. That's not the problem No, we have a lot of people sharing bad information. That's what it is. Yeah, and these guys Which makes it appear like there's nobody trying to win well, dude These guys who are young don't have the perspective to know who's who yeah, it's very easy to convince someone who's 19 2021 22 years old of Success when you got a fucking her account and they don't right, you know Or you got whatever and they don't and dude the thing is is it's so easy to go out and put a front on about making money But you can't fake real companies that you could order from and and you know you can't fake that shit And a lot of these guys that are out here dude dude. There's just so much shit It's a bit excited to bring it because it's not just about the fucking bullshairs on the internet It's also about the lack of community. It's the lack of fucking brotherhood. It's the lack of support. It's It's The lack of real information coming from the education system I mean dude the difference between when I was in the education system and now and it was shitty when I was in it But now it's like it's like they're teaching them to be dumber right and there's all these kids that want to win and build companies and have success and I'm just excited to get back. I feel like my personal now. We're gonna continue to do real AF just so we're clear But I'm just excited because that's where I think that's where I'm best dude. I'm best with that kind of stuff Yeah, so I'm excited to get back real needs it man. Yeah, the world needs it. Well guys, Andy. Let's get into these These cues yeah for these ages Um Joe likes my jokes. No, he laughs because he feels sorry for you. Is that what it is? Yes, Joe.

What that means it was that means yeah, fuck out. Well, you know, it's fucked up though I found since being around you. Oh me I found myself doing that smile bro. I can't you know what to speed around you. I'm like stealing What the fuck's that about Man, I was wondering where my charger was This dude steals my charger every fucking day. I came in here today and it was here. I couldn't even believe it You know my my my Your lawyer is stealing put it back That's Andy question number one Andy I've had I've long had large dreams and ambitions in various aspects of my life and I had no idea How to actually realize them? Having dreams and ambition without knowing how to realize them resulted in Experiencing a lot of mental and emotional turmoil inside me Every day I've been doing the power list for a while now. I've completed 75 hard. I've read your books I cannot get enough of your podcast your teachings and examples of giving me abilities to channel my energy day in and day out Towards these dreams. I feel much more structured Integrated calm. I'm now starting to love and appreciate myself. I'm forever grateful to you I'm focused on taking the next steps forward one sentence from your book on mental toughness which keeps coming back to me is on page 48 Being ambitious is a skill My mind keeps bringing me bringing this up Which is a sign that there is a lesson here for me to learn you taught me that discipline and other aspects of mental toughness are skills But what about ambition is a skill could you please elaborate on this? Yeah, so what we have to understand about Ambition is that certain people have it naturally and then a lot of people don't have it So they feel like oh, I just don't have it But if you ask those people very simply What do you want out of your life? What are you trying to achieve? They can't really tell you anything and it's because they haven't projected their lives into the future five ten fifteen years and thought about what it might be like and because they've never done that Whether it be because their parents taught them to be just a cog in the machine or School didn't teach them to be creative We have a situation where people have a hard time developing ambition because if you don't have any dreams hopes or Wishes for yourself. What do you have to be ambitious about? So when you're one of these people who doesn't actually have ambition naturally You have to start thinking what is my life going to be like five years from now? What is my life going to be like ten years from now? What is my life going to be like twenty years from now and what is my life going to be like in those timeframes if I don't change and what? Do I want for myself if I could get anything I wanted and when you start thinking like that You start to dream you start to create you start to want more for yourself which helps drive the ambition internally All right, and we miss out on a lot of these things because right now in the way that we operate and how technology is We spend so much time scrolling and so much time consuming that we actually don't have any time to be Board and usually boredom is when people create in their mind They think about what they want which drives the ambitious nature within them that we all have as human beings look Humans have created the entire earth over 12,000 years Everybody has ambition if they have something they're trying to achieve But the problem with people who don't have it is that they just don't think about it They spend all their time trying to be entertained scrolling Paying attention to other things and if you're paying attention to other things You don't have time to think about what your life's going to be like then how can you have any ambition? You're watching other people's ambition right so we have to train ourselves To visualize ourselves and what we want out of our lives Which will in turn drive the ambition from the inside out into the external world? That makes sense it makes it so you have to practice this It's not something that just happens. There are some people who are just wired to fucking go and win I am like that. I've always been like that and a lot of you guys watch me and maybe other people like me and say fuck how come How come he has that and I don't have that well because from a very early age I was encouraged to dream and think and and try to create what I wanted to be in my life I was very lucky to have parents that encourage those things all right they So from the time I was 4 or 5 6 7 years old I was like man. I want to be this I want to do that I want to do this which instilled the skill of Ambition so while you might read it as oh, it's just a trait that he has well I've been practicing that for a long time So it's actually a skill that I've developed so if you want to start developing the skill of ambition Start thinking about what you want out of your life and then also on the counter think about what your life will be like if you don't change Which is a very powerful Driver behind the ambitions that you create. Yeah, and ambition would you say that that you know if you're really trying to pursue real success At this idea of needing motivation or inspiration should be replaced with this skill of ambition right because like the ambition is the Driving for like that's what gets you on the pursuit right? Yeah, look you got to know where you're going You got to know what you want most people put more time and to go and out with their friends and making plans for the Vacation then they do their entire life. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense So what you have to do is you have to have a place that you're going and then you have to have the ability to follow the plan which is discipline To execute the plan day in and day out day in and day out day in and day out to get to that place Motivation is gonna come and go there's gonna be days where you're gonna feel fucking amazing There's gonna be days where you feel like you could just get up and run through wall and all those days you can But here's the thing on the days you don't feel like that you still can And that's where people miss you could still run through those walls when you don't feel like running through them And if you train yourself to be disciplined You're not gonna miss the gaps that other people would miss because they can only operate when they're motivated Yeah, so you're able to go win after win after win after win after win where they're going win win Three days breaks another two wins and if you just do the math You can see who's gonna get where they want to go and who's gonna get where they want to go faster I love this I love this this Carva on ambition. I want to actually this too So it's like, you know, when you talk about ambition like you got a young person here How important is it when you talk about knowing where you want to go, right? But like You have to want that so bad and I think a lot of young people The the issue when it comes to like, you know, this conversation about ambition is that you know in society for whatever reason People who seem to be obsessed with whether it's material goals or you know a number in the bank account, right? It's it's always deemed as this like greedy or bad. So like how do you get over? You know, I guess allowing yourself to be okay with one one thing success so bad and wanting that to drive that ambition to to keep the motivation That's why I tell you guys all the time if you listen to them You'll be like them and most people will shit on big goals. They will say oh your materialistic Oh, you're morally misaligned. Oh, I'm morally superior to you because I can get by with less the fuck are you talking about as Nothing to do with being a good person Being cut and by the way, you could do way more with resources for other people than you can without them So all of this shit talk on success is just bullshit propaganda that comes from people who wish they would have done something else But chose not to and because they chose not to they don't like you thinking that way either because they're afraid That if you go out and show them that it's possible that they will believe that it was possible for them and they just shit their life away All right, so we have to deal with this realistic attitude. Let's talk about what they teach at school They tell you when you're and kindergarten DJ you could be anything you want you could be president you could be a billionaire you got a dream big That's what they tell us in kindergarten right by the time we're in sixth grade You need to start thinking about your future. You need to start thinking you know I realize you got big dreams, but You know, let's start to be realistic here by the time you're a sophomore in high school It's what's your major? What are you going to school for? Oh, I want to be president the other kids beating you up throwing in the locker Okay, so over the course of time we go as people from being told we can achieve greatness to being told by people Who couldn't achieve greatness that we will never be great and so when we think about it like that It makes sense as to why people don't dream and when people don't dream They don't have ambition which creates a scenario where they can't achieve anything So we have to understand the dynamic when we're young We're told we could be anything But because we have to go through life and be around motherfuckers that never did a goddamn thing in their entire life Some of that rubs off on us and we have to be smart enough to look at them and say I don't want that life That's not the life I want that's not how I want to live that's not what I want to drive that's not what I that's not me And we had to say fuck that and we have to say that we're going to do something else and do that's very hard to do when it's your parents and your friends and your network And your teachers all these people you're supposed to trust and because we trust them we start to believe well You know, maybe those rich people are pieces of shit Maybe it is an immoral thing to try and want more Maybe it is a bad thing that I'm not meek and modest and you know shut my mouth But dude when you're 60 years old you're gonna say fuck I wish I wasn't so meek and modest and kept my mouth shut Because I'd have a lot more to show for my life So If you understand how it happens you can understand what to do about it What you need to do about it stop listen motherfuckers that don't have what you what you want that's it I love it man. I love it guys any question number two Andy I was recently promoted to department supervisor the previous supervisor was demoted and is now working under me He seems to be bitter about it. I have a hard time motivating him I'm sure his attitude is how he got to where he is. I'm not sorry I was hoping to get some advice on what you would do in the situation. Thank you for everything you do so he so to understand You got promoted above someone that was your supervisor right and now you're his supervisor Okay, yeah, that's a difficult situation a lot of times because most people don't have the maturity to recognize That the reason they are in the situation that they're in is because they did or didn't do certain things And whether you're in a good position or you're in a bad position You're in that position because of what you did or didn't do You're in the position because of what you did do he's in the position because of what he didn't do And because people can't admit that and they can't be honest and they can't accept responsibility for their lives They usually get bitter about anything that passes them by so you have an uphill battle with this person unless they are extremely emotionally intelligent and Quite honestly just a realist which they probably aren't So There's a couple ways to go about it one you get rid of them All right could do that If the person doesn't do their job if they got a piss poor attitude If they're cancerous and they're talking shit, I'd fucking fire All right, because they're not going to come back from that Uh, the second thing you could do is you could Pull them aside and have a conversation and say hey Joe I know this is fucking weird and I know that you're bitter about it But here's the thing I did this and this and this and this and this to get here And while I was doing this and this and this and this and this you weren't doing these things And now we're in a situation where the roles are reversed and If you want to get back to the role that you were in these are the things that you're going to have to do And there's no hard feelings here dude. I don't I'm not better than you This is just me. I was doing things that you weren't doing and if you want I'll help you get back to the point of where you were doing those things But that's going to require your attitude being good and not being bitter and piss poor I don't need that shit around you're not happy with that shit around So if that's the way it's going to be then we might as well just part ways now But I am totally with you if you want to get better I'll help you I'll train you I'll do whatever you got to do But uh, you know, we got changed our attitude and that that's basically the two two options there I love that man. I think people have a hard time Like leadership is one of those things and like being around you. I've learned that like it's it's more simple than you think it is But leadership is just I feel like it's one of those things a lot of people just complicate overly complicate Well, the reason they overcomplicated is because they don't want to lead the proper way Most quote unquote leaders Want to be a leader without doing the work of a leader So they don't want to live the standard they don't want to fucking do all the extra work. They don't want to hold a high Standard for detail and make sure that they can do the job They don't want to live that they don't they want to say they're the leader And then they want everybody else to do the work and what people don't understand is being a leader is make Make sure that you do the work as good as everybody else and probably better than everyone else And that you help them get to that level and the leader so leadership when effective takes a lot of hard work And most people just aren't invested in doing it And that's why great leaders stand out. That's why great leaders get paid That's why they have great careers because they're willing to be great at the things they're leading about They're willing to keep those skills at a high level and they're willing to train the people around them to have those same skill sets and great leaders are usually the people who during the time of leadership The people that you're leading may not like you all the time But after they've moved on and they've progressed they look back and they say dude I wouldn't be where I'm at without that So, you know, it's not about making them like you today. It's about making them love you in five years. I love that man I love that guys any our third and final question. This is one of my favorite ones. I think we've gotten I think you're gonna like it too So guys Andy question number three Andy I just wrapped up my first year of college I played D1 baseball at your favorite college hook-am-horns, baby But about halfway through my second semester I felt myself slipping grades focus and practices. I seasoned in play out the best etc I still finished the year decently and strong But my question is and I know this may sound crazy But what do you do the moment you catch yourself slipping? I feel like I was doing good and then I don't know where I wake up and I'm like shit I've been off And what's the best way to maintain the highs and eliminate the lows? bro, this is this is something that everybody struggles with okay When things are a disarray and when things are in disorder and you've done well you've built The skill set you've performed at a high level and then things start going off course All right, the first thing that you need to do is you need to go examine what you did to get to that point in the first place And the reason a lot of people can't do that is because those things seem basic to them once they're good all right, so Really, this is this question is really about hubris and ego All right, so when you if we imagine a growth curve okay a bell curve and you're at the beginning of the bell curve down here at the very bottom And you don't know shit about baseball you don't know anything you don't know how to hit fucking baseball This is 20 years ago for you, okay? You don't even know how to hit a ball off the tee So your dad or whoever puts the ball on the tee and says hit the ball you don't know shit You're like, okay, I fucking hit the ball all right. That's the level of I am so open to learning That I'll do whatever the coach says because I don't know anything right So over the years you get better and better and better and you move up the curve and as you go up the curve your skill set Improves your performance improves things start getting good and this this is mirrored in people's careers as well So they get to this they get to a pretty good space where they're earning big money or your your baton 400 your first team all state you're the best right and What happens is is that all these little things that you learned along the way all the little drills all the little work At the cabbots that you created they start to fade out and what replaces them is the thoughts like this dude I'm really good. I'm fucking great at this. I'm one of the best at this Okay, now the prop that's a good thing like when you walk into a batter's box you better think you're the best you're gonna Fuck it suck. We know this is athletes right but When it comes to actually improving ourselves and improving our skill set that That requires massive humility So when we get to the top of the curve where we have high skill and we start telling ourselves how good we are And we stop doing the things that got us there we start to move down the other side of the curve Which means our performance is getting worse worse worse worse worse worse And then what eventually happens is you get to a point where it's rock bottom for you that might be I haven't gotten to hit in seven games, okay? Or you have two good years where you batted 350 and now you batted 201 year and you're like fuck I lost it. No, you didn't lose it You stopped doing what the fuck made you great, okay? And we have to detach ourselves from our own greatness and And understand that it's not us that's great. It's the things we do that made us great And so you asked how do you continue to get better? Always keep in mind that it is not you it is the actions you take that are producing the result And this is where humility comes in as a valuable trait A valuable quality a valuable Core value to have as success, okay? A lot of people will say oh You're not humble because you drive a feroc that don't have anything to do with it You're like you you are legitimately low IQ dumb mother fucker. You don't know what humility even means What humility means is I know I'm not special. I know it's not me I know I am the result of the actions I take and I know that if that man standing over there took the same actions That I take he would have a similar result So we detach ourselves. It's not me. It's my training. It's not me. It's the work I'm putting in, okay? And if we could detach ourselves from thinking it's us We could continue to progress and get better and better and better And this is why people like Jordan and like Kobe continue to get better throughout their career Because they understood what I'm talking about now if you went and Talked to Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant. You'd probably think fuck this guy's cocky as fuck Well, yeah, but that doesn't change how they prepare and how they work So you can afford to present yourself as great as long as you know in your heart and in your mind That you really ain't that great and that has to do with the work ethic that you have You see what I'm saying? Absolutely So when you step in that batter's box or I go on that stage You're into a board meeting or Michael Jordan goes on the court or whatever Bro, you better believe that you need to think you're the baddest motherfucker that ever fucking lived before you go and perform But every other minute of the day You're a beginner. I'm here to learn. I'm here to get better I'm here to fucking work And that's how it works. That's how humility plays into this So if you want to continue to get better stop thinking that you're Not in control of your ups and downs start realizing that you are and your ups and downs will be controlled by your ability to detach Your own identity from your work ethic and if you continue to do the work and you dedicate yourself to the work And you do the work better than anyone you will perform better than anyone and you won't have that slide down the backside of the curve Okay, so so you caught yourself slipping so you go back you analyze where exactly you kind of messed up that Right, and then so what do you do after that? Yeah, I mean what like what what what have you found to be the quickest way to get back on track? Yeah, dude, all right you're down on the other side of the curve, right? Okay, you're starting to go down the curve. You're aware of it. You realize I'm slipping right What am I not doing now? Then I was doing that Lists those things out and start doing them. Yeah, well shit. I was going to study hall Right, and I stopped going to study hall. I was hitting BP right. I was hitting BP twice a day Now I'm only doing once a day because I led the big 12 and home runs, right Well now you're now you're 15th on big 12 and home runs Maybe you should go back to twice a day. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, so we go we we know what works and Sometimes we know what works so well that we forget that we know what works like for me in business Dude, I've been doing this 25 years. There is very obvious shit sometimes that goes wrong And I've already been through it and I'm like this can't be that and then it is that You know what I'm saying? So we overcomplicated because we think that the basic things lose value as our performance gets higher Or our place in society goes higher in terms of our success Whenever reality those little things are the things that allowed us to get there I love this man because it's like you know getting there and staying there Staying or totally different thing. Yeah, because you're fighting your own ego When you're making fucking $60 million a year, bro Do you think you want to continue to do the things that made you $60 million a year? Do you think you want to fucking fuck off hit the beach in Corona? There you go I love that man. I love it. Well hook components. That's whatever they say. Yeah, that's long one right? Yeah, okay That's fucking sweet man sweet. Well good luck next season man. Hope it hope everything works out Well guys in That was three. All right guys. Go pay the fee Never sleeping on the floor now my jury box froze fuck up. Oh fuck a stone counted millions in the coke bad bitch Booted slow got a own bank row can't fold doesn't know head shot case clove
