weeks and now it's hot again but I was getting pissed because there's always a time of year where like you leave the house and like fucking shorts and you know tank top and then coming home here in the park oh yeah you know I was saying like that's how I've been for like the last week or so and then it's like back to the oven yeah it's I like it the other way which like works warm during the day and cool at night yeah that's cool now it's just hot all the time it was dropping like 60 I know like that's perfect that's cool a little chilly you know but uh but sweet man we'll uh let's make some people better today yeah and uh guys Andy question number one uh Andy I love what you say about surrounding yourself with winners uh who want everyone around them to win my question is how do I tell my employees about my new Lamborghini that is getting delivered tomorrow listen dude I will tell you a story about that okay this is so funny is there real question no that's a real question so here's a deal man um I owned a Lamborghini I worked my whole life all right I when I was eight years old I saw a white Lamborghini Cuntosh right then I became a car person and in my you know younger life I was always hustling dude I was selling baseball cards I was doing snow cones I was doing uh you know door-to-door light bulb sales like all this different shit to try and like I thought I was going to make enough money to get a Lambo right doing this stuff and uh I'm very thankful for it because it taught me a lot of things about you know selling and not to be afraid of people and things like that but um you know then I started my company and in 1999 as you guys know we started with literally $12,000 that we got from paying the stripes on parking lots which was our night job our overnight job um and our first day we sold literally uh seven dollars worth of product and then the next day we had zero and the next day we had $23 it took us eight months to have a day over $200 it took us almost six years to get our second retail store open my first ten years in business I made $58,380 total all right I could have made more of it working in McDonald's that entire time that's not 58 grand a year that's the total amount I made um my eleventh year I made six figures my 12th year I made seven figures and um you know obviously it kept progressing because I never stepped off I never let off the gas but I when I came time to get my first Lamborghini I had owned a couple cool cars I had a Aston Martin Vantage which was like kind of like um you know it was pretty beat up we call it a cheater car it's like one of those cars with a gazillion miles on it but it still looks cool on the outside Aston's always I started with that you know and I loved it dude I drove the shit out of it's a manual transmission um then I had a couple nine eleven turbo S's I had a couple R8s and then I bought my Lambo my Lambo was like a huge deal for me because like it was a fucking Lambo like that was my dream car that name is synonymous with success yeah bro it was a fucking Lamborghini I wanted a white Lamborghini dude and so I ended up buying a 2011 uh it was used but it was only a year old um Gaiardo Super Ligeria it was white and I owned that car for over a year before I ever told anybody that I owned it because of the same reason that you're talking about you're afraid that people are gonna get turned off and that they're gonna get pissed off and that they're going to you know say things you know little sneakers and it's gonna ruin your your thing and I have to tell you there will be people that get jealous and there will be people that get upset and there will be people that uh say those things but I will also tell you that it's a great weeding out of the people who will eventually be the bad eggs in your company anyway and the way I figured this out is I had a buddy of mine who also had cars and he had driven cool cars for a long time and I asked him I was I had the car for like a year and I said hey bro like do your employees ever get upset that you drive uh you know these cars and he was like he looked at me like dead serious in the face and he goes do you want any employees that don't want to be successful for themselves and I'm like damn dude that's it that is that is great yeah and um you know it just so happened like a couple days later I had was driving a Lamborghini out at uh I was at uh what's that stay house over there west county mall is it still there yeah that's uh that's uh jay Gilbert yeah yeah yeah we went to jay Gilbert's used to be a park on the curb there and um as I was coming out I saw a couple of my guys that worked for me and they flipped the fuck out like in a good way they were like bro that is so awesome blah blah blah blah and then that one guy now that guy who fucking saw me walking out of the mall is now a multi-millionaire in our organization and he's a franchisee of our company okay so um just for reference there yeah yeah I'm just letting you know like and yes there were people that were pissed and those people left and you know what you know what happened more people came in who thought that shit was cool and who want those things for themselves maybe they don't want a car maybe they don't want to you know the things I want but they want to be successful and they have their own dreams and goals and desires and life and they're willing to work for that and they're inspired by other people's success which creates amazing culture it creates a winning culture it creates a situation where people do root for each other and they're happy for each other um and you have to go through that tough part where people you know the wrong people don't like it so uh my advice to you is to understand that when you first step into that level of success because that's a high level of success as perceived by most people most people don't know someone who owns a Lamborghini they've never met someone who owns a Lamborghini um all my friends own cars you know what I'm saying right so it's a it's a different level once you get into that and yeah a lot of people are gonna snicker and a lot of people are gonna say comments and they're gonna say things like must be nice you know but like what I say to them I still say this I had a guy say that when I was driving my Bugatti up here at Wallis he like said must be nice I said yeah that's nice I worked my ass off for 25 years dude seven days a week what were you doing for the last 25 years besides eating breathing drinking and shitting yeah and he just looked at me like man do you know I mean it like that I'm like well dude maybe you should be conscious about how you say things to people because I paid a big price for the life that I have and um the point of the matter is is that I would personally look at it as an opportunity to weed out the people who do not have the mindset of growth success drive ambition that you are going to need to create a team to build what you're trying to build so yes you're going to have some pushback in the beginning but ultimately it's going to make you surrounded by winners like bro I'm surrounded by hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of highly ambitious winner type people that have goals and dreams and ambitions and come to work every day to build their lives um and there's nothing better than that man so so I'm just saying like yeah you're gonna have a little a little turbulence in the beginning but it's it's very worth the leveling up because it makes everybody else want to level up too I was about to say it's a massive ripple effect man and now I a quick question before I even get to that though I mean we're not saying like you got to take the fucking delivery at the fucking at your office no you know I was saying like it ain't got to be this big like showboat thing but you definitely shouldn't hide it no and also you know there's a way to present things in a wet like like dude you know if you look online there's people that are like uh fucking rolled up in my this and that and they talk all this shit and then there's people who like show their stuff and they're passionate about it and then they tell the story of how they got it and what they went through and that's what inspires people right like when people hear like that story I just told you like when I sit down and tell someone that you could see their their face like light up they're like damn dude yeah like is that real like you really worked for 10 years for 58 grand and then you went it happened I'm like yeah but you gotta remember in that time there wasn't really social media the way it is today that Ecom wasn't the way it is today so it's different now it doesn't take that long it takes years but it doesn't take 10 yeah uh but yeah man you know it's always uncomfortable when people say remarks but you know after a while you stop caring you know you you have to dude there's there's there's just levels of people out there and and it's the way it is we all want to say everybody's the same and everybody's equal and everybody thinks the same but they don't yeah and um I'll be honest dude I think when I look at my life for the last I don't know 15 years where I've driven all kinds of crazy cars and lived an amazing life there's much more inspiration that has come from that than hate yeah there's been a few people that are like like dude you know occasionally I'll get messages in my DMs I don't want to see your cars when I work my ass off all day it's like all right dude well then fucking unsubscribe I don't give a shit you know what I'm saying to fuck you that's how I think about it fucking look the other way if you don't want to see win and bro cuz I'm gonna continue to win and if I'm if me driving a car is gonna bother you you're gonna be really pissed off when I'm running around the fucking Europe and I'm fucking 300 foot boat right you know I'm saying like so I'm not stopping and the thing is is like if you know you should look at this as a way to weed out the fucking negative people around you and uh and uh and that's been my experience and they were replaced by people who aren't negative and who are excited I mean there's a number of got broke like when I walked through the office here when I do the number one question I get on a day of basis what you drive today what you drive today what you drive about say like every time we leave people coming out to fuck like it's employees and dude I take the guys for rides you know I let guys check them out like you know driving them and like it's cool that's needed too yeah it's needed I was gonna say this I mean like even just because it exposes them to it exactly that's what I'm saying like like so would you rather want you know an owner operator the CEO whatever whatever position you in would you rather you know want to have them pull up in a in a in a beater and then come tell you about you know all the goals and aspirations and shit we're gonna accomplish it's even the driving the fucking shit that doesn't work no that's not even a work no like bro your people are not gonna aspire to be better to grow a career to become successful if you're rolling up in a rusty piece of shit the only people that really respect that or people who are so close-minded that they think like well you know that that's he's being humbled like bro fuck humility okay humility is a very overblown concept that affects people in a very negative way because it makes them afraid to be successful and live the life that they actually want to live because this fake definition of humility that exists on the internet means you can't win you can't drive cool shit you can't live in a cool house you can't build the life you want otherwise you're not humble well guess what if that's what you think that I'm the least humble motherfucker on the earth but I must be somewhat humble because really when we think about humility it's about the ability to know that you aren't better than your competition and you're surely not better than that person you've just done different things through your life which have produced a different result and if that person over there did the same things that you have done like I have done for 25 years they would be successful too so it's it's humility is really saying it's not me it's the work I did and if that person did the work too they would be where I'm at and by the way they're capable of that I'm not better than them they're not better than me I've just taken different actions that's the the that's what real humility is about and to be successful on a high level you have to have humility because humility is how you learn if you think you know everything because you're not humble where do you have space to learn new things and if you're going to be successful over the course of time you have to continually get better so if you really want to be honest about it to be successful at the highest level you have to have a tremendous amount of humility because the truth of the matter is to be humble you have to be great you cannot be humble if you were not great it is an excuse for your lack of effort and greatness all right so if you go around town you say oh I'm just humble but you haven't accomplished anything you don't have any skills and you're not really good at anything you're not humble you're just suck it's the truth so so let's get real here being successful creates a tremendous amount of inspiration winning creates a tremendous amount of inspiration young people younger than you need to see that shit so that one day they could say damn dude I can do that too and that's the value of doing that so you don't have to rub it in anybody's face but I surely wouldn't hide it that's my experience drive that shit baby yeah I love it guys Andy question number two hey Andy I appreciate all the knowledge you drop on us on a daily basis when you receive advice that conflicts with what you've experienced how do you differentiate between your ego rejecting it and your competence guiding your response I try to stay mindful of receiving advice but if it's an area I'm knowledgeable in I tend to stand firm do you have a mental process to definitively determine whether it's your competence or ego at play I appreciate all you do yeah for sure look man the the most important thing to recognize is that everybody has advice like when you were having your babies did everybody has something to say about it everybody right everybody's telling you what to do even if their kids suck right so this is the same thing in life everybody has an opinion about how I do things everybody has an opinion about how I run my business everybody has an opinion about how we live our lives why don't you have kids blah blah blah blah blah blah blah bro I don't I don't listen to other people's opinion they can fucking mouth off and say whatever they want but the truth of the matter is I only take advice from people that I recognize are further down the road than me or are in a different area of expertise that are offering some advice that I may not understand their competency so we have to qualify who is giving us advice that we would even consider to take and that that amount of advice is very small okay so you need to eliminate all the chatter you need to eliminate all the Monday morning quarter back and you need to look at people's results of what they are producing before you even consider their advice so for example if someone came to me like Phil night from Nike and he said hey man you're doing good but you should do this and this and this I am absolutely going to consider what he's saying because he has built an iconic brand globally globally which is what I'm trying to do so I'm going to listen to that right now if a young person comes to me and they say hey man there's this technology that you're not using that's brand new and it could do this and this and this for you well I don't know much about that so I'm going to listen to that and I'm going to consider that but if someone doesn't have a track record or they don't have the life or the business or the you know family or any of the shit that I want I just let that shit roll off my back dude and I let him you know say what they want to say and if they push on me I just I'll say something smart ask to get him to shut up you know I'm saying yeah like I'll say you know it is what it is like I say that's you know that's a that's a pretty good thing for somebody who's never done shit right you know what I mean I know I know you think it sounds good but where would you say I'm a bank account says otherwise yeah where's your proof and I guess that's what I'm talking about here is we have to be able to pre-qualify who we take advice from and just because you are competent and this goes back into the question that we just answered just because you're competent in something doesn't mean that someone doesn't have more experience or more competency there are a lot of entrepreneurs who are 75 years old who are double my age who are much more experienced and have much better understanding of what I'm trying to do I've never run a company this size before I'm still figuring it out just like you guys are figuring it out at the beginning levels but I've gone from there to here so I could speak very very very confidently on anything behind what I've done right but when I'm moving forward I have to look at people who have done more done better built the things that I admire and take that advice to heart and if someone you know outside of that realm tells me shit I don't care you know what I mean so it's just by qualifying you know who's giving us who's giving the advice what have they done what have they built and then being humble enough to consider it and realize that these people might know better and then you know and then in other areas that you may not know right being able to say well I don't know anything about that let's listen to what this guy has to say you see what I'm saying and I had to get two or three yeah for sure you should let me actually this then so I mean like let's say feel night does come to you right and something that you have been doing really well that has been like the results are there that it's working he comes in like a Andy that how you're doing it here this that's actually pretty wrong if you're trying to move this way yeah how you handle that I would I would ask him why you know it's working no but see here there's a saying in business what got you here won't get you okay so I have to be aware of that just because I've gotten this far doesn't mean that what I've done to get this far is going to get me to where I'm trying to go so that that is an understanding that you will have if you've been in business for 25 years so you know I would I would shut my mouth and I'd say okay well why and he'd say because of this this this this this this and I'd say oh shit I never think about that that makes sense right and then I start to make some adjustments so it's all about um you know knowing who to listen to knowing when to listen being humble enough to accept the advice from the people that are qualified to give you the advice and then ignoring the rest of the stuff because like I said everybody's a Monday morning quarterback everybody knows how to run a you know a billion dollar brand right just fucking ask them everybody knows how to coach a football team everybody knows how to be a quarterback everybody knows how to raise a kid just ask them you see what I'm saying but but dude what's funny is is like all these people give all their advice on success and none of them are successful so when you look at someone and this is very important for you young people to really wrap your brain around if your parents are successful you shouldn't listen to them about success that's the facts okay if if your uncle has never done shit and he's a drunk and all he does is fuck his life away you shouldn't listen to him okay I've there are people my whole life that have been around me that probably care about me all right but they've told me back in the early days I was wasting my time when you're gonna get a real job when when you're gonna grow up and stop playing little vitamin shop and all this shit and now I look at him and I'm like none of you fuckers knew what you were talking about you just chirping in my ear you had done shit and we have to go through this phase of like becoming an adult where we sort of realize that all of our heroes are kind of full of shit you know what I'm talking about like sand is not real that's right yeah and some of the people that you thought were really good people and you love them are pretty bad at life pretty pretty good that's real man so like dude it's just part of growing up man and uh you young guys you you need to listen to people who have built things not people who just love you because those people will uh what happens is is you know like take parents parents are usually the biggest offenders of this biggest culprits for sure and I don't think they intentionally do it but it takes a lot of humility for a dad to want his son to go out and do something different than he's done if he feels like he's earned a decent place in life right let's say this guy is uh you know a laborer or a plumber or whatever right and he's become a successful plumber but you are ideas to go start a business and do all this stuff his framework of what success is is going to be his lived experience so when you say you want to do something outside of that they're going to naturally have resistance to that oh that's going to be really hard which is right oh that's you know that's not success like that isn't for people like us we need to go over here and do this right it's all kinds of limiting comments but the reality is that that's not because they're trying to sabotage you it's because that's all they know and you have to be aware enough to understand that when people say those things doesn't mean you have to be mad at them it doesn't mean you have to resent them doesn't mean you don't have to love them but it does mean you shouldn't listen to them when it comes to like what you're trying to do yeah I love it man that's time to go a little bit more on this because like a question is you know in your experience in your 25 years how many people how many entrepreneurs have you seen completely lose everything because they did not listen to the advice of people who refer to them the road I mean bro I've known quite a few yeah yeah I mean I've given a lot of advice to people and then they did the opposite and then they ruined their shit yeah so like is that ego what I mean what exactly is that play there what are the I mean yeah bro like I had a guy one time who I was further down the road he was in a similar line of business to me I said hey don't do this thing it doesn't work it's gonna hurt your company and I shouldn't even set it because he was a competitor mine but like I'm a pretty good dude and you know I'm not I'm not a liar I'm not a gatekeeper like if someone asked me for advice I'll tell them the truth there's no food at the table that's right yeah for sure and um I believe that too I truly believe that and I remember telling him and I said hey I said don't do that dude and the reason I was telling him not to do is because I had done it like seven years earlier and almost killed me and his response to me was doesn't matter what you say to me I'm not gonna change my mind I'm gonna do this and I'm like all right and it fucked his whole company up like real bad for a long time in fact they're still struggling from it so and that was like 2017 when I told him that so yeah it's cause big damage dude if you don't if you're not humble enough to listen yeah yeah that's super yeah fuck man guys Andy uh question number three uh hi Andy uh first off I want to say I'm a huge fan of your Q&A shows I've been a long time listener but this is my first time submitting a question um I've been working in the fitness industry for quite some time now and I've gradually worked my way up through various roles uh lately I've been noticing a trend on social media that really frustrates me I've seen a lot of people posting about the fear of being replaced in their roles by newcomers um expressing anxiety over the idea that they might become obsolete or overshadowed by the next new and approved person what bothers me even more is that these posts often come with disclaimers like I'm not saying this for validation uh but it seems clear that the underlying motivation is exactly that seeking reassurance and validations from others in my opinion these individuals are projecting their insecurities and are more focused on getting attention uh than on actually improving themselves in their craft whatever happened to just putting your head down focusing on your own journey and working hard without filling the needs of broadcast every insecurity uh feels like these kind of posts are more about saying hey everyone I'm still here than anything else what are your thoughts on this trend yeah I think that's a common theme amongst people in general not just in in the fitness space um I do agree with you I think people are trying to get validation almost everything they do I think we grow we have grown into this attention seeking validation seeking victim culture type culture uh amongst social media and I think we see it everywhere I don't think it's just in the fitness industry and I think what's what you're seeing here when people do this is you're seeing people who have refused to stay on top of their game and become the best at what they do make excuses in public for why they're not winning all right you are not deserving of winning you nobody owes you their business nobody you know uh nobody owes you I mean that's just the simplest way to say it and a lot of people think because they start a training program or they start some sort of online you know coaching thing that they are owed people's business especially the people that know them and uh you know let's say they're not at the top of their game they they don't have the experience they they don't have thousands of testimonials they're not keeping themselves in great shape they're not practicing what they preach they're mediocre at best and these people have trouble getting business so young people come along who are running as hard as they can they are representing fitness the proper way and this goes for any category not just fitness they are keeping themselves at the top of you know everything that they need to do their skill set their mindset their physicality their education and these older people getting beat by them and that's not that's not you know uh that's not anything other than natural order bro and it doesn't matter if you're older if you're young the best people are going to win and people know consumers know who the best people are so if you're not getting business it's because you probably have a big hole in your game or multiple holes in your game and you're not living to the standard that other people want to purchase from you to learn by right we see this in we see this in business coaching a lot we see all these people who don't have a real business they don't have a real company they haven't ever built anything you know they're they're out here trying to coach people on how to do life right that's the new thing it's not even just business it's life coaching yeah have a fucker you're gonna life coach someone when you don't even have a fucking winning life like if you want to be an entrepreneur coach you should be and will be a successful entrepreneur a business will come to you right like if I fucking started doing entrepreneurship coaching and said hey DM me I'd have fucking 50,000 motherfucking DMs you know why because I built a bunch of shit not just first form but a whole bunch of other shit and everybody knows it so you know you have to have the proof to do it and if you're gonna be a life coach or a fitness coach or a business coach you have to have the edifying end result that's going to prove it and a lot of people just don't and so that's what we end up getting we end up getting excuses that are projected out into these poor me captions or poor me posts uh and dude it's it's a relevant and it makes them look stupid and just like you said you know everybody sees it for what it is um yeah man I mean it's I don't really I don't really understand how people think they can coach people on things that they haven't done successfully and it seems to be an epidemic across many different industries on the internet you know everybody's a coach of something and not many of these people actually have done the things that they're coaching on have played in one that fucking game yeah that's weird dude I don't even understand like as a consumer like how you would buy that stuff you know I see people say oh this guy did this to me or this guy didn't provide this well dude you didn't even like look at the motherfucker to see if they were actually credible like you just bought their shit and you know they don't have the result that you're looking for and now you're in a position where you didn't get anything of it you know and this comes on the this comes from the consumer's mentality of you know quick easy fast pain free rub free um success which doesn't exist you know it's just it's hard to sell the other kind of success which is what I talk about which is years lots of skills lots of hard times lots of getting kicked in the dick like how do you sell that you know hey guess what guys I got this amazing program I'm gonna teach you how to be successful by the way it's gonna be the hardest thing you ever did you're gonna keep in the balls every single day it's gonna fucking suck for 10 years you're not gonna make any money for a long time but if you keep going you'll eventually get there how do you sell that versus hey uh 12 months ago I was in my mom's basement now I'm worth a hundred million dollars and my mom's in my basement right all these fucking lies so yeah you know there's a reality and then there's there's there's the internet yeah and they're not aligned let's talk about a little bit because you know you mentioned like I mean even the last question you mentioned this this this this point of like you know how you got here isn't how you're gonna get there and I feel like that translates to this question a little bit too it's like I'm I keep picturing this like you know the king of the jungle and these young cubs that are coming up and it's like you know at the end of the day if they don't the king of the jungle stops you know doing a shit and leading the hunts like those cubs get old they can start taking your own yeah but see dude here's the thing this is what this is what if you're a real entrepreneur this is what this is what you understand I get you get better as an entrepreneur as you get older you don't get worse and football you come out of college you kind of suck you get to be in your mid 20s you learn the game you get really good you're good for 10 years then you start getting bad because your body starts breaking down yeah an entrepreneurship it's the only game that you can really play from the time you're 18 till the time you're 80 where you continue to get better and better and better and better better if you keep going and going and going and going and going and going and the problem is a lot of these guys who are you know they get to be 40 or they get to be 50 they stop doing the things that are going to make them sharp they stop learning they stop working they give up on their fitness they give up on their mental state and because they stop other people pass them and then they get pissed off and it's like bro you you thought you were at the finish line the finish line is 40 years down the road you know what I'm saying so uh you know you got to play the game hard every day and it still comes down to the the concept that's very simple of winning the day if you win every single day no matter how old you are you're just going to accumulate accumulate accumulate accumulate accumulate skills which makes it harder and harder and harder and harder and harder for the young guy to catch you because the young guy and what they do is they get a little bit of skill a little bit of success and then they left their foot off the gas because this is the first time they ever had any money you take a guy who's made a whole bunch of money who's had 20 years in the game who shows up every day and whoops ask that guy's not getting beat you're not beating him you mind as well just be friends with them because so he can teach you shit right because you're not going to beat someone like that like bro someone fucking 20 years younger than me out of I mean there might be guys and he'll run like Mike Mark Zuckerberg okay but if you're in the same space and you're going after me and I'm fucking 25 years ahead of you bro don't don't even make me your enemy you know what I'm saying right because I step on your fucking face that's true yeah that's true that's real man guys I love it man and he guys that was three yeah I think I think it's important to to this last question to remember that you know victim culture and I know this isn't a victim culture question but victim culture has become so relevant and prevalent on the internet because it gets the most attention and what happens is and it feeds into what we're talking about here is that people make a vulnerable post or they make a post talking about how they're struggling and then that post ends up getting the most traffic of any post that they know right so what they do is they start to use victimhood or storytelling in a negative way or sympathy storytelling to become part of the brand because they realize that it increases engagement and then what happens is over the course of time you know they post that first one oh you know I'm really struggling it blub blub blub is my disclaimer though I'm not yeah right then they do it again tomorrow then they do it again next week then they do it again and they do that for a year now all the sudden that's their whole identity right and eventually people tune the fuck out they don't give a shit by the way just so you know people don't care okay they might make a post on your post and they might say oh man you'll get through it or stay strong or this or that don't give a fuck how many of those people showing up at your house when you say you're struggling none of them none of them how many of those people showing up to help you move none of them the sooner you start to realize that nobody gives a fuck about you the the freer you are to go forward and not feel bad about why nobody gives a fuck they don't give a fuck they're worried about themselves okay that's the reality and when we make these posts over and over and over and over again about how hard things are what do you think happens in our real life everything gets hard okay because we've created this identity of being a victim it's a self fulfilling prophecy that is created because we've chosen the identity we are going through a tough time we are doing it and all started because you wanted attention and then a year later you came and break out of it and you've got anxiety and depression and mental health issues and you got every fucking problem in the book that you really invented on yourself because you chose a fucking identity of being a victim and so it's very very dangerous to do that and I want you to realize that like when people do stuff like this it's I bet if you go read their other posts they're probably all poor me posts as well and dude just like in real life and every single one of you guys have been here every single one of you whether you want to admit it or whether you don't some of you may not want to admit it because you're a morally better person than everybody and you're on your high horse but the reality is what happens when there's four of you and one person is just complaining for an hour fucking straight every time you're around all these four people eventually when that person walks away what are the other three people say oh it's fucking so glad they're going bro fuck dude just stop calling that guy that guy sucks yeah okay that's what they say online about you too yeah you just don't see it okay so when you start complaining we realize like bro people don't like that and they're not going to be attracted to that it's not going to serve you and while it might give you some likes and some attention on the internet it's going to ruin your life okay and what you're seeing here is you're seeing people who have created these vulnerable victim culture identities who now instead of going out and becoming the best at what they do they feel entitled like they're supposed to have attention like people should feel sorry for them and buy their shit and that's just not how it works bro the best people win the best product wins the best service wins the most convenient wins and none of the other shit matters like people may say it does but it doesn't all right what really matters is how are you solving the customers problem are you the best at solving the customers problem it really doesn't have anything to do with like or dislike or someone replacing you someone's replacing you because you're not fucking good enough man that's the reality this shows called real a if it's not called bullshit okay you may have been good yeah you may have been good five years ago but you're not good now okay you're the result of your last one thousand days what'd you do for the last one thousand days oh you were good a thousand days ago and so you thought you had it made so you let off the gas you stopped doing the things that got you there you stop reading you stop eating right you stop training you stopped educating yourself you stopped associating with the right people you stop trying to purposefully network you stop trying and then the success went away and that's just how it works it's not it's not magical it's not personal it's just reality if you don't stay sharp and you get dull eventually someone's gonna pick up another knife that's how it works man I love it man and I love it man guys Andy that was three yep all right guys let's go have a good week we'll see you on CTI tomorrow
