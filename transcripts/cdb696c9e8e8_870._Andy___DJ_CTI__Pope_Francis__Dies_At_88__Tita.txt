What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realest say goodbye to the lives of thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today. And Andy and DJ who's the motherfucking. That's what we're going to do. That's what CTI stands for cruise the internet. That's where we put topics on the screen. Oh fuck you guys know what we do here. All right. Don't forget to share the show. You know, that's it. What's up? Hey, what's going on? Dude listen, this is a an interesting Monday morning. Oh is it? It was an interesting Monday. I got a lot of stuff for you. I got some some some some papacy going on. Some big giant boats sinking and Kanye West sucked his cousins dick. So that's what the show today. What? That's the show you guys took around here at all man, but yeah, that's the show. That's what we got. All right. Well, thanks for listening. Yeah, I mean, yeah. Yeah, that's. That's going on. Yeah, that's going on. Yeah, that's really what's happening today. It's a lot of crazy shit though, but yeah, how are you doing today before we do it? I'm fucking tired bro. Yeah, yeah, I'm tired. Dude, I've been, I don't know if it's I don't know if it's allergies, coal, I don't know, but I'm coming out of it now. Bro, that's what I've been I've been like on the verge of being sick and then the last two days I didn't I felt like shit. Yeah, today I feel better. Yeah, feel like I'm coming out of it to you. Dude, I think mostly. It's seasonal shit, man. Yeah. It's what it is. Like my truck's covered in fucking pollen. Like it's all of that. I mean, it's just crazy stuff, but it's it's all good. We're here and we're going to do some cruising. Yeah, we're going to do some cruising. Um, yeah, I guess first things up. Oh, we're starting 75 hard today. Yeah, yeah. You are too. Yeah, with a whole big group of people, okay? Um, who are doing it to finish on July 4th. Okay. Oh, that was pretty cool. You know, it's pretty representative of what the solution actually is to fixing what's going on in the country. You know, become the best possible version of our individual selves, which then if enough people participate, we have collective value systems that raise the tide of the culture of this country. Yeah, that's the solution. So I thought that was pretty cool that a lot of people put that together on their own to finish by. Yeah, I thought that was cool. Anyway, we got me, I guess to kick us off before any of our major topics of discussion. Pope died today. Who? The Pope? Who? Yeah. Yeah, the Pope. Pope Francis is the first pontiff from the Americas, dad and 88. Now this is Easter Monday, um, to those who are religious. It's, you know, it's, it's kind of like a, you know, the wrapping up of a very important week in Christian religion. Um, yeah, Pope Francis, he died this morning, um, just one day after each, Easter Sunday, um, 735 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis returned to the home of the father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and his church, um, which is interesting because they actually say that he's probably one of the most damaging. Yeah, Pope's we've had. I don't know. I'm not Catholic. I mean, it didn't really mean much for me. I know, um, a lot of Catholics out there, you know, this is important. Well, he's a globalist figurehead, dude. 100% real. Yeah. 100%. Yeah. I mean, that's it. They, they infiltrated the church. The church does not represent what it used to represent. Sorry if that makes you feel a certain way. It doesn't make your faith diminished. It doesn't mean that your church is diminished. But what it does mean is that the leadership of any organization is always susceptible to corruption because of the correct relationships that that level of recognition and prestige brings and power. That's right. Empower 100% and like I mean, dude, it's not just you saying this is that it's funny, um, because there's actually an archbishop, um, archbishop, Carlo Maria, Vigano. He had something to talk about. He will have to quote, he will have to account for the crimes he has committed. That's right. So this is an archbishop. Um, and he was always a frequent critic of hope, um, and the globalist movement and the globalist shit they've done for the last five years, especially specifically. I mean, like, I mean, he jumped in on, he talked about, uh, archbishop, Vigano stood up against the destruction of the church, COVID mandates that crushed an individual rights world wide, stolen elections. He called out the Pope for his destructive actions against the church and others like, uh, support for the world economic form. Um, for this, he was excommunicated from the Holy Catholic church for she is him back in July of last year. Um, and he put out a very interesting tweet. This is, so this is, uh, archbishop, Vigano here. This is a picture of him and he put out this tweet this morning. Um, just, just kind of laying it all out and, uh, it's interesting. It's interesting. Okay. Um, now the, it appears to be that the globalist, uh, platform and foundation is crumbling just a little bit. Uh-huh. Also the same day, um, the official resignation came in from, uh, from Davos from, from Klaus Schwab. Yeah. Um, and he's out. Yeah. I know he announced it a couple of weeks ago and I think we covered it, but they didn't, they didn't put an actual date on it. And the same day that a pope, a globalist Pope dies. Klaus officially resigns cold turkey. Do you know how old the Pope was? Who's the 88? Yeah. Do you know how old Klaus Schwab is 88? Do you know what 88 stands for in biblical theory? Devil? I don't know. I mean, we got Google right there in front of your face. The reference to the Psalm 88. Let me see. I tried that to guide in the face of overwhelming suffering. Consider one of the saddest Psalms in the Bible and explores the themes of alienation, darkness and the struggle to find hope in the midst of despair. Yeah, it also represents renewed energy and rebirth and freshness. That's so crazy. Yeah. Well, that's so, Andy, that's so crazy you brought that up, right? So I was doing some digging on this. I didn't know that. I had no idea. I did not know that. But it's interesting you brought that up because what also just came out was this manuscript that they're calling a prophetic manuscript came out. Apparently it was like in the secret archives of the Vatican, right? And it lays out a bunch of different things. Lineages, the next popes that come in order, things like that, right? And this document, it contains a series of cryptic Latin phrases each believe to describe a Pope starting with Celeste II in 1143 and ending with Peter the Roman. In 2027. Now the importance of this is that it's supposed to line out the second coming of Jesus Christ, right? And it says, you know, according to this manuscript that the next Pope will be named Peter after Jorge here, right? And it's so interesting is that right now there's like nine front rudders for the next Pope. Three of them are named Peter. Well, it just got down to a final two, final two popes. And Cardinal Peter Terksen and Cardinal Lewis and Tony O'Tagley, they are now the top two for selection for the Pope. So I mean, like there is some weird, weird stuff going on, dude. I don't know. It's just, it's weird to me, man. Like that, that is, I mean, I don't think you can call that a coincidence, but it is, it is, it is creepy to me. Where how, what do you, how do you take that? I mean, that's why it's important to be a good person and to live a life and alignment with your faith all the time and not just some of the time. Not just, yes, not just on Easter and not just on Sundays and not just, I'm not saying you have to be, because Lord knows I'm not a perfect individual by anyone's, but I'm very aware of the presence of God in my life 24 seven. And you know, it seems like people think that God is only in your life sometimes. Like when you go to church and post a picture or when you pray or when you, yeah, you know, I'm saying do a good deed or do a bad deed. And the reality is, is God is ever present in your life. And if you have real faith, you, if you have real faith, you really can't be afraid of what's going to happen or death. You know, and people ask me a lot, you know, about how, how do I find the way? Find the courage to speak on the things that I speak about without any fear. Well, it's because I have unshakable faith and that's real shit, you know what I mean? So I don't, I don't fear death. I don't fear persecution. I don't fear shit like that. And I think that if people were really honest with themselves, you know, if you're getting upset because you think that the second coming is coming in two years or you're freaked out about what's going on in the world beyond, you know, observing and trying to do your best to fix it. It's probably because your faith is fucked up. You know what I'm saying? You probably don't really believe what you say you believe. Yeah. Probably got to get right. I mean, who knows, dude? I mean, look, man, we don't look, it's very hard for me to know or have. In opinion, because we've been lied to about so much, it's hard to know where the lies begin and end. Okay, but here's what I do know. I know that being a good person gets you a lot farther than being a piece of shit. I know that people need help. I know people need kindness. I know people need leadership and people need an example. And I think at the end of the day, because we've been lied to about so much, all we can do is live the best that we can, hoping that enough people will live that to where we can expose the lies and turn the corruption inside out for everybody to see. One of that happens or not is going to come down to how many people decide that they want to live the standard of being that kind of a person all the time. Yeah, well said, brother. Yeah, I mean, I just think it's hard for me to, like when you say, well, what do I think? I don't know. I guess what I'm saying is I don't know what to think because I don't know how much of the lies, how much of all this is lies and how much is true and how much is being lied about to cover certain truths up. And you know, my, from doing this show that we do for the last five years, I'm a completely different person mentally than I was then from the aspect of not trusting the narrative at all. And when I saw the narrative, it's almost in like rebellion almost just a little bit. It's not, yeah, it is that because that's needed because we have a bunch of corrupt people who are taking advantage of the everyday people. And that's not right. But you know, look, man, this is just the truth. Like I'm such a regular normal like fuck up of a person. And I've been able to visualize and create so much of my life that I really shouldn't have been able to do, which creates a level of belief in my, in what is out there that like you couldn't shake that for me. You know what I'm saying? Because I've lived it. And this is also why I believe that everybody else has the same potential because I know that there's nothing inherently special about me. Have I developed some good skills for sure, but it's been 25 years. So if you stick with something for 25 years and we're good at it, no matter what it is, you stick to good battle and different. So, so when I start to think about all these things and I observe my life and I observe what's happening in culture and what's happening with history because I personally believe that a lot of the history that we've been told is not only the lie, I think a lot of it is completely backwards. And two of the things that I've become more certain of as we cover these events unfolding is one, we are not told the truth about our human capabilities at all, meaning the ability to think and visualize and create with our minds into physical reality. That is a real, that is a real thing that I think is the most powerful thing that we have as human beings. And I think they do everything they can to keep us from discovering that we have that power because if we knew that we have that power, they wouldn't be able to control us the way that they control us. And number two, you know, I think they lie very consistently across the board about the existence of Jesus Christ and the historical truth and literal truth that exists around that figure. And the more I observe this, the more the conclusion is for me that this really is like, you know, a very serious form of slavery and deception by people like this, you know, I think the human condition lends itself to corruption. I think there's very few people over the course of history who have been able to gain power and maintain the purity of the reason for having the power. And I think that, you know, I think that no matter what is going on, we need to work as human beings to restore that. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. 100%. Up in on this conversation, let us know what you guys think. And I'm sure by the time the show airs, the new Pope will be announced. So I mean, we'll see if that I'm pretty sure it's going to be the Peter guy. Yeah. Yeah. Viva Lapepe. Yeah. And then what they say, yep, that's what they say. Viva Lapepe. Viva Lapepe. Yeah. I've heard it. I heard it so many times already just today. That's what they say. All right. Yeah, guys, let us know, man, with that big set, let's get into our main stories. Remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for Sella.com. You guys can check them all out right there. And with that being said, our first set of headlines. Come on number one, let's, let's go to the White House. Interesting things shaking up there real quick. Carolyn Levitt. She goes off on a Democrat for taxpayer funded trip to support deported suspected MS-13 gang member. So this is an interesting story that's been developing. Obviously, the immigration, these illegal aliens that are not supposed to be in this country we've been talking about. There's quite a bit. And you know, it never fails. You got some people over there on the communist side that, you know, they just throw shit in their face that's like, I don't understand how anybody has not like seriously. I don't understand people can even still hold on to that side to be real. And this story should shake it up. Send it to one of your buddies that are the drink, White clothes. I don't think that many people are still on the side. I think that's an illusion. I mean, if we look at the ratings of the news networks that are broadcasting this, they are terrible. The protesters, we've already proven a number of times on this show that they are led by NGOs that you're paid for by our tax dollars. So I actually don't think that there's very many people hanging on to this anymore. I think it's just an illusion so that they don't completely crumble. That's possible. I mean, but this story here is, I mean, it's crazy. So yeah, White House Press Secretary Carolyn Levitt blasted in Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Holland on Monday after he admitted that his trip to El Salvador to meet a deported illegal immigrant was paid for by taxpayers. So this guy, Kilmore, a break-o Garcia, right? We talked about him a few times. He's in El Salvador right now and C-Sop. And this this Senator from Maryland, when you know, the president came here last week to meet with Trump, said, oh, I want to go meet with the president. I want to go make sure that this, you know, the illegal lead deported migrant is okay and safe, right? And president wouldn't meet with him. So he then flew to El Salvador to try to like, you know, I guess play his cards there. It didn't work out for him. President said, no, you need to go through your chain of command. And yeah, now he's getting called out for it. Let's check this clip out. I guess it's true what they say. Where do they say it? That black people can't use a computer. Okay. Yeah, fuck. I thought it was a lie. I was sticking up with you guys. This shit is not even playing. It's not playing anywhere. World, Z-Shot, we're over here defending these motherfuckers. It's not me. It's not. It's not fucking tension. You saw what the button was doing. Fuck off. It's, I pressed the button. It's still not fucking playing. Yeah, show him how they're white boy. Yeah. Don't pull up my history. Don't pull up my ears. Here's a clip. Okay. All right. Your computer is racist. Bro, listen, it does not want me to win right now. Yeah. It's trying to get me fired. Yeah. Racist. Just play it from the inside. It's conspiring. Yeah. It's conspiring against you. He is an illegal alien, a foreign terrorist, and a criminal MS-13 gang member who violated our country's laws by coming here in the first place. And shame on Senator Chris Van Hollen and the entire Democrat party who wasted Easter Sunday going on every television show in the country to advocate for the return of an illegal criminal gang member. There is a litany of evidence proving this individual's ties to MS-13 that has been confirmed in two different courts. There have been multiple law enforcement officers who have affirmed his MS-13 gang affiliation. And this is who the Democrat party is advocating for. It is ridiculous. The president, this White House, the entire administration will continue to focus on deporting these illegal alien gang members and criminals from our nation's interior and enforcing our country's immigration laws. That's what the president was reelected to do. And I would add that the overwhelming majority of Americans continue to support the deportation of illegal criminals. A recent CBS poll showed that 89% of the American people support deporting illegal criminals from our homeland. So the president will continue to do that while Democrats continue to trip over themselves while ignoring American citizens whose lives have been forever impacted by the actions and the crimes of these illegal criminals like Patty Moran, who we were so honored to have at the White House to share her daughter's story just last week. Senator Van Holland has never called her, has never reached out to her family, yet he has spent hours now, uh, uh, uh, uh, falling over this illegal alien who was tied to a vicious gang that has taken the lives of American citizens. Oh, it's just unbelievable. Yeah. So this dude, uh, the woman she brought up, uh, Patty Moran, her daughter Rachel Moran was jogging in Maryland right outside of Baltimore and was, uh, attacked, raped and murdered, uh, by a legal migrant who has highest MS-13, who's also been already convicted and going through the court process and that. Um, but the senator who's from Maryland, never called the family, sent condoms, there's nothing but he's over here spending taxpayer dollars concerned about the migrants who were doing the shit. You know, it's, it's, it's sick. It's so sick. And his response about the fucking trip, uh, he said on, uh, Van Holland defended his trip to El Salvador as being paid for by taxpayers like other congressional trips, referencing recent visits to El Salvador, megaprism, sea sought by a group of Republican legislators and Homeland Security Secretary, Christie Nolan. Um, he, uh, responded to the criticism from Moran, finally saying, quote, my heart goes out to every Maryland family that is the victim of violence, regardless of the perpetrator. And that is why I am very glad that a court of law has convicted her killer. That is where we litigate the issues, he said. That's, uh, that's what he, what he gave the, gave the family. I mean, look, man, you know, number one, Caroline, when are you guys going to actually start deporting some meaningful numbers of people? Okay, you guys aren't doing what the fuck you're elected to do. Let's be honest. Okay. Are you doing some of it? Yeah. Are people wanting that change to happen immediately? Yeah, we didn't want this to happen over four years. We wanted you to round up all these people, whatever the fuck that means and whatever it takes and get them to fuck out of here. However it looks, we don't care. Okay. Okay. That's number one. And I'm sure if you asked that woman's, uh, who was murdered family, they would agree. And I think if you said to the 89% of people who were represented in that CBS poll that she mentioned, if you were to say, would you support a mass roundup of illegal migrants and hold them in temporary, holding areas or whatever they had to do to get them to fuck out of here? We might lose 15, 20% of the people because they couldn't stomach the method, maybe, but at the end of the day, Caroline, we are wanting to change immediately. You know, these things that Trump mentioned, uh, removing these people, getting crime back in order, uh, punishing people properly for violent crime. The tax situation, like dude, listen, stop pussyfoot and around, bro. Come in with your fucking hammer and fucking swing it. That's what you were elected to do. Okay. And if I have any problem with the Trump administration, it's this nobody's been arrested. Nobody's been held accountable. Nobody is even really talking about it anymore. Y'all fucking talk big shit when we, when it was time to vote, but here you are trying to play business as usual. Okay. And let me tell you something. We don't want you to play business as usual because we recognize that the other side is so far fucking gone that if they were to get power back again, they will try to kill their opposition because guess what? A lot of us can read history. All right. So let's just start there. All right. Trump and the administration and Caroline and all you people talking about all these, you know, amazing things that are happening. You need to step at the fuck up because dude, the base. Yeah, there's people that are looking at Trump and they're happy right now, but the base, the people who really want the change, I mean, to me, it's all, you guys are razzled dazzling and shit. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And like you saw the shit they did with COVID with the COVID website. Yeah. You guys put on the fucking code on the lab league theory, the true origins of COVID-19. Like you somehow discovered oxygen. Yeah. Okay. Stay in this for five fucking years. We begin to ask his beat for it. Hear nothing from you guys. Okay. There's been no accountability. Fouchies running around doing all kinds of stuff. All these people are still doing what it is and the only conclusion that a logical, intelligent human being can come to is one, you're preparing for the arrests, which if you are, you should be letting people know, I think. Number two, you're in on it and you're not going to do shit. You're going to post this post on the White House and say, oh, yeah, they actually was a lab league and blah, blah, blah, and you're going to act like that's some sort of account. That's not accountability. That's not people being removed from this earth who caused misery and pain and suffering for profit. Okay. That's not, that's, that's what we want. We want that. Okay. What's happening? So if I'm being completely honest, this motherfucker spending money to fly to El Salvador for, like, I don't really fucking care. I know it's stupid. He's stupid. They're stupid. And we're stupid for watching them do this and say, I can't believe they're doing it. What do you mean you can't believe they're doing it? They've been doing it. They don't care about you. They don't care about your family. They don't care about your ability to progress in society. They care about the criminals because the criminals create the disruption that they get to run on to potentially fix, which means funding in their own pocket. That's the reality. They do not fucking give a shit about the average American. And in fact, they want to and intentionally make the shit harder for the average American so that they can get funding, which makes everything comes back to them getting rich. Okay. And that's where we're at. So quit saying you can't believe it. Quit saying, listen, you see the media all come out and try to like defend this kid down here in Texas that stabs this other kid right in the fucking heart and say, it's not a hate crime. And we don't listen, motherfucker. This happens every fucking day. Y'all don't report it because it's against the narrative. You only report it when the black person's the victim so that we can create more racial divide and more arguments and more separation so that, you know, the white people and the black people are out in the world screaming at each other yelling at each other, resenting each other so that they can continue to do this shit that they're doing that we're describing right here. Okay. Until people get smart and realize, instead of saying, I can't believe this is happening, actually view it for what it is. It's not an accident. They're not stupid. It's not a mistake. Do you, oh, you think Joe Biden came in for four years and let 20 million illegal migrants across the border because it was because he's fucking old and see now, bro. Right. Right. Right. Right. Rest reality. Our government has been infiltrated by forces that do not have the American people's interest at heart and mind and, in fact, even worse than not having the interest in their heart or their mind, they are actually incentivized heavily, financially and also with power to make the life of the average American citizen as hard as possible. If that means allowing migrants to commit crime and violence to happen in neighborhoods and people to be raped and killed and tortured and harassed. That's what a fucking means. That's what it takes. And they want that. They don't not want that. So when we look at this guy going to El Salvador, you shouldn't look at it as this is a misaligned heart. And he actually just care, no, that is not it. He wants these guys here so that they will commit crime so that they can come back in four years and regain power and get the funding to do whatever the fuck they want. That is it. Like dude, nothing irritates me more than people that continue to say, okay, believe this is happening. Can you believe they did this? What the fuck man? Believe it and handle your shit in your own neighborhood. Okay, no one's gonna handle the shit in your neighborhood. You and the other men who are living your neighborhood need to stand the fuck up and quit tolerating shit. And until that happens, and I'm not talking about white man or black man, I'm talking about men, right? Who could look around and say, hey, fuck dude, it's not this black guy's fault. It's not this white guy's fault. It's their fault. And we need to stop arguing with each other and start realizing who's making our lives difficult. And until that happens, bro, nothing's gonna change. Yeah, that's real. I also saw a lot of people like getting spun up about this Supreme Court decision that just came down to, and it wasn't really even a decision. But all of this, even just a deportation, itself, right? Like getting all these people out of the country, it's all been around like the legalities of it. It's all legal. Like they're all lawyers that like to fucking, you know, have their law fair going on. And so if this reached all the way up to the Supreme Court, and they just put out a temporary injunction, temporary block to halt all of the deportations and shit, just so they could review it and put their opinions and two cents in on it. But I've seen people take this and spin it. Like, oh, see, the Supreme Court says, Donald Trump's bad and wrong. It's like, that's not what it was. Everybody just has to, you know, has to relax. But I think that's the element, and you know, that like gets left out. But it's like to your point though, it's like I could also, I could also see the argument just like, I don't care what a judge says. I don't care what we're doing this for the betterment of the people. Look, bro, and listen, it has to happen. This is the reality. And nobody wants to say this, but this is just the truth. We have an opportunity right now. We have a president who could clean this up. Okay. Now whether he does or not, I don't know. But he better figure out how to clean it all the way up in the next fucking four years. Because if there is one inch of this communist shit left, it will regrow and reappe- it's no different than fucking cancer. You gotta cut it all the fuck out, okay? That's what the common American citizen should be expecting is to remove all foreign influence, to remove every single bit of outside corruption, no matter who it comes from, to restore the sovereignty of our country and our own self-reliance on this amazing piece of land that we get to call the United States of America. And if we don't have someone that cleans all that up, we are eventually going to lose it to communist forces. Because here's the thing. One side, the good side, they just want to be left to fuck alone. Right? Like I just want to be left alone. I don't want to be fucked with. I don't want to be forced to do anything. I don't want to be yelled at blah, blah, blah, right? That's been our attitude for the last 40 years. I'm going to pursue the America dream and those people are fucking crazy. That's not their agenda. Their agenda is to conquer you. So if you have two groups of people, one of them is to be left alone. And the other one is to take all the rights away from those people and conquer them and make them subsurban. Who's going to win that fight? The people on fucking offense. The people who have a desire to take from ironically what are the producers of this country and make it theirs? And that's happened over and over and over again in history. And it always ends when these people get in power with some sort of genocide of the opposite side. So what I'm actually saying here and what people need to realize is that if you don't stand up and you don't put pressure on Trump to clean this shit all the way out, we will end up with a communist system maybe five years, 10 years, 20 years down the road where all the traditional quote unquote, freedom loving, et cetera, Americans are actually wiped the fuck out. That's what will happen. That's what happened in history, okay? Or you know, it's crazy to, and you have said this before quite a few times on the show, but I'm actually still what, let me say one more thing. So my point to this rant or whatever you want to say is that if Trump doesn't do it, it still has to be done. Well, that's what I was just getting to. That's why I brought this and I was just, yeah, I was about to say you said it a few times and I'm actually starting to see this like pick up a whole lot on social media now. But people saying like if Trump doesn't fix this, we will have a dictator that is going to fucking demolish all of it. Yeah, I'll be me. I fucking do it. Motherfucker, I will come in there. You guys don't understand. You don't understand. Because it'd be way worse. I would come in there and clean this shit up in literally one year and we would be done. And I would go the fuck away. You never even hear from me again. I just want to be left. I'm in the group of leave me the fuck alone. Okay, so have you been seeing that though, pick up? Like I've been talking a lot of people talk about it. Yeah, I looked in. Yeah. Sometimes to restore a democratic process, you need a dictator for a short amount of time. That's going to say fuck you, fuck your shit. Oh, you're going to stand in the way of me deporting illegal fucking criminals out of this country. Well, guess what? You're going to fucking deportation with them. If you want, you know what I'm saying? That's what I'm saying. Yeah, I mean, like, look, dude, it just does. And we're rapidly approaching. And why I say rapidly, I mean in a few years, a situation where we as a culture and a citizen is going to have to make a decision of how important our freedoms and our ideals and what we think America's supposed to represent actually is to us. That's reality because unless Trump would have the support of people to do this, but he's for whatever reason, hold the card. I don't know. I don't know. Listen, and I'm not saying Trump's a smart dude. He knows way more than we know. So maybe there's a process to this. I don't know, but I know this, man. I want to see some fucking accountability. You know, I want to see these people who have been lying and cheating and stealing and robbing and causing disruption for their own benefit. I want to see these people held accountable. That's what I want. And we're going to get it one way or another. That's the truth. Because there's a lot of people that fucking agree with what I'm saying. And if Trump doesn't do it, you think those people are just going to go away? They're fucking not. Right? No, man. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us go down in the comments. What you guys think? Let me say, let's go check out some of these comments. Yeah. Let's go cruise. Let's go cruise the comments here. So I got, I'm getting some heat for what? Apparently being gay. Apparently being gay. This first comment from Kevin Lewis, 91, 51, why would you want to go that fast? You may need to fire DJ for being gay. Well, I don't know that it's legal to fire people for that. Yeah. Right? You're right. Yeah. What? Yeah. I can just fire because I don't like you, though. I mean, that's something I definitely can do. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Wasn't the only one. Contraband blade works says DJ asking why you would want to car that fast is the most cut, un-American question ever. That's like saying, why do you need that many bullets in your gun or why do you need such a big blank? Love you guys in the show. No hope for show. Why do you need such a big blank? Big dick, maybe. Why do you need such a big fill in the blank Andy? What would it be? Why do you need such a big? I don't know. Why don't you guys let me know what you think? What's the blank? Yeah. What's up blank me? Why do you even need such a big credit score? There you go. That's probably good. That's probably good. Yeah. Or income. The last one, dude, I think we got to we got to send this guy something. This is probably one of the best comments I've seen in a long time. This comment comes from so you wrote it to yourself. Yeah, but no, yeah, basically. No, I'm do this is pretty fucking good. This is like we got I can't deserve the trophy for sure. I wish this was me. Tuck 360 says if spending 11 minutes in space makes you an astronaut, then I'm a gynecologist. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. The logic, the logic computes. Same same. Yeah, same same. I agree. Yeah, man. Thank you doctor. Thank you, doctor. Thank you, doctor. Thank you, doctor Tuck. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, guys, we appreciate you, man. Talk about a job that you wouldn't want to have. What? An astronaut? No. Well, you're in there trying to look at all the female shit they got going on in there all the time. Where that ruin your whole. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true. They got me. We're going to complex me. They got a lot of stuff down there. Yeah, I don't want to know about it. Yeah, nothing. I mean, I want to know about it, but not like that. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I do know what you're saying, DJ. What are you saying? What are you saying? I like fast cars. Yeah, I'm saying. I do want to know about it. You fucking thought the clip was the butthole. I thought the fuck up. Yeah, I did. Yeah, you did. All right, maybe a little bit. All right, guys, we do appreciate you for being real ass fans, man. Thank you, guys. With that, let me say let's get back to the cruise. All right. It's all in headline two. Titanic. Okay, we got to do a deep dive here. No pun intended. No pen. Yeah. I want to carbon fiber submarine with a Nintendo control. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. Right. But there are some new things that are happening. New things are to coming out almost, you know, over a hundred years later, about the Titanic. And I thought we take the time to really to really look into this into the conspiracy behind the Titanic. You mean how they fucking killed some of the most powerful families in the world because they wouldn't go with the Federal Reserve? Yeah, we're going to talk about that. We're going to dive into that. All right, we're going to lay it out for the people. Okay, lay it out. Yeah. Okay, and then you guys can tell us what you guys think. But I mean, we're lay it out. But before we even can lay it out, like I said, there's some new updates that have come out about the Titanic. Okay, I don't know if you've seen this, but there's a new book. It's a book that reveals chilling accounts of Titanic Captain's last moments on sinking shit. What they do, fucking interview him. Well, so let's dive into it. He claimed that they were telling a Titanic lie while Titanic Captain Edward John Smith's official cause of death remains one of history's enduring mysteries. Arthur Dan E. Parks has thrown cold water on theories that he took his own life, claiming these rumors unfairly tarnished his legacy. So apparently there has been witness reports from the ship that said that the captain committed suicide before it sank before it even struck this alleged. They hit the hit a fucking iceberg. Oh, really? They're saying he popped himself before they hit the ice before they hit the iceberg. Okay. And like it's like witness accounts like heard the gunshot. Like it was not like it was not like, you know, like people knew it. A lot of people knew it. And so, you know, this guy Danny Perk, he's trying to, you know, squash these theories and rumors. And he made bombshell claims in the book, Titanic legacy, the captain, the daughter and the spy, which details eyewitness accounts from shipwreck survivors who discuss among other things how Captain Smith met his end over 1500 people died when the RMS Titanic sank on April 14th through 15th and 1912, following its fateful collision with an iceberg. Now apparently a lot of people, a lot of the dead were never recovered. They're saying about 337 was the most bodies that were ever actually pulled from the wreck. And it gets really, really interesting. But yeah, so apparently a lot of people saw it. And there was one, even the Los Angeles Express at the time saying, you know, wrote an article saying that the captain, E.J. Smith shot himself. Another report from UK's Daily Mirror. This is all when it happened. So I'm talking over a hundred years ago and I had no idea about any of this, but Captain Smith shoots himself on the bridge. And a lot of people were saying it. Like I mean, there was like people was all, we heard gunfire before or gunshot before it before the crash. And they were saying that all these like controversial reports, it was, you know, smearing Smith's representation, a reputation. But yeah, apparently he had an appetite for booze. He was piloting the Titanic at an unsafe speed and he ignored warnings about the iceberg, possible because he was drunk. But yeah, I mean, it was just, it was so weird. And then you had a, of course, you had other people saying, although they saw the captain go down with the ship, they saw him, you know, I don't know. But either way, whether that's true or false, let's dive into what we believe we know about the Titanic in a circumstance. So I asked chat GP, GPT to hop in on this and it laid out some things. Things I didn't know, things I had to check, things I had to verify. But I thought this was interesting. So JP Morgan, okay, he's an American banker. He was massively influential. He financed the Titanic's parent company, the international market till Marine, IMM. And he, these are facts. These are, these are undisputed historical facts, okay? He canceled his trip on the Titanic at the very last minute and we say very last minute. He had luggage that was loaded onto the Titanic. Okay. He had a full suite that was supposed to be dedicated to him. He had his, or he brought furniture in, all of these things. And JP Morgan was a known advocate of centralized banking and he would have benefited directly from the federal reserves. He wasn't an advocate. He was one of the family, he was representing one of the families that came up with the whole fucking idea, the whole plan. Yeah, the whole plan. Now there was some major opponents, at least as the conspiracy theory goes, that were completely against it. John Jacob Astor, he was one of the richest men in the world at the time. Benjamin Guggenheim, he was a mining magnet and Isador Strauss who was the co-owner of Macy's. He was also a former congressman. So the conspiracy theory goes, this is the logic of it, right? Is that JP Morgan, he knew the ship was doomed. I don't necessarily, I mean, I guess you could believe that if, you know, he knows he's not going to be on there. He knows something's going to happen. So whether it be iceberg, a design flaw, some type of intentional sabotage, he knew something was up. He stayed off the ship, citing some very vague reasons. Again, he had luggage already boarded on the fucking ship. And then Astor Guggenheim and Strauss was supposedly opposed to central banking, right? And then their deaths, because they died, there was very little resistance and the Federal Reserve was created less than a year later. And so it's, it's, it's interesting. I don't have a little bit more. So JP Morgan and Co, they also owned and found it and controlled US steel. GE general electric, he had immense control of the financial world, right? Now, you got to go back even a couple of years before that. There was a bank run in 1907, right? And that was the whole argument of like creating the centralized bank was so there were no more bank runs and they couldn't do that. And that was, that was his whole thing, but like even looking at the timeline of how everything. So 1907, there's the financial panic, Morgan, JP Morgan bailed out Wall Street personally when that happened. Reinforcing his representation and reputation as the de facto central banker. Then a bunch of debates over the next four years, Titanic sinks with all opposition. And then what your role, soon gets selected that same year, central brings created the year later. Now, it's so interesting because one of the things I pushed on chat, GBT, I'm like, well, like, did JP Morgan like benefit from those families dying outside of the, you know, federal reserve being created? And at first, it was like, oh, now there was no, there's no evidence of it directly, you know, benefiting or anything like that. And I'm like, oh, let's do some independent research. JP Morgan, Chase, today, they control all of Macy's marketplace and e-commerce system and payment systems. They have a large share of that. Aster who also created the World Earth Historia and St. Regis, which have now been combined into Marriott, right? And trouble by Marriott. You know, JP Morgan, Chase, top institutional investor in Marriott International. There's there. And then the Guggenheim guy, the minor guy, right? Big gold and all of that stuff, that company sold to Asarco, Incorporated, which is the American smelting and refining company. And JP Morgan, Chase, came in in 2008, built them out of bankruptcy and they had a long history of interacting financially in that company as well. So even today, there's still effects and benefits that JP Morgan, the company itself had and all three of those enterprises. I don't know, man. We mean, oh no. It kind of, I mean, it all lines up. No shit. It's not a conspiracy. These are factual events to happen. It's all factual. Yeah. And I think that's the thing. It's like when you look at the dots by themselves, like they're just dots, right? JP Morgan, they do a lot. Most people don't even know what the Federal Reserve is. They don't, they think it's a government bank. They don't understand. It's a private fucking bank, right? Like they, listen. It's a good place to start on why we are here, where we are now, and why the narrative of history has been the narrative of history. Okay? Because here's the reality. Everybody who stood up against it has been fucking killed and made to be a massive fucking villain. That's the truth. Like you mean globally? Yeah. And since this happened, ever since this happened, it doesn't matter. It's not just the US. It's everywhere. Yeah. I mean, what's the thing about like all the top, like a lot of top world leaders? Who were like killed, who assassinated, like they were all in opposition to like central banking, like Omar Gadot. Yeah. Of course, Saddam Hussein. I mean, wouldn't there another one? Yeah. Hitler. Eight off Hitler. Yeah. Like they were all against the, listen, there's more than that. There's a whole bunch that anybody who's ever stood up against the Federal Reserve or wanted to return to the gold standard, the proper way, has been fucking killed. And they have been made a complete, tyrant villain by the media. And by the way, who do you think it throws the fucking media? Oh, the same motherfuckers that created the central fucking banking system. So you know, these are, these are not conspiracies. These are not. Now you can argue whatever you want. You can argue that Saddam Hussein used gas on his own. I don't, you know, we could say all, we could say all of these things. Okay. But the truth of the matter is that everybody who's ever opposed the central banking system has some sort of genocidal hostility worked into their quote unquote reputation character. Yeah. And to defend any of these men in any way, shape, or form is completely unacceptable by society standards. Why is that? Hmm. It couldn't be that they don't want anyone to actually figure out that the reality of the narrative is actually more about the central banking system financially enslaving the entire earth. It couldn't be that, right? Like that couldn't be the reason that these people were problem people. Well, because if you think about like on the base level, like the central bank, right? Like inflation did not exist until the central bank was created. They control all of the interest rates. I mean, so we're talking about like the world's economy, countries like full economies, our economy here. It's all at the ends of a very few. Yeah, but how do you get people to never look into it or never question it? You have to paint these world global contastrophes. Anybody who stood up against it, you have to paint them as like the devil. Yeah. And I'm not standing up for any of these motherfuckers. I'm just pointing the facts. That's the thing. It's like, okay, sure. They probably did some fucked up things, but like, what was the root of it? Well, and then who financed the fuck? Well, hold on. Do. Listen, here's the problem. Is there an incentive for the media to villainize those people so that, okay, this is the question that should be asked? Is, first of all, there a relationship between the central banking families and the media globally? Yes. The answer is absolutely absolutely. Absolutely. Okay. The next question that should be asked is, do those people have an interest in hiding the fact of how much they take advantage of the regular citizens across the globe? Do they have an incentive to hide that? The answer is yes. So if those two answers are yes, then the third question that should be asked is, is there a motivation for them to villainize the people who have spoken out against central banking and have actually removed central banking from their country's economy? Is there an incentive for the central bank and media, whoever owns it, is there an incentive to villainize those people to a degree where you cannot socially ask reasonable questions about them in order to protect their own interest? Is that a reasonable question? I would say that's a reasonable question. Yeah, I know it is, but people can't connect those dots. They want to jump in and say, bigotry in this and that, that's the play. That's the design. So until we get to a place where we can have open and honest discussions about the realities of why things are the way they are, you know, I think it's happening more and more. You know, I think more and more people are understanding, but what does that mean? Well, in history, what it's meant almost every single time this has happened is death, destruction and war. So these people haven't, there has been no indication since 1913 that these people have any willingness to step aside and they'd rather kill millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of people to protect their own financial interests. You know, I don't know. I think we live in a very different world than what we are presented with as the truth. It's so crazy. It's so crazy. You look into like, you know, like why each person had opposition to it. The one guy specifically, Guggenheim, again, he was a minor, like he was a conglomerate, like he, he mined minerals, one of those minerals being silver and gold. He wanted to keep a gold standard for the fucking country. You don't think he would be in opposition to a small group of people controlling the interest rates and inflation of all of it and taking them off of the gold standard. Because that's exactly what they did. It's exactly like, I think the, I think people have a problem connecting the dots there because like that's that's a piece of it. Listen, this is why they don't teach the shit in school. Most you said, oh, people have a hard time connecting the dots. Brother, most people can't connect the dots in their own personal finances. So no fucking shit, they're not going to be able to connect the dots here. Yeah. I think the other piece of it too, like outside of your question is like, I mean, there's another question. It's like, what do we do with that information? You know what I'm saying? Like that's a question people need to, like I mean, all right, cool. So you're with us. What do we do with that information? Yeah. That's a hard question, a hard answer to fucking put up. Well, I think there's a large amount of people that were hopeful that Trump was going to straighten this out. But it doesn't look like it. It looks like we're going to continue on the same bullshit monetary fucking system where they can print as much money as they want, devalue your wealth over the course of your life, tax you at a ridiculously unfair rate while at the same time being able to print as much money as they need to. So if they can print as much money as they need to and they have no problem doing so, then what is the purpose of the tax code system? It can only mean one thing. No financial oppression, intentionally, for control. So we live in a de facto slave environment that is just labeled differently than what it was labeled, you know, 3,400, 500,000 years ago. It's just like when you've mentioned earlier, you know, us being a sovereign country, it's like not sovereign when we have lobbyists and fucking bureaucrats running our government. That's right. Despite what the citizens want. Correct. Correct. That's sovereign at all. No, that's sovereign, man. I don't know, man. Guys, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Love to hear your thoughts on this conversation down in the comments. Please let us know. By the way, let's clarify this while we're talking about it. You know what they want people to say? Let's just be real. They want people to say. What do they want them to say? They want them to say, it's the what? It's the juice. It's the juice. That's what they want them to say. They want you to say that because it's lazy language. It's a generalization. It includes many, many, many millions of innocent people and they can hide behind that. There's no accountability. It's morally irreprehensible for people to accept that it is, you know, to persecute the juice because of the Holocaust. Okay. So when you want to identify what is actually going on and you say, it's the juice, you should realize that you are saying exactly what they want you to say so that they can defend it and call you a fucking anti-Semite, ruin your credibility, etc., etc., etc. And keep doing what they're doing. It is not the juice. It is a group of organized criminals with a line interests that hide amongst and behind all the regular Jewish people that exist in the world. That is the truth. And until those people are identified by name and by interest and not grouped into some large, broad spectrum, there's not going to be any progress because they will just say you're a bigot or you're a racist or you're an anti-Semite and it's easy as that. But if you are to say no, I have nothing against Jewish people at all. In fact, there are probably some of the biggest victims of this because they're being used to promote criminal activity that isn't even something that most of them are aware of, which creates hatred towards certain people. So now you have most of the divisive, that's how they win. 100%. Yeah, bro, like listen dude, the fucked up cycle. No, it's intentional. They want people to say that. They want people to say that. What they don't want is for people to say this is a group of organized criminals that hide behind the government of Israel that have been doing this shit for 100 fucking 20 years. That's what are 110 years now. That's what they don't want you to say. And then they don't want you to point them out or name them. Okay, and then people will say, what about all these? Look at all these people who are in charge of this and this and this and this and this and they're all Jewish. Yeah, bro, what are we talking about here? We're talking about, well, a couple thousand people. You could sit here and say, look at all the people involved in COVID. All the people at the top, they're all Jewish. Okay. But even if they're part of the of the gang, still not 14 million. No, right. It's still it's, you can't make it look like it's this entire and by the way, just like Christians, there's different sex of Christianity. There's people that believe one thing and then slightly different things and then slightly different things. And amongst the Jewish community, there's massive. Disparity amongst some of the belief systems in Jewish culture. So like dude, like you can't make lazy arguments and fucking solve this problem because they've thought it through and they're not stupid. You think they don't know that people are going to automatically go to the fucking, it's the, what the fuck? Right. We, if you want to solve a problem like that, you have to be much smarter than that. And you have to say, oh, I know it's actually not the Jews. It's actually Steve and Chris and fucking Susie. And here's the list. And it's them. That's the fucking way you solve these problems. It's not, you know, like we don't go in the city here in St. Louis and say it's the black people. We say it's fucking Tyrone. Right. And it's fucking, you know what I'm saying? JJ. It's JJ. Like we fucking, you know what I'm saying? Like that's what the fuck we do. Right. I mean, we don't go to Florida. I'm like, it's all the white people fighting the Alligators and Krogan. No, we say it's Kyle. It's Kyle. It's a motherfucker with the green monster. You don't say it like fuck dude. Like I don't know. Like it's, I can appreciate people, you know, because dude, I get a lot of comments. Or like, you don't even see what's going on. You don't even know. What are you going to say? I said what it is for the last fucking five years. Y'all want me to say some shit that I don't believe is actually true. That's just my point. And if you can prove to me that every person that you say is in on it, is in on it the way you say it is. If you can prove that, then maybe we'll have a discussion. But like dude, I don't see that. I know plenty of fucking Jewish people, bro. Their cool is fucked to me. I don't know. Maybe they get around each other and they're like fuck that white motherfucker. I don't fucking know. You know, Kikam right in the took his. Yeah. Like no bagels for him. Like I'm not fucking until we fucking, you know, like dude, it's, it's good. Good people versus bad people. It's criminals versus fucking citizens. It's good. It is what the fucking is, man. Yeah. And I don't give a fuck if you're criminal, if you're a Christian or a Jew or black or white or fucking whatever, bro. If you're making life harder for the collective good people, then fuck you. You belong in a fucking gallows. That's what I think. Yeah. 100%. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think, man. With that being said, let's get to our third and final discussion. The rapper of 47 made the admission on X on Monday while releasing a snippet of a music video for a new song titled Cousins. He posted this out. He says, the song is called Cousins about my cousin that's locked in jail for life for killing a pregnant lady a few years after I told him we couldn't look at dirty magazines together anymore. I mean, they went on to say, perhaps in my self-centered mess, I thought it was my fault that I showed him those dirty magazines when he was six. And then we acted out what we saw. My dad had Playboy magazines, but the magazines I found in the top of my mom's closet were different. And then finished off saying, my name is Yeh, and I sucked my cousin's dick till I was 14, tweetsent. And yeah, I don't know. I don't think I don't know how to take it. I mean, the comments that I've been seeing on his posts have all been kind of like, you know, shocking all a lot. It's, I don't know, I got a snippet here. I don't know how much we can play on YouTube for you. I got to see if this works. Nope, they're going to work. Now pull it up. Is that like home videos? Yeah, it's like a weird production. I'm not going to be a singer. That's the song. Yeah. I mean, dude, look, you want to know what I think about it. I think this feels like something that's been weighing on him his whole fucking life. And he's tired of carrying it. And he's saying, this is what the fuck it is. And he's an artist. And that's his way of unloading that office conscious. That's how I see it. Well, you know, it's crazy. I also see it as him using his influence to let other people know that if some things that were weird, maybe have happened to you when you were growing up, that there's freedom and knowing that other people have been through similar things. I personally, you know, I think Kanye's way fucking ahead of everybody else. I think people misjudge him for what he's doing, especially with the the Hitler shit. Because I've stated before on the show, my personal take is that Kanye has seen the inner workings of the entertainment industries. All of them, you know, he's been around celebrities from television and movie and athletes and fucking everything. Music, obviously, culture, obviously. And I think he's seen behind the curtains. I think he understands a lot more than people think that he understands. And I think he appears to be insane. He might be. Maybe I'm completely fucking wrong. But the guy's been considered a fucking genius his whole life. And now because he's saying things that are uncomfortable for people to hear. To hear. Yeah. Now he's crazy. Now he's crazy. Everything is is that, you know, it takes someone to like what I'm the way the world works now. Reasonable conversations don't get the play, right? Like that conversation that we just had about this whole scenario, that's not a conversation that anybody wants to throw light on because it's a reasonable conversation. And nobody wants to have that. Nobody wants to have it. Because most people are one side or the other side. And by him coming out, he understands, I mean, let's be honest. Does anybody out here think that Kanye West does not understand how to use attention and the media to his benefit? No. And if you think that he's ignorant to that, then you're a stupid motherfucker. He knows exactly what the fuck he's doing. He knows exactly what he's saying. He knows exactly how to appear like it's just coming out of his mouth versus calculated. The guy's fucking smarter than you. Period. Full stop. Okay. And he understands that for him to bring attention to some of the things that he has discovered and believes that he has to say the wildest fucking shit possible to get people to look into it. He understands that there's so many people out here that love Kanye West that when he says wildest shit, people are going to be like, what the fuck is he talking about? Let me, like, what's he really looking at here? You know what I'm saying? Like, it's very strategic. Dude, that's what I see. I see a strategically run play to open people's eyes about some of the historical corruption and intentional slavery systems that we have going on globally. And bro, what if you know how you talk about all the time? It's like, you know, you know, because we talk about this, Epstein shit, which actually ties in JP Morgan Chase beautifully, right? Because they did all out of the financing and bank account managing for Epstein. And you talk about all the time. It's like, you know, people, if we just all got to a point where like, we're not, afraid of what skeletons are in our closet. They have no leverage. That's correct. What if this is like that play like he's just, this is what they got. Well, he understood, listen, bro, he understood. That's listen, that very well could be the case. They could have come to him and say, hey, Kanye, we know your sucker cousin's dick till you were fucking 14. And he's like, oh, you know what? I don't give a fuck. I'm going to make a fucking song about it. Hey guys, my name is Jay. I suck my cousin's dick. He like, bro, bro. Bro. I think that's a very good possibility. Bro. Yeah. Because dude, what's the quickest way to take fucking steam out of the people's fucking momentum? Just admit it. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. What? I'm not a fucking perfect person. Guess what? Just like you, I have things that I'd rather not have the entire world knowing. Guess what? I've done some fucked up shit. Guess what? That's what he's doing. Bro. Okay. And if everybody were to do that, that would take the power away from literally everyone. And you all are fucking, this goes into a whole different conversation. You're all afraid of what people are going to say. You're afraid to be exposed as a fraud. You're afraid that fucking the things you did are going to be unacceptable to the rest of society. Let me tell you something. Every single motherfucker that throws a rocket you for whatever the fuck you've done in your life is living in a fucking glass house because that is called being a human being. There is no playbook that you get when you walk out of the fucking womb that says, hey, or do this. And by the way, you'll be all right. If you just do these things, that's not how it works. And people love to leverage people's poor decisions or lack of perspective or bad behavior or sinful behavior, which by the way is called being human. And they leverage and weaponize that into shame and guilt to get people to fall in line. And by the way, how they use it on you all is to make you so fucking afraid of stepping out and being what it is you know, you could be that it silences you and makes you afraid and makes you quiet. You're afraid to speak up, which is why we had a situation like COVID even happened in the first place. So this is a personal decision. Okay. And real talk, I don't give a fuck when anybody thinks about me. I don't care. And you know what that does is it makes you free. Pretty free free. Free. Yeah. Because if you don't give a fuck, bro, nobody can say anything and they can't hold your feet to anything. You're like, yeah, I did that. Fuck you is what the fuck it is. That's what he's doing. Oh, bro, that's like I just like my fuck. I would do. Well, by the way, by the way, we've all seen him say all this shit and we've all seen him doing this. What's happened to his net worth over the last couple of years went up. That's when up. People still talk about him. He can't not talk about him. Listen, dude, you should never let anybody fucking hold something over your head. I mean, there are things that are unforgivable for sure, right? And outside of like, you know, the raping of children and molesting and all that pedophile shit, you shouldn't be afraid to fucking to offer your experiences as lessons for other people that might be able to avoid those same mistakes. And you know, everybody lives in fear, bro. Everybody's afraid. And I'll tell you what, dude, I see Kanye through a different lens than what I think most people see him through. I just, he's an operator. He's smart as fuck. He knows what he's doing. He's not willing to go along. And he's taking their leverage away one by one by one. What are you going to, oh, they're going to call you a Nazi for pointing it out? What does he say? I am. Right? There's that M&M song. I am what you say I am. Okay. And he's doing that. So like everything they call him, he's like, yeah, fuck yeah. And I mean, you're probably right. They probably call him. He's like, hey, you don't fucking stop it, dude. We're going to tell the world you sucked your cousins dick. And he's probably like, cool. Let's hear what I mean. I suck my cousins dick. You know, he makes a fucking song, you know, like, yeah. And you know what? I don't fucking care if he did. I don't care. Do you care? No. Does it make him gay? No, you're a fucking kid, bro. You didn't know shit. You got mixed up with some bullshit. I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't think anything less of Kanye for sharing that. Not at all. Does any of one of you, anybody? I don't, I don't fucking care. Damn, man. That's wild. I would love to have Kanye on the fucking show, bro. I think it'd be a fucking, or just talk to him in private. Yeah. And just like, I want to hear like phones. Yeah, no phones, no recording. Like I would just want to hear, I want to know what the fuck you, what are you, what are you really doing, bro? I'm pretty sure I'm right. It might be me. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm right. And if I'm wrong, you know, and he, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong. But I don't feel like I'm wrong. I don't think you are. I don't think, bro. I think he's trying to bring awareness by saying, wild ass shit, that then gets him, gets the conversation going. Because look since he's done, since he's done this, look at the conversation, how it's changed. Okay, you have people out here who are presenting very logical, accurate, factual commentary about this situation. And by the way, the people who are making traction, yeah, they're not saying what Kanye is saying. But because Kanye is saying it the way he's saying it, he's forcing the conversation to happen in a reasonable manner. That's the important piece of dialogue happening. Yes. Yes. Damn, man. Guys, tell us, please, what you guys think about this. I don't, I don't think, I truly do not think, I don't think that if you dug into his fucking heart, I don't think you hate him. You hate Jewish people. I don't think that at all. I think he understands that there's a criminal element that hides behind it. And he's just, he's taking his licks because he knows he can compared to people who can't. Well, it's, it's how do you get people to the city, right? If you got, you know, this common, this crazy shit all the way over here on, on this side, then you have to say equally opposite over here to set the tone for what's in the middle. Yeah. You get that. That's how you bring people to the city. I mean, dude, it makes perfect sense, bro. Makes, makes sense. That's why I take, bro. And by the way, Kanye, I don't think, I mean, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I don't think anybody cares, bro. I don't think anybody gives a fuck that you suck your cousins did, bro. So you shouldn't be, and by the way, any of you other motherfuckers that got a little dirt in your closet, guess what? The idea of a family growing up with the white picket fence and the perfect little household, that is a fucking lie to make you feel guilty about your shit. Yeah, right. They impose an unrealistic standard on society so that we all feel fucked up. Yeah, everybody's fucking life and childhood was fucked up in some way. So if you got some shit, fuck it. Let it go, bro. That's all I'm saying. By the last guy I knew that was like, lived a perfect life. He ended up being a liar. Those people go to jail. No, no, they killed him for it. Well, Jesus. Well, so I mean, like, you know, that's my, that's my look on it. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong about all this. Maybe, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm wrong. But like, I'm just my come here to communicate my viewpoints. And if I'm wrong, I will adjust the viewpoints as I go, like I always do. So but that's my take at the current moment. Yeah, man, guys, let us know down in the comments what you guys think. With that being said, it's time for our final segment of the show as always. We have thumbs up or dumb as fuck. When I go back, you know, talk about childhood here. You're a big wrestling fan. Wrestling. Yeah, right. Rassling. Rassling. That's my grandma. Like the WWE, WF. Well, I grew up in the real wrestling days. Yeah. See, I got turned off quickly because I true. I got to realize that 80s was different. Was that real though? I do believe it was real. Yeah, that shit was real. No, no, that was real. Like your, your error, that was real. No, it wasn't ever real. For sure. It's real. No, no. It's real in terms of like, yeah, it hurts and they plan it out. Okay. And physically, yes, there's. Yeah, but like, there's a narrative to entertainment, dude. Everybody knows that. Okay. It's like politics. Yeah. But I'm just saying we had great characters back then, bro. We had Rick Flair when he was young. Yeah. Okay. We had fucking Sarge's slaughter. Jimmy Superfly Snooka. Nope.

They're real fake shit. Yeah, the next, the 90s was like, staying and fucking. Right. But dude, bro, the Scott, the Steiner Brothers were the 80s. People don't know that. Like bro, they were, then, then in the 90s, they got to, you know, you got Scott Steiner, Big Pop-a-Pump. Rick Steiner kind of went away. Triple H.

Stone Cold Steve Austin. Yeah, see, that was past my time, bro. I wasn't into the, yeah, I wasn't. I love Stone Cold. Yeah, because you're younger than me. Yeah. That wasn't my thing.

So he sends a woman flying after driving his ATV into WrestleMania barrier. Do you see this? Yeah. So at, at another three counts, it's a stone cold Steve Austin's WrestleMania Resume. Awesome. And appearance at WrestleMania 41 on Sunday to thunderous applause as a thrilled crowd came unglued when his glass breaking music hit. He then tried to drive his ATV down the ramp and drove it around the ring. But before he could complete a second loop, Austin turned a bit too wide while attempting to get past a corner nailing the barricade and sending one woman back into her seat and haste. Let's check this clip out. I know, States and Russ almighty. You never out of chase. Oh, that's it. Oh, crush time. What? I know, States and Russ almighty. You never out of chase. Oh, that's it.
