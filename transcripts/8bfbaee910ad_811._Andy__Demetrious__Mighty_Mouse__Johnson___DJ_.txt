We almost had a race war Thanks, I haven't man. I'm gonna be here man and shoot the shit. Yeah, so if you guys I mean if everybody knows Demetrius But if you don't know Demetrius he is probably the most accomplished if not you know The biggest legend in UFC history Flyweight champ 11 title defenses one champ as well. Yep, right? Are you still fighting or is it I'm a fisher retired? Are you? Fistley retired. Yeah, well, that's a good career. Staying on bro. Yeah, thanks man. Thanks It was a long career and I felt I was at a point in my career where I just wasn't having as much fun competing Yeah, you know when you do it for so long You typically when you're going to fight it's always focused on getting ready for the fight I've always enjoyed the process. I've always enjoyed learning But you know, it came time to fight inside the cage Otagon ring wherever it may be like after my last one, which was in Dimmer Colorado Excuse me. I have my kids my wife there If I'm out there, I got that fight. I was like damn So it's all life is is just me fighting and collecting a check. I was like I want to do something I need to do something more So I took a year off just to like see if I would miss it You know, I still kept training I kept on working out but no sparring and keep points. I was like, you know I don't miss it. I think I'm done. Yeah, I think I'm gonna focus on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and the Guy and that's been like my saving grace and See yeah, so no more getting a punch or punch people in the face. Yeah, that's cool, man Well listen, you did plenty of it. You did it very well Yeah, nobody could take that from me. I did have asked kicking in my days For 18 years of my career. So I think it's fine just to relax and chill and focus on different things and Build my brand and just enjoy life. Yeah, now now you're married and you have kids. I'm married to have three kids 11 9 and 6 that's awesome. Two boys and one girl. That's all What I mean, what was that transition like man because like that? I don't feel like that's something you hear a lot Just in the MMA world of like you know guys who dedicate all that time to fighting and then you got to like transition Like you're not having to like punch for money no more like what's that transition like man? Yeah, I mean I think it was two two ways to answer that question one the transition of not going to the gym spending two hours of commute being a gym all day and day learning you know New techniques what this guy does well, but he doesn't do well That's amazing. I get all that time back right you know the time away from the family is stuff you just can't get fucking back I'm gonna I was always involved in my family's my children's life Even in training camp right like after I you know, I never get after I beat him or so I was like I had to get back fucking home because the HOA is on my ass I gotta go pressure wash this one fucking fence so I'll be in Vegas one night not to pursue who down the next day I back home So I've always been that type of person in my career so when it was time for me to like okay I'm done fighting. I'm not gonna click the check from fighting anymore. It was Almost easy to lead that to lead that space But as far as the financial side of it, you know I gave myself a year and and through that whole tachyrab always been building Different companies and help elevate the companies and I lie myself with great companies And so once I said okay, I'm here myself a year I need to start using my intelligence and my brand to bring in money like I have to because I only could fight for so long And if I stop fighting 138 I'm hoping I'm hoping I'm hope I look like 92 grandma's 91 So 92 and if I can make it to 92 that's from 38 to 92 That's a long fucking span of you gotta make money. No, it doesn't matter how much money made it mixed martial arts Unless you making like 50 million to fight which ain't nobody yeah, I've ever met made that much You gotta figure out how you gonna make money and so for me I gave myself a year was okay I'm gonna see if I miss it because I don't want to be the after that that retires and goes I'm coming back Come back. I was like I'm gonna myself a year Lay low start working on like the YouTube to podcast all that stuff working at businesses and When I year came up I was like okay, I'm self-sustained. I made some great investments early in my career And everything's growing and I'm enjoying doing it until I was like alright I think I'm I think I'm done you never know when you true the Because you're always grinding you're always gonna fucking grind because it's who you are. It's just why yeah Yeah, I told my father like man when I tell him wake up. I'm gonna do with the fuck I won't play video games You're not yeah stop lining yourself and you know, I am traveling more than ever I'm busier and more than ever and and we don't like to say busy I'd say we're being very productive with our time bro. That's first of all I love that I love that whole thing First of all people forget that Guys like you are just regular dudes, bro that you know, you got to go home and you got to do the house stuff and the husband stuff and You know those things and I think that's super cool that you acknowledge that but dude you said something in there That is so important especially for the younger people, you know, we're inundated with You know the flash and and the the big money and the big baller shit When we're young right and we have all these kids now that are in their 20s and and dude They're doing all these things to try and make a little money, right? I get it because I was the same way Yeah, but what we do have to understand as men Especially if we're gonna be the provider is that bro this game is long This game is so long and no matter how much money you're making right now it ain't enough Yeah, it just isn't and like people don't understand that they think oh, I'm gonna get to 40 and I'm gonna make you know Five million dollars in retire. It's like no you fucking it Yeah Like dude that we're gonna live a long time so I think it's a you know you making that point to the to the young box here Is a super big point dude. Well nobody nobody talks about that. No, I feel like in mission That's why we see people on 30 for 30. No being like what oh, I spent my last 50 grand on a fucking Hummer Why I think it's very taboo and mixed martial arts and I think in any sport right? I think even in not just mixed martial arts you look at NBA NFL yeah Hockey whatever it may be nobody true comes out and says like okay, man Like this is what I made this what I made in my career and I put you know, you know I remember Kobe Bryant he came a talk to us before he he passed away and he was like yeah, you know I took some of the money that I made from the NBA and I invested in vitamin water that turned out to be great and You have some athletes do that but that's the cream of the fucking crop for sure He's like yeah, I'd vessel like five million in by no I was like yeah, we don't even make five million as an athlete So we were I couldn't relate But I think it's very important to be up front with a lot of athletes Like dude like you got an investor money because you own it all it takes is one ACL One wrong hit an NFL wrong wrong, you know Blue ACL you're never gonna be the exact same and we've seen athletes like I think Derek Rose He tours Achilles tendon I believe yeah, he was never the same and Luckily he was a basketball player. He made great money, but it makes martial arts You could be on like a five-fight win streak making, you know Let's just say I don't know a hundred of a show a hundred and once you make $200,000 you win five times So that's a million dollars That's correct you guys can correct me in the comments below if that's my rap Do you get it to taking taxes? There's 20% and there's you know you're at 800,000 20% to your Management so that 20,000 so you're at what 600,000 dollars at the $400,000 is gone Okay, and then let's say you fucking lose so you're at $600,000 You're not gonna get the same type of velocity of money coming in right at the time and a lot of people don't recognize that Mm-hmm and like you said all they do is see the flash the flare the nice cars the girls the social media But social media like I will love when one day goes Hey, just got my check. I'm gonna go to the fucking bank. I'm gonna deposit it and I'm gonna sit there And I'm gonna start investing my money into you know as be 500 or the down industry or you know the trooper queue I think there needs to be more that Shown on social media and talked about but nobody likes that stuff. That's boring. It's not sexy. Yeah But it's stuff that works I mean even thinking about like we're talking about young athletes who the NIL deals Oh, yeah, I mean that's a whole I've always been like a staunch like Against it for many different reasons and not because I don't feel like young kids should have it like the other athletes They're working their ass off You know the likeness and like I get it cool. Yep But to give you know a 17 year old a 18 year old who a couple of weeks ago had to raise their hand to go to the fucking bathroom Access to hundreds of thousands of dollars with zero fucking oversight It's irresponsible man. It's irresponsible. I feel like there has to be a better way. Well, bro I was talking to you so do you know, you know, Demarco far. Yeah, okay So Demarco when he was here in St. Louis. We were good buddies. I haven't spoken to him in a few years Demarco far used to be a detackle for the Rams when the Rams were here in St. Louis and he's Super Bowl champ awesome Dude fucking awesome dude played up Washington. Oh really? Yeah, okay We were we were him and I were out to eat one time We started talking about like the rookie symposium and what they teach these guys. He's like bro They don't teach him shit. No, they don't fucking teach him any financial shit They they try to but the guys aren't listening because they're young and they got big money And they think they're the first young guys that got big money and you know, they're warning about these girls They're like guys these girls are gonna come try to take your shit and none of them listen because they think they're the exception You know part of it is just a young man's ego, you know what I'm saying? Like and financial literacy right? Yeah teaching like it all starts at home, right? But then again, you got it. I didn't come from money. Yeah, my mom single parent death You know, she lived off of a child support checks, you know, I remember every single month She will like what would mean another month all the child support checks came in and so that kind of like hit me like Okay, so we're living off child support Luckily, you know at this time of my life. I never met my dad my my brothers Dad he paid and then also when my sister started to come live with us Then that's when her dad started to pay so we're living month to month paycheck to paycheck And so for me I never got that flashy and all that stuff so when I was fighting you have see you know I'll make what I thought I mean 5,000 to show 5,000 when being kid you have a moto I was still working full time so all that money went straight to the bank. Yeah straight to the bank until I started fighting when I fought dominant crews for 14,000 to show 40,000 a win I lost that fight that's when I finally quit my day job was okay. I'm gonna try to take this serious I'm gonna try to take this you know this mixed martial arts stuff serious But you know when it comes to the NIL deals. Yeah, like you're giving the kid Six figures who you know it can go two ways it can be a guy goes now I'm pulling out man. I'm a great Or I can go like I've been raised by I've been shown what you can do with money I'm used as a tool to better my life and to better my future Then you know it's too spectrum the same thing, you know people do drugs and like Fuck you off the deep in or some guys can do drugs But it's a tool for me to help me sleep. It was a tool for me just to relax and decompress or you know call my anxiety So it's to there is it there is there is some truth to that dude It's like it's like the kid who grows up with an alcoholic alcoholic parent, right? Yep, like you either become alcoholic because your dad was an alcoholic Or you become sober because your dad was an alcoholic 1000 right or then you like for me me my wife We don't drink alcohol anymore, but because she one of our kids made a comment and you know I don't really drink as much but my wife she you know have a couple beverages more than another and she comes from an alcohol family like her dad was alcoholic, but he sobered for like I think 25 years and My oldest son made a comment one day and she was like fuck is that how he views me when I pick up a drink and so we just We don't need alcohol anymore, but if he but prior to when he sees me drink or you my wife It's where relax is like we earn this dream. We you guys get your clothes your fed house the lights are on everything's good I'm gonna have myself a beverage, but now we don't we just drink anymore because we want we don't want the kids to grow up in a society Where it's like oh when a celibate. Yeah, let's have a beer. Let's have a shot. Yeah, right? It's totally different so but I agree with you like yeah If you if you're around it and you see it then they're like oh, you're either gonna be a non-alcoholic or you're gonna be Alcoholic because my dad used it that's what you get when he had a hard time. So I'm gonna use it I'm having a hard time alcohol culture is a weird thing, dude. It is it really is. Yeah, it's like You know, I'm gonna celebrate What first of all because most people they say that they're celebrating But what are you celebrating another usually another week of mediocrity? That's what you're celebrating and the fact that we would reward ourselves with something that's so harmful For our minds and our bodies, you know, and dude I'm not judging because I live my whole life like that. I come from alcohol culture I still like to have some beers and hang out with the dudes. I'm not being overly judgy I'm just saying it's interesting when you think about it. Yep, you know I Have definitely drastically cut down what I drink. I haven't had hard liquor with the exception of one time since 2018 and it was one shot through the celebrating The life of a buddy of mine who passed away. So that was it and but you know drink beer. I like smoke weed Yeah, you know, and I do like weed. Yeah, but weed's amazing. I know When I was growing up I was like, you know, you were on the stigma so all we told battery that it I never smoked just never smoked right smoked it once and I saw proper clouds over the river and all stuff And I was talking to my my wife now she goes honey. That is not we choose that shit with It's like came back from the mountains. I was like this. I was like It's so but now being older like once again, I feel that I'm successful The kids take care of and I forget I was a you know One of my business partners He's you know, he's very very well off. You know, he calls me goes, hey, what are you doing phone this fucking laundry? You got five kids we all work out every single day. So that's what I'm doing. He goes man You always photo laundry. So one day my wife we're doing your work. She's outside and we have the green cameras And I see something at the front door and I see your ass out and the front door like this Oh God look so easy so easy and I came around and my brother my younger brother He asked to bring a bipolar and his gateway was Bash tracked from marijuana and so for me I've always stayed away from it And I've done like edibles at this time of my life But you know edibles is you're on a fucking ride and you don't know what you get it It was gonna be five 10 15 20 because you they say it's the sort of it is Yeah, I never know how they know especially on those homemade ones Oh, yeah, exactly so I was like you know what I was like it looks so easy. I'm gonna try it a go around the house I was like give me some of that she goes are you sure you you sure you want some of this? Oh like yeah, yeah, you're okay Okay, I'm done. I don't want to tell you more. I'm in the back. I'm gonna be fucking trees You need to call that I was like great No crash slept like a fucking baby woke up. I was like 44 beats per minute. Okay, go to the gym next day I'm faster. I'm moving I texted my question goes this is a PED He goes shit don't make you fast. You probably just got some some good rest and I'm like When I made the decision to stop drinking alcohol I was like okay, why do I drink alcohol? It's to feel good to be to lighten the mood and I'm like okay Well, that is literally toxic to every cell in my body. That's right. I always sell my body and I was okay You know a snoop dog and two chains. They out there smoking for the whole entire life and they still out there I don't work on my ass off so if I take one toke I wanted a half toke and that gets me where I need to be and I wake up and I see great. I was like That stigma that people think like marijuana's bad is bro. It's bullshit. It's a you know They they allow alcohol and allow alcohol to be pushed because it's damaging to people Yeah, they need people fucked up. They need people dependent They need people fat. They need people mentally fucked up so that they can get all the treatment and buy all the Farmer and do all the therapy and have all the medical issues and then they suppress natural things Which is really cool what's going on with RFK right now in the government But they suppress things like psilocybin which can help with depression massively One or two treatments can make a big difference for a lot of people. They suppress weed which you know Fuck dude. I've smoked a lot of fucking weed and I drink a lot of alcohol and every every fucking time Every problem I've ever had in my life dude came from drinking alcohol. I never went down the highway It's fucking 150 miles an hour smoking weed You know what I'm saying I didn't saw the fuck down Like bro, I just made all the bad decisions when it comes to alcohol It's just I got up one one day The last time I drank a dude I had in it. I had a I got a fight and And that was the last time I'm like I'm done with this shit, dude Like this is I'm way too old to be doing this shit. Yeah, well, I think you hit it right up Yeah, it's like I've never heard about any of my I've heard you hear so many stories like guy goes to the bar It's hammered drives home either gets an accident kill somebody or he makes his life ruins is like Get home beats a shit out of his wife in his kids. I've never heard of I've never heard a story And I'm I haven't heard every story around the world But I've never heard a story from somebody goes man. He got so fucking high. He came home Never heard that story Well, he just died now he just fucking sleep and he go make it be the whole goddamn right it's like Cut the blood. He's a cut the bullshit. It's like you know alcohol is sold to miners is holding the stores And you know, I'm glad now that weed is legal in most places. Yeah, I think legal in Washington state So I'm very blessed for that, but yeah, we gotta hear too. Rick. Oh, it's yeah, yeah, that's awesome I think hopefully around the world even like when I went to Singapore It's like can't bring marijuana you can't bring on something I was like but you can do it got caught And I was like I've never heard of somebody getting extremely high and beating something up Yeah, sure enough bro. You go to Singapore. Do that shit. That fucking can you yeah, I know I know but I'm like why it's like yeah, it's it's It's natural and you know, I understand there's some people once again, it's a tool There's some people who can just they smoke weed and don't do anything their lays at it I or you got people who can use it like for me. I use as a tool. I'm like dude. I'm fucking tired I can't sleep. I'm gonna take a couple hits I'm gonna go to bed hit the gym tomorrow and you know what? I'm just gonna relax and then I'm more patient with my kids when it's time to do fucking schoolwork Because my oldest he's 2 DM's smart for his own good, but it gives me the patience to be able to Communicate with them. Yeah, I use as a tool too to deal with everybody else Fuck and myself Love it, man. Yeah, bro. All right. Well, that's should we do some cruising? Yeah, let's do it Yeah, I'm mad I'm mad if I'm here. Yeah, do some cruising man. I wanted to bring it before we get into it Thank you for coming on bro. No, no, thanks. I have so this is it's cool to have you here, dude Yeah, no thanks. I have a man beautiful facility man the gym is amazing the product is amazing. I love it I mean, you know, I'm happy to be here But you got a lot of fans here, bro. Oh, thanks man. You got fans everywhere, but you got a lot here. I appreciate that appreciate that Well, let's do some cruising man. I wanted to bring this topic. I mean, it's kind of shit I'm excited. I can't wait. Which one is it? Well, I mean, I mean, I feel like we're days away from it So we got to talk about oh, okay, okay, you talk about fighting. Oh, we talk about Jake Paul fight Yeah, I thought you know, talk about open rink. He's ass and fucking come all hairs blowing fucking one billion that shit Okay, let's go get into that This is just the intro, you know, yeah Mike Tyson fight man. Yeah, so he just made a comment Not a couple I believe you I should actually I'm a natural born killer Mike Tyson highlights the difference between him and youtuber Jake Paul And so yeah, they're set to fight this Friday. Yep You guys from now two days from Tomorrow tomorrow. Yeah, when is this dropping tomorrow tomorrow. Okay, all right today Okay, yeah, yeah, sir He knitted that yo yo yo It should be interesting, you know, I love that calm the first thing can't even he's like I'm a you know I'm a natural born killer. That's 58, you know killers when they're when they're they're young They're great killers. They don't get caught. They're very, you know discrete subtle secretive Then with caught but typically as a killer he takes a kill as he gets older he starts to you know Not not clean the sink is good. He starts such a slow the individual gets caught So I agree with Mike Tyson. He is a natural born killer, but that killer is 58 who's taking on you know a fabricated I don't say fabricated killer, but Jake Paul were You know Jake Paul's has never gone through that broke man stage up a professional athlete like he's Came into he came I've never heard that that perspective. Yeah, he came into the sport wealthy Like he wasn't running he wasn't working full-time like I was he was working 40 hours a week He wasn't you know Mike Tyson. He was He was broke, right? So Jake Paul's never going to have that same mentality That I had or Mike Tyson had or a lot of athletes had he came in it He had the best of the best nutrition the best of the best stated our facility He had the best of the best he gets to pick and choose who he fights and that I didn't I think it's that opportunity my Tyson had the opportunity, right? So you take anybody and you give them the stated art facility the stated art nutrition the stated art pro to whatever it may be They're gonna be something and especially when he can hand pick who he fights Right That's I mean look you still got to do the work though. What that you know saying like like here's what I'll say I'm known Jake since he was 17 years old. Mm-hmm. Okay That motherfucker. Okay Tyson can say whatever he wants Tyson could say oh I'm a natural killer And there's also some there's a lot of truth to what you're saying the When it comes to Tyson though, you know as you are a killer people start to know you're a killer right? You're not sneaking up on anybody. Yeah, you know you're not Tyson If Tyson doesn't go out there knocking the fuck out. It's a loss for him. Yeah, okay. So Jake is a natural athlete. He's a good athlete coming up and I know Jake personally Jake is a one of them real fucking hot fire dudes when it comes to disrespect Embarrassment and disrespect is what is what fucking fires people like that And he's like that and the fact that he feels disrespected the fact that he feels that everybody looks at him like a YouTube Decided to box. I think it lends It lends itself to Jake's favor Because he's wired that way. Yeah, and uh, you know, Jake's an exceptionally intelligent dude very hard worker very good athlete And uh, you know, yeah, he definitely had the advantages But also I think the disadvantage is too right because like he didn't grow up with the sport. Yeah You know what I mean? Yeah, and I I think the amount of progress He's made in the short amount of time is fucking incredible. Yeah, I think the hardest thing that a lot of people got it The perspective of boxing right boxing makes martial arts two different two different animals, right? Where boxing you have more say so what you can and can do So from the standpoint as a professional athlete who fights I can see why the way I interpreted what I just said about Jake Paul if you look a little bit disrespect No, no, that's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying there's two views to them two two is it right But a lot of people they can both be true. Yeah, Jake Paul if I if I told Jake Paul like Jake Paul you never you never you weren't you weren't fucking poor You're a star of road unit starve like I was working a fucking 40 hours a week caring things trying to make it to the gym to get my Mountains and yeah, you had somebody there the tire gloves to wrap your hands. Oh, you have a tight back on the get you had that Yeah, Paul and I'm I say there's nothing wrong with that Props it's different. It's different pops to you for setting yourself up and coming to this focus Jake Paul has done and that takes big balls bro. Yeah, it takes big balls because he didn't have to yeah, right and he's changed a lot of people's lives And boxer I met a sereno yeah her paychecks that she wasn't able to get she's been on something He's been able to market her. He's been on their brain. You know, he's about to make a get Mike Tyson a big payday So Jake Paul has done a lot of great things in boxing. Yeah, I think what he's also got everybody watching it dude I want to tell me yeah, it's exciting again, right? Yeah, and I think they're me I'm gonna rewatch him. Yeah, I am too All right boys Jake Paul taking an old ass Mike Tyson Yeah, but I think the biggest thing like for me when it comes and this is and this is the culture of boxing It's a culture of boxing, which is different from mixing martial arts Why is Jake Paul fighting someone who's 58 years old? Yeah, well that'll be my first my first argument. Why do you think he is? My precipice very obvious well one big fucking yeah, it's a fucking huge event huge event these guys are showmen Exactly, yeah, but when it comes to like there is it and then for me as the purist I like to think of myself as a purist of trying to test yourself against the best, right? Because they mix martial arts you don't get the pick and choose who you fight, right? It's like when I was in amateur Yeah, they pick for you. They pick for you. It's like you're fucking fighting get ready You don't know anything about him and you fucking fight Right, so for me, it's like are you tell me there's not another person out there in the world who's 28 years old Who's five and no as a boxer that Jake Paul cannot fight? No, I think I think that's where he has to move If he's gonna do what he says he wants to do. Yeah, if he wants to be like a legit champion Champion where it's like any her you're gonna pick my you're gonna pick my next five fights. Yeah Pick him that's like that's we got big fucking balls like yeah, I don't you pick you picked the next five guys I think that's gonna be coming for him. I hope yeah, I hope so too. I hope cuz I'm excited for it I think he really intends to be I think Jake really intends to be a world champion. I think he's very driven. He's very dedicated People can laugh about it and they can say he's this or that I mean, I've shook this man's hand a number of times looked him into fucking eyes guys not a pussy Yeah, you know, he's gonna give it everything. He's got and I'm sure he's a nice guy He's a nice guy. He does a lot behind the scenes for people. He does a lot for boxing community behind the scenes His money trains kids Like you know this character that everybody seems to not hate it's it's a fucking character Yeah, exactly. Sorry Jake, but no, no, I just want people to know he's a good dude absolutely, and that's and that's the thing where the Things get misconstrued yeah, right? I give and like for me when it comes to like fighting like just not the business I never right he goes well, do me. Johnson if I did that you know, I might lose Yeah, he did the Tommy Fury and Tommy Fury was a 50 50 fighter Like he's not even like there was a guy said about me about the new just like yeah I've been in the gym sales fucking 18 years old and now fucking work you Jake, right? Yeah, and it's just like a mix my shorts Everybody's path to a world title fight you look at Dustin point He's never been a true like world unmiss beauty champion. He's been in term champion But guys like Charles Oliver have gone through the weeds and and got it right so same thing with Jake Paul where there's a kid who's 18 years old Who's like I'll fuck a he they've looking Jake Paul's like I'll fucking work him. I've been I've a box in sales eight Yeah, he's he's so that's where like for me As a purest when I look at it. I was like did you wrestle I was on high school. Yeah, yeah, so it's like those wrestler kids right to start it when they were fucking They were fuck you They don't lose and they they've been bread they've been bread that way so yeah, but an on all I'm excited for Jake Paul And this is people got to think a lot of people think I hate on Jake Paul Brother Jake Paul wins or lose Does it affect my big account? No, does it affect the way I live my life? It doesn't so I don't I have no stake on if he wins or lose I want the best for both these gentlemen. I want I want Jake Paul to win if the I want Mike Tyson win I want Jake Paul the win. I want both of them to win. I I feel the same way. Yeah, but but I want but if Jake Paul truly wants to be a world champion A true world chamber. I want and everybody wants to take him serious. Yeah, I am here. I'll sit in the front row I'll make popcorn. I'm ready to watch the ride and I want to see you challenge yourself When you find someone who's fucking 58 years old and you're 27 my first thing is like how come there's not another Person out there who's 27 back in challenge him well. There's plenty of that will but they're not gonna get paid like this Which is fine. Yeah, and he might not bring as many views So it's like yeah, are you doing a business set of it or you're trying to you know, yeah, that's how I am But oh, I think there's valid points to both both. I think you're right, dude I mean if he's gonna be what he says he wants to be he's gonna have to do what you're saying. Yep, that's to yeah Yeah, yeah for people to for people Let's just say if he's making it to own belt baby, then he'd he grabs a whole boy and be sick off the street I'm world champion. I was like now you fucking done did it. Yeah, I'm gonna start disrespecting you Yeah, you just made a fake belt. That has been in lineage or anything like that. So I got to I got my I got my own first form belt Well who we got who we got for real you know I I think they're so I'm gonna go at Jake Paul the reason why it's because yes, Mike Tyson is a killer He's great. He's fast, but I'm not gonna be night e that the man is 58 years old. I saw him fight. What's his name? Mercer not Mercer who's a Joins Jones Jones. Yeah, where's your? Jones junior? The he could have fucking killed that guy. He went half speed. Oh, I don't think I don't think he was really going bro. I mean Sometimes bro, you see them sparring bro. He moved. I mean, you just know you see I have a naive either like you have a train I yeah, like when I see Mike Tyson move. I'm like holy shit dude for 58. Yeah for 58. He moves phenomenal. Yeah Yeah, but for 58 but for the eight. Yeah, right? Let's go watch him when he was Jake Paul's age Boom boom just to rhythm all that stuff. Yeah You know and boxing you can hold you can move Yeah, you can do that stuff. But this ain't this ain't this is a Primary boxer like who was literally one of the scariest dudes ever he said you just said right there. Yeah who used to be yeah I mean you scared me dude But you know, I'm gonna have to go to Jake Paul. I think he's younger skill wise Mike Tyson's way better than him way better than him Like the piggy poo the the angles he throws at but you know, we're not talking about skill Right even if Jake Paul knocks out Mike Tyson Mike Tyson still a better boxer. Yeah, right like when I beat him is to Hudo He when he beat me the second time I I feel comfortable saying I'm still a better mixed martial artist like I feel for skill for skill You know, okay, Delhi he the Delhi he the to the burlabolo. Okay now you did I know way more knowledge than him Right and Mike Tyson has way more knowledge than Jake Paul, but if Jake but this is once again my eye where it's like yeah, you know Okay, Jake Paul wins. I still don't think you're a better fighter than my Tyson. Oh, I don't think I don't think he thinks that Yeah, but I'm gonna keep on I just keep looking at some of these right hooks that he throws bro and they're fucking mean Like Jake Paul he throws some hard fucking right hooks, but dude I also think that you know Tyson's Three four inches shorter him dude. Yeah, and I think he's gonna walk up and up under him bro. Hey, hey, I hope I'm wrong I'm just saying it could go either way. I am not even comfortable picking because I don't know you have to pick you have to You have to that's what I tried to do the same thing on my shit Yeah, like you have to pick there is no there is no fucking no no no no you have to pick and you know And the day I grew to anyone these guys can win, but I'm gonna hedge my bet against a younger guy who's had yeah Everything give it not I want to skeuming not everything give it to him But who's had the best of the best training and I don't care if you have somebody who is athletic Who's willing to put the work in and a state-of-art facility? You're gonna be a product of something you're not you know Jake Paul is truly getting there his jab is quick Did you see the did you see the documentary on Netflix? No, not yet. Oh, so they have this like pre three series documentary to the fight Did you watch it? No, it's not the Jake Paul documentary. It's this pre-fight with Tyson Yeah, that's where the quote came from yeah, that's that so I was watching it and Fuck dude. I mean they took a Jake Paul to the the Olympic training facility up in Colorado and all the Boxers up there were giving them fucking props. Oh, yeah, man. It's good like bro. He's So I don't know man. I Say it dude. I got a pick Jake. All right. I got a pick Jake listen man. I Agree with what you're saying. Yeah, he's young. He's fast. He's strong and he's he's training. I Think he's training Like do look the guy who has More hungry is gonna train harder, okay, and I think Jake has way more to prove than Mike Tyson Mike Tyson is Mike Tyson And Mike Tyson is a fucking straight up gangster like I literally am figuratively I Would not want to fight Mike Tyson like for fucking any reason. I Just think I Think it depends on how Mike took the training dude I think if Mike comes out and because dude you you probably I mean look this dude's a fucking top level competitor like you Yeah, there's no way to turn that down when you're in that environment Yeah, like if you said hey go in there and fight this dude half speed and the guy punches you half speed is over. Yeah That's over. I think that's what is gonna come down to bro like if Jake hit like bro I don't know what if there's any like pre-arranged agreements like I Moose 75 Jake's hit it hits him with a fucking 76 is gonna be a problem. Yeah, that's how I feel about it's gonna be a problem That's how I feel about and Jake hits hard. He knocked out tyron will Lee. He knocked out of uh Been asking he knocked out the other boxer Frankie or I forget the guy's name. He hit him with the overcut time They're perfectly so Jake Paul has good ice. Yeah, he's getting better He's getting better and shout out to Mike Tyson or fighting a kid who's 30 years like for me. I'm 38 and I've grappled kids who are fucking 2022 the mod of strength that how fast they are like I can keep up because I'm athletic Yeah, but fuck me man. Oh my god damn you little motherfuckers So so I go Imagine like a session of fight We'll see. I mean, and that's like I said, there's no disrespect to Mike and Jake Paul But I have Jake Paul one in this fight just because my Tyson's 58 like you know age is a number and as we all know when you work out You I'm not gonna lie. Yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna be like when I'm 58. Yeah, I sure hang on fight some of who's 30 years Other than me I mean look dude, I you know We'll see that's what watch the fight All comes out to Friday. Yeah, I'm excited dude and and you know I've been always a Mike Tyson fan you know like when I grew up the world stopped when Mike Tyson thought bro Like it's stopped. Yeah, it's gonna stop Friday too. Yep, and and I'm excited about it, you know, and I would hate to see Mike Tyson get knocked out because I'm Mike Tyson fan Yeah, but fuck this is gonna be It's gonna be interesting. Yeah, we'll see me guys. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments I think it could go the other way like real quick too. Yeah, like I think Mike Tyson could walk to the center of the ring and fucking Knock this dude to fuck out piece of the mixture, baby. Yeah, like it could go that way. Yeah, but I think if they get into a boxing rhythm Jake's definitely in a in a in a driver's seat. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I agree Jake Paul doesn't suck. No, that's a lot of people got to understand Jake Paul does not suck a boxing. Yeah He's a great boxer. He's a good. He has a good jab good eyes We need to do the Mike Perry and that's and this is the thing about a lot of people understand is like And yeah, it's telling Mike Perry is fucking Mike Perry's bad ass bad ass. Yeah The thing about boxing is that that is the culture of boxing you pad your record, right? You look at uh What's a Jovante Davis Ryan Garcia you look at uh all those guys they pad their record they pad their record then eventually these guys meet Right, uh Earl Spencer They finally meet and they fight and then they go their separate ways Um, and that's what Jake Paul is doing. He's padding his record where in MMA for my culture you don't get to pad your record Yeah, I just see as what it is. It is what it is like your my first fight at WC was fucking Brad Picket And I was on the feet it as an amateur and a professional Brad Picket hat like you know probably 25 and two Fucking on a tear. I don't get to dictate that so When boxing you get to dictate that and I think that probably puts a lot of bad taste in people's mouths Where it jigg Paul's like I'm gonna be a boxer. I'm not gonna have any control of my career. I'm Anyharns. I hate we got a fight for you this we're gonna fight I think that's gonna be his next move. He's gonna have to move into that. I agree. I agree And I'm excited. He does I'll be I'm a coach Excited to dude, you know because I remember talking to him like and right when he was getting into it And you know, he was very serious about it. Yeah, and I was like I kind of walked away and I was like Hmm Yeah, like I didn't know what the fucking thing. Yeah, and now he's fucking doing this. Yeah, it's pretty awesome dude Yeah, back to what Jake Paul has done for boxing now boxing is an Netflix platform. Yeah, you can't take that away from him He's done things Yeah, he's done things for boxing that people like Eddie her and you know, that I've been in the boxing sport for so many years That they couldn't even do yeah, right like he's You know Branch and out and making things happen because now if Netflix has a successful show On Netflix, it's gonna give history making it's history making it's gonna give more Boxers young boxers an opportunity to have another platform to fight for Instead of you know The zone, you know at one point you had HBO. Yeah, Cinemax showtime yet all these bigger organization now It's another place for people to go and be able to fight. Yeah, so I'm excited to bro. Yeah, we shall see what you pick I'll got Tyson you do yeah, I got Tyson. Okay. Hey, don't just pick because he's black. It's okay Well, you're gonna say that DJ fucking hates black people. I do DJ's racist That DJ ladies jumping not me I mean we do kind of look a lot. I was gonna put your like Look like you ate little DJ Baby picture man, no, I got I got size you guys do look alike a little bit. Yeah, can't you yeah, I'm off my dad Oh shit I got I got Tyson and only for one reason man you guys know that I get to famous interview Back in his glory days though I think one of the reporters said some some dumb shit to him from the crowd To the dude like I will fuck you in the asshole I'm sorry. I just don't feel like that just disappears It just doesn't go away. I will fuck you And you go like it like you gonna love you. Call me daddy Yeah Listen, you can like that does not have a different level That is a different like that's just different. Jake you better wait Listen man, like I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I got I got Tyson I think it's a fucking 50 feet bro. I think what are the odds or the odds close? No, but Vegas the same. I think Jake's the favorite But fuck dude. Oh my guys. Let us know what you guys think down in the You better wait bro Hey after I have that car. I'm gonna be more pumped to watch you It's gonna be crazy, man. But yeah guys, let us know down in the comments what you guys think Uh about Tyson and Paul with that being said man. Let's get into our main headlines Guys remember if you want to see any of these articles pictures links videos go to Andy for seller.com We link them all there for you. So with that being said, man. Let's get to our first headline headline number one Oh, Helena moan reats trump. Thanks Biden for smooth transition during white house meeting Um, so they met for the first time. I guess in some in some time Um president elect trump and president Biden both pledged a smooth transition between administrations as they met Had the white house on Wednesday morning quote. I look forward to having a smooth transition We'll do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated what you need President Biden set us cameras and reporters were briefly allowed in the oval office for a meeting speaking Second trump emphasize uh that quote Politics is tough in the many cases. It's not a very nice world Uh, but it's a nice world today. I appreciate very much the transition that's so smooth It will be as smooth as it can get and I very much appreciate that the farmer and future president At it um, I'll be honest. That's probably that. I don't know what the fuck Biden's face is there Um, bro. He's just happy get the fuck out of there He's like these last four years of sucked, bro He's like I had a deal with Kamala You know, he's like hey, I voted for you buddy All you know, he did too. Look at that motherfucker. He fucking definitely voted for for trump You the vote for trump or you just shit himself again. Yeah, maybe it's one of those. I mean, I hope the transition is smooth You know, I'm happy that You know the american people has spoke in a voted for Donald trump to be in the office and I'm happy that the The old administration are gonna hand over the power smoothly and as it should be and uh I'm excited to see what trump's gonna do You know when he was in to begin with um a lot of my values aligned with his values And they still to do today and I'm just excited to see I see calls it the golden era of this country So I'm excited to see what happens. Yeah, I don't see man. I'm excited too If they let him in office, man, it's just I still got the same fucking weird like Everybody's excited and I appreciate that and I'm excited too But god dude, I can't shake this feeling in my gut like like these people are gonna do some super fucked up shit like I I don't man I don't know. I mean, dude. They've done a lot. So that's what I'm saying bro And they're being way too quiet and way too cool and like they're you know making these faces and shit. It's dude. It's one It's it's either it's either one they are terrified Because he's gonna hold them accountable for the shit that they did and they're trying to smooth it out and be like hey We're cool. We're cool. It's all good or Too they got some fucking bullshit plan and they know it's coming yeah, and it's one of those things because they're not acting normal You know, I still think it's the same thing I've been saying dude. I think they're gonna fucking kill this dude They're gonna be like oh look around it. Yeah, and then they're gonna say oh you guys are voted for Trump. We have to avenge Trump And you know by the way, it's free and fair elections look he won You know, and I just feel like they're so they get the war they get the people on their side I don't know man Maybe I'm just being hypersensitive to it because it's been so fucked up The last four years You know started with COVID and just kept going and uh Maybe I'm just maybe maybe I'm reading too much into it man, but I haven't been wrong on much and it's just like a feeling I have yeah, well, I think the reason why they're probably acting all weird and quieting shit is because I feel They got caught with their pants down. Yeah, they're in the ocean, but ask naked the tide fucking receipts, and it's like oh That's what's really big. Definitely could be yeah, I mean the mainstream media is done You know the trust is gone, you know like you got the views getting hammered the view girls are fucking stupid Hey, I got a job for you dude A second host on the fucking show do it the major is the man here. I mean don't Yeah, girls. I just say you have to move here from Seattle. I know that sounds horrible I mean, I you know, I'm on x twitter whatever it's called. Yeah, and I see fucking these girls You know what they're all they're all look gorgeous. They're they're probably amazing moms on that stuff But some of the stuff they talk about and you know a lot of stuff the new Tom Holland the new border sees I love that guy. It's like and him him sitting there and fucking girlbuel It is against the law to come to this country as an illegal alien that is that code was written before my time And it'll always be there. It's every other country in the world Bro, you tried without a fucking license. You are brick in a law You are you have signed up to become a criminal right if I try to go to Canada and live in Canada right now Without having green papers. I am a legal alien and they would deport my ass Why is that such a big deal to understand it's not it's not right so when he said that okay, you can't come To America the correct way through immigration and all that stuff get your papers right So why not do that but a lot of them don't want to do it Then I heard another conversation is that a gentleman who is who came over to America the two of these guys. Yeah, they came over here the correct way They get pissed off when they see the people come over here illegally and they go you know how long I had to wait To get my paperwork done and how much it costs how much it costs and you think you could just jump the fucking line Yeah, I'm fucking pissed because you basically discredited all the work I had to do to get here right and that was the first time I heard that perspective I was like and he put in the reference of like going to Disneyland He goes if I wait in the line for three hours to get on you know magic mountain And the use come up and cut me get you think I'm okay with that fucking scooter Yeah He's like you do be okay with that so the view not talking like that Trying to pin in in in the light where it's like well these people need a better life now bro It's all bullshit. Let's let's cut the bullshit and let's get straight forward like And my buddy bibi on a Fernandez he Came he lived in Brazil Brazilian lost he left in the jungle for a very long time Then one day he ended up in Canada and he was like oh, I love this country this country's amazing And he had his green card and he was working up there But he went through the right process in order to get his legal uh his citizenship in Canada So he's a Canadian citizen and he knows all the provenance he went through the correct way And yeah They're and they're in in in in Canada. I love some bro. That's what America's made up like you know my ancestors came through Ellis Island you know I'm saying like This guy they came from Bosnia he came from India. Yeah, you know these dudes went through all this process and Let's be real dude. It's not about They don't understand these fucking guys understand exactly what this is about. This is about them bringing people that will vote for their side For eternity. Yeah, and when they sit on TV in the view and they're like oh my god. This is so morally Bad and you know, it's so rude and it lasts compassion They're lying to our faces these people are not stupid. They they think their audience is stupid Which apparently it must be Yeah, because bro they eat it up You know and then you get all these wine drinking You know brunch bitches out here telling you you're a bad person because yeah Because you don't want people coming here illegally and then they'll say shit like well who's gonna cut the grass and I'm like well who's fucking racist Yeah Who's gonna clean your toilets and form all your vegetables. Yeah, that's what Kelly Osborne said on the fucking And that's what my sister said but when before she passed she goes you find something else to pick your vegetables I like I'm sure we could find somebody it's not hard, right? But I think the whole scope of things and while you're talking about mainstream media is dead Yeah, and that's the reason right there. You have a guy like Tom. I'm a he goes guys like I know the code like he was drilling a woman on AOC growing her Growing her oh she gave up the she gave up Yeah, it's like let's cut the bullshit. He goes if if I'm an American says it if I'm at home and there's a message domestic violence And the cops come they're gonna separate me from my child. That's right. They're gonna about CPS Chopper tech to services, right? And you're telling me we can't do that for obviously. I don't want Uh illegal alien being separated from his mom and nobody wants nobody wants that right nobody want listen We got to deal with what is yes not with what's ideal right of course nobody wants that you don't want that I don't want that he doesn't want that yeah But at the same time we don't want 20 million mother fucking military Terriage males in our country. It shouldn't be here. Yeah exactly and and That's part of the why part of the why is they tell these people The tell the good-hearted America people Because they are good-hearted. That's why they you know, they tell these people like look You know these people are families. They're not fucking families. They're fucking military age males coming here And where do you think they're gonna get the women that you know, they're not gonna They're not uh bringing their families with them You know, you know what I'm saying and then all the women are like rooting for this like Dude, it just makes our entire system more dangerous more uh likely to have conflict it's just and and the good people with good hearts believe it But those people on the view they fucking know why they're pushing that agenda. Yeah. Yeah. It's not because they feel sorry for those people And the fact like you know, that's something excited for the new administration with Tom Homme How he's like dude like I'm fucking shutting this shit down. I love it. He goes I have no problem. You come to the country. I want you to come this country the correct way Yeah, and he goes the cartels Fucking you your your your terrorists now. He goes you know, I says I'm a fuck you like yeah, let's fuck you with ass So I'm excited, but I think with the view I think like oh you have a heard them talk about like can you guys like see This shit they need type of goes girls. Can you believe that Kamala Harris paid Beyonce 10 million dollars to go perform Can you believe that girl's like what what do you think about that? They're not saying that shit. They're not gonna say that shit Right then they're gonna talk about you know Make an Italian get paid to many dollars. You got thing is like what I'll sharp didn't got paid half a million Yeah, it's like Oprah got paid a million. Yeah, it's like what are we doing like and then they lie about it That's the part that that pisses me off the moon Oprah try to lie Oprah try to fuck oh, I did not get paid It's all it's that it's that company Yeah, it's almost like why not if I was over there like yeah, I got fuck you got damn right I got paid I took that can't pay money because Why not and that's that's where the American people lose trust in American media because all that bullshit, and you know shout out to Elon Musk for buying fucking you know Twitter and X and it's just just being honest and you know I just think that's where Life needs to go is everybody being honest if you want to come to the country Please come come the right way. We we support you and we need to take care of our own like we take care of our own There's no reason why People who need aid that are our own American people that are trying to get aid right and try to better their lives They need to come first They need to come first after that then we can help everybody else like my house comes first If I can make donations to the school or anything like that I'm gonna do my best but my house needs to eat first and we need to be comfortable before we take everybody else because Ain't nobody gonna take care of my family better than I am and that's how it is in America Nobody's helping out in America if we get into fucking war right who's gonna come to our aid nobody who we're the only mother Fuckers in the world bro that work the way we work and then pay the taxes we pay and then have those tax dollars Go overseas yep instead of spend here on our people. Yep It's absurd. Yeah, imagine it's like it's like it's like okay. All right All right Andy you made this amount of money you got to pay about you know 500,000 of taxes But you know we're gonna do any really we're gonna give you a discount if you put Uh 30% back into your own ecosystem. Yeah, I want you to better your your your your employees life If you want to do all that stuff, we don't want to take that you know that whole 50% because we're gonna sit in over somewhere else Yeah, if you could you imagine how much the economy would be stronger? Just like dude like people don't understand that it's this is why I really like The appointments of Vivek and Elon getting appointed in the uh The government efficiency It would have been called a doja Government efficiency, right and here you go like when they said you have the most richest man in the world Endorse Trump he didn't get paid a dime. Yeah, and that a dime to in fact he was spending money Spend a money right and the fact like we were like oh he's buying an election He was no he was paying people a million dollars to support the Constitution of the first amendment I believe it was right. Yeah, that has nothing to do with register for voting the rest of our voting right it's like Like the whole thing and like oh, it's like you need a license to fucking drive But you don't need a license to vote. Yeah, like what is that? I? It's just oh you have a license. Yeah, I got license that yeah I just wonder no mine. Well, I mean Apparently, you know these liberals that you know they say black people don't know how to get ideas I don't know where to go. Yeah, or or use a computer You know just just a lot of interesting things that the way the country Is and which gonna go and I'm just excited to see I am too dude I know I know because I think these dudes are gonna wreck they're gonna wreck the bureaucracy And bring it down to a manageable point I know for a fact that Vivek shares a lot of the views that we're talking about here I know that I know I mean he's been on the show we talk semi-regularly about this exact thing and the cool thing about Vivek and first of all look what you on day with twitter He got rid of all the bullshit trimmed alive. Okay, he understands how to do that He's a very successful businessman. He runs some of the biggest most profitable companies in the world And then you have Vivek who is also a self-made very very wealthy man And he understands constitution better than almost anybody I've ever talked to you So you combine those two ideas about how to shrink the government and then Vivek's knowledge of how to actually do it I'm very excited because dude I know Vivek talks about a 10% tax and if we to your point Yeah, if we only paid 10% in taxes think what your fucking life would look like The economy and the jobs and the pay scale yeah, and people's ability to afford things like The you know these guys on the left they keep blaming like the grocery people and the greedy oil people and they're Dude that's not what it is the who's greedy as our government And they take our money they make us work Then they take the money and they send it overseas so they can funnel it back to themselves in some way shape or form through Political campaigns or you know to companies. They don't stock in sometimes. I'm sure they probably just steal it right directly And we don't know about it. They have to show companies different you know all this different shit That shit all has to stop dude. This this bitch A warrant If she is author gray stock with the split Leadership two people who do the work of one person. Yeah, this seems really efficient The beautiful thing that they're probably gonna do it for free. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say Yeah, do you think you think they're like oh, hey, hey, Trump here's my w2 or my 1098 semi-final The vape's not saying and certainly not Elon but the vape is not saying hey give me my $140,000 a year. Yeah, like my government salary those are the people I I want working where they're like I've made my wealth Yeah, I have yes, I want to make sure when I leave this earth Isn't it better place and you get stuff set in place those are people I want to work for the country I don't want some of you who's showing up to collect a paycheck, right? Yeah, that's what I love about that Paycheck and fucking flipping it you know, I mean dude Elizabeth Warren makes two hundred and eighty five a year And what does she do?

Yeah, right I can if somebody goes all you're horrible for saying that and And then I never were the majority bro. Yeah, well the thing that makes me even drives me insane is like my father-in-law He was a marine my dad. He served the military. He did like 25 years. He retired my stepdad So I've been around military family my whole entire life. I grew up as a military kid So like when I see people burning the American flag as like dude if you don't like the country then get the fuck out Get the fuck out like if you don't like the way we run in shit like we like I'm running it But how our Americans how Americans are running it get out. Yeah, dude. Just leave like I totally I've allowed some some of my tax taxes to go to that. Oh, yeah, like for well, he just tell it home in it to Oh to help give me Go to getting Americans out of this country that don't want to be here rather than Want to fucking Ukraine. God, you're gonna fucking Israel. You know, you know, yeah I would allow my taxes to go to that. Yeah, a deep American deportation. Yeah, yeah, like 50 bucks. Yeah Oh, they're flying spirit Like fucking We'll buy you a canoe And we'll stick it in the ocean. We're fucking shove y'all yeah because like when I see them They'll come back. Yeah, right? I see them burning the American flag. I'm like like you don't love the country Not only that bro. It's fake oppression like oh, I'm so oppressed It's like most fucking you're making a video crying on a $2,000 fucking phone. Yeah, there are people where he's from That fucking cannot fucking eat. Yep. Okay. They're pissing and shitting in a hole. Yeah in the ground. Yep You know what I mean? They're riding ten deep on a fucking scooter. Yep, but you know those those That's true shit man. I was in the middle of it. No bro. He fucking did it Yeah Seven people I think by I think people The American people who who say they're oppressed they haven't traveled outside for sure The country to see that right like when you actually go out there and you take these like I tell my kids all the time They're like, oh, just go to Mexico. Yeah, just go to Mexico and look at a little kids come up to you Sell and fucking gum. Yeah, you know, yeah, or or when I was a manila the kid came up to me try to sell me a goldfish Yeah, I was like anybody as I got a tank dog when we do the goldfish But here's five books and bucks. He went off But people who haven't seen that or experienced that they don't know what True press is right they don't know that right and that's what drives me saying and I'm like I don't want to see here and think that I know everything But the way I feel about certain situation about The way the world is and the economy and what the last administration is done and what the view does It's like guys cut the bullshit if he's breaking a law then he's breaking a law like there is no way between and if it's a law That was put in a place by four far there's that we have to respect it. We yeah Something isn't it, you know, you're driving drunk you want you have to have car insurance It's against a law. Yeah, you get pulled over you don't have car insurance. You're in the fucking ticket If you don't respond to the ticket, guess what you have a fucking a worn out for your rest. Yeah, you don't come to a warrant Go to the court. You're in fucking jail. You don't Yeah, it is what it is. It is what it is. Yeah, right? I But hey, if you don't like the way it is you're more welcome to lead. Yeah, I agree, dude And I'm I'm just a little bit worried about this shit you know because When we talk about you know, we we talk a lot about these people the root of these people is communism and You know part of what's been going on in this country for the last number of years has been a demoralization of our citizenship intentionally and What's what bothers me and what scares me With the position that we're in right now Is that everybody seems to be happy everybody's Optimistic and everybody starting to regain the enthusiasm of being an American patriot right? So what's the easiest way to demoralize someone? It's not to continue to pound them and pound them and pound them and pound them It's to let them up and then fucking pound them again and dude that's what I think Is I think they're gonna try to do that in some way shape or form because you know give everybody hope give everybody hope And then fucking take it away And that's what makes me nervous Yeah, man, yeah, I think the only way that I That can happen is that like let's see once You know trump gets in office and they just start fucking cleaning house They just start like they go to calirados like you've been as well a gang get fucking ready And they just and they show all of them just fucking wiping them out. Yeah, like go to ways They can show up They put their hands up. Yeah Cuff yeah, we could third world this shit We can scatter your fucking brains everywhere. Yeah, so it's too late and it's all gonna be you know Predicate on how the media does it yeah, like imagine if all their deportation and then we're throwing on a ground Get the fuck out of here that it out, but if we did it Civil and man away. It's like hey guys like Do you have you have a green card? Do you have a paper? So you don't unfortunately? Okay, well, let's get you in this this truck We'll get you to a nice site and we'll get you home nice and safe and thank you. Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen I know but but if it comes in like Then Go like then you got the view is this what you guys want it to happen You remember you guys ask for this. Yes, yeah, it is And then I'm gonna spin it and there's gonna make us feel like as we are but dude We just got to we just got to own it and be like yeah, yeah, yes, yeah Like when you just own shit nobody can say yeah sure. Yeah, yeah exactly right? So I think Yeah, that's what we wanted we wanted them gone now. They're gone. Yeah Well, I mean, there's a statement man There's a Famous quote it's like you know, everybody wants bacon nobody wants to see how it's made It's not gonna be pretty yeah, I'm saying but I'd rather have that you know as ugly as brutal as it is gonna be ugly Yeah, I would rather have it's gonna be hard for people to stomach dude It is but I'd rather have that and then have to worry about my wife or my daughters. Oh being fucking assaulted But I'm so glad that's not supposed to be here. Yeah, or be able to go out in your own city I go out to dinner with your fucking family. I'll take the bacon. Yeah, I'm the same way. Yeah, I think like if we're gonna get demoralized Yeah, like that's where it's come with people gonna see how the bacon is made. Yeah, I'm like oh the fuck right, but you know you could choose me Go to fucking go to fucking Canada Yeah, yeah, no you're right absolutely so I like I said I'm excited and I hope That I hope everything goes smooth and I I guess I'm excited like I was gonna happen Like when I see Tom Hallman he goes and he he grilled aoc and he goes the fucking code section of that and then I like she goes she goes Okay, I think He goes I'm holding up the cost to shit and then I love when he's like Another guy was like do you care about me because I've served this fucking country It's like like JD Vance big fan of him. He was like like I've always felt that someone who's gonna be power Other country has to serve in military. I just think it's good right to actually put the boot have a perspective Have a perspective like guys. I have been over there. Yeah, and they don't fucking play like yeah, you know and uh I'm excited for him because he he was a marine and Well, I mean bro you should have some perspective on sending other people's Children to war. Mm-hmm, you know, and that's one of these things like um, you know, Trump says this about Liz Cheney. Yes, you know, he's like bro She has no perspective of violence like when you got called out for that thing that he said yep Like it first of all is total bullshit when he said was And he made I said this the right way, but what he was saying was Let's take some of these politicians like Liz Cheney who loved to go to war and let's put them on the front Fuckin lion's deal much. They like it. Yep. That's what he should have said yep And it's true. Yeah, she has no perspective of violence. She's never gotten her fucking ass beat You know, I don't think so and certainly not like men do yeah, right like in the way that we grow up and the way that we fucking deal with other men and how So there's a natural respect that men have we like so we understand there's consequences to violence Naturally through the way that we grow up and if you put someone man or woman who doesn't ever have that perspective in charge of a military now we're sending people To die and looking at a spreadsheet. We're not understanding the actual repercussions Someone's son or father or sister Going overseas and not coming back that like that's a big responsibility that we should not take lightly and you know That's why I can't stand these motherfuckers like Lindsey Graham who are always on TV calling to go to war and shit man Fuck you you go to war. Yeah, yeah I never forget when I was drawing up. I had a boss Super hardcore hardcore Republican you love I hope he's so alive. I'm not sure but he I worked at a golf course and I'll sweep and at the time there was nobody there He'll sit there. You know listen to news read the newspaper and there's five like early 95 maybe 98 95 or not and he had A my said he goes He goes you know how do you get rid of age DJ? I was like no, he goes you take everybody who has age you put on the fucking island Let him die A's would be gone, right? Then he was like when we go we went to Iraq we're having all that stuff. He goes Fucking pitiful. It's just it's just horrible like what's wrong? His name is ed gleason and he goes You know how you take care of this war? I was like how he goes you pull every america's hissing out of there You fucking bomb it you just bomb it and he goes and I was like you should have killed him He goes well the ideology of these people is to hate and he goes and we're over there fighting a war For oil whatever may be what do you think their kids are gonna do when they when they're gonna get older? You didn't like oh wouldn't it change Centuries is centuries a century but if you go over there and you bomb it and you swipe out of the face of earth Granit, you know, I'm a child at this point. Yeah, listen to an adult. Yeah, who's like, you know, give my first job I'm like I sit down and like that is kind of interesting you would never have Hopefully the word as you never have AIDS And then you would never have this ideology that always wants to spread hate or have their own way like woman You can't read you can't do that it's like we have a great relationship with Japan What's that yeah, yeah, exactly because what do we do? We drop the fucking mom and I'm in there like you don't fucking do anything yeah like So well, I mean look there has to be an establishment of respect for that to happen yeah, but I you know, I used to think that same shit dude But then I realized like We're going there and we're like fucking with their ship and like like how would we feel this time? I can't fuck Yeah, like like broke and and that lens to your argument like it it solidifies it because like dude What if we were here and we're all sitting here talking right now. We're like yeah The fucking all those Chinaman came over here and they killed my fucking dad and you're like yeah, bro They got my fucking brother. I mean fucking that right forever forever forever dude and like that's the problem with you know us being the The you know iron fist of globalist, which is what our country has become we are no longer well I think we're getting back to this now, but for a while for a long while we have been We have been told To be patriotic and we have been told that we are the good guys and I'll be real dude I don't know that we've always been the good guys. I think we've been and I think our soldiers are the good guys I think our people are the good guys, but we are Manipulated to go fight a lot of these wars and a lot of this shit Based upon pretenses that aren't good or true. Yeah, or even true. I mean that's the other That's the problem dude and that's why when Trump was in office you have any fucking wars Because he understands that now, you know, we shouldn't be sending guys over These other places because these fucking douchebags are gonna make some money dude Yeah, I think I'm hard to see and like you guys can correct me if I'm wrong like you know you you talk about We're on the subject of war you look what's going on in iran with the israel Hamas on stuff and it's like okay You know One side of Uh Hamas they started a war with uh the other side right dropping in a fucking parachute Fucking killing people for no read for for a war. Let's be going on for so so so long, right Now am I wrong that we should not get involved like I feel like no we shouldn't get involved no right because Now when we have fucking hundred thousand fucking veterans on the street and like we got all these problems over here bro Like I agree with you. We should be America first. Yeah, we shouldn't get in the bubble because we had nothing to do with that right But I feel and my dad was teaching me. He's like it's called like a proxy war right like exactly where you know Russia Russia stop buying oil from us or Reese something happened, but now Russia was like you know why we buy oil from America that that sounds that sounds pretty good now right I heard her come out and say that LNG Um, but it's like that's what makes me sad. It's like okay. We have These two part of the world they're fighting each other because they want it like Russia and Ukraine Russia wants Ukraine and they want to become that powerhouse again and then we're sitting a to Ukraine. It's like fuck man. It's like If you do it then now Russia goes why you send a fucking money like yeah, you want these problems right or it's like I feel like we're in its condunge I was like how do you solve world peace, but when we cannot you know where you got to take away the profits. Yeah, that's that's the thing It's this is all about money bro. Yeah, these motherfuckers at the top Raytheon Uh, lucky Boeing these guys are some of the biggest lobbyists in the world they they contribute to these political campaigns political campaigns Pay them X amount over like let's say a bomb really cost thousand bucks making it up. Yeah, they pay a million bucks And they get to keep half of the over and then they redone it you know, so like You know what I'm saying? So so the bomb they they bill us a million dollars when it really only cost a Thousand the 999 thousand this left over they split right and they take that so then Lockheed or whatever like I'm speculating lock Yeah Using them as a placeholder then they take that that half of that 500 grand right and they donate that shit into various political campaigns so that the wars continue to operate and like dude We take away the ability to for these politicians to get donations from the military industrial complex from big form Yeah, now yeah, that has to be eliminated dude Because if we take away the profits then there's no incentive. Yeah, right now we're thinking with our heads Not our fucking greedy, you know dicks, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, like it's kind of crazy like if that's true He puts her out there again If that's true, it's like damn they they they were there fighting and killing each other just for profits and money It's like you you thought parachuting down on people who have a good festival was Okay to to make money like yeah, that's why I'm confused. Well, I mean, I think the issue is bro Like I mean you're a good dude. Yeah, where most people are good people And sometimes there's like there we could be naive to assume that like evil exists Evil people fucking exist. Yeah, there's bacon that has to be made. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? There's people like who could care less at the end result because they're so far removed from having to deal with those issues Right, I mean even the Israel You know Palestine conflict like pro israel as a country right Is one of the strongest most affordable like formidable countries defense-wise. Yeah both geographically I mean the shit the the technologies that they have How did how would like bro a cockroach cannot cross the border into Israel without Israel knowing yeah How do these guys fucking how you know saying so like yeah, not really that let you know like there's just so much Look you can you can't talk about the truth of Israel because everybody calls you anti-Semitic It's not it's so it's so aggressively defended socially in conversation That nobody can talk about it and that's a big problem You know we talk about all the time. Yeah, but the thing is is that because it's not against Jewish people It's against the fucking corrupt government just like our American people is not our American government The Jewish people are not the fucking Israeli government either. Okay, so the Israeli government Straight up fucking lies Okay, they're killing all these kids. They're fucking Do it but then we don't you know we hear oh Hamas flu. They're fucking paragliders over our Supposedly in Inpatrible dire dome right we we we we fucking blew up a cockroach yesterday with the 50 cow But these guys flew over defense and undetected yeah, all right, and then we don't talk about like the The conflicts that have been happening in the street where you know is uh IDF soldiers have been like fucking just harassing and and shooting kids for throwing a rock at them, you know shit like that like There's there's no effort there for any sort of reconciliation and it's a big problem because How do you solve that right and so like dude? We can't just like we can't just say oh is reals the good guys and These guys are the bad guys like it's just not that simple. It's just not simple Every conflict that's ever been fought in the history of time Do you think either side thought they were the bad guys? No, you know He's saying I was like we're the fucking bad guys Yeah, like dude they think they're in the right and eight and the other side thinks they're right It's hard to solve that conflict when it's been going on for a thousand years Especially when you start throwing some fucking money in there. Yeah, I actually even more complicated And so like dude, it's really frustrating that people just jump on either side of the thing But I will and I do jump on a side, but the side ain't either one of their sides. Right. It's our fucking side It's your kids. It's your kids. It's all these people here It's our fucking citizens in this country who work their entire lives to pay the government money to just get squandered and Stolen and fucking funnel back into these people's pockets Bro, we are oppressed financially by our own government and we have a chance right now for that to all get on Wow, and it's very exciting because dude. I really am a believer of the vac I don't know any of these other guys personally really Eric Schmidt Andrew Bailey, but I really think he's I think these dudes are gonna do this and bro if if if Elon and Vivek do what they know how to do We're gonna be freed from our oppressive government. It's very exciting. It's gonna be fucking awesome man guys They go nage it's for real dude for real and people people that are against it like saying oh, I can't believe they put you on in there Why you're a fuck not you're gonna fucking love it when you're taking home twice as much money dude And you're you're not struggling the way you are and all these other things that we've had to deal with yeah for somebody For somebody who's willing to spend his own money to put to get us in space Right is only the and give starlink. I want to give starlink to everybody if you're in Africa and you have internet I want you to have internet. Yeah, why would you want that motherfucker on our side? Yeah, it well my blown him It's like guys if he was like I want to give people starlink so they can just you know, well they're gonna spy on them Then yeah, maybe not bro. They hate you on for a very simple reason. It's this Okay, I'm an American Oh shit yeah, technically we're so racist. I mean, where's all the D. I people? Oh, you got a Indian in a fucking man. Yeah, you're not gonna roof. Yeah, what the fuck is that shit? Yeah, you guys bought your hypocrites So dude here's the thing Trump's D. I. Yeah, it's here's the thing about Elon Okay, Elon took their main weapon away from them and their weapon was Twitter and they were allowed for years over decade to run Twitter Unibated with favorable algorithms for their opinions and suppression of everybody else's Elon came in and said no, we're not doing that We're gonna see the real temperature and so he took away their biggest advantage which was the advantage of illusion Okay, they had the advantage as a small vocal minority To appear as if they were the majority because of the technological algorithms that were being put down across across all social media Elon exposed that so and that this is why they fucking hate him so much because now Just like you said they're they're in the ocean and the ocean is receded. Yeah, and it's you know There are a bunch of little soy Triple dicks yeah, right man. I got a big thing. He goes, are you do? Yeah, that's the type of goes. Oh shit I actually tucked it in see the water cold That's right dude But that's the truth Yeah, and so they are exposed and they don't fucking like it. No, so that's that yeah You know and dude these other social media companies are gonna have to follow suit in fact dude I can tell you I know Metta's doing it because my story views are fucking triple what they were even the day before Trump's election So legitimately trip. I believe it. Yeah, I believe it. Well, and here's the thing I'll never forget what Elon must up And he goes are you gonna try to bribe me with money go fuck yourself. Yeah, go fuck yourself Yeah, and that's one of the things I love about him is that no, he's not he's not corruptible. He's not corruptible No, right. How do you corrupt their cop? Hey man? I'll give you all this cocaine Yeah, you can sell it and roof up it. Yeah, but the cop was like no, I got I got plenty of money by kids Yeah, no, that's also why we should be taking tax dollars and paying these fucking cops what they deserve to be paid bro They do the most dangerous job in the world. They deal with all these drunks all these alcoholics the the problems of society They have all this they see all this horrible shit and we're paying them fucking 70 grand. That's fucking bullshit, bro But we're sending Hundreds of billions of dollars to all these causes all over the world. How about this? How about take some of that fucking money and give it to our our people who actually keep order in society and pay them well So that they they are comfortable They're able to deal with the bullshit and and they're not have to like bro Imagine being a cop and having to deal with all this bullshit and then deal with fucking money at home That's fucked up dude. That's not right like when you put in that perspective like imagine like It's like hey, hey, you're crane. We're not gonna see you all this mind. We we got to take care of our own If people like how could you do that? It's like bitch. I'm trying to make sure Johnny on the street is getting You know so much money that he's here willing to keep you safe and all that stuff I wonder what if what if we were paying what if these police officers made 200 300 grand off of the fucking government. What kind of people would we attract to be cops a lot of people great people We're like you think I'm gonna come when I was a kid It was a popular thing to say I want to be a cop. I want to be a firefighter. I want to be a teacher Well, we have to create those careers to be uh, you know financially Beneficial enough to attract people to want to do that.

Charming guy. We sit down and have some drusa. Hey I got my own island dude. I got my plane right here. Yeah, I'm the Karen the fucking five minutes you guys want to go Fuck let's go. Yeah, okay, so we fly down to fucking Epstein island. We're drinking a whole time We get there. It's beautiful Fucking we're having drinks this at the other and then all of a sudden there's some girls to show up right and the girls to show up You know, they look young 25 hot, but they're 15, okay, and Then they get they get you on film doing all kinds of shit Whatever you do and if you don't have to be much, you could just be fucking socializing with them They're gonna rub in your shoulder. Yeah, yeah Then you fucking leave and then you get a phone call the phone call goes like this Hey, hey DJ I'm gonna need you to make this post I'm not fucking making that post. I don't believe in that shit. Yeah. Oh, well here. Look at this Here's this video of you doing that, okay, and this is how they do that shit This is why when when celebrities like crisis has happened such as COVID, okay? You have all the big celebrities all of them saying the same three or four lines, right? So this all of the shit This is my opinion. I don't I actually know this to be true From people who know it to be true, but I'm gonna say it's my opinion Epstein diddy two sides of the same coin Epstein was for the wealthy business industrialists the CEOs the big big dogs. Yeah big dogs Diddies for the entertainment industry, okay, all the celebrities all that so when you could coordinate The the Titans of industry. Yep with celebrity culture and control the narrative That's how you get all this fucking communist progressive shit out as and to become popular That's what I'm observing and what I've heard from people that would know And what happens when you don't want to post that tweet or post that you know I'm saying what happens when you don't go along with the narrative. Yeah, they're gonna fucking remove you get outcast Yeah, no longer the big Emma May fighter. You're no longer the fucking you don't get the movies in Hollywood You don't get the record labels. You know you get outcast it. Yeah, and we've seen that with plenty of people in the industry that like you know All of a sudden look at Mel Gibson. They're just out hold on look at Mel Gibson Mel Gibson is one of the greatest actors greatest producers greatest writers ever Okay, they kick him out of Hollywood because he's he fucking says this is the way it is And then he goes on and funds his own successful movies Not everybody can do that. Yeah, now the other part of it too, man is that like you know That's just Epstein and Dady that we know about because many more those two industries like yes There's one in the in the in the fucking country music industry. There's gonna be like bro. They're all Yeah, so I don't I don't think I don't think it was ever that they were onto them. Yeah, I think what happened was They got to a point where Too much shit was getting out Like I bet you did he sitting in brit jail right now being like them motherfuckers They fucking fuck me. They had me do all this shit collect all this shit And that's why they kill fucking Epstein and I believe they'll kill diddy too before you get the chance to tell people what the fuck happened I think so too. Yeah, I hope My dad was actually in a no Gibson's last movie bone yard in Vegas I hope I hope that we get to find out because you know growing up in the 90s. I love babbo entertain me I love I love the music. It's great fucking That was beautiful. Thanks man My wife said in tone that but I totally disagree with her But he had all these amazing things and here's you know once again somebody who's in power Makes all this money and then you pull the ocean proceed. Yeah, you know It's like he's got all these fucking skeletons in his head. Yeah, you know in his feet So I'll be curious to see what happens like I'm just wasn't that okay if it wasn't that then why are these people so fucking afraid? I don't know Like why not just like like guys this would happen. Yeah, and we had some freaky fucking parties. Yeah, hey people were doing some weird shit Yeah, but that's that that's that okay. That's what the narrative would be if it wasn't What I'm saying it is yeah exactly that's what mean like I That's the hardest thing right is that we don't we and we might never know the fucking truth Yeah, because all we know if he is in with the agencies the nerve like okay We're gonna release this is this and that's it we're I like to think that the agencies were involved. I would like to think the agencies were like okay, you know What do you keep eye on it? We have a couple things But we make sure what we see is legit, right next you know They read his house they get all the files on stuff. They're like yeah, well, we suspect it was true We have this person there this person there. He was sex trafficking all that stuff and then if that if We hear opinion I want to hear from the horses mouth. I want to hear did he like yeah, man Like I got concourse into doing this type of style of of lifestyle You know the sex trafficking. I'm guilty of all that. Yeah, not one person has ever stepped up and said yeah While motherfucker, yeah, I like the baby oil and all that shit I have farmer Indian vehicles pharmaceutical companies. Yeah, I had them lace that baby oil That's why I had all the bottles 10,000 bottles lace with you know that no HB right just I just want somebody come up and own the shit. Yeah, right? That's why I'm exactly what allowed that to happen Why not because bro? It'll fucking implicate our own agencies Yeah, I'm not with that. I mean like bro They they said it during the Epstein situation the judge said himself like you know all of the witness testimony That was going on during that time like during the Galein Maxwell trial No, they there were names that were named yeah the judge ordered that that should be Active. Yeah. Oh, why wow? Why and was they they said why they said because it implicates too many people when high level positions that are that are Racking implicate them. Well, what was the one thing that at the first time they caught him It was in like a FBI level. Yeah, and then it was like well that was early that was early on Yeah, and then he kept going kept going yeah They need some old spine. We'll take care of it. Then eventually was like okay I took that as a sign that like the FBI was like hey, we've been on for a long time I thank you for this evidence. Yeah, we're gonna let him go because we want a bigger fucking fish that that could be possible That could be possible like hey, you're gonna work for us now. Yeah, you're working at some point He they crossed that over if he wasn't manufactured. Yeah, if it wasn't but like I once again That's what that gave me excited. It's like if deity was working with the agency, right? I like to believe that he wasn't right, but we all don't know But if he was like no, I'm like because imagine that if you All this money you have the biggest fucking parties you get LeBron James coming there Yeah, and then LeBron James, you know LA Lakers and you get him in a room cheating on his wife I've got him doing coke and he goes I got that You got somebody else I got that too. He is all these things in black and his back pocket and for him Egotistically, he's like I'm the I'm the The the The Godfather right on the Godfather I run fucking high because it's done Something's going my way and then especially how he did with Cassie walking out like that somebody who's a power hungry That's always looking for that that that ride Cassie Cassie was the girl that he was dating at the time where there's another one that tried to escape and he pulled her back and Yeah, yeah, it chased her down the hall naked. Yes, I'm like that that right there There's something about that man, right? And then you have JLo somebody said why should we take JLo? Doresmith for common worth for comma when she was around did he at these fucking did he parties and I never warned Anyway about that right so I feel that Diddy is a mastermind behind the closed door that maybe the agency knew about the whole tire of time and they were like, you know what? Nobody's died yet Let's see how long this freak off parties keep on going. It's almost like you know he's robbing the store and nobody's bad I'm like when to keep it in this girl when to see how big this fucking pot can get and then it was like okay guys now it's time Yeah, baby tell me okay, but how how Okay, if that's the case then why has nobody said shit about it until now. I know That's the kicker why not immunity does exist, you know, there's a immunity deals There's you know like that should exist. Yeah, yeah, you know, I'm saying because right now did he's not saying shit So okay cool you guys got the big fish, but like well, why wasn't just him well how The question would be like why hasn't he said anything yet like why haven't they gave him a day court like all right You trial data set for that in the law. We fast forward that day. All right. It's diddy versus New York City or the world Okay, diddy Let's take over this video right here if you fucking plug in this 15 year old girl. Yeah, why don't you split yourself? What's going on here? You know she's under age right like yeah, let it play out. I it's like Torielanes Yeah, they're not gonna do that bro. Well, I like Torielanes like I don't know if you know it's sort of by Torielanes and Mingus Sally But it's like there was four motherfuckers in the car four and All they hurt was gunshots and everybody was like oh Toriel nobody would come out say who did what nobody would come out and then they did The investigation are like all the throwing Toriel behind doors They never got the fingerprints on the gun. They never tested anything everybody just says it was Torielanes And then Megan is Sally's friend just went quiet and it's like The judge won't give him another trial or anything. They're just like We'll put on the uh sweat on the rug. So I feel like there has come point in time that we're gonna have to hear from diddy And just to hear what what the fuck was happening and releasing tapes like was the broad James there was fucking, you know Ray Jay there who was was was who was there right and I Just like they're building up the this suspense of like well, we don't want to hear from diddy or Yeah, I know pizza boxes telling us kids give it to the fucking pizza boxes like me a fuck your pizza boxes. Oh, what's in those pizza boxes? Pizza boxes To back I think there's a lot I think there's a lot here. I think it's a lot deeper than what people think I can't wait. Yeah, I can't wait like even the Epstein Like I didn't know anything about Epstein But when I sat down and watched the doctor me and I was like what the fuck bro when I was in British Virgin Islands I'm sorry US Virgin Islands where his his islands called little St. James and I was down there like 2015. We were out on a boat and we were talking like we went by the island and The captain of the boat, you know, and obviously he could be full of shit Yeah, but he's like he's like yeah, dude. He's like that's one of the biggest sex trafficking operations that's ever existed He's like and there was helicopter landing and he's like you see that helicopter And I'm like yeah, he's like they fly these girls down and then he said that helicopter fly back and force six seven times a day Wow, yeah, he's like and there's always young girls on it like not young girls like 22 Yeah, he's like yes, yeah, I think the unfortunate thing about our society and how the world works is that you never think about you Hear about the black web the dark web you hear about it and you know, I run a discord I run like I have my community and one of the guys wasn't there for a long time. I was like fuck man Where's this guy had the fuck's he at and I have a guy who kind of like does all like the cyber security shit And he goes hey, I want to bring this to your attention. I know you're very busy and he goes hey This is why this guy's been around kind of buying out this guy had so many underage Children on his SD drive that he got off the black web and I'm like what the fuck and I knew this guy hung out with this guy Yeah, yeah, he's been on one of my fights. Bro. I'm like what the fuck is sure enough like then he he was in Military you go in the court and all that stuff and all came out but He his response to him getting caught was how he got caught tell you that real quick is that he took his SD card To a manufacturer that does 3d printing and when you went 3d printing done you take it there like hey This is why I want 3d printed and so you give it to them and they go through the files and they do it right they have a schematics on there He gave them the wrong SD card The SD card had a whole bunch of little children on there, but ask naked And then the girl who took it from him called the authorities yeah, the authorities came to him grab all his shit all his hard drives all that stuff and Is it him Tim Walls? No, it wasn't It wasn't him, but that's where I hit close to home to me That's a fuck the dark web is you hear about all the time. Oh, no, it's real, but for me. That's where he close like the shit Was it on bro? It's out there bro. Yeah, I was out there I told him I was like I said I said of the article is she goes why you send me this picture of this creepy ass dude I was like look closer at the name. She goes what the fuck yeah, and sure enough like so this hits home like what do you yeah? Yeah, you know, you never know dude. You never fuck. Yeah, you never know. We just had a situation where a dude that we knew Got popped by for financial crimes like to the tune of like half a billion fucking dollars Yeah, and this guy. I mean where we knew this is now good Yeah He goes no one he had that guy damn neighbor again. I knew something was fishy But the fuck it works in McDonald's Yeah, good man. Yeah, man guys jumping on this conversation Let's know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline Uh, number three another situation we want to talk about has a new development Daniel Pini situation up in New York That guy the the soldier who who choked out that So there was a guy on subway who was terrorizing the subway. Okay, he restrained him and the guy ended up dying And then they they fucked their prosecuting him for murder. Wow. Yeah, so this happened last year back in June This is the original article New York grand jury and died. It's Daniel Pini and chokehold death of Jordan Neely So this is uh, again, this happened over a year ago But yeah, Daniel Pini's a 24 year old white man was captured On video placing Neely a black farmer street performer with a history of homelessness and mental health issues and a chokehold That turned deadly during a subway ride and Manhattan on May 1st of 2023 Now the footage sparked outrage and protests racial and political overtones Some suggested that Neely's death resembled the 2020 police killing of George Floyd All of this crazy stuff that happened During the trial trials were going on for a minute now They've brought in these use of force experts And I thought that you know, I think we have a use of force expert here I think I am too. I'd love to get your take on some of this stuff that they're they're bringing in um But they they brought this guy in his name is dr. John R. Black a retired police lieutenant and expert witness in cases involving high stress Decision-making and lethal force he broke down the case Says quote a tragedy has occurred on all sides and the best thing that we can do before we pass judgment It's a truly Try to understand how these things occur both from a sense making decision-making standpoint the choices of the actor as well as by An evidence-based standpoint about what truly occurs and what the science shows Um, to regose and talks about these chokeholds. Yep All right, um, he says quote in some places. It's referred to as a lateral vascular neck restraint Which is the idea of shutting down the blood flow Um to the brain black set the blood carries oxygen if that occurs for enough time depending on the person state of arousal How much uh how much under stress they are the person that is having a chokehold applied to them basically they go unconscious Um, he says You continue to say says the quote the crook of the arm cradles the airway does not collapse the airway But the pressure is on the right and left carotid artery Bortensay that's called the lateral vascular neck restraint that causes again a momentary outage and consciousness And the officers are able to safely detain or control the subject otherwise out of control Um, but then they go to say that that's what caused it. That's what caused the death Um, was the lateral vascular neck restraint. Um, now there's other things that have developed in this situation too Apparently one of the guys. Oh go back to read that you got me And I know everything now if I'm gonna give him honest opinion Says chokehold that is what they're saying calls the death Uh, there's a black said that another type of chokehold that is uh, there has a different intent and he says quote in contrast We also use the word chokehold for the shutting down of the airway black set Usually it would normally also occur with some sort of potential damage Um, now Bortensay that the different types of restraints can appear similar on video He said public response to fatal incidents has has led to police departments banning Uh, the lateral vascular neck restraints. So that's quote no matter the what the circumstances the appearances calls an emotional conductive belief that the chokehold is what caused the death Bortensay um And uh, on top of that there's been some some updates apparently one of the guys who actually helped Daniel Penny help uh, to be strained The gentleman um, he lied a little bit about this about his story But he's been getting a lot of support in the courtroom from other witness testimonies are saying like you know This guy was freaking the fuck out. I was scared to death and Daniel Penny kind of restrained him the Daniel Penny didn't uh, I'm sorry Not Daniel, but Jordan nearly did not die on the subway that hours later at the hospital um You know, but he was in a manic episode um, and so there there's a lot of interesting stuff going on. What was the official cause of death? Yeah Like what was that the hot hot attack was there blood and net it was excuse me. It was there uh What's one thing I'm going for? Where's any drugs involved? Uh the taxology report. Was there any you know Was it under the influence? His death was rule go back his death was back his right there His death was ruled a homicide back compression of the net there we go. Okay So From my understanding of applying a choke to so many people is that when you choke somebody out They go unconscious and then the reason why they go unconscious is there's no blood flow to the brain But once you release the chokehold blood flow should resume back to the brain and that's where they have that They they they body re re starts re kicks and they should be fine now In some cases that I've been told is that when you choke somebody out you hold it longer And then the blood doesn't get the opportunity to go back to the brain then you come brain dead and you potentially die There's also cases. I've heard that if somebody has like um, you know a nodger on their brain or aneurism is like we're A blood vessel bows on your brain. I believe um that can also happen or if he was choking him out And let's say he's choking him out of the bow standing up And then he falls asleep. He lets him go he falls down and boom hits his head hard That is another cause of death of the trauma to the head So I think I don't Once again, what's the medical history? What's the topology report was he Ones, you know all that shit plays it. I feel plays a factor But if I was to put this gentleman in a chokehold do and let go When he passed out he should come back to life. Yeah If everything's healthy and his brain's healthy, his heart's good The chokehold should not kill him. I keep that chokehold longer Like you know, so his blood is getting in Yeah, but that's still not collapsing the airway exactly right like you're you're I've been choked out dude. Yeah, like it it fuck I got choked out for fun one time at a party So I want to know what the fuck it was like. Mm-hmm. Row. I gotta lie people shit Yeah Hey, when I was kid I did that Yeah My my buddy John fucking he fought MMA and he I want to see what it was like So he choked me out bro. It was crazy like I was there And he was doing it and then I woke up and and I didn't remember what the fuck he was I didn't remember for like 10 seconds that I had told him to do that. I was like Where the fuck am I like I had woke up from the deepest fucking sleep ever? Mm-hmm say it's like crazy What's that thing you get when you get in surgery? Uh, anesthesia anesthesia. It's like that. It's like yeah You come back and you're like it's in a minute to figure out what's going on Is that why when dudes get knocked out like they wake up and you're like confused? Yeah, yeah, when I got knocked out My was more like a boom and I went numb, but I knew everything I was going on right See my eyes and I fell down and I'm like fuck Gotcha mother fucking his because I was like Did you say that shoot? Yeah I'm sure he didn't go step your mother fucker, but my mind I got remember I hit us oh shit I went down I couldn't move. I just wasn't like numb. Yeah, and my eyes were open and then I I felt the punches hit me was like like hard by can you feel like your body's numb? You just absorb the energy and then after I got there's like Fuck And then the rest comes to me go he was okay, I was like yeah fuck him alright. I got right where When you get knocked out like when I knocked people out like when I knocked out just for Naveed is I hit him so hard and I hit him where he was like Like he's just that comatose. Yeah, so he goes what happened with the fuck happen And so it's like too different where you you get that numb or if you get choked out it's like I'm a I never get I choke my buddy out like I had him in a deep gear teen and he didn't tap but I can feel his body go limp Yeah, and so I let go and he was in my lap and I was like true True and I start running to shes out with the fuck out What happened I was like fuck man you didn't tap you now You go fuck I So like when I was going chase me chase for a grappling I had him in a choke hold right and it's it's chas my excuse me chas I was fucking close. I got one letter wrong. Yeah, so I'm choking him out and then he's like I'm like I look goes are you okay? And he goes yeah, man. I'll tap. I was like some motherfuckers don't tap right and I'm sitting Hold it and I'm like You're not gonna tap. Oh, alright fuck and I didn't choke him, but then I got him to triangle I was like alright you will feel it today and I had that triangle on him for like a lease 45 minutes like no see me 45 seconds just hold it hold it hold it hold it hold it hold it He's getting now. He's trying to get out of the vitally he tapped and I was like okay you tap He is a strong he's tough to all the kids are tough Yeah, man, but they're like fucking 30 Yeah, I mean, but it's interesting to see I mean it's unfortunate that happened I mean, I would have to I would have to see the video of like him actually drop it like you all at time like people get hit in the head I mean in the jaw and they fall down and hit their head on the concrete and then he died Yeah, it's like wasn't the punch that killed them. Yeah, it was a hit him. It was a hit on the head So what caused him to hit his head me punch him, which means I'm liable well, dude Either way though like that that's good some merit in shit like this guy's threatening people threatening women Saying he was he was saying I'm gonna fucking kill you all this crazy shit in public and dude we can't be putting People and fucking prison for helping other people avoid a dangerous situation because that sends a signal to all the other men Don't do anything. Yeah, and then you got a woman saying why aren't they men do anything? Yeah, well fuck bro They're gonna put me in jail for my whole life, you know like you're supposed to 15 years. Yeah There was this dude should be free today He I hope he fucking gets paid a shit ton of money for what he's got to go through. Yeah, there was a guy. It just happened a guy um A Samaritan I think it was over in the UK. I'm not sure where is but this guy was raping a chick And a guy saw and he gets on and just fucks this guy up just whoop his ass. Is that where you're running between the cars? I don't know maybe I saw the probably he ran on he was like boom boom boom start fucking a month And then my buddy uh his name is Cody Garrett. His name is donor operator He sent me he goes hey, Mike. He sent me a video say thank you to the homeboy who who whoop that guy's ass I was like yeah, sure absolutely. I'm glad he did the right fucking thing and he saw a woman in distress Who's being fucked with being raped And he didn't sit by and goes nope not my business. I'm gonna keep walking He got a world and he whoop that guy's ass. I was like good for him like good for him for doing what was right Yeah, and We need that in the world. We need that in the world. Yeah, it's part of the obligation that we have as men Is to stand up for people that are weaker than us regardless of what consequences we might face and to do so But with that being said We shouldn't be put in prison for being good Samaritans and protecting people even if it would happen to go wrong Yeah, you know because who knows right and that's the thing like my brother when he when he started having his episodes of skits of fitting and bipolar um My my wife at the time she'm a girlfriend. She was like nope When you get the fuck out of here and my mom was like no, it's fine. He won't hurt anybody And then my my girlfriend at times she goes fuck that he snaps. He starts stabbing everybody Nope, we out and then we packed our shit that day and we left and then it's the same thing like We don't know what that guy had he could have a knife and he's has an a manic episode or he's fucking high on whatever it is And he goes on to start stabbing people and then But now what now what right it's I think this is one of the biggest The biggest misjustice or what have we gonna call it like unjust situation? It's going on in America right now It's what's going on with this dude. Yeah, it's very fucked up now if he now if he had uh a history of Killing people like oh, I got open open open over yeah, okay. We're gonna have to look in it But if he is what you're saying like he was X-Marine um There's some base level training there. Yeah, that's a good point. I'm actually not familiar with this Clean clean record clean record He was in a subway Somebody's acting I rate saying I'm a killer bite. He goes nah, I'm not fucking it's almost like this you look at 9-11 like I'm I want to go more about on the plane, right? Like in today's society. I would hope If motherfuckers on the plane with a box cutter saying everybody stay in your seat Nobody's gonna get hurt Like that shitting gonna happen today's society people like the fuck you is like yeah Emerson and jump a game mate and just fuck him up right? So I think what he did is like that same reaction is like You're gonna act crazy. You don't kill all of us. Yeah, not the fuck not not what I'm here I'm gonna get my hands on you first and you're gonna yeah He put him to sleep and unfortunately he died Um, and that's why I think in this situation is what happened like I don't think he's a killer I don't think he's a murderer. I think he just did something that he felt that was right at the time to take action Instead of he reacted instead of no he took action instead of reacting, right? Like I was talking with her. Yeah, like he's not gonna sit there and wait and like okay I'm not gonna you get to jump on me. I'm gonna jump on you And that's what happened I feel like 21 white man was captured on video placing nearly Black former street performer with a history of homelessness and mental health issue and it took old that day Turn deadly during a subway ride. So it says he didn't drop him. No, no, he I mean they were they were laying on a conversation first Yeah, I mean the whole thing was video tape we I mean I can pull it up on the show. I think I think I got flagged every day for Yeah, I gotcha but yeah, I mean if it's a conversation here. I mean the whole George Floyd thing Once again like after the technology report came back now. I'm gonna focus high. I was like what was he? He was high as giraffe pussy. Yeah, you die to fuck a fentanyl over this is in the corner report. Yeah Right that's where I'm talking like yes of you know the neon and neck. Yes, that does cut off the blood flow of the neck But he still has his left artery different on which I was up so he did have a blood But if a young healthy male Was you know if you put your neon me you have it back there and I'm like ah fuck I'm at high. I shouldn't die. No, yeah What happens is is these dudes are highest fuck yeah and like broke because I've been pinned to the ground by the police Like I've had a douche I worked in a bar for a long time The Sometimes you get wrapped up in a scrap and they don't know who the fuck is who yeah, okay? And dude. Yeah, it's fucking if you're highest fuck and you're fucked up And you're gonna panic when that happens because like dude if you relax you're fine. Yeah, definitely You know, but I could see where someone's highest fuck like he was It could drive to a fucking cardio then or whatever right? Yeah, but that's all the time where people like on a PCP And shit. It's called like the medical term is excited delirium Happens all the fucking time and like they get there because of the drugs that are in their system They're numb to pain. Yeah, Mace doesn't fucking affect them or see doesn't affect them Aspeed patients do not affect them beating their ass, but like you know Once they're finally get them control they send them to the fucking hospital days later They die from all of their injuries of their bodies now fucking feel You know I'm saying so I mean the shit happens Not all the time, but it does fucking happen man. It's like you know Personally, I mean, I think looking to the situation knowing the video scene the dudes innocent man Yeah, and like those cops bro. They don't want to be doing that. No, they don't man And I think that's the other part too. It's like going back to even our earlier conversation man. It's like Well, I mean how important is it to ride on the fucking subway in peace? How important is that to you? Yeah, you know what I'm saying like because if we're gonna be a society that has standards and you know have these more like There's certain things that we just cannot allow yet I'm not saying that you know the dude deserved to die or should have died But guess what after his death is not the time to try to you know push for mental health like where was the help for this guy? months first of all I don't have any fucking sympathy for this shit anyway, okay? Like bro, there's a lot of people have mental health problems don't go fucking kill people. No, okay What is this shit where we're making excuses for the fucking evil shit that people do? Oh, you know fuck dude his dad wasn't in the house and you know, he had a fucking drug problem and you know He got beat when he was like yeah, so yeah, he doesn't make it okay. Yeah, you know like like dude I think in this in our society we could we could do more It's very hard it's a very hard problem to solve right because come from mental health up my brother when he Has to sprinting bipolar it hit him at a young age around like 1920. I'll come on from work He's walking in a fucking square like I'm like his name is selling. I'll recall him. Juni. He's always fucked with bugs We call him Juni bug. I'm like Juni get your ass in the house now and you go, huh? What? Oh, I'm good. He's keep on walking one day I've come home. He's but asked neck and just bathing in this sign. I'm like, what are you doing? He goes, you know if you have the sun hit You know your whole body you get all these vitamins come on one day he's drinking fucking just fucking that's actually a real thing The butthole tanning. Yeah Yeah, he would do such crazy shit and then there was no form to help him And then the thing that was even crazy when he finally got booked He broken to a the parmer complex that was vacated and he went to the hot tub but asked neck it and he was sitting in the hot tub And the the people who run a hotel that the hotel but the apartment complex are like you can't be in here But I said he goes, yeah, I can and he goes no, you can't the cops calm. They detain him taking They book him and the way he was acting in the room You was just like staring at the wall acting fucking crazy. Yeah, and they put him to The mental health facility, which is a western state in the P.O.lb in Lakewood right alive Well, not with P.O.lb but in the Washington state And next thing you know I'm like, hey, you know, I'm his brother. I want to be able to help him. What what does he have that? Oh, we can't give you any information unless he signs The paperwork. I'm like, so let me get me let me get the straight You're telling me you're gonna let somebody who's not fucking Saying who whose legitimate what you're saying he's fucking crazy Make a decision whether I can help him or not or understand what he needs they go. Yep It's like I'm like, what the fuck are you doing? Yeah, and now I'm at this point now where my mom is getting older She's battle cancer before he's gonna my mom's gonna die eventually. Yeah, and my mom's taking care of him If I can't figure out what he has what medication he needs How do they suspect me to help him if he won't give me the right of attorney to build the help him right? That's the part. I feel like we have with our that's a big problem big promise like guys. I'm a good guy Yeah, I want I want to be able to help him, but they're like nope He has to let us he's yeah, and then eventually your mom dies They don't let you help him he ends up fucking on the street doing some crazy ass shit and it all happens over Yeah, it's a that is a systemic problem with our mental health system They need it. They need put some problem with it being culturally Culturally celebrated where we have a lot of people that don't really have mental health issues Saying that they have mental health issues because they get attention on the fucking internet right and that's the victim culture mentality and this is a very good example of that Because it's very hard to help people like your brother when you have everybody on the internet talking about their mental health And they're fucking you know, they're propagating their own victimhood to get attention Like how the fuck do we know who is actually who? Yes, same thing with racism you call everybody racist How can we identify the real racism? Same thing with fucking me too movement if everybody's a sexual harasser or a fucking abuser or a rapist How do we identify the actual ones? Right, and this is the problem that we have by attaching labels to things that are not actually the things that we're putting the labels on And dude that that's a big problem because a lot of people suffer from that like your own family. Yeah, yeah, that's fucking That sucks. Yeah, and it's it's always hard and I I agree through when like the mutu is like yeah, what is oh He grew up in the same girls are crying today about how no mental talk to him Yeah, bro because like trying to hold your door. You called me a fucking pervert. No I tried to hold the door and you made a video and put it online and said I was a fucking Male showbiz pig yeah, or whatever, you know like bro And that what that what you know women are like how do we correct that well you got a fucking ruined it? Yeah, you got to tell the women who say that shit that they're full shit It's a women problem that women got to solve themselves You know, if you want no, I'm being real If you want if you want men to be You know to approach and like the traditional way and all these things like bro We can't have a big group of women saying oh this guy came up and talked to me. He sexually harassed me or whatever like you can't have that Open my own door. Yeah, okay cool. Go ahead, dude. Yeah. I was just trying to be helpful Yeah, well, I think all sins back to the very beginning of the conversation of like we've been in society where it's like Oh, no, I can do that. Don't you you stay where you are. I was like yeah, okay fuck. I guess right where I remember there was um masculinity right like my buddy was like toxic master yeah toxic mess something you who's that shit back in a day like masculinity at one point in time was like fucking dope. It's it is it is it's required for a civil society Yeah, and then there was like that that toss toxic masculine. He was like well, I can do that too And it's like yes, you can but I can do it better. I built stronger. I'm built faster like genetically It is what it is right well, bro. This is about removing the the top the masculine male from society So the society becomes easier to control exactly. Yeah, right. Yeah, that's that's what it comes out to me. It's like no like It's not gonna be that way right so I think real men cut off their dicks You know what I'm fake as fuck fuck. I don't know what to tell you They're going to real men take us through it real men cry all the time. Yeah The fuck out of here like I said there's so much that goes on where it's just like you sit back and you sit there You're like what the fuck did I just do no shit No shit My favorite one was When a man dress up as woman And then they're like you're gonna dress me as when he goes it's ma no no it's ma. I'm gonna say no you're a fucking dude Yeah, um that's what you are sir you have ma. I'm you have to succulent cancer It's like The best one ever the best video ever on that is when that that dude is at sonic The guy's trying to be accommodating he's like he's like look you know I'm we're trying to be helpful. You know we we brought you your food Your server address me as sir. Yeah, and he's like he's like look You know he's tried to be reasonable and then the fucking the dude goes Look at me. What would you think I am and he goes you're a man Dude turns the phone in himself. He's like do I look like a man? Yes, yeah, I'm like you got cocking balls now you Fuck dude and by the way cool. Yeah, but don't shove it on everybody exactly That's why I think that the whole the lines getting Mr. Shooters like okay, hey I have no problem if Ryan picked me up from the fucking airport dressing the two two and make him a lipstick. Yeah And like and I'm like hey, what's up dude he goes No, I'm a fucking feels like Ryan You're a dude you're a dude right and that's like that's where like I even tell my kids they came home And they're like dad There's a furry in the classroom.

It's a it's a it's not a furry He can pretend to be a cat. Yeah, but you ain't got to dress him as a cat. Yeah, you dress him as Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah And that's right. I think he's got fucked up Whereas when people are like you have to dress me as yes, what I didn't know because they're forcing us to lie to ourselves Okay, if you force someone to lie to themselves They're it's not harmless. It actually creates a situation where our own belief and integrity to self Becomes ruined and and deluded. So if so if I am forced to address what I know to be a man as a woman I'm forced to like in other countries dude you go to jail for the show. I'm okay I am eroding my own self esteem because I know I'm lying I'm doing something that is against my own intelligence what I know to be true And if you so there's damage to doing this it's and the problem is is that these people try to make it like it Oh, it's just innocent. Why can't you just accommodate me because it's now fucking true bro And if I lie to myself that hurts me Okay, if I am gonna lie to myself. It's gonna be my own terms and like yeah, yeah, all right cool. I look like Zeus Yeah, right, you know, that's fine. My dick is 10 feet long. Yeah, exactly not nine when it's really 11 You know, they're like let me choose to do that You know you don't you don't you don't you can't force me don't pigeonhole me into your astrology That's right you have to Or what are we fucking what are we forcing them to do nothing?
