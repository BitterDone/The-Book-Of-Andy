I actually knew a girl named irony That I wish you knew some other interesting names What's so funny I know some interesting names Yeah, Madot bractioning you know some braxxin with a truth and with two axes Yeah, stupid Connor. I don't want your conners. Oh Some hunters. I like irony. I like things that are ironical and I saw this headlight man, and I just thought this was the most ironic shit You could possibly put together Uh, I want to get you take on it man, so this headline reads so you know we got astronauts Astronaut astronauts allegedly well then that's that's an important thing to say allegedly There's a lot of people that think there's a lot. We live in the uh the firm in it. Mm-hmm. I mean listen that's the firm and Joe He's the old uncle of the good guy that goes down the wormhole for no some shit. No, he knows some shit Um don't shoot at the firm but we got we got some we know allegedly we have astronauts that are stuck in space right now Oh really mm-hmm and like there's something going on with like the yeah the spaceship shuttle ISS station thing their own And so You know like it's on the ground It's stuck at the bottom of the pool They kick it off the movie set But uh, you know, so they got to do this like rescue mission right and Out of all the people out there out of all the companies that could could could you know put some stuff together to go rescue these guys They choose bowing Ha And that's that is ironic now listen These people like the astronauts they release some statements that talking about it and they are having to like bold face like to the public Say how confident they are in bowing to ability to come save them could you imagine legitimately being stuck in space And then they call you on the radio and they say hey Don't worry about it. We got to cover we talked about the Boeing oh shit They're coming to get you Bro, that's like asking Epstein to come rescue you from a ditty party bro like that's not good bro. I would just I'm good here. Don't worry So that's the food Bro, yes, so they're they're confident You know, they had to release some statements that uh, you know and their confidence in Boeing so Two astronauts they've been stuck in space for weeks And weeks longer than plan believe bowing will get the pair back to earth safely even as the troubled companies space capsule Has faced a string of problems. So NASA test bot pilots butch Wilmore and sunny Williams offered an optimistic view of their current predicament Uh, that began last month when helium leaks and thruster failures were discovered on the new starliner capsule They launched into space Quote I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home. No problem. Williams said During the Paris first news conference from orbit on Wednesday Will more at it quote were absolutely confident speak for you bitch Which is a very absolutely confident He and his colleagues will return safely after thruster testing is completed on earth And everybody knows blow bowing's happened to miss. She's right now They just had another plane just yesterday. Uh, blew a blue some tires as it landed I mean, they can't even handle shit on the ground and in this atmosphere and they're supposed to go take care of some shit allegedly at the deep end of the pool, you know I don't know They're upside down. I can see that Like all this blood's rushing to his head bro. It looks like it They got a water balloon for a fucking head and then they left the spacecraft to take this picture of the spacecraft Oh, is that what they did from space did they really do that? Is that what they said no? I don't know I think they took this from that 7-0-11 on the moon Oh Man, yeah, that's all they got news is go to go go move man get yourself on surface. Yeah, yeah Yeah, I just thought there was ironic man. I like Okay, I make this shit up. But when's about to do a hold my beer moment It'd be so sad though it'd be so sad. I hope everything goes well Have you seen that documentary or that like that piece on the floating around the internet about how all the Challenger astronauts are still alive? Oh, I did see that dude. That's crazy dude like the same names. I didn't change the name bro And they are clearly the same fucking people bro. Yeah, it is fucking creepy. Now. I don't did you see that? Bro They are clearly the same people like I don't know if this is even a sky. I don't know if that's AI or someone made that or whatever but like Dude, I mean they put a lot of work into it if they did It has all their occupations and everything dude What's crazy is the occupations are the same thing they did before yeah, that's what snuts. Yeah, bro. Yeah Listen, I don't know man man. Everything's a lie Yeah, everything's a lie. These people lie about everything. That's why you got to do your own research No, don't do that. Let let that sink in don't do that. You know, I'm saying yeah, right It's very dangerous to do your own research. You might find out how much relying to you right? Yeah, I don't know man, but uh, but let's get it through our headlines guys If you want to see any of these headlines these articles pictures links videos go to antifacilla.com You guys can find them linked there. We linked them up there for you in links Sweet, yep, I you know real quick. This isn't bad. I know you hate on the cherry lime.

I thought I was like through the That peasant a more it used to be I'm gonna sit on this ass. What's up doing to me man? All right, let's get into these headlines man guys 80 headline number one Uh, now this is an interesting one Um, you know Every now and then they try to like sneak some shit in there, you know, and I always catch it. Yeah, I try to catch it Yeah, I kind of catch it. I kind of call it. We catch it Huh We're he catch it. No, I got catch him like I'm like it's the shit that nobody like it. What do you mean? He catches the rear Okay, you up for it, bro. All right. All right. No, that's cool. They try to sneak that in. You can catch it. Yeah, Joe You know about these jokes dude like if you got to explain them that means they're the best kind. Yeah All with the show Oh Man, so they try to always put some shit under the covers that's still gay in it There's gay too in it Depends on who's on the sheets of them I found this one for the boat No, man, but they're always on some bullshit. So we got to uncover it. We got to talk about it Um, I want you guys to read this headline this headline is from NBC news that just came out today Um, and the headline reads Russia aims to undermine Biden in November election in telephysical state No Didn't didn't Russians interfere in 2016. Oh, yeah in 2022 But they won in 20 but Biden won in 22. Yeah, but that was just because the people had enough of Putin Gotcha, but Putin's back stronger. He's back stronger. He's here to ruin America and undermine our elections again It's definitely not you know The Democrat party that will you know wants to pack the courts and put people in jail and allow millions of migrants into our country To protect democracy. Yeah. Oh in the laptop. That was Russia. That was Russia too. Of course. Yeah, definitely wasn't So is that is that like it was interesting how How Russia photoshopped all those pictures of Hunter Biden. Yeah, you know, I mean, Lizard They were I mean, they were being really nice to game a pretty decent size. They gave them a big old big big dome. Yeah Yeah, they gave him big dome Like if I was I'm like, my baby. That shit smaller shit. You know, I'm saying like they gave it to him. Yeah, it's crazy how they did that yeah I was ruined the country but give him big big meaner. Yeah, that way they won't believe it's us. Yeah, right because we wouldn't do that Well, it looks like Russia's here to ruin more of America. They're running again. Yeah, they're back You know 2024, you know, they took it took it took a year off for break a election cycle off from their back now So um, and it's crazy because you know, they actually ran this article back in February And nobody really talked about it right like this is the headlines from from from from February Hell on me. It's Russia's 2024 election interference has already begun Um, which I think it's interesting and it's like, you know, they know their parties in trouble. Yes, definitely I mean Definitely Russia's you know Massing up the election. It's not like you know 200 Democrats voting to allow illegal migrants that don't belong in this country to vote It's funny. You say that man because you would think like all the things that we could be doing to say you know to make sure elections are secure Yeah, the people Who are claiming that it's you know can be in a fear. It's so easily. I do nothing to fix it Weird. Yeah, it's so weird like uh, Democrats slam popular voter ID bill is racist and xenophobic Uh, voter identification rules are just like civil war racist exclusion laws according to Democrats who denounced and voted against the GOP's save act bill On the house floor Quote this is the 2024 version of the Jim Crow poll tax and we should vote against it claimed representative Jennifer McClullen Um out of Virginia Uh, she'd announced the bill which requires people to prove their citizenship before casting a vote for Democrats or Republicans Um, so in 1800s and until the 1960s many people were denied the vote when they did not pay the flat poll tax on individuals living in a jurisdiction But McClullen is determined to Uh descenter the bones of historical racism for democratic advantage in 2024 saying uh, let's just watch the let's watch the video I got the clip for you here she is asked this bill is essentially a poll tax Because I am not aware of a single proof of citizenship document that does not cost an individual money to get it Unless we are requiring every state to provide one for free and then it's on on funded mandate This is the 2024 version of the Jim Crow poll tax and we should vote against it We should vote you out of office. I agree in every single person who voted for that Who said you know that they believe that illegals should be able to vote here are voting That way and having that point of view so that they can maintain power for themselves It has nothing to do with the well-being of this country and it's actually treasonous Okay, so every single one of those people if I were president I would arrest every single one of those people which is probably why I'm not president Yeah, that's what I'm saying is it's like why would you cry that election is so fragile then and say that you know It could be in a fear and all it is But then completely vote against something that because they don't have a problem lying, dude No, there's no way they're importing their voters. That's correct They're importing our voters is what they're doing. Yes, right and they understand that people are sick of them They understand that they have not served the public They understand that the public has figured out that they are not serving the public and their solution isn't To change policy that serves the public their solution is to say well too bad We'll import new voters and you guys who come from America you guys who were born here you guys who Are American citizens by birth? Fuck you. They have more rights than you that is what is going on now these people are treasonous They should be arrested it's bullshit And it shouldn't be happening in our country at all no And like and then you know this whole xenophobic because again, they they always result like they have to be No one cares on type of racism bro. No one cares nobody cares and everybody knows like Everybody has in a fucking ID. Yeah, everybody has in that. I don't know personally anybody And if they don't then they don't get the fucking vote Okay, because they're not contributing anything to the country like these people There should be a tax to fucking vote You if you had to pay $20 to vote we'd actually get the people who were contributing society to vote I don't think that's the solution. I think the solution is simply if you pay tax whether you're 15 or you're 95 You get a vote if you have a job you contribute in you pay tax you should have a vote if you do not you should not have a vote Period, that's how it should be people shouldn't get to decide what we do in this country if they are not contributing to the country They shouldn't have a say that's reality dude We're allowing the people who don't contribute them anything To come into this country to vote because these people Pander to them that they're gonna take a shit from the people who do produce and give it to these people who don't produce And they get these people to vote for them on empty promises that they can not ever fulfill or they'll destroy the country And now these people who are mindless fucking morons Have figured out that the only way to actually stay in power is to import new voters and allow them to vote and do that is in direct Violation of the interests of the people of this country including their own base Most of the people that voted for these people in 2020 are now saying dude. I'm not voting for these people And so like think about the level of ego And superiority that these people must hold for themselves to decide that it doesn't matter if the people don't like it We'll just import new voters like think about that. Yeah Yeah They're not with us no more. We gotta get some new people. Yeah, and dude screw what our base says Let's not adjust course. We're gonna create what we want to create make the pot bigger Their job is to serve our interests their job is to vote as a representative of the people Out there that's the whole idea not not for cooperation Not for other countries not for lobbies not for these. Yeah, it's a complete bullshit And I think about like this too, man. Like even just this idea of like it's very very simple If you want to drive a car in this country in any state you have to have an ID You have to have a driver's license driving is a privilege We don't look at voting. Yes. I look at it as an obligation, but it's a privilege Right like like that is a like If you're not contributing we take away the voting rights for felons Pretty you know, I'm saying like it's a very simple conversation Which is why you know that this has nothing to fucking do with any type of racism or xenophobia This is them trying to expand their fucking base of course stand stand stand power of course Of course and the people should be pissed about this the most are not Okay, you know, it should be mad about this the most is the black community The minority communities that for fucking 40 years 50 years now These people have been coming in fucking 60 years have been coming in And promising to fix these communities and intentionally destroying them instead Okay, and then when the black community finally says broke enough enough now they import 20 million new people New minorities into these people's neighborhoods replace them bro Which by those know I mean even if they it conservatively let's say it's 15 million That's still enough to replace the entire black vote. Yeah, it's it's And when you actually calculate the amount of black Americans that actually vote it's the amount of immigrants it would be double You know, some of them saying like like they have enough to replace the black vote by two Is that is that accurate? I don't know. Yeah, bro, but I mean that's the other issue bro Like there's not enough black people that vote like if you look at the black voter turnout the highest was in 2008 for Obama You know, I'm saying but even that one there like 62% why of eligible voters Why why did they vote for Obama, but they didn't vote for it. They won't vote in the other time No, I'm being serious. Why it was black. Okay. Well, that's a stupid reason of over someone It's very stupid. Okay, and we need to get smarter in the country than to vote for someone because they look like us or they You know, we think that because they're this or that they're gonna represent us We need to start voting people in the in the power that are actually from the people that are gonna do the people's will and work Not these people like Corey Bush from St. Louis who doesn't do anything but impoverish your own communities and create more Disruption and more problems for own community that gets voted in because she is black That's fucking wrong. No, and I think we are past that at this point. I mean, I think most people are past that like I mean at the end of the day It's about I feel like they are to you. No, they are. Yeah, I feel I figure who it was it was it was daily something Um, they did a they tried to do this like we'll sit down and then we they bought like six black people in the room And they were expected that these were all like you know Traditional Democrats and like half of them was like no, I'm voting for Trump. Yeah, first time in my life Yeah, it was there like he's like, oh, that's that's surprising. Why is that surprising? No, that's it. That's a fucking sick of this. It's a condescending racist Comment to even say that's surprising You know because what you're saying is because I'm black. I'm supposed to think right this way And you're not smart enough to see something that you're not told to know it's bullshit. It is bullshit And I and I yeah and these people It's getting tired dude. So instead they they Import an entire populace of new minority voters and it's all these fucking white people Celebrating it and then nobody can like nobody's like saying oh well those guys are the actual racist Did you see the video of Joe Biden like skipping that black woman at her? Yeah, I saw that bro. I saw that The listen dude. I didn't even want to be there. She was probably paid to be there and he's still skipped her That's the fucked up part listen dude These people hate black people. That's what needs to become the understood reality though these leftists use black people To appear to be virtuous to appear to care to appear to say I have compassion for you when they have none Okay, there's nothing more racist than saying I'm gonna do this for you I'm gonna do this for you. I'm gonna do this for you in the minute you walk away I do everything to make that harder so that I can come back to you in two years and make you the same promises and Blame it on someone else and say oh well, it's the white man. Oh, well, it's the conservatives. Oh, it's Donald Trump Motherfucker and it been that for 60 years. It's been you Okay, and our communities have woken up to that and their response to it is is the fucking replace these people Well, these people belong in fucking prison for real man and like That's not just me talking, you know aggressively. That's that's where they belong If they're willing to sell out our American citizens To maintain power for themselves and privilege for themselves this country is far past time for a restructuring Of power that's the truth now guys jumping on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments That being said, let's go check some of them out.

It's not going to lick itself. That was a t-shirt that it was wearing Um This is a real real incident so store employees claim that the alleged assailant in the incident is known to frequent the area Uh, and a nearby underpass, which is where they believe he could be parking his car according to Fox 29 authorities Have since posted a photo of the man which appears to show a clear picture of his face and described him as a six-foot tall black man around 25 or 30 years old with a short receiving hairline And a full beard sounds just like you DJ Um meek mail jumped in on the conversation Rapper meek mail. He's from Philly.

Don't pursue him. It got to actually be you Philly small people know where this creep as dude at get the fuck out of here. We need community protection also um And uh in good news they did catch him um He uh, he actually turned himself in Uh, his name is Gary A Miles. This is him here Um, and he has been booked for indecent assault and decent exposure open-lootness and harassment Andy what we got on this I still am confused on how you would do that without someone noticing like what do you what's going on like not being serious like how You know the logistics I want to see the full store like the full camera from the store And by the I mean look I mean it's got belongs in the fucking woodshipper if this is true Like this kind of shit should not be tolerating society man. No You know this is like you oh sick dude. It's a total violation. It's it's it's not fun like it's I know people are laughing at it and shit, but it's not funny. It's parts of it that are funny It's it's it's not funny because like dude people are being violated left and right By people this goes but like this goes back to what I was saying this motherfucker does not contribute to society He's clearly a fucking menace What do you do with those people? Okay, like in the Democrats answer is let's go get him to vote for us right? Right like that's what I'm talking in office. They no they go to these people just like this and they say Vote for us and we'll give you some shit from the guy over there who's working his whole life who has a family Who's paying all these tax will give you will take some of his and we'll give it to you Michelle Obama's exact quote Someone's gonna have to give up their piece of the pie so other people can have some more Well, how about you do that bitch? Okay, you're the one with four fucking properties that are in eight figures each Okay, you're the one that was a community activist that comes out worth a hundred million dollars explain that shit Okay, so when we talk about taking the pie you've already taken a big piece of the pie from other people Now, why don't you give some of your pie to this guy who's jerking off on people's legs? You won't do it These people are full of shit And if we want to civilize society We need to stop having sympathy or empathy for these kind of people Okay, and I know that's hard for people to take. I don't know why it's not for me But for some reason people get their feelings hurt when you say things like that. No This guy is not contributing society. I bet you he's done a bunch of other shit These people do not belong in civilized society and whether they belong in a mental institution or whether they belong in prison Or whether they belong in a fucking woodchipper. I'm for the woodchipper because it's the easiest cheapest thing to do And it fixes the problem so that we can keep more of our tax dollars And I know you guys are probably thinking he can't be serious. No, I'm extremely serious Okay, people who have long rap sheets who are repeat offenders who do violent things who do sexual things have no place in our society Whatsoever they they are never gonna be rehabbed they are never going to come out and become the You know the attorney or the doctor or the someone who contributes to this country And it doesn't matter if they're black or they're white or they're from fucking America or they're from fucking somewhere else I don't give a shit Okay, if you're gonna do fucked up shit fucked up shit deserves to happen to you and and these people like dude Like women are American women have to worry about dudes pulling out their fucking dicks And nutting on them in a grocery store or Walking to the mall and being harassed by a group of migrants Okay, this is wrong and the men of this country need to stand to fuck up and stop tolerating this shit That dude should have had some street justice happen to him for real And I mean permanent justice. I don't mean beat them up or slapping them It is what it is dude These people don't deserve to live in a civilized society because they are not civilized and I think it's appropriate for us to consider that we need a period of time where the punishment for people like this is incredibly harsh so that people understand this is not gonna be tolerated No, you're with the fucking program. That's what that's what it is that guy should have his dick cutoff Yeah, for real like that's the appropriate punishment cut off his fucking dick. Can't do it to sterilize him And let him go back out and if he does more shit, fucking throw him into wood shippers. Yeah I want to say this too to your point about the fucking pie shit man. It's like, you know Well, why do I have to give up any of my pie? How about this like stop making the price of good so fucking much And people could go bake their own fucking pie Like that's the fix. Yeah bro listen. That's the play the play is to keep you So Improvesh and struggling for your livelihood that you cannot pay attention to the shit that they are doing that's Basically Stealing from us to enrich themselves, okay? So that's the plan. This is not the land of the free This is not the freest country. This is not you know this magical place anymore And we if we're gonna get back to that which we should We're going to have to deal with the scum of the earth element that has gotten to the point where there is no accountability for them Look at all these kids running around doing all this crazy shit to people because there's no accountability Okay, but if you took a group of those kids and you fucking said oh you beat this person of death and one of your little mob shows By the way, you're all going in the wood shipper four of you, okay? And you made everybody watch it. Do you know how quickly that shit would stop? It would fucking stop in one day. Yep Yeah, it's just people don't have the stomach to do what needs to be done to solve the problem in society Doesn't have to be that way forever, but in all of history, okay? for the Fuckin 12,000 years for the 12,000 years the humans have a recorded history There has always been Violence to deter poor behavior. That is a reality There have been hangs there have been dismemberings there have been fucking Guilla's in pay for you name it guillotine's quartering The reason for this is not just to kill people is to deter people from doing things like this And we have lived in a period of time now for 80 years in this world Where there has been very little public accountability or fear placed into people to not do this kind of stuff And the reason that that has been worked out of our government system is because it's been abused, right? There's been times and periods of history where innocent people were murdered or decapitated or executed and That's bad and that's terrible, but at some point in time we have to show people What the fuck happens to you when you do bad shit and it's not just you go away to prison It's we're gonna you oh you fucking mass shot these people Okay, well, we're gonna gut you on TV We're gonna dissect you in front of the entire world They're all gonna be able to subscribe to it We can take that money we can give it to the victims and everybody in the world sees it and they say fuck I ain't doing that shit because this is what's gonna happen to me. I think that's the other sinister part of this Super it's not it's not just that Innocent people were being you know wrongly, you know handled or dealt with you know They also realize that there's a pretty good business and just keeping people alive for a long time in prison systems You know what I'm saying like this the prison industries them Yeah multi billion dollars and it's it's mostly privatized too mostly privatized You know, I'm sensed with like you know, oh we can make a lot of fucking money off these bad people Yeah Rehabilitation we'll call a rehabilitation. There's no rehabilitation for people that jack off on people's legs There's no rehabilitation for people that rape people There's no rehabilitation for violent criminals. There shouldn't be any rehabilitation pedophiles Pedophiles violent and sexual criminals or should all be lumped into this category of removal from society That's my opinion and I don't buy this shit. Oh, it's just one mistake. No, it's not it's not just one mistake Okay, it's not just one thing And if you get caught lying about it if you get caught making it up you should have to receive the punishment for making it up Mm-hmm. Oh, that's real man Yeah, guys jump in on the conversation. Let us go down in the comments. What you guys think I was that being said. Let's get to our third and final headline head none number three talking about uh You know How to go with this it's like you know, we all have a very you know, we try to have a realistic approach Realist approach to society You know, and we talk we just got done talking about these criminals and you know, what do we do with these people that are not conformers? Well, let's go to the great state of California um because there is a they actually have a great idea of how to how to you know deal with this stuff Um, let's head on the reach California city attorney threatened to punish target store for repeatedly reporting thefts at store in crime written state I saw this Yep, go ahead. It's a good fix. Yeah, it's a great fix a city attorney and California has threatened to punish a target store For repeatedly reporting thefts at the store in the crime written state Sacramento City attorney Susanna alkala woods this lady right here uh said the retail store located at 25.05 Riverside Boulevard in land park will be fined and slapped with a public nuisance Charge if it continues to call police when there is a theft at the store person familiar with the incident who acts to not be identified for fear of repriezile Told the Sacramento be that city officials warned that an administrative fine would also be charged pursuing legal action against a business for reporting a crime has prompted lawmakers to add an amendment to a retail theft bill making such threats illegal Alexander Gamma large Gamma guard Gamma guard that's right, mm-hmm 2 points for DJ President of the California Police Chiefs Association who testified at the assembly's first retail theft committee meeting in December appeared stunned by recent news and explained there is no place for that quote I Was also surprised that anyone would ever attempt to make a nuisance case out of somebody calling To report a legitimate crime he told the bee now woods is office in the Sacramento police department told ABC 45 news They were unaware such a threat had been made um so the new bill uh proposition 47 under the proposition 47 initiative that was passed in 2014 Lower-level crimes were set as misdemeanors and $950 felony threshold set for shoplifting But many were opposed to the voter approved plan that they believe has been the cause of the escalating theft in their state Um, so again going back to our conversation earlier like who voted for that It was the people that were probably down the steel some shit You know i'm saying because yes like that's how it works Oh, you mean like so i'm a criminal and you guys about to pass this bill where you know i won't wrote listen This is this is way deeper than that We're getting into that. Let's talk. No, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it I mean obviously crimes up in california um they're having you know We're talking recover the mesh robbing. Okay, let's work this out. Let's talk about it. Why would Anyone pay For a judge to be elected in a metropolitan area and then told to not prosecute criminals. Why would they do that? Why would you say why would a judge? Okay, George soros. Mm-hmm, but let's say it was anybody doesn't matter George soros has funded dozens and dozens and dozens of municipal City-level judges That do not prosecute crime right they do not prosecute crime in their city. Why would you do that? Because you Because you want more crime. Okay, obviously this guy's not a dumbass right He's a multi billionaire, okay, so why would you want more crime? Create more chaos keep people in the state of fear Obviously, you know business can't survive longer if they keep getting fucking stolen from okay Okay, businesses can't survive and what happens to them when they can't survive they close Okay, when they close one that goes up when the point that goes up. Okay, when they close What happens to the property right now? What's happening to the property all over the country? I was getting bought the fuck up. Okay, by like two Companies, okay, okay What happens when people the business goes To the point where someone who owns the property all right someone who owns the property loses their business and they can't pay the taxes on the property who gets the property Uh, the state Right, okay, so When we talk about what we're trying to do and we're talking about what's being trying trying to be created We're talking about the re-establishment of owning the property in these areas All right, so how do they confiscate the property you've heard the the domain you you've heard about Clashwob say no you'll own nothing and like it and the communism the state owns everything So how does the state re-acquire a property from the citizen? Well, they create crime which destroys a business which allows them the opportunity to confiscate the property whether it be Through the state or whether it be through huge private funds like black rock or these other places that buy up all the property or International money. There's a lot of people from China who send their money over here and buy the dilapidated buildings because those buildings are still safer investments Than what they have in China, okay? so That's the inner city all right now Outside the inner city we have the rural areas Now how do we create a situation where the state gets the property from the rural areas? Oh, I'm glad I asked okay They raise taxes they raise the cost of Fertilizer and farming supplies they create a situation where farmers can't afford to make a profit and then these farms that have been in families For literally generations are lost because there's no business to be made and then they can't pay the tax and then the governments confiscate the property Okay, bro. This is this is a big step in that into implementing communism be great as much chaos as you can and then also What they want is they want to create as much chaos as they possibly can Acquire as much property as they possibly can and make it so uncomfortable so that people beg For a solution and their solution will be some sort of martial law with digital ID to confirm who's here And this is the danger of trump cracking down on the migrant situation I'm all for deporting these people. I'm not talking about our I'm not talking about our friends from Mexico who come here and bring their families It contribute to society and work cars. Those are some of my favorite people in the whole world Okay, but now what I'm talking about is people from third world countries that are criminals that are shipped here You have other people in other countries talking about how we are receiving the criminals in our country Which we are so when we think about trump deporting all these people Okay, we're talking about a potential and this is a big fear of mine And I've heard this fear from a lot of trump people that are going to vote for trump. They're like dude on voting for trump but there is a chance that he you know When we go to move these people there's going to become how do we know? Well, they got it you got to be a mere citizen get a digital ID They could implement all this shit and we have to be very It's very impressive. Yes, we have to be very very very smart We cannot just worship one man and say oh, he's the guy. It's going to fix it That's how you get in situations where we're begging for a solution and the solution comes so heavy handed And then never released no different than what happened after 9-11 with the Patriot Act Okay, the Patriot Act. Oh, we're going to spy on citizens over in the middle east. They just blew up our buildings Come to find out. We don't even know if that's true Oh, and by the way the Patriot got actors still in play and they spy on a medical citizens within every single fucking day And that's why they fucking hate that works. No, and that's why they Say that he's a traitor. He's a traitor because he's let us know that the American government is using the Patriot to To spy on us. Right. That's not a traitor. That's a patriot to fucking patriots. Yeah, so Like dude when we look at what's happening We the people have to be very independent thinkers. We cannot attach ourselves To one man or one solution no matter who that man or who that solution is We should be discerning about every single decision that's made uh, you know Critical of the negatives of those decisions and talk it out like a logical human being The problem we really have in this country is that people are planting their flag on one side or another And they don't care what that side does as long as their side wins And that's very unproductive and damaging to our culture and society and uh everything they're doing with the crime is just amplifying that more and more and more and um You know, it's a shame. It sucks, but yeah, I mean when you pass a law that says we're not gonna prosecute people up to $999 for theft Then who the fuck isn't gonna steal you know, you have movie stars coming out and they're like bro I go in the store and everybody's just walking out. Why the fuck should I pay right? Okay, and that puts companies out of business All right, like the domino effect the companies go out of business. Where do you got to get your food? And every other communist situation that's ever existed where do you get your fucking food? Oh, you get it from the government. Oh, and because you get it for the government and they're inefficient and they can't supply people the way What happens people starve? Why don't you go read the book red famine? It'll give you an idea of how this works Dude, we are this close away from having a fucking famine in this country For real. No dude every four fucking seconds a family farm is lost every four seconds in this country Holy fuck. Yeah That's crazy. Yep The American farmer is under attack dude and it's all for control. It's to make it So unprofitable that they can operate sees their land replace their food with all this chemical shit These you know, what the fuck is it burgers and all this shit that bill gates owns and all these people own and it's all for money and control and business Like dude, this is insane. This is insane shit. These people have no soul. They have no care They do not care about you. They do not care about me They only care about themselves and their small little circle of very evil people And that's what we're dealing with and the only way for us to truly get through this and when is for all of us to unite And become critical thinkers and say okay Right now. This is the right choice right now Trump is the right choice otherwise we're for sure gonna lose over here But if Trump gets in and starts doing fucked up shit. We can't just say oh DT's the man. We got to say hey that guy's messing up. This has this is wrong We need to find a middle ground and we have to realize that black white left right Straight gay Whatever they all they see us as the same they see us as little peasant Kakroches that have to take what they decide is for us which is completely Out of line with what this country supposed to be about and I do think people are waking up to that But dude what we really need is we need fucking unity We need people to come together. Yeah, we're not gonna get the pink hair Crazy people that are insane, but they can be invited too if they want But the reality is we're probably not gonna get them Most people that have common sense most people are the same They want the same things bro. They don't want to pay a bunch of taxes They want to be healthy. They want to be happy They want to be able to pursue their version of the American dream They want to be able to afford a house. They want to be able to afford To live and these are things that everybody wants And the only people that don't want that are the people that want to take that from the people who are trying to do that And these Democrats right now they're communist okay that 200 people that voted for Migrants to not have ID those people are communist They're communist okay, and they've infiltrated our government those people will never come to the unified side Never Okay, and they're gonna try to take everything from you and whenever they get enough power You know what they're gonna do to you if you don't fucking like what they do they're gonna kill you Because that's what communist do. I don't think people understand how close we are to that I think people think this is just normal political cycle. It's not it's just not Yeah So this country's ever been well, dude. I think we have more unity now than we've had in the last 10 12 14 15 years for sure Um, I'm seeing it more. I'm you know in a big driver for that is humor People are starting to joke about shit that they couldn't even joke about two three years ago Otherwise they were this or they were that or they were this you know language is loosening up people are having a lot And everybody who's still you know getting all up tight and saying you know that I must know flake There's still throwing fits about fucking every single thing you see what I'm saying So like I think the fact that humor's coming back and people are laughing together And people are like telling jokes that would have been considered like off color three or four years ago But 20 years ago they were hilarious on color. Yeah, I mean yeah, no shit Oh shit, but dude we're getting back to it man, and it's cool But like dude Everybody has to realize that we are in a very dangerous time And it's not going to end if Trump gets elected because the power that he wields If he wields the power to let's say you know, deport all these people We better make sure that he has a plan to pull that power back You know what I mean? It has to be based off of large demands. Yeah, that's right. We still have to say these people serve us Right these people serve us. They do not serve themselves And I do I personally do feel that Trump does that. No, that's my personal opinion I know people fucking you know all fuck this or fuck that or whatever wrote look man We're presenting with two options right now. We have one option that goes this way. We have one option that goes that way We have to pick the better option right now and then hopefully in 2028 Guess what hopefully the two options will be better than the two options that we have now And we get to pick again We could go this way or we could go that way And you know how successful people dictate and run their lives one decision at a time They they say okay, we could go this way we could go that way All right, well, this is better than that so I'm gonna go this way I'm not even if I don't like this person. I'm gonna go this way because it's better. No, okay Now two years down the road. Hey, we could do this or we could do that Okay, well this time I don't like this way so we're gonna go that way and that's how we need to think about it It can't just be this you know the biggest thing that's happened That I think negatively affects Our country is that they have tricked people into identifying with a political party no matter what And that's not that's not right You know what I'm saying like the way that these Democrats Simp for pedophiles and child molesters and sexual crime uh sexual criminals Like anybody with like it's it's amazing to me How many people who are traditional Democrats just like look past that like that's that's bad the big deal That's a huge deal dude and that's bad That's wrong and and they're willing to just pretend like it's not happening when it is happening You know you you have grown men showing their dicks at Pride parades when there's kids around you have grown men dancing in front of little kids at school Why are grown men dancing in front of little kids at a school The kids aren't asking for it and now and why are they're not women Who pretend to be men doing the same thing? Oh, well, that's because we have a pedophile problem We have a bunch of pedophiles who have worked their way into the LGBTQ umbrella And some people believe that they have protected privilege and that's insane All of those people deserve to be dealt with we cannot have a society of minor attracted people We cannot have grown men showing up in little kids bathrooms. You see what I'm saying? And people don't want to have the argument with people so they don't say anything It's like dude if you don't say anything. This is what's gonna happen. I saw this meme the other day Says turn off the news you were never meant to carry the burden of the entire world Okay, this is a meme and I saw it posted it had like fucking 47,000 likes Do you know why we're here? Do you know why we're in this predicament? Because too many of you Believe that meme turn off the news turn off the news Do your life live your life. Well, guess what that shit that you're talking about is in very serious Jeopardy at this point in time and the reason we are here is because many people have taken what that meme says to heart and they've become Detached from reality. They live in their own little bubble. They say I'm gonna live peacefully and I'm gonna do this So I'm gonna do that and I'm not gonna pay attention over here. The problem is is that Even if you don't pay attention, that's going to come for you Okay, I cannot pay attention to a tornado But if it's coming at me that doesn't mean it's not going to hit me just because you're paying attention You know like this is what we're dealing with here and It's amazing to me how many people still Think that other people are going to solve the problem other people can't solve the problem Only you can solve the problem All right, that's the key to this whole thing Other people cannot solve the problem for you here You have to solve the problem and if we all solve the problem in our own household and our own community in our own network The problem will cease to exist But because we have been conditioned to believe that somebody's going to ride in on some sort of white stallion horse and save the day for us And we haven't had to have our hands in this for so long It's been too good for too long people still believe this and this is what's allowing the Just destruction of this country. Yeah, hey man the tornadoes come. I don't really care for weather I don't really believe in tornadoes. I don't really care for weather. Yeah. I like talking about weather. Yeah Did that's the equivalent here? It's like what the yeah, you're not going to try you out of the way you're not going to try Nah, it's not real live-level. Yeah, it's not real It's insane. It's just it's just ones and zeros. It's fake Yeah, I don't know. I'm just sick of the lies dude. Yeah, like I'm sick of the the idealism I'm sick of the ignorance and the ignoring of the problem I'm sick of people that just Like dude, it makes me angry when I talk to people who I know are like successful and have their shit going on And they have no idea what's going on. I fucking I get so pissed at him I'm like oh, so I've got to give up my fucking day-to-day life to protect you And you don't even give a shit. You see what I'm saying It's funny because the culture is what has to be fixed here and The culture is fixed by entrepreneurs How you run your company is how people are gonna run their household? How they run their household? It's how they're gonna run the community how the community runs determines what's going on in America Okay, so all of you guys who listen for business and entrepreneurship you better realize that you have a major role to play in this And it's correcting the culture that you went along with for the last 15 years because the biggest companies in the world went along with it Dei ESG Ridiculous fucking culture issues and political correctness All of this you did because you saw bigger companies doing it and the reason that bigger companies were doing it Was because they had it dictated to them by the banks and the banks had it dictated them by groups like the world economic forum And they did this to force cultural behavior change all right you have a Larry think says this he says this in public All right, so these people Change the behavior in the organizations knowing that the entrepreneur were copied the most successful organizations And now you have a bunch of small businesses, which is where most people work Running their companies with all of these initiatives when in reality all of those initiatives are designed to create a different behavior on the ground level Which is what our culture is in America like I don't know how to explain that anymore clearly Like the culture that you creating your business is the culture that people take home the culture that people take home Is how their families race how their families race and represent themselves in the community is what creates the culture of the community Which is what creates the culture of America and that means you have A responsibility to set that example whether you are an employee whether you are an employer or whether you are just someone who cares about this country and lives in your neighborhood and needs to represent a standard of What you believe America should be you know This isn't about getting everybody else to live like we want them to live This is about us living how we know we should live so that other people will see it and follow along and people don't like that because it takes work And it's hard. It's much easier to believe that Donald Trump's gonna write in on his pony and save the day Which isn't gonna happen culture has to change and it the only way culture changes is if the people change and that's you Yeah, I love it man guys jumping on this conversation Let us know down in the comments what you guys think about it.
