that we put up topics on the screen we talk about what's true what's not true we speculate on what we think is going on and then we talk about how we the people have to be the solution of these problems going on now today I'm just going to get right into it we are joined again by our good friend Mr. Andrew Bailey the attorney general of Missouri what's happening bro hey thanks for having me on guys appreciate you having me back it's great to see you could see all how's everything going it's good man staying busy find the good fight yeah I see that I see that I see that baby Bailey's my homie yeah is it yeah he's putting their work man I was just made me proud to be a Missouri trying to keep up the all we got some patriots here Miss Erie we do man you know we do very good man now Andrew Bailey you know DJ DJ yeah you know first black patriot in Missouri you'll play that cricket sound right there you know but a G Bailey Mr. A G you've been putting in work man I just like I appreciate the opportunity to get to serve and like appreciate getting lumped in with you and center Eric Schmidt man that's good company I feel like I'm like the all-star patriots you know it's funny though man there's been a few times and I'm still going to knock on wood that we don't have to do this but you know I ride my bike and down on 55 riding 55 south of my bike you know I might press the the speed a little bit and every time it plays in my head man it's like man I pray I've never had to call Andrew Bailey to help me out out of the situation bro because it's my way patrol man there's levels to they don't play go straight to the age I'm saying I'm just like I don't know what to do like I'm gonna call Andrew you work up the change so I just hope you never get a call from me man I'm there for you brother I appreciate it don't pull me over don't tell it that we call you three at the morning yeah man say the call I'm said to call no but man you've been putting in some work man we got a few things happening right now you saw you on the the Harrison butler stuff yeah happening on that how's that going yeah man look this was an instance in which Harrison butler expressed his sincerely held Christian beliefs at a Christian college to an audience that applauded at a commencement ceremony for graduation and the left lost their mind awesome I'm but the problem here is that the city of Kansas City had a ex account a Twitter account where they essentially docks Harrison butler why would they do that if not to retaliate against him for his expression of his religious police well thank God we have the first amendment to the United States Constitution that says we are allowed to express ourselves and allowed to exercise religion as we see fit absent government intrusion and so that was an egregious example of again government retaliating against an individual for their sincerely held religious police we have a Missouri human rights act that provides the attorney general of enforcement authority and we've demanded certain records from the city of Kansas City to determine who manages a social media account and we got a safeguard your in place to prevent this from happening again they they fire that I think I saw somebody fired the guy who did it or something like that but like yeah you're not you're still not safe bro well that that's right I mean it's accountability but not transparency right we still don't know who it was or what control measures are in place to prevent it from happening again yeah dude I feel like a lot of times that we see these things happen it's just we see because social media is still new right like it's not like it's been around for a hundred years and I feel like a lot of companies are still adjusting to who has the power to say and speak on behalf of the company because I could tell you this there's been a number of times where I've seen stuff put out of here and I'm like calling back I'm like what the fuck are you guys doing take that shit down not very often but I mean it happens and I wonder if that was the case there yeah I think so because I you know somebody with their own belief sure just expressing them through the company channel yeah that you know I think there's a distinction here when it's the government and I think that's really when it became a problem that and oh yeah and I also think that uh you know that but to your point I mean the very next day the mayor of Kansas City went on a talk radio show and said he apologized now what he apologized for was not the content of the retaliation so he apologized that it was in the on the wrong medium of communication we just used the wrong Twitter account essentially so kind of a hollow dude how are we to this point like legitimately it feels like we're at this point well I do feel like culture's changing so I say that first I know it is but it's so bizarre to me that the dynamic between the left and the right when it comes to culture that the left has no problem attacking insulting doxing and the right like oh they're always like we'll take the Hyrule we don't do those kind of things it's like dude like we're it's like this double standard where like if we say anybody with common sense that centrist or to the right says anything that they don't like they throw a fit but the minute they get it back dude they can't handle it at all it's a weird thing yeah that that high road stuff is weird man because it's like you know we're we're trying to still play this nice game where we select those rules and it's like that's not the game this is a man if you're you're a veteran if you if you if you're in a battle and and people are shooting at you and you look at the guys and be like you know I feel bad for these guys I don't really want to shoot them back what happens you get killed and we have to get to a point where the people who are center and center right and right are speaking up and say hey fuck off you know this isn't cool because dude he did nothing wrong he did nothing he's a Benedictine it's a it's a Christian it's a Catholic school this is the beliefs if you don't like those beliefs don't go to the Catholic school you know why is that's why is this so hard for people to understand well and if you listen to it's like a 19 minute commencement speech the first awesome yeah the first part of his speech you know what he said was that the left wants to drive Christian thought expression of Christian belief from the public domain from public discourse they don't want to hear it they want to silence any voice and then what happened yeah exactly prove the point they prove the point is prophetic yeah it's crazy man you've been putting in some work though man what so you're on the campaign trail now yeah how's that going it's good man it's good we're in a good spot you know people have seen the work we've done fighting and winning from azureans for the past 18 months and they're excited about it you know between removing the sorrows back prosecutor in the city of st. Louis it was unlawfully refusing to do her job to shutting down the you know transgender child mutilation industry in the state of Missouri increasing criminal prosecution across the state by 133% just to clean up some of the criminal behavior and hold wrong to lose accountable and find justice for victims you know those are signature wins that we've scored in a short period of time this has shown me state results matter yeah where it is Kim she's still playing where's Waldo she's in the win man this appeared she's laying low I like playing how to go see I mean if you guys need some help just call me you know I can help out a little bit you know she's playing fucking where's Waldo man are they still still no no Kim Gardner no no no no she's probably in like a ruby or something showing yeah you probably pay for it too oh man it's wow for me too well sweet man well I'm happy he's here man I'm just yeah it's good to see you hey get to see you guys see you man well I want to bring something up before we get to our headlines I'm not sure if you guys saw this but you know we talk about this temperature changing we talk about you know lifelong Democrats saying like hey we're done with this stuff right and this is an interesting story coming right out of California let's tell I'm reach Democrat California Senator blast party over pedophile jail sentence fight I'm done with us did you guys see this I did it's amazing it's amazing so let's dive into this a little bit a California state senator fighting to throw pedophiles into prison for longer has blasted progressive members of her own party for trying to water down the new law declaring quote I'm done with us Democratic Senator Susan Eggman who reps part of the sand uh with a sandquan Joaquin Joaquin Joaquin yeah I should have known that that sounds you should have I should have known that yeah who reps part of sand Joaquin County just outside of San Francisco gave the fiery speech on the Senate floor last Thursday when lawmakers were weighing legislation that could make it a felony to purchase or solicit a minor for commercial sex in the golden state um let's watch the video let's see what she has to say thank you mr president and uh members um I'd like to say as a as a progressive proud member of this body for the last 12 years I'm done I'm done with us protecting people who would buy and abuse our children I'm done I don't want to send more black and brown men to prison I don't want more people in prison but I don't want people buying girls I don't want people buying little girls anymore and I'm tired of saying it's okay and that we have to protect the men who do it as a mental health professional and as a social worker I can tell you I've spent my entire career working with people who have been wounded I'm not going to say beyond repair but they have been wounded to their core by the abuse that's been heaped on them oftentimes by those that they love and look to protect them and if their parents won't do it then by God we should I think she let a little cat out the bag there a little Freudian slip up there you mean like where she said I've been protecting them yeah I don't want to send more black and brown people to jail so who's who's doing it you know I'm saying I got she made a little slip up there but I didn't I didn't think that you're taking that I thought she I thought the slip up was she basically said we've been protecting these people yeah like out in the open yeah I mean why is that why are like are these people like what it where does like you've been around these people like what where does this come from that they want to protect or and like minimize like sex crimes and molestation and abuse like what yeah yeah because like we out here we all just think they're pedophiles too right this is what they're into yeah you're you're in a conspiracy to assist these people in the the target offensive pedophilia yeah yeah and it's it's crazy we you to your point earlier you know as a country we used to elevate the rules of the game above the players in the outcomes and the rules mattered and you know the left and the right might disagree we all agreed that we wanted a safer streets better economy jobs for folks you know the simple things how we got there we would have policy disagreement over that now the left has completely jettison the woke left has completely abandoned any pretense of attempting to achieve pragmatic good practical good they don't care like they no longer would even acknowledge that there is good and bad and in a moral sense in other words they're okay with child sex trafficking they don't want to stiffened penalties to punish child sex traffickers that's insanity I mean I I don't know how you they're you're no longer playing by the same set of the rules or or the you know the when you can't even agree that there's practical good from protecting kids from sexual assault how do you even begin a conversation dude it's common sense man and it's very common ground that people can be united on nobody that no normal person I've ever met could sit back and say somebody who abuses kids or molest kids or as a pedophile or a map or whatever they call them deserves lighter treatment like deserves a break like we're to me where we come from here we put you know we we don't put but we would like to put those people in what chippers yeah yeah yeah yeah the only thing that's worse than the pedophile is somebody that protects them that's just my stance man I think you're just as guilty you're just as guilty I just told I have a hard time configuring out where the fuck this comes a position like how is this a position no like how do we come up like how do these guys think hey you know what we should do we should stand up and protect these people to do these shit to kids like what where is the virtue in that like where who does that appeal to when you're it's completely ignoring the actual victim of the crime yeah the kid and to smithing it like it's nothing yeah well and to her point I mean look you may send up a child sex offender to prison for a term of years that kids can live with that the rest of their lives yeah I mean they're serving a life sentence right I think dude I think there's there isn't a very loud stench of evil undertone with people like that that support stuff like that like the to me there is no other there's no other explanation for it man like that is evil that's evil stuff so what do you think what chippers yeah I mean I look there's no punishment to to step for right those you would what's your punishment man yeah harsh punishment yeah I got it dude we're in it next Andrew Bailey campaign commercial let's do it he's driving the tank with this the woodshipper it's all behind it yeah I love it I love it I love it with the helmet on everything I love it man well guys let's get it to these headlines remember if you want to see any of these articles pictures links videos go to Andy for seller dot com you guys can find that link uh with that big set head on number one uh let's talk about it it's the uh it's the talk of the town talk of the country have I read jury resumes deliberations in New York v trump trial uh this is I've never seen anything like this this is uh this is crazy so let's let's get through some of the fast facts here we got uh the jury enters its second day of deliberations and former president trump's new york criminal trial on thursday um at the time of the recording they're still in deliberations um there is no timeline for how long the deliberations will last uh but a verdict could come down as soon as thursday afternoon uh this is fox news reporting um and the uh the the third fast fact here is that trump and his defense team are required to be present for the deliberations uh so they can uh hear any potential notes from the juries um now a couple of interesting things that's been going on there's been a poll that came out um CNN had their own version of this as well um the the new poll reveals how trump trial verdict will impact the 2024 election where they found uh that two thirds of registered voters nationwide uh that were questioned in this npr uh pbs news hour um marist national poll uh that was released uh they they two thirds of people said a guilty verdict in the trial would make no difference to their vote in the presidential election um and then 17% said a conviction of trump would make them less likely to vote for him and 15% said they'd be more inclined to support the former president at the ballot box um so it doesn't uh you know it doesn't it doesn't say explicitly what the two thirds if they're voting for or against it just said that they're not changing their minds so uh whatever that may be um and of course there's been a monopoly on this stuff you go to any of the msm heads um they have spent a collective of 10 hours um that's 10 consecutive hours of non-stop talk about this case just in the last week um so you think of all the primetime air show air hours and watch time they're getting they're spent to the average about 10 hours or 640 minutes consecutively talking about this trial um but here's a weird thing not once in any of those times they mentioned the the angle of political prosecution they don't even mention that alvin bragg is a registered democrat who ran under the democrat campaign um and solely ran to get trump in this exact situation um they don't even mention it um now the most interesting thing here which uh let's open this up for discussion is the fact that with this uh the the jury trial and the jury rules right and how there is no uh you know unanimous decision that has to be made um we have an attorney in the room who is very well versed in this stuff ex can you explain to us what they're trying to do and uh what's the problem with it yeah a lot of problems going on here I mean this is an illicit witch hunt prosecution it is not intended to to obtain a legally valid conviction of a criminal defendant it is solely designed to uh take present trump off the campaign trail and to to the extent they obtain a conviction that it'll the court of appeals will have to overturn it but that could take years it'll undermine the first few years of a second admit trump administration I mean they're going to poison a well that will be drawing water from for a very long time we should all be concerned because this is what a banana republic looks like when you bend the rules to go after political opponents crime is rampant in new york in manhattan and yet they're going to expend these resources on a made up crime that is not supported by the facts or the law but but within the context of the closing sequence of the trial a few things going on here number one the president is charged with 34 different counts and they all some of them require a predicate offense like he interfered with uh the election by committing this crime into doing xyz the problem is the judge has declared and read to the jury and the jury instructions that they don't have to have unanimity they don't have to be unanimous all twelve of them don't have to agree on what the predicate crime is that creates a roving commission I mean at that point it's like throw everything against the wall see what sticks whatever you guys come up with is fine that violates not only the president's six amendment right to a fair trial to violate to process how can he prepare for trial and defend himself and it's like anything could be a crime you know this when the jury instructions are when the law as given is provided by the judge in this context is so abstract that the jury is free to roam through the evidence as it sees fit and pick any old thing to to hinge liability upon that becomes really unfair and so that's what that's a significant legal problem since twenty twenty the United States Supreme Court in the case of ramels v. Louisiana has held that juries in criminal trials must be unanimous that wasn't always the case prior to twenty twenty there were two states that still didn't have a requirement for jury unanimity in criminal trials Louisiana and then Oregon for some lower level offenses and in twenty twenty that all changed when the court handed down ramels v. Louisiana so this is a legal error of enormous magnitude that'll have to be corrected at the court of appeals but is one more piece of evidence that this was an illicit which on prosecution so what just so forgive my ignorance on this but if they don't all have to agree and there's twelve right yeah so does that mean three can think he was guilty of one thing three can think he was guilty of something else three can think he was guilty of something else and three can think he was guilty of even something else and because they all think he's guilty of something he's guilty that that's right and that's what I'm saying that's a roving commission that's insane it yeah that is completely violates so so you could have three people that agree he did this and nine that agree they say he didn't yeah but then because you have three that agreed it's something else dude that's crazy it's an enormous has that has that ever happened ever so the actual the the basis for the so in the federal rules it's always required jury unanimity Louisiana and Oregon in the late 1800s changed their state laws to eliminate the requirement for jury unanimity because of Jim Crow they realized they had to allow people of every ethnicity every skin color on juries so they wanted a silent certain voices so that that's why they created this lack of jury unanimity at the state level in those two states that was well outlined by Justice Neil Gorsuch in his opinion in Ramos V Louisiana and so again the the historical context here it is terrible for for the Democrats right I mean it there's a you have a black prosecutor using a racist technique the silence black people off of a jury to get a conviction on somebody doesn't like that's fucking insane man yep yep that's insane well let's check in with with Trump because he had a statement on this this was earlier when he came out from break dude that's insane that's insane yeah absolutely isn't when you're not going to read about that in the media yeah no they were they were frustrated exactly well bro I couldn't this is why I wanted to ask you because eat with the information that's coming out of both sides has been very unclear of what that actually means and how that affects what's going on I think that most people don't understand what we just talked about at all and I think if they did they would be more outward there would be a palt eat people from both sides yeah yeah this is what Trump had to say thank you very much I would say in listening to the judges from the judges as you know very conflicted and corrupt because of the confliction very very corrupt mother to risk it could not be these judges these judges are rigged the whole thing is rigged the whole countries of mess between the borders and fake elections and you haven't tried like this with the judges so conflicted he can't breathe he's got to do his job and it's not for me that I can tell you it's a disgrace and I mean that mother to racing could not be those judges but we'll see we'll see how we do it's a very disgraceful situation every single legal scholar and expert said this is no case it shouldn't be broad and it certainly could have been brought seven years ago not in the middle of a presidential election it was all done by Joe Biden this judge contributed to Joe Biden and far worse than that but I'm not allowed to talk about it because I'm a gay girl at far worse than that by a thousand times worse than that the worst I've ever heard but I can't talk about it it'll be talked about but I'm not allowed to talk about it but it'll be talked about in the history books what's happening here is weaponization and a level that nobody's seen before ever and it shouldn't be allowed to happen so I'll stay around here this is five weeks then five weeks are really essentially not campaigning although I took a big lead in the polls over the last few weeks something's going on because I think the people of this country see that this is a rigged deal it's a weaponized deal for the Democrats to hit their political opponent for Joe Biden the worst the worst president in the history of the United States he's destroying our countries letting millions of people from jails from prisons from insane us albums from mental institutions drug dealers poor end that is well if you look at their crime statistics they've gone down 72% in drag because they're releasing all their criminals into our country because in this horrible president that we have and then they have a protest of Robert De Nierius there's a fool he's a broken down fool standing out there he got he got magnitude but I just want to say it's a very unfair trial I should have never happened if it was going to happen it should happen seven years he goes you know Greg didn't want to bring it the southern district didn't bring it the FEC didn't bring it this judge didn't even let us use the number one election attorney he's making the rules he does not think about elections he doesn't order to think about voting and vote counts he just don't want to think about this stuff that's not his profession we had the leading election expert in the country Brad Smith ready to test if I wouldn't let him do it they wouldn't let another gentleman who represented and you know very well you saw it was the worst I think I've ever seen and who were treated understand Bob Castella wouldn't let him talk about all of the and the hundreds of emails that he was sent by a gentleman another gentleman who I can't mention because I'm gagged every time I speak to you yes these simple questions I'm not allowed to give you the answer because I'm gagged by this judge but we have a very very serious problem yeah I mean our country's going bad and remember and let me just leave you with this this is all because of Joe Biden is and I not even think it's him I don't think he's smart enough to think about it but it's the people that surround him in the office this mark they're fascist they're communist but they're smart and they're ruining our country but we're going to win this election November 5th going to be the most important day in the history of our country we're going to take back our country from these fascists and these thugs that are destroying us with inflation and with everything they do how stupid they are allowing 15 16 17 million people into our country totally invented totally unchecked we're going to bring back our nation November 5th remember most important day in the history of our country in the meantime this trial is rigged thank you well he said communist that it's very specific yeah because that's exactly what they are man I think they just want this stuff right here you remember those AI pictures came out about about uh about Trump getting locked up and stuff that's what they want that's what they want the people to see anything else on this topic guys yet the gag order I think is really important uh the you know there's a presumption against gag orders because they violate the first member right to free speech and there a gag order is intended to protect at least in part the defendants right to a fair trial well then why would you gag the defendant it's his right if he wants to wave it in the same way you can wave your other rights if he wants to be out there talking about it and for so that that presumption against uh uh you know a gag order as violative of the first amendment should be especially true when you've got a presidential candidate in the heat of a campaign i mean it the gag order alone in in my mind is like that one of the most egregious things that's that's happened and again just one more piece of evidence that this is an illicit pro illicit witch on prosecution what do you think he's talking about when he says a thousand times worse you know i think that again there was a period of time where we used to elevate the rules of the game above the players and the outcomes and and instead instead of you alvin bragging if you go to his website the man had in district attorney it says one standard of justice for all how does that guy keep a straight face and say that when crime is rampant New York City and they're not locking up the drug dealers or the people assaulting innocent victims on the subways and stabbing and murders they're not doing anything about that but yet they're going to use the third ranking official from Biden's Department of Justice and bring them in to assist at the trial court level prosecution of a presidential candidate on made up charges and then not allow the president to campaign or talk about it and not give the jury the actual physical copy the jury instructions and not require unanimity on the the the predicate offense i mean it's like item after item after item after item that you line up here and it it even if you don't like president trump which personally i think he's great but if you don't like president trump how can you possibly say that this this system is fair or that this system was intended or designed to protect the defendants individual rights to free Trump well fair trial yeah i mean look what's the repercussions of this going to be because clearly they're operating outside the the boundaries of normal courtroom procedure so you have trump talking about you know presidents get immunity they get immunity they get immunity and clearly he's not getting it so what is that going to mean for these guys if he gets back in power well to your point yeah i think this boomerangs uh if if the left is going to commit law fair and we're going to undermine the rule of law they should be prepared to experience that as well and i think i think that that's why there are certain people who may like for instance in today's supreme court decision it was a nine o' decision in favor of the nra against the state of new york on a first amendment claim and you know even uh so do mayor who i believe wrote the the opinion probably looked at and said well she may not be aligned with the nra but she doesn't want that happening to her advocacy political groups either and so there's some people that can at least kind of pierce through that and see that for for what it is so you think they're starting these people are potentially starting to realize that he might win and that if they if they behave in this manner that there could be repercussions on their stuff i hope so yeah i mean look the deep state has been out to get Donald trump since before 2016 remember leesa page and peter struck and the text messages the deep state of the doj was already plotting to undermine his presidency and that that same doj refused to prosecute hilly clinton for destroying government property that had classified information refused to prosecute president bite new head classified information in his garage but then throws everything they got after president trump at both the federal and state level on again this elicit witch hunt prosecutions that it's fundamentally unfair it offends our basic sense of fairness it offends the law uh it's enormously problematic you know i think the best thing about this is the the president has been said i agree because i think this thing about this is communist shit dude like this is this is show me the man and i'll find the crime yes that is not what the united states is is built around no no no so i mean that's the best thing about it and i think people should really be concerned about this because like trump says and this doesn't matter if you're left or right or in between if they can do that to him that means they could do it to you and they will yeah power absolutely little guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think uh down there and uh speaking in comments let's cruise so all right about that uh we got some interesting stuff here um 69 andy steward uh he says Biden has done more on infrastructure than any other president and living memory pay attention i think you left out destroying infrastructure yeah don't want to destroy it if you've got to left that out there yeah you're right yeah done more to fuck it all up yeah dude you know what's funny because these this guy writes this because they signed the fucking infrastructure bill and he doesn't realize that infrastructure bill had nothing to do with infrastructure yeah you know now what was the thing they spent like 12 billion dollars that was budgeted for EV stations but they got six built they built like seven yeah six or seven yeah but they're supposed to have like five hundred dollar yeah it's been a few years dude it's weird to me how many people like believe so strongly that they understand what's going on they don't understand what what was that bill three thousand pages or some crazy shit and they introduced it at the middle of the night it was like in the middle of the night and then they sat in the next day that's what I was there's not a single human on the planet that could have read it no and yeah i mean who knows what's in it who knows what they're voting on i mean the the process they're so flawed and i think special interest ends up winning and the people lose on stuff like that yeah dude and then we're looking at the infrastructure go look at Japan go look at china go look at Dubai and then look at our shit okay and you're telling me this dude work that anybody's been doing anything good for infrastructure i mean and dude with you say that for Trump too we can say that for the last seven presidents our country looks like shit we're way behind so this isn't this isn't even a democrat republican thing this is a corrupt politician thing like they take the money and they don't do what they say they're gonna do it's just an honesty thing man yeah so any you know your comment was pretty fucking stupid good name yeah stupid ass comment yeah this next one comes from Harris Jeff too bad someone reads to need no someone needs to read thank you so much you know i yeah he was surely he's talking about me I mean fuck you Harris hey all right you didn't want to say who it was because you didn't want to be called racist that's what he listen that's what it was someone that's fine those people i mean we're right i ain't worried about that one guy what's his name what's the description what do you look like fucking he's a young man oh man he got he's got but he's got dark hair you know we're at you know gonna assholes man this last comment i mean more fuckers not wrong

the word yeah guys we appreciate all of you guys thank you guys for being real ass fans keep life first guy except for yeah that first guy can yeah Harris you can too Brian go lie but i would be wrong that being said let's get to head on number two headline number two reads movie log bite and tells black voters trump wanted to tear gas them during peaceful George Floyd protests this is my faith this might be my like legitimately my favorite time of the year is like every four years the election start panthering i love the pandering i love it and uh this is great this is great i think this this my all this might almost top the fried chicken that Biden did really did you see that fried chicken stuff no oh bro oh he did a commercial where he was going to have dinner with a black family and brought fried chicken yeah like this guy really thinks this is how he's gonna connect with the black community i mean listen how you did all right like i appreciate you bring i'm gonna eat it but that's that's fucked up man i know but like here's the thing okay look dude i'll eat it too i like fried chicken man you like fried chicken love it yeah fried chicken is the shit everybody likes it yeah but there's a thing i'm by the way i'm tired of black people claiming it like it's theirs i like fried chicken it is no it isn't it is not you can eat it okay you can eat it all right but we all know what Colonel Sanders what do you i'm gonna just say it i'm just saying you're saying he stole he stole him 11 than 11 spices and herbs saying he did that's it that is it that's a pretty serious accusation just saying well i'm gonna talk shit on the man you have any information back that up well i mean i don't want to talk about he's not here to defend himself but that's fair he stole that fucking chicken recipe bro this this is very like in keeping with uh Biden's explanations during his initial presidential campaign about uh being like the lifeguard at the pool oh man conflict with corn pop yeah yeah the they got these stories and he's so out of touch like the it's it's only but think about the meeting like okay we're all having a meeting and we're like hey all right Joe fucking black people hate you we got to fix this so what says i got an idea yeah here's what we'll do we'll bring a fine chicken i'll go on the morning uh what's that show with the the the morning club morning Joe no no no was it where he said you ain't black oh the uh the Charlemagne Charlemagne god he goes on Charlemagne show and he's like i got an idea i'm gonna tell him all the ain't black and let's say what do you like what the fuck dude where's this dude get this advisement from bro i don't know man but this is bad this is uh i got it i see it's a no seats i got a watermelon sealus all right we get more black audience i'm gonna come to your house with some fried chicken let's do it bro let's do it pop eyes baby i'm really surprised that Biden can still eat solid foods i mean he's usually like going out of me before nap time yeah he is on a smooth diet for sure i sure sure um yeah but this is this is crazy so uh so while he was uh doing a uh i guess you can call it a rally of uh 52 people in uh filadelphia uh he he said let's just watch the clip let's watch here's a clip running again and it's clearly unhinged he calls insurrection to storm the capital patriots patriots if reelected he wants to pardon quote every one of them let me ask you what do you think he would have done on january 6th if black americans that stormed think about this what they would have happened if black americans that stormed the capital i don't think he'd be talking about pardons it's the same guy wanted to tear gas you as you peacefully protested George Floyd's murder the same guy who still calls the central park five guilty even though they were exonerated he's that landlord who denies housing application because of the color of his skin he's that guy who won't say black lives matter and evokes neo nazi third right terms we all remember trump is the same guy on at least berthism the berthism lie against baroque and then trump tells you he's the greatest president i love this one he says he's the greatest president of black people in the history of american including more than Abraham Lincoln i mean can you fathom that we're in the head like i said i think he injected too much of that bleaching is coming back to get affected his brain what happened to his brain somebody's brain is affected that's for sure but it's funny man hold on so trump wanted to tear gas black people when he was in power when they were peacefully protesting right which wasn't peaceful my name and it was far more not peaceful than what happened to j6 by statistics alone yeah okay but he wanted to tear gas them when he had the power to tear gas them but didn't tear gas them so that's bullshit for our chicken anybody yeah how incredibly offensive that joe biden thinks if the everyone with a certain skin color thinks and behaves exactly the same way yeah that is insanely offensive i mean and across the board it's fucking it's messed up man i think was also messed up too is like how how they get on these campaign trails these them crafts bro and like they just completely shit on 70% of the population you know what i'm saying like that's messed up that's messed up like they are so strongly trying to get this black vote this year which i believe is gone like they have lost it completely i don't think they even have it anymore um but you know it doesn't stop them from from continued a lot of people uh this is another headline biden campaign co-chair americans have too many struggles right now to understand biden's incredible achievements how does well that's the point that's that's actually the point the point is to make things so hard to make things so oppressive financially to make times so hard to make the division so strong that people can't see his incredible destruction of america that's the point that's the exact point that's insane that's watching this clip that's what that's the game bro the game is a bunch of elite people quote unquote elite who believe their elite go to wash and dc and they get us to fight they get us to argue they make policy that make it hard for us to be prosperous if we had prosperity at a wide scale if we weren't destroyed by taxes and the middle class was able to comfortably live and not panic and not be frustrated and not scraped together to pay their bills we would notice the shit going on a society a lot easier and they know that so their goal is to create an environment of division and hardship so that they can get away with more shit that affects us in a negative way and benefits them that is the entire game that's the game is being played and until black people and white people and gay people and straight people and the people on the left and the people on the right start realizing that we're all seeing the same way by those people we're not going to get anywhere yeah there has to be unity and i'm talking common sense unity like i'm not saying unity with the you know uh pedophiles that are dancing at kids schools and teaching them to do ridiculous shit i'm talking about common sense people common sense democrats common sense republicans common sense black people white people asian people latino people fucking we need unity because if we're united they have no power and that's why they make it hard so like when i read this because i actually saw this last night i was like yeah that's exactly correct yeah his incredible achievements in the destruction of this country because no one's destroyed more of this country in a shorter amount of time than Joe Biden he's breaking records yeah he's breaking records that's the statistical reality that's not just bias or because you know i don't like them that's we could go down the statistics of this yeah yeah let's let's diamond to what she said because actually got some some some fun fact checks on this lady um let's see what she had to say then i think the question is if the campaign was in such good shape with black voters as president Biden has done in the past so many times why would it be using its most valuable resource the president to hold so many events five events targeting black voters in may of an election year you know i think part of it is to show that we see how important that vote is a lot of times people feel like their vote doesn't matter um a lot of people are going through a lot of struggles right now coming out of the pandemic and they are not even aware of the things that this administration has done to really uplift our community so is that evidence of why we're seeing some i'm sorry interrupt is that evidence of why we are seeing some of the erosion right now the need to sort of better communicate that so they can bring those black voters back you know again i think a lot of people are have their own pains and things that they're dealing with and so we want to make sure that we highlight the different investments that he has made whether it is in our infrastructure and creating jobs the lowest black unemployment rate in you know in 50 years and probably ever for us investments in our black small businesses which is why he was visiting small businesses today when you look at the investment in education you know the the sixteen billion dollars for hbc use and also student debt relief which is one of the top issues that i hear about from black voters i had a capital police officer stop me on my way into the capital ask me to roll down my window and he said my wife is a school teacher she's been working for decades we were able to get that debt relief and it's the first time that we've been able to get out from under and i feel like i hit the lottery i want you to tell joe thank you we want to make sure that people see and hear those stories right and we're making those investments now because it is a pride yard yeah that hbc you mean the hbc you that trump said hey we'll fund you forever and you don't even have to come back and ask and then Biden said hey you got to come back every year and ask yeah that's funny and the numbers you know so basically you got to come back every year and beg us for money trump said that just so you guys i'm being sarcastic when trump was in office the hbc that came in the office trump said hey we got you you don't have to come back every single year like you've had to do forever and then Biden changes that when he gets in office and so now they're trying to play it like they're doing something great for hbc you and actually it's worse than what was happening during trump not only that the 16 billion she's touting is completely off base what's the actual facts is trump funded them and gave them 45 billion dollars Biden dropped that to two okay this is a actual fact let's dive in a little bit to that unemployment ratio is talking about right Biden has the the lowest unemployment rate for black people there's some there's some little fuckery around there that's actually that was actually trump and he set that record in 2019 which Biden was able to manage and scrape together to get to however it has since already been back up the lion they're completely lion man dude the problem is DJ is this goes in what yes they're lying but the reason they're able to lie is because shit is so hard yeah yeah like dude who's worried about this shit when they can't pay their bills or they can't buy groceries or they can't pay for living expenses like it's hard to pay attention to things like I mean have you ever been financial distress yeah I have to bro and when you're fucking feeling that kind of weight on your shoulders it's fine to fight yeah dude you don't have to worry about nothing else and Andrew because you've been on the the campaign trail you've been able you've been in front of of real people what what's it been like out there and people are tired of it people are tired of the left telling them things are going well when they're feeling it when they go the grocery the gas pump and yeah I mean look I've got four kids and like that you know in September we're trying to buy new shoes and backpacks for school and get kids on the school bus and the president's touting this the strongest economy and it's like you got to be kid me man like are there some things going well of course there are but the the average working family is hurting because of Biden inflation and at the same time that's happening like you said he flings open the border you have 10 million people have come across the border illegally and are given work permits and everything else and they're now taking jobs that working Missouri families need and using up resources that we pay into for working Missourians and so you're right it the left creates and president Biden is directly responsible they create his greatest achievement is creating chaos and disaster that's the achievement and it yeah you're right it's kind of hard to focus on anything else he's done because he's been so effective at destroying so much dude how do you feel like talking to these people when they when these guys get on TV and they brag about the economy being so great how do you you know when you're talking to these people I mean don't don't they aren't people tired of feeling like they're just getting gaslighted yeah I mean I and again this is the show me state like people politics is different in Missouri yeah results matter yeah I mean people that just get up and talk Missouri's don't want to they don't want to hear it man they want to see results yeah and so if all you're doing is is is chirping people aren't paying attention and and that's the problem with so many of these these talking heads on the left they're they're not able to point to results that stuff might fly in New York and California and and but here here in the Midwest and specifically in Missouri you know it's the show me state results are going to matter it's one of the things I'm most grateful for is being from Missouri because it really doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican or in of course we got crazy people on the right and crazy people on the left you know the 2% of the polar opposites but the reality is is people do appreciate actual statistical reality and and it seems like in other places that's not the case it's like you know like one thing she said when she was talking she said you know Biden's taking care of small business that's why he was visiting small businesses well it doesn't matter if he's visiting small businesses what matters is is are they helping small businesses and so they say these things to make people believe that they're actually doing something when in reality this I could go down and visit 100 small businesses today it doesn't mean they're going to be better right right now that how many small businesses could he not visit because they're closed permanently well they blame that on Trump everything happened during the pandemic for that two years they blame on Trump because he was in power when it happened and I think like we said on the show I think that's going to get worse and worse and worse as we go because now we're starting this is different topic but now we're starting to see vaccine injuries we're starting to see all caused death go up we're seeing you know 40 fucking percent in some places dude we're seeing crazy statistics we dude the MP from UK had who was the first guy in UK to get the vaccine you see this bro first guy in in in the UK the MP to how to get the vaccine had to have all four limbs amputated for sepsis yeah dude he had it in 2021 now he had all four of his limbs amputated like we're seeing and by the way that's horrible shit terrible I'm not like sitting here loading and saying oh I'm not one of those people got my hands dude listen I actually look at those people and think they're victims I don't look at those people like yes they were ignorant yes they were mean yes they were aggressive but they're the ones walking around worried and fucking dealing with the shit and I think that they're starting to they're starting to admit a lot of these things so that they can turn it on Trump and be like Trump rushed the vaccine and now look at all this stuff and I think that's going to get worse or worse is the election I think that's their October play their October play is to turn this all of that on to him but when they say beginning back to your point you know like you said the closed businesses they blame that on Trump you know it's the student loan thing real quick I think that's really telling so they're saying that hey one of the things one of his greatest accomplishments is helping pay off people's student loans now he's doing that illegally unconstitutionally and attempt to buy votes let's not be mistaken congress has twice 2019 and 2021 rejected bills that would have canceled student loan debt and he's using the higher education act of 1965 that allows for amendment to repayment terms well the words amendment to repayment terms are different than the word cancel there's no such thing just cancel it any working family or small business or tell you there's no such thing as canceling debt somebody pays it that's going to cost the American taxpayers a half trillion dollars in Missouri it'll cost us north of 44 million dollars that's why we filed suit against it so the same people that are sitting here and telling you we're gonna fix your kitchen table issues are exacerbating the Biden inflation that's hurting all of us so it's a gimmick again it's creating crisis and catastrophe that ultimately inflicts more pain so then they can promise a remedy that is empty at best well that's their MO they come in every two years every four years they say all this shit they're gonna do then they do the opposite and they walk out with millions of dollars or right at the end they can promise to fix it or do small things make it appear as if they're fixing issues just to get the votes as well you know what I was thinking about is like how do all these blue collar Americans feel like how do all these plumbers these construction workers these concrete guys these roofers these people who didn't go to college necessarily but then went into the trades how do they feel that they're paying the debt off for people that went to school for four six years for liberal arts or to freely for anything how is it now how are we now uh saddling the the blue collar salt of the earth backbone of our country with the debt of a bunch of privileged fucking assholes like dude I wonder how they feel about that because I'll tell you this I'm not a blue collar guy but that pisses me to fuck off yeah this is me off I've got friends that didn't come home from Iraq that paid for their school and blood sweat and tears and yeah and now there's a widow who creves every memorial day you know because that that soldier needed a way to pay for school and you're right I mean we cannot let Joe Biden saddle working Missouri families with Ivy League debt that's what the lawsuit against it is all about and at the end of the day even if you think it's a good idea for the federal government to pay off student loans surely we can all agree Congress has the power of the purse not the president and when we've seen Congress reject those bills twice and you can look at the plain text of the law and see that the president does not have the authority to do what he's doing surely we can agree this is not the proper proper way to to achieve that policy objective well so how so so let's say you assume and you win yeah what happens to those people they got their debt wipe well I mean that's the problem we've already beaten it once before we put it back in there well I the federal government's gonna have some explaining to do for sure and look we've won this case once before Eric Schmidt filed it I took it I moved it forward I've sat at council table representing the state of Missouri in February of 2023 and we won this time last year we got the decision that struck down his first attempt to quote unquote cancel it again I would tell you there's no such thing as canceling that but his attempt to saddle working Missourians with with Ivy League debt well what's scary is that now he's doing again and he's on the stump on the campaign trail flaunting it saying the Supreme Court told me no I'm gonna do it anyway at what point do we call this a constitutional crisis like if Donald Trump had done that and said I don't care what the Supreme Court says I'm gonna do whatever I want I don't care that Congress hasn't empowered me to do it I'm gonna do whatever I want he's fucking blibber oh right yes Biden gets a pass on all of it yeah but dude he's doing Biden these people are doing all the shit that they accused Trump of doing and Trump did none of this stuff what you know Trump's gonna take us to World War three oh really there wasn't the war the entire time he's in office now look at what's going on you know Trump's gonna ruin the economy oh really you know I mean look dude this is insane shit and I really really I'm really concerned about what the lengths they're willing to go to sabotage the election maintain power because dude these people very clearly understand and what they're afraid of the reason they're trying so hard like with this court case and all these things is because they are very worried that Trump is going to weaponize the same way that they did and and they know that they're guilty and so dude he should yeah what you should or the people should like again like I mean we can't just keep sitting back and allowing I don't think that's gonna happen dude I think I think they've pushed people to we're getting close to a boiling point where this is not going to be accepted and I don't think people are gonna sit around and just tweet about it either and I don't think it's gonna be you know I don't I don't see the local sheriff's and police departments getting in the way of people being pissed about this because it's hurting them too like you think all these police officers these guys out here that they're being ordered to do this and that and they're getting hurt by these policies you think they support this clown no they're afraid to lose their job because shit is so hard they don't know what to do so by creating this environment where things are exceptionally hard on everybody it forces everybody to sort of comply because it's like well shit if I if I don't comply dude I'm gonna I'm gonna starve and so that's that's the play of what's going on but I don't think I mean dude I just I don't know I feel like people are getting to a boiling point for real like culture is is to a point where these people are exposing themselves you know people are starting to realize what's going on and I don't think they're gonna be able the only thing I think they can do that I think they might do is flip the table over somehow create such a crisis you know like flip the power grid off or something for two weeks or something yeah I don't know man just shake it up yeah yeah guys jump it on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three speaking of flipping the the game board over we're we're three watch this headline reads blinkin hints us may accept Ukrainian strikes in Russia with American arms this is hot off the press this just came out and this could have some very significant implications if it goes through so Secretary of State Anthony J. Blinken suggested on Wednesday that the Biden administration could be open to tolerating strikes by the Ukrainian military inside Russia using American made weapons saying that the United States would quote adapt and adjust its stance based on changing conditions on the battlefield mr. Blinken said that the United States had neither encouraged nor enabled such attacks but he said that the Ukrainians needed to make their own decisions on how to best defend themselves a position he has stated before and that the United States government had quote adapt it and adjust it as necessary as the war evolves when asked by a reporter whether his words quote adapt and adjust means the United States could support attacks by Ukraine with American made weapons inside Russia he said quote adapt and adjust means exactly that meaning those words signaling flexibility from Washington now would they do that it's interesting because we already did U.S. made munitions were just used in deadly strike on Rafa Tinkam over in Palestine oh yeah let's not forget you know Mickey Haley signed those bombs she did sign those right I saw that I saw that saying finish them it's insane and this is coming from CNN our favorite people munitions made in the United States were used in the deadly Israeli strike on a displacement camp in Rafa on Sunday a CNN analysis a video from the scene and then reviewed by explosive weapons expert has found at least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out following the Israeli military strike on the outskirts of Gaza southern most city most of them women and children according to the Gaza health ministry and Palestinian medics footage attained bi-seeing and showed swaths of the camp in Rafa in flames with scores of men women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault burned bodies including those of children could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage uh Israel's escalating assault in Rafa were some 1.3 million Palestinians were taking shelter before his Israel began its operation there has drawn swift international condemnation uh with the United Nations agencies aid groups and multiple governments calling on Israel to immediately halt it's offensive um so we have a president's already being set they're already doing that do I see do we see Ukraine following similar actions here you know I think what scary is the point that you made earlier and that is when Donald Trump was in office bad actors on the international stage were afraid to commit bad acts because they didn't know what he would do and when he did have to take action like he did in Syria it was surgical it was swift it was uh proportional and so there was there was a methodology to the foreign policy it made sense from like an objective logical standpoint what are we doing like what does going on out you've got North Korea saber-attling you've got China saber-attling at the Taiwan straights you've got uh Russia invades Ukraine doesn't show any signs of letting up I don't know that I don't see any internet that's a that's a never ending war well it means making who Russia's making $400 million a month for that war they're making right so they spend like a hundred million dollars depending on who you ask Ukraine's obliterated anyway yeah so they can't uh there's numbers are done numbers are done which is probably why they're talking about the strikes now you know an escalating to strikes inside of Russia I'm dude if that happens and it comes out that it's US made uh missiles that's that's gonna be a problem it's gonna be a major problem but were this concerned about the border between Ukraine and Russia and doing nothing about ours about the southern border united states of America I mean that's shameful that's my argument too bro how is it that we're not putting Americans first yeah this that is the most shameful deplorable aspect of the Biden administration to date it's uh yeah I do not listen I don't care about any any one of these four countries Israel Russia uh Palestine Ukraine they can awkward your fuck we have too many problems inside of our own country right now that are being abandoned intentionally right and like I could care less for any one of them I agree with you and I also it makes me super annoyed at how passionate people get about these conflicts that are you know on the other side of the globe and they don't say shit about what's going on here it's like dude what are you you're falling into the trap the trap is to get you concerned about these things going on over there so you ignore all the things going on over here and if you ignore all the things going on over here and you allow them to fund all these things going on over there you're also allowing them to whittle the money back to their own fucking pockets so like it's it's part of the game get riled up about Ukraine get riled up about Israel don't look over here though don't look over here in your own neighborhood it's all it's all a big shell game for them in my opinion to fleece the Americans of their tax dollars dude there's not another country on this fucking planet that works like we do only to send our money other places that doesn't exist like we're the biggest slaves in the entire world we're why are we paying more than half of our total income and people always love to argue this was not half of my income oh really we'll do the math it's not just income tax what about all the other tax okay and if you do all the other tax you work for the government and you work for the government to take that money and send over these other places that will never benefit you what what what is it about a minute how is that free how is that free oh the land of the free how I yeah I agree completely I think philosophically humans are designed and intended to be an end unto ourselves not a means to another's end and to your point the system of tax tax and spend has made us a means to to a someone else's end a means to the governments yeah end and that's never ends and it never ends and then you know what I think about man I think in the summers when I was in high school I did concrete work all right and I did form setting all right and that's hard that's a hard job dude especially in the summertime and dude I would I never really acclimated in that job and I'm not sure anybody does like when you go home at night you're sore you're tired like you know you worked and it was the best thing never happened to me and and out and not not out of disrespect but what it did was taught me that I better figure something out otherwise I'm gonna do that my whole life right no disrespect for the guys to do it I have the utmost respect to the guys that do it but that's a hard life and what I think about is those guys going out working eight 12 hours a day to try to get some overtime take care of their families and then then being taxed in this way for the money to be sent over there and there are kids to get fucked in our school system and to this guy's point our infrastructure's terrible we have these homeless veterans we can't afford groceries there's all this stuff going on and and we're paying for that how does how is that okay that's not okay that's not okay for a grown American man to go to work and sacrifice his mind is health and his body to pay for his family only for that money to be sent to fucking Ukraine or anywhere else that's not okay bro and that's a fundamental problem with our government system that we need to fix there's so much more that needs to be fixed than just electing Trump like there's fundamental realignment of this country that needs to happen and dude you know I guarantee you do there's tons of blue collar guys right now and they're like fucking right bro because that's just hard yeah when it's it's not just the taxes themselves the income tax personal property tax sales tax it's the ghost taxes yeah regulations where to get a market to product a corporation has to jump through so many hoops that drives the cost up to where average folks can't afford it or the inflation where Biden prints money so fast that the dollars we do have in our pockets are worth half as one percent less than they were in 2020 the tax code is is bad enough but the ghost when you couple with that the ghost taxes it's probably more than it's well over 50% especially for entrepreneurs and people don't think that people think as an entrepreneur you know I buy this energy drink for one penny and I sell it for four dollars that's not the case like you guys need to go look into it and then you got Biden on TV blaming it on the CEOs of these companies saying they're gouging you dude do you not did you not take a basic economics course if things cost more they cost more you know and that's and it comes down to the consumer because otherwise if it doesn't there's no profit margin what we're not the government I can't just go turn on my money machine over there to keep the company going like this is a real thing and it doesn't just affect one or two businesses it affects all of them which affects every person in this country that consumes anything so by dude there's there's so many problems here that people just don't want to I just don't think they're in a place to really understand because they're struggling so hard I think they've got us in the perfect place they know exactly how much money they can take from us with us not going under and they keep us right in that spot of extreme struggle where we're always swimming but we don't really get anywhere and what's interesting to me is you know you have all these socialist people that believe in and but they don't understand that concept it's like dude you are in exactly what you want yeah you got what you wanted yeah yeah you're living in what you want and you don't like it you think you guys think that socialism or communism brings you a utopia no never in the history of communism has it worked and it's well that's not real communism no real communism you start yeah because the producer stop producing because it becomes a lost cause you get taxed to the point where you can't make any money and then you have to come into work every day and bust ass and sacrifice your life your mental sanity everything for nothing and those people eventually just say fuck it and then everybody starts that's what happens and that's what dude there's a book about it called the red famine or you could read Atlas shrug but you won't because it's a thousand pages long great book yeah great book yeah it describes exactly what's going on it does it does the producer stop producing you know at the point in which people are not an end unto themselves or a means to another's end what's the point in doing anything you know I I agree with one of the central tenants that every human interaction should be by mutual consent to mutual benefit when you get to a socialist state or communist state everything is coerced and compelled that there is no free will there is no choice it's it's all tyranny and that's again the reason we have a constitution is to protect us from the government the reason we have a government is to protect our rights that's the conversation we need to be having in this country is what is the purpose of our what is our national identity in my mind it's the constitution what is the purpose of our government it's to protect our our rights and give us a forum to adjudicate disputes over those rights and if we can unify around that we can restore this the health and welfare of this nation until we can come to common consensus there and we're arguing over you know people that want lighter sentences for child molesters yeah it's hard to even start the conversation yeah well and also dude let's be honest the financial literacy of our country is one of the lowest in the world and that's intentional they don't teach us when we're in high school to balance checkbooks and balance personal finance or what simple interest does or what compounding interest does or how to invest or how to be successful they don't want you to be successful because the poorer that you are the easier you are to manipulate and control and this is why they teach you that making money and becoming successful as some sort of morally inferior position in life right what better way to keep people in poverty to then to get them to believe that it's bad from a moral standpoint right like bro this is manipulation you've all been manipulated your whole life

level of humor yeah they deserve some trophies they're like terrible and it's fine yeah it's fine it's all right if we had a paper that's that that would be your responsibility to write the jokes at heart for the leading headline yeah a Michigan judge was astonished when a man busted for driving with a suspended license appeared before him in a court room zoom call while driving a car Corey Harris 44 popped up on screen behind the wheel as Washington tall county judge Jay sedric Simpson flashed a dumbfounded facial expression on May 15th Mr. Harris what are you are you driving he's so great he says quote Mr. Harris are you driving Simpson ask according to footage posted by mlive.com Simpson casually confesses that he is here's the clip Mr. Harris are you driving actually I'm pulling into my doctors off it's actually so so I'll just give me one second I'm parking right now all right what are we doing you're on our we are respectfully request units he's laughing at her up possibly before weeks the court would allow this is his defense attorney okay so maybe I don't understand something this is a driving one license suspended that is correct your honor and he was just driving and look at the news face he's like haha is what the charge is your honor yes no I'm looking at his record he doesn't have a license he suspended and he's just driving that is correct your honor I don't even know why he would do that so defendants bond is revoked in this matter defendants turn himself into the watch not kind of deal by six p.m. today throw you to turn himself in we'll result in the bench work with no bond what a dumbass man dude you could have blurred discrete or something dude are you driving you let me just pull into this parking lot real quick no he tried to

sunk oh I gotta go to jail six p.m. today and if he goes jail at six p.m. he knows he's not getting out that day it is hard to go to jail on a driving while suspended case that might be the one thing that'll land in there it's just like complete and open defiance yeah you're all like you know it's of your own defiance oh yeah you know wow dude what what is he thinking nothing I wonder I wonder if I was a judge I would where are you going like I would have wanted to know where he's pulling up to you oh he said dog's office now he ain't pulling up to no dog's office look man why would you not just like step outside the car and just like be like I'm at the park yeah I'm taking a walk in the park yeah not definitely not driving yeah fuck me I don't know man you can't you can't think like oh shit having a bad day man that is a bad day it's just a yeah really awful day now you get to have some baloney sandwiches yeah on the state that you paid for yeah yeah where we giving this guy I mean this is this is thumbs down yeah okay thumbs down what we got yeah man this guy I mean he's too dumb to could you defend him as a client no no I mean he's gonna be I mean that's what that but honestly from illegal perspective look I've spent a lot of my professional life in courtrooms and I've seen some dumb stuff this takes kick but his attorney like throwing one on the bus and like what wasn't he driving just now yes you're on I mean that's his judicial admission that statement is now attributed to the defendant she's admitting that he's currently committing a new crime for which he could face additional criminal charges I mean he probably has a great civil suit against his attorney for making that admission without consulting him for me what was she supposed to say she could lie to the judge if she was she was caught too but but she can't plead the fifth yeah I mean she should I believe she probably should have said something like we'll have to check on that your honor I'm not with my client right now I'm not sure what he's doing right now I can either confirm nor deny what he's doing right now your honor we'll have to get back down that like your honor I would ask that my client not answer any questions related to investigation of other criminal matters until I have a time to continue to help you it could tip you go on to jail too bro it's a green screen yeah yeah that's right yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a reasonable explanation yeah it's fine one yeah oh my god judge Simpson don't play bro he does not play I would say he was I would dude listen put me up there maybe a good judge I think I would be a pretty good judge yeah I think I'm probably I don't know the law that's fine they don't know it either they don't know it yeah I mean I think it guilty dude you're going to jail bro like just that's simple yeah yeah he's done look at the face face as at all he's like oh shit well guys Andy trying to general Bailey that's all I got yeah thanks so much for coming in man thanks for having me guys see you and chat and bro you're doing great work just one thing before we go do what do we have going on with the free speech stuff yeah so we're waiting on a decision from the United States Supreme Court we argued the case back in March the same day that the case in our AV Vulo was argued today the court handed down in a 9-0 decision in favor of the first member rights free speech the decision in our AV Vulo so we could be within a few days few weeks we should be within the next you know 30 days the court should hand down the decision in Missouri V Biden we're kind of anxiously waiting I think it's a you know at the end of the day this is a ruling on a preliminary injunction at a preliminary stage the proceedings and the court regardless of what happens we should end up back down at the trial court getting into the merits of the case but I think it's a good sign that again 9-0 ruling in favor of the first amendment today and the court in the Vulo decision actually in a footnote referenced Missouri V Biden's the ruling from the fifth circuit court of appeals so kind of an interesting you know lineage and yeah what's so what would they be the result if they rule in your favor for that well they'll if they a complete victory would upholding the trial court's preliminary injunction against government collusion to silence American voices on big tech yeah I mean that that would be you know Biden appealed is that's what this is yeah the Department of Justice wants to be able to silence you on on on social meeting they do then they do yeah they absolutely do yeah so is that a first step I'm just curious about this because I don't know I didn't I didn't know did you you know that they took down my page yeah like two weeks yeah yeah so and I got it back but we had to go to we had to go to Jim Jordan to get it back so the is this a first step towards amending or changing section 230 and their ability to censor us it should yeah section 230 the communications decency act is the fount of the problem here and it's created a government controlled cartel of these big tech social media corporations that are free from the the normal open market impulses that would protect against censorship that being said the you know they'd also gives the government enormous leverage to uh to coerce these big tech social media corporations into conducting their censorship regime for them because they can always threaten to amend a repeal section 230 so it it's problematic for those those two reasons it's both a sword and a shield for for big tech but you know do what you do what we say or we'll change this and you can't do any of you loser cash cow yeah you'll have open market competition and you may not survive yeah if you have open market competition then you and I could say well I'm not using the censoring platform I'm using the freedom platform yeah but but beyond that you know I think in this country it 230 notwithstanding section 230 the communications decency act notwithstanding there we've got to build a wall of separation between tech and state that we would not tolerate that level of collusion and coercion in any other marketplace in other words if we were talking on our cell phones and we started talking about a topic that the government didn't like and the government started muting us on that cell phone we wouldn't tolerate that or if all of a sudden we were getting newspapers which I realized print media is largely dead but that were large sections were redacted at the government's demand no one would tolerate that why is it that we tolerate that on big tech why is that marketplace difference because the censorship goes on in the shadows where we can't see it or don't know about it and that's that that's the problem and that's why you've got to have that wall of separation between tech and state long term to protect our right to free speech on social media platform. So you would say that if we win this case this first case the next the next one we're going to try to do is fix that. Yeah I think that the preliminary injunction we obtained on the 4th of July last year is the first brick in the wall of separation between tech and state and we can use this lawsuit to continue building upon that wall eventually Congress is going to have a role to play here I mean with the not only with section 230 the communications decency act but withholding officials in the government who are participating in the censorship regime accountable eliminating those portions let's just cut the fat get rid of that part of the government altogether but to the extent that you know you still need those entities how about appointing like an on on Budsman or an inspector general to monitor compliance with the court order that we we've obtained yeah I mean things like that can help us we can use merits discovery to root out the vast censorship enterprise but Congress has a role to play here as well we got to work together to build that wall well we got to get that done man because that's creating a situation of uneven playing field even in business yeah because of that so market manipulation yeah dude 100% well hey brother look we really appreciate you coming on I know DJ and I in the in the team here and in our audience really appreciate the work that you're doing it's a big deal it's historically relevant and there's anything that we can do to support that just let us know hey I appreciate you guys thank you so much for having me on thank you for covering these important stories yeah thanks all right guys that's the show don't be a hoe try the show
