75 hard verses that's basically the four different shows I go through the intro and every show I don't feel like doing it today so pay the fee it to show's good share it that's how it works let's go ahead and get into it let's get into it I got some good ones for you let's let's get going with question number one Andy in your latest real talk you said that when other countries look at America they don't say nice things I agree with you I think our people have lost a lot of respect for our country and a lot has to do with the way our current administration has been running our country they've kicked out soldiers who refused the jab and have been promoting this woke ideology in your mind in your opinion what do you think we need to do to gain the respect of other countries again well I think you know something that would probably be a good idea to start with is like you know not send our troops over to there where they live and kill their fucking people and blow up their cities and destroy their infrastructure and put them back fucking 50 years I mean that would be a good start you know a good follow-up to that would like to not promote our military to be transgender individuals who have mental illness who are completely weak and useless members of our military you know promoting things in our school system that actually create high quality high achievement high drive high discipline individuals that are going to be productive citizens instead of you know teaching little children about sex or transgender ideology or any of this other crazy shit I think you know stopping the idea of we're going to reward people based upon the color of their skin or the gender that they were born in life you know we turn this back into a straight meritocracy where the best win and the best fucking produce and the best get the opportunity and that you if you want to be the best you have to work to be the best that's the world I grew up in I respect that kind of thought process you know when I look at other countries that are you know like for example and people are going to piss when I say this but when I see China raising their kids to learn math and science and rewarding their kids to learn math and science and then sending them the bootcans in the summertime where they run around and learn how to operate weapons and camp and survive and do the things need to be done as like a individual you know an autonomous individual I actually think that's what the fuck we should be doing and we should be doing a lot of that and that's really what kind of like what the error was when I grew up okay when I grew up like if you wanted to get a trophy at your baseball tournament or your tea ball tournament guess what you had a fucking win and if you didn't win guess what happened you didn't get a trophy you get she okay you know if you wanted to pass a if you wanted to get an A in school you had to study if you wanted to start on the football team you had to fucking work okay this is the reality of life and we're dealing with a weak ideology that is intentionally installed that is Marxist and communist in nature that is designed to make the generations the young generations of America completely inept and useless and weak and that makes our country vulnerable and you know I see people say things like well this generation is totally fucked well if that generation is totally fucked that means we're all totally fucked because at some point in time that generation has to come to the point in their life where they're carrying the load of this country they become the doctors they become the the engineers they become the scientists they become the politicians they become the soldiers and if you have an entire generation of children who have been taught that the only thing that matters is how they feel about things instead of how things are in reality and they cry and whine and pal and scream and and do we have a generation of adults to do this now like we have a generation of 25 and under adults that think that by them throwing temper tantrums that's what produces the result because no one ever corrected them along the way and in fact that's what they were taught so this ideology is already super deep and super infected into American culture and I've been talking about this in public on my podcast since 2015 all right but where to appoint now where a lot of these people have become adults they've been told falsehoods about reality throughout their entire childhood they've been told that everything is fair they've been told that everything is equal they've been told that you know you get rewarded for showing up they've been told that you know all these things that are not true and they've been told that you know being masculine is unhealthy and damaging now we're having exercise villainized to make that seem like it's bad so you know I would say reversing all of that would be a good start and that would be the start because this is gonna take 20 years to reverse that's what you guys don't understand you know people keep saying oh that generation that's you know there's 20 years of fucked up people right now 20 years when those people are between the ages of 30 and 50 what do you think is going to happen to this country do you not get it like so it's more it's not just about respect from the other countries it's about our country not collapsing that's where we're at and like dude we've by my math we've got about another unless they do some drastic stuff which I believe they're going to do because I don't believe that they have the belief of the people anymore so I believe they're going to have to rush their agenda of the collapse of America along so they're going to do something drastic but if they don't do something drastic by my math I think we have another 15 years before we have 20 years or span between 30 and 50 they're not able to really produce unless massive correction is taking place and so you know there's a lot of things you know not promoting children cutting off their fucking penises or you know doing all this goofy-ass shit that like you know we're promoting I mean there's a whole bunch of stuff you know I agree with Trump's philosophy I think that's a strong philosophy you get peace through strength you have a strong military that doesn't go around the world and get involved in all the bullshit defends our country defends our people defends our interests and leads everybody else go do their shit you know like America first a real America first agenda people first economy first manufacturing first the city's first and and the safety of this country first and that's respectable if if if another country were to live like that just like I described would you not look at them and say well that's the example of what a country should be and that's the example that America has set for for a long long time until a bunch of people came along and decided they wanted to fuck it up and a lot of you guys went along with it because you didn't want to be called names and now here we are and we're in jeopardy of losing not only what we have right now but everything that your kids could possibly have everything that your kids could possibly gain your your kids' lives are actually in danger right now you're just failing to realize it and you're afraid to speak up because you're afraid of the you know the carons on the internet yelling at you for saying some shit that is actually true and so you know that's my answer I think there's a lot of things that like if I was living let's say in Dubai and looking at America I'd be laughing my fucking ass off right with a shit ton of money yeah it's gross it's disgusting shit you know like look at the cities like look at look at the look at the shit that's on TV look at the shit these people in Hollywood promote look at it like it's it's just a fucking disgusting place it's become a disgusting immoral cesspool of shit and and you know and that's people keep saying oh well it's the greatest country in the world if you looked around bro you crane is nicer than the fucking United States right now okay like you don't get it the reason you keep saying that is because you've been had that drilled in your head your entire life and you've never been anywhere else there's lots of places that are a lot nicer than this country a lot of places in Middle East are a lot nicer you guys have been lied to that's the reality and we have an opportunity now to stand up speak up and draw a line in the sand and say we're not fucking doing this shit and to build this country into what it actually should be not the facade of what we want people to think it is but actually what it is and so you know getting the respect of other countries it's gonna come long after we get the respect of ourselves and we're far off from that right now love that man guys Andy our question number two Andy I am currently on my third brown of 75 hard and I have lost over 55 pounds and feel amazing I've always been overweight and struggled with my body image and though it was not the only goal of completing 75 hard I finally have the body I've always dreamed of having with these things being said I am struggling with having those old insecurities creeping in and I was wondering how you keep them at bay hey look dude I can relate to that I think anybody can relate to that that's been out of shape that actually gets in shape and for the most part I think everybody struggles with it I think everybody even the people that you see they're in shape and you say man I really love to like look like that person I bet they have insecurities about their body that like you know like they probably get nervous before they have to go to the pool they probably get a little nervous before they have to take the shirt off or you know and dude I'm no different like I I was fat most of my life so like for me that's fucking in me like I feel no matter how no matter how physically in shape I am I still have a little hesitation to this is why you don't do it like this is just the truth I have a pretty good fucking physique for 44 years old in fact I have a good I have a great physique for anybody at any fucking age that's a true okay for a guy that's 44 years old I'm in the top 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 percent okay I still get nervous about taking on my shirt I got full fucking abs I'm doing the best I can I've been putting in the work you know fuck we were at the pool yesterday there's nobody around it's just me DJ and Sal and his kids and I'm like fuck I'm gonna take my shirt off like this is why you guys don't see me you know flaunting my body all over the internet because like dude it's not first of all it's not my identity and I'll say something about this too I think it's funny when people talk about how humble they are and then every single picture they show is themselves with their shirts off like you cannot like that's that's a circle square yeah and then those same people attack people for having financial success like cars or businesses or houses and they they throw stones at those people but then are too unaware to realize that you're doing the exact same thing with your body in your physique okay well I'm proud of my body and physique I earned no shit you don't think I earned all that other shit exactly you know what I'm saying like it's the same thing okay so like my like I could probably do a lot better on social media if I took my shirt off all the time but it's not comfortable for me so I can relate to this question a lot um I think the big thing you gotta remember dude is that everybody feels the same way and nobody cares bro like if you're working hard and you're doing what you can do what else can you do what else could you have done you've done the 75 hard three times you've lost 50 pounds you built yourself into what exactly what you want to be like you've done the work bro you should be proud of that and like you shouldn't hesitate and I know that that probably won't cure it because it doesn't cure it for me but you should understand like dude at the end of the day no one gives a fuck I don't give a fuck I don't care if you're a hundred pounds overweight or 300 pounds over no one cares but what you know you care and so like you have to understand this is just something that's in your head it's something that will probably go away the less the more time you stay in the condition that you're in the longer you stay there the less you'll have that insecurity because it'll be so far removed from where you were that's something that I noticed the the longer I stay in high and good condition which for me you know that really started in 2016 that's when I started really getting my shit together and so what's that how many years that seven years yeah okay that's you know I'm not nearly as bad about it now as I was that but I think to having the dysmorphia I'm especially with what we're surrounded with online you know we're surrounded with online like all these people who you know let's be quite honest most of them have favorable genetics most of them don't have to work as hard as someone with normal genetics and they flaunt their shit as if they're living at a higher level than everybody else they rub it in people's fucking face and it makes people feel like shit because dude most people reality don't have that sort of genetic composition well look at fluid again 10 pounds bro look dude I don't have to look I just walked past it okay but like dude most people are like that most real shit yeah and so we have these guys and girls on the internet uh you know who show their physiques non-fucking stop who were blessed I'm not saying they don't work hard but they were blessed with favorable genetics meaning they work really hard but they also have good genetics and they have a better look than what you or I or anybody with like regular genetics is gonna be able to obtain and it makes us feel like we're not doing what we can but like bro when you do everything you can and that's what you produce it is what the fuck it is you know you probably got a lot more brains as some of these people you know I'm saying like we have to also consider some of the blessings that we we did get that those people didn't get that we just don't see it well we don't give ourselves credit for right so because we're down on ourselves we're not we're not we're not running around with our shirts off in every fucking Instagram post because we look like Zeus and it but you know we look pretty good for us you know we're lean we we we we're healthy you know like dude like my my physique is not genetically gifted it's like it's really good for a regular dude you know what I'm saying like that's that's my point like um and people don't consider that and so we have this shit shoving our face all day long and it gets to the point where it's like no matter how good you are you still feel bad about yourself and it's not a good way to live you know you should you should understand that you're comparing yourself to people who and I'm not again I'm not taking anything away from them but they were pro they probably looked pretty decent before they started training and eating right you know what I mean you know what I mean like dude I have lots of friends that looked pretty good before they actually started training and taking their shit serious and then once they did bro they look crazy right that's not most people most people are just kind of like plebs all right we're just like average people I'm one of them so I don't have a problem saying it um and we work really hard and and you know let's say that other person's 10 is a is the 10 that's the benchmark we might only be able to get to a 7 or 8 that's our best but that's the reality of genetics and how it plays and and the truth is is it really shouldn't matter what other people think of you or what what other people say about it's like what work have you done and if you've been doing everything that you can do you're going to feel good about yourself and you shouldn't take that away from yourself because you've earned it you know what I mean so stop telling yourself this bullshit bro like having a perfect physique is not reality for most people most people they're gonna have their perfect physique which is you know it depends on where you start it depends on who your parents were it depends on what you did growing up it depends on if you played sports or how long you've been doing things so like do we got to work with what we got and we got to produce the best out of what we have and dude um you should feel proud about that that's my answer man and and I struggle with this too I'm not sitting here preaching like dude real shit like it's uncomfortable for me to walk around my shirt off but when I do people like god damn dude you look fucking good but like I don't feel that way I only see the shit needs to get better I only see the shit needs to improve and that has to do partly with how I'm wired as an entrepreneur that's all I see in business is where can we get better but uh it's a complicated issue and body dysmorphia is a real thing and I think it's important to understand that you are very best may not look as good as some of the other people's very best but it's you are very best and you should be fucking proud of it and anybody with normal brain uh that's not a dick is gonna look at you and say dude you're fucking crushing man and proud of you those are the people you want to be around anyway that's why I love first form so much bro because first form is not based around these elite athlete like crazy genetic people these are just regular fucking people that are living at the highest standard that they can and I'm surrounded by and so like dude you know not everybody's gonna win physique competitions but fucking most of these people in this building and most of our people on our Legionnaire team and most of our customers do their best to live real life at the highest level that they can and dude that to me that inspired that inspires me a fucking million times more than somebody who was gifted with something who's just kind of selling it as their thing you know what I'm saying absolutely man so you know well there's nothing cooler than me to see in people like this where you know they lost 50 a hundred you know or in extreme cases um like Anthony you know 600 pounds right and reclaim their life like dude I don't know I don't know how you I don't know I just feel I feel very fortunate to be surrounded by people like that you know what I mean because like dude that's those people are right here they're right in the heart they're right in the mind they might not have the Arnold Schwarzenegger perfect physique right but bro they're fucking working hard and they're doing the right shit and to me that's what fucking matters I love that man guys Andy our third and final question question number three Andy I recently moved my brick and mortar store into a mall and all I hear all day is oh I'm just looking how do you build an actual relationship with the customers that are just looking and don't want to be Bob okay well the reason they're saying just looking is because you're coming at them like a fucking teenage boy at his first set of titties bro okay this is where you're fucking up all right you you're going up with the premise how can I help you today is there anything you're looking for like all this cheesy ass shit how about just go up and have a conversation it's not genuine I worked the retail store I've probably worked more retail transactions than any other single human being I know okay and that's what's giving me all the skills all the skills that you guys know me for or listen to me for or that I've used to build the businesses that I own came from that place and so I would highly recommend getting yourself in this situation because the skills that can be obtained through that amount of reps are are invaluable to success and they're only becoming more valuable as things become more automated because as a i gets implemented as things become more automated there's less and less people with these real people skills which makes them super fucking valuable okay so let's just start with this stop walking up to him and being like the cheesy sales guy all right everybody knows this okay if you've ever shocked shopped in a place like the buckle okay okay okay for real now I'm not shopped in the buckle since like 1987 but I'm just saying we've all been in there at least once and you go in there and you know you're looking for a pair of jeans or whatever right and you go in the closet and you're in the fucking thing changing and you're putting on the jeans and all the sudden the shit starts flying over the fucking door bro like this shirt and that shirt and you start hearing this person talk and the other side I think this will look really good on you I think this I'm like bro I'm fucking a hundred pounds overweight that ain't gonna look good like so like you get attacked right and people are so used to this attacking in a retail environment what do you think you should do if they're so used to getting attacked the probably the good ideas to not attack all right and make them comfortable and so one thing that I used to do that I teach to our team that has become super valuable in my life is finding common ground that doesn't have to do with obvious situation at hand for example I love cars okay most of you guys know that I'm a huge car fanatic it's probably my big it's my biggest passion life outside of business and dogs okay but cars business dogs yeah no I think dogs are at the top bro yeah so uh so I would try to find like people like where I worked in retail stores I could see what people drove up in all right and you can adjust this technique however like it could be what shoes there were it could be something about them that's unique it could be something going on in the world it could be something going on outside in the main thoroughfare of the mall right but we want to find common ground and one of the things I used to do that uh just because I was interested in cars it's like when someone would drive up in a car that was cool I would make conversation about the car because if someone drives a cool car and by the way cool car doesn't mean like Ferrari it doesn't mean expensive okay a lot of people make their like we don't have any money this is what I did I made my car cool like I went to fucking AutoZone I got the shit I stuck the shit on my car the stick on party yes bro I did it all right I did it but that's all I could afford so I made my car cool and I fucking was proud of it like I drove a Jeep with no top it has some fucking cool you know little trinkets the shit on it I thought it was for me it was cool okay and so like you have to understand it's not about how much the car costs and this is one of the coolest things about car culture is that true car people don't give a fuck about the how much the car costs they they care about like they understand the fucking culture like I mean the story what you did it you could like do one of the coolest cars I think out there is a Subaru Subaru WRX STI that are fucking totally built out I've never owned one and that's something I want to own and I could easily go buy one right but the point is is like that's way below it really any of my other shit price wise but I think it's like the one of the coolest cars in the fucking world like I I think everything is cool if they think it's cool so what I used to do is when I see someone you know like back in that day bro people would like modify their Dodge Neons and shit right so they'd roll up they'd have a black out Dodge Neon with tin and windows and you could just look and you could tell they're driving that car intentionally okay and so I would make conversation about their car I would say dude I like what you do with that man it looks fucking good you know blah blah blah and they'd be like really you know like yeah we start talking about that and that breaks down all those barriers and dude then they don't have an opportunity to tell you you're just looking okay another thing that you can do is uh bro you know because you can't like always this is a higher level question this is something for RIT I'm getting into something else the point is is that you try to find something common that you're genuinely interested in and talk about all right and this doesn't mean be cheesy and fake like you're interested because if you fake interests in that same scenario if I fucking wasn't interested in cars and I tried to fucking fake blow this dude's ego up a lot as car and I didn't think it was cool he'd be able to tell you could tell that okay and all of you can tell that you all know when you're being bullshit so my recommendation is very simple practice talking to people about things that are irrelevant to the sales transaction when you first meet them another thing is is if you have a business uh like if you own the business you know maybe and maybe look at like this how much is a how much is a bottle of water cost you if you go to Costco and buy it on a palette it's like fucking eleven cents okay so if you took your eleven cent water and put it had a fridge in the back and when your people walked in the door your customers your perspective customers you just walked over with the water said here enjoy complimentary water when you're when you're enjoying uh you're when you're looking around bro that's a way to break the eyes oh thank you very much oh you're not gonna hide outside yeah you don't ask them if they want it you give it to them like there's all kinds of shit we teach all the shit in our team all the shit we're talking about we teach these techniques um but the point is is that creating rapport around commonalities when there's a sales question in place is important to break down the barrier of the resistance because dude these people are going to usually they're used to going into place like the buckle where they get harass okay they're used to going into places um you know really anywhere bro where the dude people are just up your ass how refreshing would it be if you went into it like think of it as the customer think of it like you're the customer what would be cool if you walked into a place how would it be cool to be treated how do you want to be treated and start treating your customers that way that's what works okay so stop attacking them start getting to know them and change your intent from I'm trying to sell to I'm actually just trying to make friends and and it'll fix most of your problems changing your your intent what I just said from selling to making friends because really what business are you in are you I don't even know did you say not okay because it doesn't matter because ultimately you're in the business of accumulating customers so shouldn't the intent be to make this person a friend so at least even if they don't buy anything they at least walk out and they say dude I went to fucking Andy store that guy's cool as fuck shit isn't that worth a conversation isn't that worth some effort see a lot of you guys are so short-sighted you don't understand that you're actually pushing negative word of mouth out the door because of how push you are in the environment you walk up to these people and you're attacking them and they're like oh just looking and they fucking you know what they do is they walk out of the store and they're like yeah that store is cool it's good they got some good shit but like bro they're on you like like flies on shit bro you ever been to the bug with a yeah bro and you don't want that shit you want the opposite of that so how do you want to be treated fine commonalities work to make friends make it your genuine intent and remember you're not in the business of selling whatever it is you sell you're in the business of accumulating fucking customers you can do that by making friends make a friend make a sale it's very simple love that man guys Andy that's three yeah go pay the fee to throw got a own bank row can't fold does it know here's shot case closed closed
