What is up guys it's A to Priscilla and it's the show for the realist's sake of the show. We're going to put topics on the screen and speculate on what's true and what's not true. We're going to talk about how we, the people that saw these problems. Let's just get right into it. All right. You guys know the deal. We don't charge your money. We don't run ads. We ask very simply that you help us grow the show. All right. It makes you think, it makes you laugh, which always does. Let's be real. It gives you a new perspective. Teaches you some good shit. Do it's a favor. Don't be a hell. Should have a show. All right. What's up? I mean, it's cold in here. So like, the metal might have like shrank a little bit. No, I know what it was. I had visitors come into my area and I will bet that they sat in my chair. I mean, I'm always in here though. So I haven't seen anybody come in. Really? Yeah. Quentin didn't come in here. I didn't see him. I wasn't in here. Everybody did. Yeah. Quentin. I know it was you. Quentin, my fucker. Quentin, my fucker. Yeah. Anyway. What's going on? What's going on, man? Yeah. Everything's good. Moving and grooving. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I think so. Yeah. What? Nothing. What? Nothing. Have you ever been, uh, you ever been? Dude, come on. That's Sergeant Slotter. You ever know who that is? You ever been camping? Not there. Did you camp a lot growing up? No, not really. We were sports family, bro. That's right. Yeah. We didn't do, you know, you can only do so much stuff. Would you go camping? I bet a couple times, man. It was just okay. It was all right, man. Look, I'm cushy, bro. You know, I'm all about, you know, competition and you do glamping. That's kind of, or I just don't go. Yeah. Like, if you guys wanted to go, we were, I'd go with you guys, but like, it's just, I don't know, man. Like, I've been a couple of times. Like, I went to a little Sahara State Park, which is in Oklahoma. It's like a four-wheeler park. Different sand dunes. Yeah. It's cool, but like, we were there for like three days, dude. And I mean, like, I don't know. We must have not prepared properly. Or you, I mean, you know me, I'm prepared. Yeah, I know. We were eating. You show up with like a fucking camel. You know, sleep inside this tonight. Yeah. Like, dude, no, dude, it was just two. It was just two. That is not my thing, man. Yeah. You know, I know we're up doing that stuff. Yeah, I feel that. Like, I grew up, we shot a lot of guns, you know. But mostly, dude, it was sports. It was sports all the time. I mean, literally all the time. Yeah. So, I mean, we played every sport growing up, like every, like football, even if I fall somewhere, when or fucking everything was gone. All year round, dude. We play football, baseball, ice hockey, you know, wrestling, fucking lacrosse in there. Yeah. Like, we did everything. Like, that was just what we did. Yeah. I've always loved camping. Soccer, you know, I love camping. Yeah, I think that you do. I love camping. Yeah. You know, and I've always been a proponent of the outdoors. You know, I like going out, you know, out, out there. But there's something happened over the weekend. I thought it was interesting. This dude's right here. Yeah. Sarge, Sarge slaughter. Pull up Sarge slaughter. Sarge slaughter. Is that what we're moving you different? It's GI Joe. It's an action figure. Pull up Sarge slaughter. Tell me not the same dude. Sarge slaughter. Sarge slaughter. Oh fuck. Tell me that guy didn't model his whole thing. I Sarge slaughter bro. Yeah. He was also a wrestler. I see it. I can see that. Yeah. Yeah. We put him up there, get a side by side. Yeah. He's like the same face man. That is that's the same dude. Well, I might not be the same dude, but that guy clearly, that guy clearly jacked Sarge slaughter as his identity. And now he's acting like it's original. Yeah. Yeah. It has to be a get this has to be a joke. They're hey man, like, hey dude, I got this idea. All right. I'm gonna dress up. As the woman Sarge slaughter. Tell me that. Come on man. What's his tape text? Hey gay. This guy's got a set to hero bro. Yeah, so this guy, Patty Gonia, scaled a mountain in Yosemite National Park. Oh, Capitan, right? Oh, Capitan. Yeah. And put up a pride flag. Let's check this out. Some carry hate. We carry the largest trans pride flag to ever be flown in a national park and unfurled it on the side of El Cap to prove a point that trans is natural. A Trump administration and trans folks would love to have you believe that being trans is unnatural. But species that can transition sexes can be found on every continent and in every ocean on planet Earth. So call it a protest, call it a celebration. We are bringing elevation to liberation. They try to erase us from government websites and education systems and libraries. So we raise this flag higher than ever before. So every trans person knows that they have people that love them in their corner. The people united will never be defeated. Yeah, that's why you'll never win. All by all. Yeah, that's where I'm sitting. Look dude, it's not even about winning a losing, okay? Nobody really has a problem with trans people. People have a problem with the propaganda and the immense amount of judgmental bullshit that is shoved down our throats. And on top of that, they have a problem with this being shoved in their kids' faces. A lot of pedophilia in there. Okay, so yes, dude, we, it's totally infiltrated by pedophiles and that doesn't mean that all of them are, but it is a hiding spot that protects pedophiles. And every single person knows this. So it's not about people hating trans people. It's about you guys allow pedophiles in your space. You invade women's spaces. You play outside the boundaries of what a normal person would accept and you force it on everybody. And that's what's causing the quote unquote hate. When you try to tell everybody and force them, the whole entire world to use literal, they them pronouns, like I could see even like a dude who's trans that pretends to be a woman wanting to be called her, I can understand that, but you guys made it weird. Now you have people saying they them, how the fuck you supposed to talk someone that uses they them? No one could even do that. Yeah, how'd you go in here? Okay, it's, listen, it's not loud. We're not smart enough to understand what you guys want us to do. All right, that's the truth. And the reason is because it doesn't make any fucking sense. Okay. So now you get nothing. And no one's trying to erase trans people. People have just come to an understanding that you represent such a minority of the population that we're not going to bend and change and accommodate everything in society to you. Nobody gets that privilege. Nobody gets the privilege of everything in society being catered to them. That's not how it works. And when he's saying, oh, well, every species has the ability to change sexes. Yeah, dude, like if you give a frog enough atrazine, it changes sexes. When we give you atrazine, which clearly you've had a lot, your testosterone goes down and you start to feel like a woman. All right, but your penis does not turn into a vagina. So humans do not have the ability to change sexes. Naturally, no. Yeah, not even, oh, come on. The surgically thing is a mutilation. That's not real. Yeah. The crazy thing to me, man, is like, you know, I've got some digging on this guy. I'm like, that's a healthy looking dude. You know what I'm saying? Like, you know, like it's not bad. Oh, well, that's bad. Well, this is, this is, it's just a gated. You know what I'm saying? But like, how do you go from this to like this? You know what I'm saying? Like dude, listen, man, it's fetish. It's fetish shit. Wow. Like dude, a lot of these guys have watched so much pornography and been so around this over sexualized identity that it takes more and more and more and more for them to like get excited. To the point where now, you know, they're all the way over there. And that's the truth, bro. For a lot of these, I would say grown men going to win. You know, and I also think you accompany that with the culture trying to take masculinity out of society, be whatever you want, everything's okay. There's no boundaries, there's no rules, there's, you know, everything's okay. And dude, that's not true. That's civilized country or a civilized citizenship requires boundaries to stay civilized. And there are cultural rules that keep that in check, right? One of them is you don't fuck with little kids, okay? But dude, because there's been no accountability or shame driven towards some of these outrageous behaviors, they've continued to grow and people that have these things have taken them from, you know, behind closed doors out in the open, they feel very comfortable. You know, like why is, why do people ever feel comfortable in drag dancing in front of children? That's not something they should feel comfortable about. Why would a grown adult feel good being at a pride event but naked? That's not something they should feel good about. All right, but it's been accepted and it's been tolerated because we've been told that if we criticize it, we're a bigot. We're wrong. Yeah, we're not wrong. We're not wrong. No kind of sandals, you're wrong. Yeah, so, you know, dude, again, nobody hates you, bro. Like, yeah, we're gonna make some jokes about you because look at you. I mean, you've made yourself into that. And I'm sure, listen, I'm sure you're nice, dude. I'm sure you're cool and I'm sure you think you're being an activist for your cause. But when you guys pretend to be this completely oppressed part of the population, when in reality, dude, for the last five, six years, all we've heard about is your shit. Eventually, people get tired of it. You see what I'm saying? There's some exhaustion. Dude, yeah, there's a lot of that going on. So, you know, look, man, I, whatever you wanna do whatever whatever you wanna do is cool. I don't give a fuck. Stay away from kids. Other than that, be whoever you wanna be. But don't expect the entire world to bend over and accommodate everything and then say that if we don't, it's hate. Right. That's not true. You made us. That's true. That's true. That's the part that's always getting me, man. It's like, you know, they talk so much about unity and love and shit, but like, but only if you go along with what they do. Only if you agree. Yeah. And it's not even just agree at this point. Like you have to like overly, like it's way past the point of excellence or you have to be an ally. Yeah, right. Otherwise, you're a bigot. You can be a pro ally. And if you're not an ally, we're gonna get your fire. We're gonna call your names. And we're gonna get your canceled, which doesn't work anymore. Okay, because no one cares. So, whatever dude, like do whatever you want, but you're still a dude, you're always gonna be a dude. And that's the science. That's it. That's it, okay? And I don't care how you live. Well, let's stop this fake victimhood nonsense bullshit. All right, if we want to talk about who the victims are here, it's these little kids that you pump this shit in their brain and confuse the fuck out of them. And they don't get to live a normal childhood because adults like you are so insecure with who you actually are. You got to strategically attack these kids when they're young and forming their worldview. You can't tell me that they don't do this on purpose. And then they say, well, you're doing the same thing by being straight. No, that's called biology. That's called natural. That's natural. They got to stick and there's a little hole and they go together like a fucking Lego. Okay, like, you know what I'm saying? Oh, that's all this post earlier. It was like, you know, now and days, you know, back in the day, you said like birds in the bees conversation. Now it's like, you know, birds in the bees, the bees in the bees, the birds in the birds. The bees that used to be birds. Yes. The bees that used to be bee. And it's bullshit. And you teach these kids. Dude, listen, we have a big problem that stems from this, this no actual boundaries, no actual science. I don't know how you say it. My vocabulary's pretty limited. I'll tell you. No, it's, it is, it is the ability to interpret everything as you want to interpret it. It's the idea of your truth. There is no your truth. There is only truth. And we have a big problem now because we have an entire 20 year gap of kids who have been raised under the idea that whatever they see the world as is the truth. And if it's, if it's not that way, then they're being oppressed. And that is not true. So we have to work to correct this. Because these, these people that believe this, dude, they're just gonna get beat on their whole life. Yeah. They're gonna never gonna win. Bro, never because there are rules to reality and no matter how much you try to remove them, they will still be there. I can say to you, or do you do? Uh, I don't like gravity. I think gravity's bullshit. Let's jump off the side of the building and you know what's gonna happen? Gravity's gonna press us. We're gonna crack our fucking skulls, bro. Yeah, that's right. Gravity's gonna oppress us. That's what it is, man. Gravity's oppressive. And gravity, you know, like this is the, this is the, like this shit's ridiculous. That's how they work. That's how they work. Yeah, bro. And like the truth of the matter is, yeah. I mean, I don't personally hate anyone outside of like, I do. No, like I'm talking about like people I know in person. Like, you know, like I don't like, I don't like Hillary Clinton. Yeah, right. I don't like Obama. I don't like Michelle Obama. They're fucking racist. Like there's people like that that I hate. But I mean, bro, like, you know, just because I refuse to bend my reality and lie to myself about the way things are, doesn't mean that I hate them. It means that I'm not willing to compromise my integrity, my confidence, my belief in myself, by admitting that something I know is not true is true. And that's what these people don't understand. They don't understand that by forcing someone to admit something that they know it isn't true, there's actually damage to their own self image and worth because of that. It's not just harmless. Yeah, right. It's not just accepted. Yes, that's not what it is, man. And, you know, they say it's hate. It's not hate, dude. You're just not understanding the entire situation. So, you know, and then, and then, you know, like we said, you allow people who are sexual predators into your movement, so you're not taking it seriously. Not only you're not taking it seriously, you're collectivized into a group of predators. You know, if you ask most people about, if you ask most people what they think of trans people now are drag queens today versus 10 years ago? Dude, 10 years ago no one cared. Now, like a regular, it's like, bro, they're looking, they're like, fuck, here he comes. Here they come. Let's keep that, yeah. Yeah, no shit. Let's keep them away from our kids. And then you have the do-goodter housewife, upper middle class, who's completely out of touch, never had to work for shit. And feels guilty because their life has been easier that they need to advocate for this. Like there's some kind of virtuous person when they don't even stop to think like, what damage am I causing? You know, it's just, dude, you know what we're dealing with? We're dealing with a bunch of selfish adults. That's the truth. You know, we're dealing with selfish people that advocate for this. We're dealing with selfish people like this who put their beliefs in the little young people's minds. When they know it's fucking wrong, bro. You know, and then we're dealing with selfish adults that won't stay up for it. They won't do shit about it. They won't say, yeah, dude, it's sad, man. I feel really bad for the kids, dude. Like, the leadership's not where it should be. You know, it's like a bunch of people that never grew up. Anyway. Yeah, man, fuck. So when we're going camping? Let's go. Yeah, man, fuck, man. I don't know, man. Guys, yeah, jump down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think, man. Got on the hell of a show. Got a lot of stuff to talk about. Oh, we got more. Oh, there's more. All right. Oh, there's a lot more. There's a lot more. And if you guys want to see any of these things that we cover on this episode, go to AndyForSouthern.com. You guys can find that stuff there. You can also come watch along on the tube. Yep. And, yeah, dude, if you're not watching on YouTube, like most of you guys are on audio, buy a lot. Buy a lot. If you're not on, yeah, I mean, dude, we did audio for 10 years before we ever did any YouTube or eight years. If you're not watching on YouTube, man, you're missing out. It's different experience. Yeah. You know, she's saying. Come check it out. Yeah, I don't know. But you can come watch it on YouTube. Check us out and follow along with us as we cruise. The internet. Let's start with headline number one. I like going to the White House just to set the tone. There's been, listen, it's hard not to like battle Trump, man. It's really hard not to like it. It's hard. What did you do this time? I mean, bro, so you dislike him because he's a troll. I love it. Yeah, I know. But I absolutely love it. I love it because you're definitely the biggest internet troll I've ever met. Thank you. Yeah, I take that. Thank you. That's a fucking champion troll right there. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I got people getting mad. I got about to bait tomorrow tomorrow. Yeah. We're tell people about the debate. I'm debating a black fat communist. And you know, it's it'll be good. It'll be good. Live on IG, APM Central. All right. Yep. Toon in. Yeah. Massacre. Yeah. Call me mouth. You know, Sam. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, DJ Poe pot, baby. You know what I'm saying? Oh, my God. I think that's probably right though. I do like the I like the troll and a man. I like the troll and you know, oh, dude, it's good. It's great. You know, and so I have more time. I would do a little bit more trolling myself. I mean, listen, I think everybody should. It's an Alex hates that. I do it. No, dude, it's fun when you don't take it serious. Like when you walk with like it's about to I'm like, it's not personal. Yeah, I don't take it personally. I still sleep great at night. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's fine. I just I like it. Yeah, it's like it's like burden each other all day. You know, it's great. You know, but yeah, so that was a situation in South Africa. I think we covered a little bit those the white farmers coming here to America. Actual asylum seekers, actual refugees, you know, fleeing an actual genocide. That's actually sponsored by the government, right? And so well, it's really it's. I don't know like if we're being honest, we have a white genocide happening here too. It's just done in a different way. Cultural. We can talk about that later. Cultural. It's legitimate. No. Well, yeah. But, um, so, but, well, I will say this so to all the other races, they just don't understand it. No. That's real. Oh, that's real. But yeah, Trump had the South African president come to the White House and the trolling began pretty quick. So he had the, he had him there. And you know, they started on this conversation about what was happening in South Africa. Because to do it is bad. It really is bad. And you know, again, there's, you know, there's history here, right? I mean, it's not, this is not, it's not a recent thing has been happening for a while. South Africa's had plenty of issues going both ways, you know, but I think it is definitely interesting. And when you look, it's like we're in 20, it's 2025 to still have racial tensions that are actually like violent and leading to massacres like in 2025. It's kind of wild to say that it's still happening, but it's still happening. Um, it is happening. And, um, you know, and so they started getting on this conversation about it and, and, uh, the South African presidents named serial Rama Fosa, um, quickly started to deny it. And, uh, in true Trump fashion, proled in a fucking TV, dim the lights and, uh, had them made, made them watch it right in front of them. Let's check. No way. I'll borrow his fucking grade. Really? Let's check this clip out. What do you take from you to be convinced that there's no white genocide in South Africa? Well, I can answer that. I'm not going to answer that. It will be. How is that funny? It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South African, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here. When we have talks between us or the quiet, I don't know, quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I'm not going to be repeating what I've been saying. I would say if there was a African or a former genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen would not be here, including my Minister of Agriculture. He would not be with me. So it will take him, President Trump, listening to their stories, to their perspective. That is the answer to your question. President Trump. President Trump. We have none outplayed. We have thousands of stories talking about it. We have documentaries. We have news stories. And that is Natalie here, somebody here to turn that. I could show you a couple of things. And I would, I just, I have to, it has to be responded to. Sure we will. Let me see the articles please, if you would. Excuse me, turn the lights down. Turn the lights down. No look at this face. He's like, I'm sorry. Thank you. You're on. This parliament can do with the election. Oh shit. People that went to our coupon land, were required not permission from you, from the President, from no one. We don't care. We can do whatever you want to do. Why you to tell us whether you can occupy land or not. We are going to occupy land. This is how Natalie can occupy land. That's who you are. And I would never let you go. We can't leave you. We can't leave you. You can't leave you. You can't leave me. I don't know. Yes. I don't know. It's my natural peace game to kill. And the pollution, the mud and some point, there must be killing because the killing is part of the pollution act. He's sweating. He's sweating. Dude, I don't think that's funny at all. It's not like real talk. Like that guy sitting there smiling and laughing and shit. That's not funny. Because he just got caught lying. Yeah. That's not funny. Yeah. I caught lying. Was that him on the video? No. So that was that revolution leader, right? Right. So he's a member of parliament in South Africa. You know, government leaders should have parliament over there. And he is like the head honcho for that parliament that like, you know, I mean, we're hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people. The guy speaking. The siding with this guy. All right. And yeah, I mean, and I mean, and this video, this clip right here is alone is like six minutes long when I roll. When happens at the end of it? And then this? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I will just fast forward a little bit because he shows even the part where like, you know, they're going over the mass graves of actual white farmers who have been killed. I want to hear what he says afterwards. This is very bad. These are the, these are burial sites right here. Burial sites over a thousand of white farmers. And those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday morning. Each one of those white things you see is across. And there's approximately a thousand of them. They're all white farmers, the family of white farmers. And those cars aren't driving to stop there to pay respects to their family members killed. And it's a terrible sight. I've never seen anything like it. Both sides of the road you have crosses. You're going to go hard. Those people are all killed. Have they told you where that is, Mr. President? No, I'd like to know where that is because this I've never seen. This I'm sure he's never seen. Yeah. Dude, I've seen it. I'm in the middle of a fucking country halfway across the world, dude. I've seen that video a hundred times. Dude, I'll listen. That makes me fucking super mad. Bro, the fucked up thing too. It's like, I mean, you got legacy media, communist media. And what do they say? Well, it's not happening, man. President Trump pushed unsubstantiated claims of white genocide in Africa. Well, if it's unsubstantiated, then why today did they make an amendment to the law, a temporary amendment for the slaughter of, I believe 300 elephants to feed people because the farmers are gone. And now they're starving in certain areas. I believe that it could be wrong. No, you're right. Was this in Bobway? Yep. Yeah. Was it 300 elephants? Yep. Yeah. So they have an endangered species that they have now made an amendment to our temporary amendment. What do you think is going to happen after they eat those 300? What are they going to do? Oh, they're going to kill 300 more. And they're going to do that until they're fucking gone. Okay. Well, they're going to starve. And they're going to go back to the way shit was before fucking farming went to that country. And you know, it is what the fuck it is. But the truth of the matter is everybody who knows anything about what's going on knows that's happening. Everybody who knows anything of what's going on knows that Israel just genocide an entire population of people in Gaza. Okay. We all know this. And like, dude, the respect for human life, the lack of respect for human life, discuss me. It just does. What gives these men the right to decide that other men and other children and other families die? Don't matter. I mean, yeah. Do not fucking matter. I am so tired. And I don't care who it is. I don't care. The fact that we live in a world where a president of a country is sitting in the Oval Office laughing because he's being accused of genocideing the other side, quote unquote, that speaks to the disgusting nature of humanity in my opinion. The fact that we have literally millions of people in the United States who refuse to acknowledge what Israel has done to Palestinians. Like, it disgusts me, dude, because we're not valuing human life at all. Like, dude, like think about how you value your life, how your family values your life, all of you. And when you're gone, it's a big fucking deal. You're gone. You're gone. You cease to exist. And we have a hundred thousand people in Palestine that were just wiped the fuck out. Right? They're gone. They'll never have a chance to do anything that any of you did ever. Right? How many of these people in South Africa are getting like, it's just hard for me to understand why, why any of us as humans in any country tolerate any of this shit from these people. Like, there's millions of us and there's very few of them. Why do we tolerate this? You know what I'm saying? Dude, it's sick, man. It's, I mean, like I said, they do, I will say this. Like, I, you know, look, everybody always hates me because I tell people what I think. And I refuse to buy into one side or the other side. But I do feel like Trump is the first guy in a very long time that actually cares about people. I'm the first human life. Yes. And I don't know, man, I don't know what to think. It's just, it's sad. It's sick. Yeah, it's sad, man. It's sick. And I like to, I mean, media don't help, bro. They don't help. I got this little compilation here. That's because they live in a bubble, bro. There's people listen. They all went to fucking Yale and Harvard and they all think they're better than everybody. They, they look at people who are poor and people who are, you know, in less developed countries. And they think that their life doesn't matter. And then they pretend it does for political clout. Like it's just when it's convenient. Yes, dude, it's just gross. Yeah, it's sick, man. Watch this video. In the dramatic scene in the Oval Office today, the tense confrontation, President Trump ambushing the president of South Africa. Next, another Oval Office meltdown, President Trump ambushing the president of South Africa. President Trump is being accused of conducting something of a diplomatic ambush of South Africa's president in the Oval Office. To be with you, I'm Katie Tsu, President Trump orchestrated another Oval Office ambush today. Today, Donald Trump meeting with the president of South Africa and attempting to ambush and humiliate that leader. Zillinsky territory where essentially he was a bit ambushed inside the Oval Office. It felt like an ambush in there, kind of like the president of Lensky meeting in the Oval Office. This was an ambush. It was orchestrated. Little Ramaposa brought his best diplomatic self to this meeting, but nothing could have prepared him for this multimedia ambush. What started as to some degree an ambush? Well, Katie, I mean, it wasn't ambushed. Ambushed. Ambushed. Ambushed. Ambushed. Ambushed inside the Oval Office. Those people are all going to burn in hell, bro. Real talk. Right. Yes. All of them. Those are terrible human beings. On top of it, who's writing the script? Like we saw all of this through COVID. We saw all this through Ukraine. We saw all of it. We've seen this a million times. I don't think anybody's really listening to these people, by the way. I think they've lost credibility for sure. And by the way, when you are having a diplomatic meeting, it's called coming from a pair. Okay. When I have a meeting in business and we have to solve an issue, I come with the facts. I don't play polite. That doesn't solve anything. We're not getting any closer to a resolution. You bring the facts. Those are the facts. You ask questions. He asked a question. That's not an ambush. And everybody out there who has one fucking percent common sense knows that. Understands that. Yeah. It's sick. And now only that right after all of this legacy media shit, that dude who's in the video to him out, you know, kill the farmers, kill the bow, the bowers, he doubled down on it. His entire party did. They doubled down on it, released a press. Well, then I think all the farmers should move to Europe or go to go to one of the, the quote unquote, look, wherever they go, they're going to be called colonizers and hate it on and told their shit. So the best you could do is go to a country that's, you know, primarily white contribute there because clearly they don't want you there. And we'll see what the fuck happens when you're gone. They'll starve. They'll be, dude, and Zimbabwe, they're begging for the farmers to come back. So, you know, like dude, you know, this is what happens when you, you know, when you fucking, when you don't stick up for yourself. That's it, man. Nobody, nobody that is trying to gain position over you. People don't understand this. They will guilt you. They will shame you. They will try to make you feel bad. Do all this stuff in a minute that they get power over you. This goes for any group. This is not black, white. This is just how this is, this is in business. Okay. And bit, let's take a business example. In business, there will be people that will come along because if I use the racist example everybody's gonna get their pussy hurt. Okay. There will be people that come along and they act like they're your friend and they tell you all the shit you want to hear. And then they say things like, dude, come on, man. You know, look at what you've got. Look what I've got. Bro, help me out. Let me get in a minute, the minute that they get to a position where they think they have enough clout or enough leverage. They will try to fucking squash you. Okay. That's in business. That is human nature. That is strategic thinking. That is manipulation and anybody who falls for that in any way, shape, or form whether it be business or whether it be culture. I understand you might have a good heart, but you need to understand that not everybody thinks like you. Not everybody has a girl. That's right. And there are evil motherfuckers out there that will tell you everything you want to hear until they get to a position where they can leverage it and then they'll fucking kill you. And dude, that's what's happening over there. So, I would suggest that people recognize what's happening there and think about, you know, how important it is to maybe stand up for yourself because that's what happened over there. And by the way, I want to say this too. We're all Americans here, bro. It doesn't matter if you're black, white, yellow, red, fucking, I don't give a fuck. There's right and wrong and sometimes our own people are in the wrong. You see what I'm saying? And we have to be honest about what's right and wrong. Otherwise, we lose all ability to even have any kind of civilized culture. So I don't know. Don't get, I guess what I'm saying is this is going to become more and more of an issue and more and more talked about. And the reason they're talking about it more and more because this has been going on for a long time is because they're trying to stoke racial division here. And I think it's important to talk about, but I also think it's important to realize that the black guy that lives next door or the white dude that lives next door is not your fucking enemy. You know what I'm saying? It's real. A lot of people get sucked into this shit, dude. It's very easy to. Yeah. It's very easy to, man. Yeah, guys, let us know down in the comments, what you guys think. Let us know. How was that being said? Let's go cruise some of these comments. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, bro, I pissed some grimaces off yesterday. You did. Yeah, you did. Bro, it's great. See, I mean, you know what's funny though? I didn't mean to make everybody mad, dude. I'm just pointing out like you're not trying. You're not, I'm not saying you got to be ripped. I'm not saying, you know, I did say you got to be jacked. But when I say jacked, I just mean like not a piece of shit. All right. Can I take your lunch money? Bro, but you got it, dude, it was great because a lot of them dudes were just telling on themselves. Bro, I got some examples. Oh, you do? Of course, yeah. All right. Yeah. Let's check in some of these comments. I was having so much fun with that, bro. Did you see my grimaces illustrations I put up? They were pissed. I'm calling them grimaces from now on. They were pissed. Don't be a grimace. Well, the problem is you check some of their profiles and like, of course, it's private. Oh, bro. Or no post. There was this one guy that was like, he's like, I'll fucking kill you in any gym and any sport, any this and any that. And I look at his picture and I'm like, bro, are you fucking sure you want that smoke? I'm fucking cha. Yeah. I saw a Canadian hop in there. Oh, what do you say? Probably something polite, huh? Hey, sir. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if I agree with what you had to say. Yeah, personally, his name is Chad, but like personally, I have a hard time. Like, I don't feel like if your name is Chad, you have a foundation to make, make threats. Let's do it. First of all, I'm just being rude. First of all, Chad's. Listen, anybody that is mad by that. Right. He's the only exception. Yeah, that's true. Chad, right. He's the only exception. But I think he does 2Ds on this chat. Well, look, here's the reality. If what I said makes you mad, that's a U-problem. That means you're not living up to it because if you were, it wouldn't even trigger you at all. You'd be like, fucking right, bro. I got my shit together. You know, and then everybody is whatever. Let's see the comments. Yeah, let's just check some of these out there. Well, first one, whisper as B said, mother fucking internet. That's right. I'm not who's mad at. Who's mad at? Oh, that's you. Apparently. What's up, mad at it? This is next one, I'm 98, 9, all three days in a row. And Tom, that's what's up. Yeah, yeah. Tom was cool, bro. Tom was cool. Man, I wish we would have had like a full two, three hour show with him. Yeah. But the way that came together, like dude, people don't, we didn't really get to explain this, but like it was last minute. So last minute. Yeah. And then we had a time to work out. And we want to do a show. I'm like, all right, well, I got like an hour because I got to go speak at this thing. And but it was great. I watched his, I finally watched it last night. That's fucking hilarious. It was pretty good. Oh my God. Did you watch the whole thing? Yeah. Did you see a fucking park route? Had a chop off his own dick, bro. I'm my favorite. So is it going to look normal after that? No, it's not going to look normal. It's going to look like you chopped your dick off. The fucking nursing home one. Bro, you being pregnant, ass-like, are you scoozy? No, he glist. He's calling an Uber. No, I'm not. I'm not. Uber shows up. Where the fuck am I? I'm here for top. Where the fuck? The fucking the school play. Oh, bro, this the whole thing was great. It was fucking perfect. Like dude, and I see people be like, oh, it's so dark. What? That was great. Yeah, that was great. I don't know, man. I guess if you don't have a sense of humor, you might not get it. That was definitely right on my alley. Like, that was some funny shit. Fuck no people watching. Bro, he's a good actor. He's good. Like, yeah, dude, like really good. I don't know. I thought it was awesome. But yeah, dude, I would love to have, you know, he's a big car guy, too. Yeah. Yeah, it's coming. You got to come back. Yeah, I think we're going to do some car stuff. Yeah, that'd be sick, man. You know, other thing, because I trust me, I got the comments for you. But you also pissed some people off with our rap suggestions and those rappers are alive. Oh, yeah. Other controversial. Well, how, how, well, they just said we feel like we left some people out. Okay. Like who? Technine. That Technine is pretty good. Yeah. We left him a couple of times. 50 cents. Bro, want it? Yeah, I mean, he's good. We love, we love, I mean, look, I mean, it's a hard, that's a hard thing. That's what you're saying. There's lots of good. Like, Technine is good. Like, dude, hit one of his songs. I'm a player. Nice, my favorite song in back in college, bro. You know that one? How did it go? I'm a player. No, that's not how it goes. I don't know the same fucking line. I know that I don't want to be a player. No, I'm a player. I'm a player. I'm a player. You never heard it? Never heard that. It's fucking good, man. Yeah. Yeah, see? All right. I met him a couple of times. He did. He performed it one of the, I had him in, when I used to do the concerts. Oh, yeah. I had him come one time. I lost him. That's it. I was a, Julio from Denver. That's right for a live brother Lynch, brother who? Brother Lynch on. What? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on, bro. That's not a real guy. Bro, hold the fuck off, bro. Brother, who? Not that new shit, but that whole shit. Oh, my God. Is he trolling me? Yes. All right. All right. Look at the fucking guys profile, dude. Of course he's trolling. Bro, that's, that's pretty fucking funny. I'm sure I've never heard this rapper before. Dude. All right. Dude. That's a pretty good trolling. I mean, that's super racist, but it's fucking funny. All right. That's cool. Is that a real guy? Oh, it is. Oh, it is. Brother, brother Lynch on. Okay. Oh, it is a real guy. Oh, braces. Brother, that's just funny, dude. What's a black dude? Is it? What's your black? Hey, bro, do you guys listen to Young Gravy? You ever heard any Young Gravy? No. You know who he is? Bro, I saw, I was fucking around my Instagram, dude. His songs are pretty fucking funny. I don't know if he's like a serious rapper or like, it's just like fucking around, but I think he's a pretty big deal. But it's shit's funny. Like the lyrics are funny. Yeah, brother, brother, brother Lynch on. I thought this guy was making a racist show. Now the truth comes out. Tell him something, little bit. I don't say it. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Who were for Andy? Oh, dude, I thought that was like the troll of all time. I'm like, fuck, man, I've never heard of this guy. Shit. I'll check him out. I'll check him out. Dude, that's fucking funny. All right, now let's get into some heat. Let's get into some heat. Dirty diaper. Here come the grimaces. Dirty diaper, 1783. I watched the show with my wife and was quickly disappointed. I skipped to the next episode, 10 minutes in. Then skipped to the fourth episode, then turned it off. This guy wants men's bananas straight up teenage boy humor about wings. Not funny at all. What? Okay. Well, they know fucking listens. I mean, like, dude, it's like people heck like I force them to listen. Yeah, right, right. Don't listen. I was quickly disappointed in you, son. I skipped to the next episode. And I heard another dick joke. I was like, wow. I think that's the guy's going to hear jokes about wings. I think that's kind of fun. Yeah, straight up teenage boy humor. Yeah. Men's, I don't get the men's bananas, though. Oh, you want men's bananas? Oh, we do? Yeah. Oh, so so we're almost we're gay. Oh, got it. Okay. So that's not teenage boy. He totally makes sense. Yeah.

It's too easy. Too easy man. I'm pretty sure you refer. Dude, he's just projecting. It's like, what could I see my dick? Cause you're a fucking grimace bro. You're exactly who the fuck I was talking about. Oh man, zero tone on the calves. Oh man, zero. It must be it. Listen, it's it's gotta be rough. I'd be pissed off if I look like a fucking McDonald's character too, bro. Oh shit, bro. Hey, I love you man. Yeah, all right. Quick and easy. You got more. Oh shit dude. You gotta keep cruising man. Oh bro. You gotta keep cruising. But here's an idea. We should do this as a whole segment. Like I mean, it's own fucking like episode. You mean like cruise the comments? You mean like the one I told you to do when we first started? Yeah. You know, is he sure? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like you're like, I feel like I'm having PTSD here man. This is like my whole life. Like tell motherfuckers like, hey, this will work. I think it's been a great idea. And then they're like, oh fuck Andy dude. Like get by way. Then eventually we work our way all the way back. Same set. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. You know what? Yeah.

Come on now. Maybe. Dude. Listen. If anybody got a, I can see why he got offended by what I said. You know what I'm saying? Like, did I got it? Yeah. Like dude, all I'm saying is, like, you're not trying, man. We just try. I just try. That's it. All right. He's not trying. Yeah, people got mad at me from that. Man, man. But, they went full, full, full Roy boy. Bro, when I was fucking 350, everybody's like, you fat fuck. And then now it's like, steroids. Yeah, fucking Roy boy. Yeah. Of course I fucking take steroids. Bro, I'm 45 years old. I take a shit ton of testosterone. I'm just supposed to. That's the way you do when you're 45. On top of that, I work my ass off. And anybody who's been following me for a long time knows that. And some dude right in there, I saw one of you saying, well, you know, I work 60 hours a week and don't listen dude. I work 60 hours a week by Wednesday at fucking noon. Okay. So fuck out here with that. You couldn't walk a fucking mile. You couldn't walk a fucking day in my shoe. You're with me every month, fucking day. But you want to talk about an ass beating. I am acclimated. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Grimits. Oh, we're going to make some shirts for the Grimits. If we feature them on the show, we're going to send them a Grimits shirt. You got to sign it for me. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, we do appreciate you though for being real ass fans, man. Keep liking commenting. Bro, shame works. Shame does work. It does. Remember that dude I fucking told that shit to it when we were at that speaking conference? Oh, yeah. So it comes up and he's like, yeah, you and I are pretty much the same. We have the same discipline. And you know, I'm, I'm alpha and all of it. Like, first of all, dude, anybody who's a term alpha, fucking weird out immediately not alpha. Yeah. Second of all, you're 360 fucking pounds, bro. The fuck do you see in the mirror? Remember how I went on him? In front of me? Like I said down in front of like 5,000. I'm like, these are the amount of people. Yeah. And dude, he came back a year later. He was down 130 fucking pounds. So all of you to get upset when I say the truth. I'm gonna walk off because people need to see the fucking truth. I've been lying to themselves the whole lives. I know it's hard. It's hard for everyone. But that's not an excuse for being a piece of shit, especially when you have people that look up to you. People that depend on you. Yeah. It's real, man. It's real. But yeah, man, let's keep cruising. Let's go headline number two. Hour in headline number two. That was fucking fun. Let's keep it in DC. This is a hot topic that's happening right now. You kind of touch on a little bit. But I got some things to say on this one as well. But it's going around. Gunned down Israeli embassy staffer, Sarah Milgram worked on peace building between Palestinians and Israelis. A grieving father says that's the irony. So I believe this was last night. Two people were killed. A father of the bride to be who was killed along with her boyfriend or the capital Jewish museum in Washington, DC. So his daughter was working to bring Israeli, Palestinian peace and more to Gaza before being gunned down by a suspect who later yelled free, free Palestine. So yeah, so this happened. This was like late last night. Late last night. Yeah. But they're calling him the anti-Israel suspect. He's identified as 30 year old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago. The embassy of Israel to the United States set the victims. Yaren Leshensky and Sarah Milgram were set to be engaged. Rodriguez is believed to have committed the act alone and is in custody. Said Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith. Now, here's a video of his apprehension because they had it. You know, he didn't really run anywhere. He actually went into this place, told them to call the police that it was him. And he set away in there for law enforcement to show up. Here's a video. Five. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. They seems awfully calm for somebody just getting killed. Like right in front of their faces. Doesn't it a little weird? Last night was weird all over the board because before you and I mean, there was also something about some security guards at the CIA headquarters. Shadow woman, like ran through the berries and shit, like, I mean, do you know who was interesting about that Jewish museum shooting? Did you know that Pam Bondy was on the scene? She was there. Yeah, immediately. Yeah, I saw that too. That was weird. That is weird. That's weird. So the AG goes to on the scene of crimes now. I mean, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, right. It's weird. I mean, maybe there was another reason she was there. There's the picture for her. That's weird. I mean, immediately. Yeah. Here's my fear. Okay. Well, you know the guy that they killed wasn't even Jewish. He was Christian. Yeah, he was Christian. He was an IDF soldier who was Christian that also dedicated him basically his whole life to protecting Israel. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a lot of reports saying that he was a Jew. He's not a Jew. He's a Christian. I saw something saying that like it was like his dad was Jewish. His mother was Christian. I don't know, but I mean, there's a lot of people saying, oh, this Jewish guy got, no, it wasn't. I'm just saying it's not right. Did he got killed? But he's not. That's misreporting in the news. Here's my fear with this. Okay, because I feel like this shit's been coming to a head here recently. I think my fear is that they're about to usher in some really, really dangerous author, I thought it's Harry and level censorship when it comes to free speech. Yeah. Like it's coming. Yeah. And they're using this to justify it. That's my out. No, I think you're right. That's my outlook. Yeah. And if they don't get it here, there'll be a bigger attack. If they don't get it there, there'll be a bigger one. A bit bigger one. And like, and do the problem that I have with this, man, is like, you know, yeah, that's under the assumption that this is a false flag for political motives. I've been seeing that too. Hold on. Which I think most people that have been paying attention for the last four or five years, at least, would agree that this appears to be that. There's a lot of weird stuff about it. It doesn't seem like it's just some random dude. He was led in. You know, if you read, if you listen to the interviews, it's really weird. It's weird. So, you know, what DJ's saying for those of you that, you know, aren't following is that these attacks are being orchestrated to usher in speech laws so that you cannot criticize Israel at all. Otherwise, you are dealt with how they deal with people over in England right now. Hate speech. Like, you literally will go to jail. Hate speech is a new thing, by the way. Okay. That's like the last five, six, seven, eight years. That did not exist prior to that. Prior to that, if people said dumb shit, they were just a dumb ass. Right. But now there's these restrictive speech laws that are happening globally, which doesn't help anybody's cause. Like, if you were actually innocent of any of the things you were being accused of, and then you try to make laws about that you can't talk about it, that doesn't say that you're not doing it. It says you're doing it and you can't talk about it. I've been running into some interesting people on social media. And again, like, this is not, this is not anti-semitic. It's not anti-zionism, whatever you want to call it. Listen, it's not anti-semitic or racist or bigoted to notice things. Or to point out data. These are questions that have to be asked or talked about. And they have to be talked about in an actual, intelligent way, collectivizing entire groups of people. This is why I have a problem with the people who do say it's the Jews. Do you know that you're collectivizing a massive group of people for the decisions made by a very small minority of that group? That's the truth. While it may seem, everywhere you look, that's still a very small group. It's the same thing with Black crime. It's the same thing with... It's the same thing, same thing, same thing. You cannot solve a problem when you play into their intentional defense. Their intentional defense is to get you to collectivize the whole group of people so that they can discredit you for being racist or anti-semitic. And then you're just a crazy person talking shit. So if you all want to really solve the problem, stop generalizing and get more specific about who's doing what? Right. You know, to your point though, I mean, the crazy thing is like, I've been running into these different accounts across social media, man. And it's so interesting to me is how quickly they will jump in the victim hood mindset, right? And cash blame. Well, that's part of the defense. That's part of it. But like, you know, this guy on Twitter, it's a Jews really safe in America. I don't know anymore. Band the Muslim Brotherhood. Stop tolerating Hamas flags. Stop normalizing Jew hate marches. Fight anti-semit and prosecute them. Shut down the free Palestine terrorist movement. Do it before more Jews are killed. Well, maybe, maybe the collective of the Jewish population should hold the people at the top of their organization responsible for what they're doing. Well, because- And not defend it. Because who's the thing? And by the way, there's a lot of Jews that fall into that category. There's a lot of Jews that say that what the leaders of Israel are doing is very, very, very, very wrong and it's disgusting. Just like most people are saying. Just like China saying. Just like India saying. Just like most of the people in America are now saying. Just like Europe saying. China went so far as to accuse them of crimes against humanity. I think they're trying to bring it to international court. Yeah. I can't- Now, there's- I might be mispeaking a little bit there, but I read something about that. But the point is, is that they ignore that. The media doesn't acknowledge that segment of the Jewish population. Either side of the media. No, they don't say, oh, by the way, there's a whole bunch of Jewish people that fucking hate what Israel's doing. They don't ever say that. Why don't they? Because they want to create collective hate. This person is either falling into the play that they want him to fall into. Or that's an asset- Who's pushing it? Punching out legitimate propaganda. Right. Well, I mean, it's not just this. And bro, you think about AI now. Okay. You know how easy it is? Like, dude, fucking five years ago, six years ago, four years ago, they had the bots. Now they got AI, bro. They can fucking do it. Like, dude, did you not see the VO3 that you- That a Google came in with? I saw that. Bro, it- Listen, you will never be able to tell again what's actually real or what's fake. And I tell you what, dude, whoever solves that problem at scale is going to be one rich motherfucker. I don't know enough about it, but I'm going to tell you this. If you could figure out how to quickly identify people, if things are AI or not, you're going to be rich as fuck. Yeah, accurately. Yeah, precisely. Yeah, actually. Yeah, for sure. You know, but- And then sure- There's going to have to be a law, bro, that says this- If you don't identify this video at AI, then you're- You know, the FCC or something. There's going to have to be something. And he's to have a quick. Yeah. And he's to have a quick. You know, are there accounts like this? He left fold. You know, and he's calling out people, Candace Owens, Pierce Morgan, every single person who held Hamas and Hezbollah flags in the street, every person who supported them, every person calling to globalize the Intifada, every single human being who contributed to Jew hatred online by spreading Hamas proper danda and blood libels. You are all guilty and you have blood on your hands. Don't worry. You will be held accountable sooner or later. Like, what the fuck does that mean? No, I mean, what about the blood on your hands of 100,000 innocent motherfuckers? They don't talk about shit like this. Yeah. You're Andy fine. Randy fine. There is no suffering adequate for these animals. May the streets of Gaza overflow with blood. So their blood doesn't matter. You see what I'm saying? Bro, that I do. Yeah. That's my problem, bro. Bro, that's the elitist mentality. That's not a exclusively Jewish thing. No, it's elitist. It's social class. They matter more than you and I. Okay. That's it. And dude, like I saw this, you know, like that. It is sad. These would be like, yeah, but what's funny is you see how they're talking about them like he's a Jewish man. He's not Jewish. I'm not even Jewish. But, you know, the thing is like I saw this other person like, oh, you know, it makes you wonder like that they pick him because he was Christian and they could I don't know. I don't know. But like, I saw this post. It was like, because again, like I'm not it's sad. Right. It's very unfortunate. Both of them got killed, right? Both. Yeah. It's very unfortunate. But that's not supposed to like, oh man, like, you know, they were supposed to be engaged next week and, you know, now they're not going to be able to have a family or have a life. And I'm just like, well, I mean, what about all those kids and God, though, that we've been bombed? Like, did you see the thing Theo Vaughn said? Yeah. Where he was like, bro, you see, and I agree with them. Everything he said I agree with. You're watching videos of people literally reassembling their children because their head was blown off. There's a video that I was sent of a man holding his son's head in his hands. Like, but that's okay. You see what I'm saying? Like, that's okay because they're fucking animals, quote, unquote. Right. That's not okay. It's not, man. That's not. And, and dude, honestly, the more they talk like that, the more the more these elitist talk like this, when I say, that I don't mean Jewish people. I mean, the the Jewish mafia at the top, the eliest, the more they talk like that, the more people are going to fucking pay. That's what I'm saying. Like, it's not like you can't, like, you're not going to force your weight. Like, look, and you can't just keep trying to, you know, blanket blame everybody who questions or or or calls out or or should like that. But then not also take responsibility for the shit. That is being posted out. I mean, look, man, do that. Look, dude, that's why you either have to stand up for what's right or what's wrong. It's a right and wrong. It's wrong that all those innocent people were killed. It's wrong that these people were killed. Those are wrong. Those are wrong things. Those are wrong. Okay. And it doesn't, you can't hold weight. Like, the fact that these two lives hold more weight than how many people have been killed in Gaza. I've said 100,000 a bunch of times. I don't even know if that's correct. I think it's about that. 121,000. Okay. So somewhere between, let's say, 60, 60,000 and 100,000. Okay. So these two lives hold more weight than 60,000 to 100,000 people because they happen to be a different religion than you. Yeah. That's not right. And I can't agree with anybody who agrees that that's okay. No. And the tweets and the statements and all of these things, these aggressive like, dude, you know what? Listen, man, I think this could be, and this is total speculation, and this is going to really like bother some people. But it almost feels like the elite Jewish leadership is trying to intentionally create a situation where lots of Jews are killed so that they can keep that level of power over people that they've had for so long. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. Like they're willing to sacrifice. Yes. That's what it feels. It feels like. That's what it feels like because, dude, you're, they're pissing off everybody. Well, I mean, if you think about it, I mean, historically, I mean, if you, if you really pull it back, some would argue that's what happened in 1930. Boy, I know. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, oh, I know that's, that's, you know, there's lots of different opinions about what happened or what couldn't, what, what happened or what didn't happen. But the point of the matter is, is that it feels to me, like, they're orchestrating this hatred intentionally towards regular Jewish people so that they can have bad things happen to those regular Jewish people and then be like, look what the world did to us. And then, and then get all of this extra favor towards Israel. Like, bro, they're playing with fire, man, because there's three billion Muslims, dude. I'm going to tell you right now, there's none of those people that have anything nice to say about Israel. And probably, I would bet that most of them don't have the discipline to say, because they're more emotionally connected to it, to say it's not all Jews. You see what I'm saying? So it's creating a very dangerous situation when you're surrounded by all Arab countries who fucking hate you and pissing them all off. Yeah. Like, dude, it's just, you know, like, and dude, I've, you know, and then why wouldn't they report the mass amount of resistance are getting from their own people? You see what I'm saying? That's the same thing that happens in the LGBT community too, bro. Like, because there's a, there's a, it's more and more every day. Like, we talk about where days against groomer, right? They call them out, but they're not getting no love from the, the, the, that community. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, like, they're not, no, they're just the centers. We're not going to cover that. Absolutely not. Yeah, dude, I think, I think of Jewish people are legitimately worried about things getting out of control, which I think is a legit concern based on what's happening. I think it's important for them to stand up and say just like we would say against our own leadership, be like, bro, those people don't represent us. You know what I'm saying? Like, we're not okay with that. And stop feeling like you have to defend the homeland. Because if we're being honest, the Israel that the Bible talks about is not the same as the leadership that is leading Israel now. So like, I think a lot of it, and some shit's just not, you some shit you just can't defend, bro. Yeah, but I guess fucking wrong. I understand that, but I think that Jewish people have a very tight connected community, and which is not a bad thing, right? They're socialism. They're, and that's not a bad thing. Yeah. But they can't be, first of all, they can't be the only ones allowed to have it. And whatever they say is good for everybody else. It needs to be good for them too. Okay? Like importing all these people from all these, why don't they allow that over there? Yeah, no. You know, but that's another discussion. But the point is, there has to come a time when you admit to yourself that your team is doing things that are out of alignment with what you know is right and wrong. And you can't stay blindly loyal to people who are doing things that you know very well are wrong. Because that is the way that you end up with this mass hate and this mass attack mentality, bro, because like not everybody will take a minute and stop and think. Try to differentiate. There's a reason that propaganda is pushed. You know why? Because it works. Fuck it works. Yeah. And like, dude, it's just, it's just, it's, I think it is very dangerous. I think it's very dangerous. And I think it's, I think it's wrong. I don't think anybody should be collectivized into any group at all. I will never say that. I'm not, that's not the kind of person I am. I catch a lot of heat for that too. You know, that doesn't say that that doesn't mean that I don't stand up for white people's rights. No, I will clearly stand up for that. But I'm not going to buy into that everybody fucking hates this person or that person or that we should collect. That's not right. It's not right. What's right is, that's a good dude. That's a bad person. I don't want to be like the bad person. So I'm going to call that out because I don't like that. And that person might look like me. They might be related to me. They might be my dad. But that's wrong. And dude, that's where we have to like get to. And if we ever want to really solve these things because the truth, the matter is, is that we're manipulated against each other every single day in every different way. Like, why the fuck is it such a big deal of what pigment someone's skin is? Or why is it such a big deal? What religion that someone believes? Like, these are all things that are manufactured for division amongst us that benefit other people. We as humans are not, we're not living in our natural state. Our natural state would be peace and harmony if we weren't manipulated in other ways. Yes, there would be violence. Like, if someone came on my property and tried to fuck up my, I'm going to kill that dude. Right? But the collectivization manipulation is that wouldn't exist, man. Not like it does today. Not. No, man. No, it's crazy, man. Guys, tell us what you think. Jump down in the conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. With that being said, let's do our third and final headline here. Andy Domis. Oh, yeah. Andy Domis. I'll let you read this headline. Headline number three. Is it a complicated one? Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. US officials delayed warning public about heart inflammation risk from COVID shot report. Senator Ron Johnson says Biden administration with hell, crucial health information about the COVID-19 vaccine. Hmm. About two dicks too short, right? Yeah, I don't know about three, four years. Two shots, you know, like, I believe we even said this on the show that they would come out later in a minute. You can try to flip it now. Well, no, what was a thought was that they were going to try to spin this somehow on Trump. You know what I'm saying? And like, I got, because I got some stuff here, right? And Warp Speed got brought up a few times. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? But the large majority of it is falling on the Biden at men's shoulders. Well, that's because they're the ones that made it mandatory and find everybody's got everybody fired and all that shit. Exactly. It's different to say, hey, we got this vaccine. You weren't taking or not. Right. Rather than saying, hey, like they did to me, we're going to find you $700,000 per employee when I have 500 employees. So basically, you either do this or we're taking everything from you forever. Mm-hmm. And just so you know, I told them to fucking eat shit. There you do. So, um, man, so let's, let's dive into this, Andy Domes. Let's see what the finally saying, four years later. Um, you have, uh, US health officials knew about the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 vaccines, but downplayed the concern and delayed informing the public about the risk of taking the jab. That is according to a new Senate report released by Senator Ron Johnson Wednesday. Uh, Johnson is a Republican out of Wisconsin. The chairman of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations has been investigating the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines. Earlier this year, he subpoenaed the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, for records relating to COVID-19 vaccine safety data and communications about the pandemic. Um, so this report, and we'll, excuse me. Um, now this report will link it for you guys, uh, Andy for seller.com. You guys can check it out there. It's 55 pages. I read through it. Um, and uh, it was, we're all 55. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Damn, do you know how long it take you uh, what time is it? Like, did you start last week? It's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, Hey, I want my bike back by the way. I had a fucking walk to work today. No, you did. You should've forgot. Did you drop the gate or no? No, I was going to. They're doing, they're repaving my road. I was going to ride my bike yesterday, but I couldn't find it. Fuck off, man. Oh, but yeah, so let's dive in through this because there's, there's a lot of stuff that's happened. So, um, it was a panel of, of different doctors, attorneys, lawyers that kind of all, uh, kind of work together in creating a, a solid picture. Um, and from the sound of it, it sounds like they all listen to the show. Uh, because it's exactly what we were saying, uh, to the T. Um, so it starts off, um, uh, with a, uh, doctor, he's a cardiologist. Um, and, uh, let's see what he has to say on this. Now, the topic today is myocarditis or heart damage from the COVID-19 vaccines. I'm a cardiologist. I know the topic well. I've examined thousands of patients with this problem, thousands before the pandemic. I had two patients ever with this problem. There's 1,000 at 65 papers in the peer-reviewed literature on COVID vaccine myocarditis. So let me summarize them for you. The first one that came on my radar screen that was alarming came from Washington University in St. Louis, August 18th of 2021. The first author is Verma and colleagues, New England Journal of Medicine. 42-year-old man comes into Washington University hospital with vaccine myocarditis. The infection is rolled out. It's the vaccine. He's in the hospital. So one of our best hospitals in the United States, he dies three days after taking Moderna. They can't save him in the hospital. Say, Dr. McCollum, move the microphone just a little bit away from your man. Then one was reported from Korea by joy and colleagues. This is not a younger man. Just a few days after Pfizer, he comes in the hospital. He dies within eight hours of being in the hospital. I can tell you, my cardiologist, that doesn't even happen with heart attacks. He dies within eight hours. I examined all of the slides and the images that the Koreans had showed us. It looked like somebody took a blow-chorch to that heart. It was so completely fried with inflammation. His heart was destroyed. These cases, which were widely known at the time, should have gotten everyone's attention. Everyone should have been laser-focused on this. We should never have someone die after taking a vaccine that's directly caused to the vaccine. Then, Gil and colleagues, Connecticut, published an archives of pathology. Two boys, age 16 and 17, who die a few days after taking Pfizer. These are teenagers. They're found dead at home by their parents. They're absolutely horrified. I mean, and then remember, let's remember, we got called conspiracy theorists. We got canceled. We got censored. We got episodes deleted. We had Dr. Fauci and all these experts saying that people like you and me and Dr. McCullough and a bunch of other doctors, Ben Tapper, these other people were total cokes. Steve's right. The front-line doctors, they put one of them in jail for saying things like this. They tried to ruin Joe Rogan for saying Ivermectin worked. All right, so there was a varying nefarious, intentional play to inject people with this. And I believe, and I believe this 100% in my heart, that it was an intentional play to literally call the population in a way that, and I truly believe this. And I don't say this to fuck. Well, I had three people. I died. No, die under the age of 40. After they took the vaccine. Three mother fuckers. Three that I knew personally. My best friend was in the hospital for two weeks. I know, dude. He's lucky you can be around. Yeah. Bro, I thought I was your best friend. Yeah. Man, you're my best friend. You know, fuck, I hurt me. I'm not black. You just gave me the vaccine. You just gave me the vaccine. You're my best friend. All right. Let's take my big other guy. So, so anyway, my point is, is that like, dude, they, and I, dude, I really, I say this, not to be, I shouldn't say this, but I'm not trying to scare anybody, but I truly believe that every single person that took it is in serious danger at some point. I believe when it's all said and done, their lifespan will be much shorter than that what it was, what it wouldn't. Yeah. And we've only been two, three years away. A lot of times we've seen these class action lawsuits for medicines. They come 10 years later, bro, right? And you were a love one. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Right. And they can't do that because they reclassify what a vaccine is. Yeah. Those are another attorney that's talking about that. He's like, it's vaccines are the only thing in the United States that is manufactured or produced that have a unit. That's right. Fucking airplane cars, but airbags, the remember, a vaccine used to mean that if you took it, it cured the thing that you took it for forever. You never did. Okay. Yeah. Right. Then they reclassified the definition of vaccine. Okay. So that they could put this in that category to avoid any sort of repercussions legally. That was 1986, by the way. Bro, and remember, remember all of these people who like, dude, remember the people, like, remember what they did? Remember how they like, like, me, dude, remember how many people with fucking yellow at you or I? Like, and we've said, dude, you're fucking, like, I do. I remember I'm going to be, I see my fucking first baby being born because of it. You know what I'm saying? They tried to kick me out of the hospital before. Yeah. And then they're vividly, man. And like, bro, they threatened, they threatened people like me, who employ people. They threatened them. They said, if you don't do this, you could be subject to up to a $700,000 fine for every single employee. Okay. That means, like, and then they get on TV and what'd they say? What Biden then say? Oh, well, nobody's fortunate to take it. Volunteer. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Now, if you do take it, we can give you some free donuts and french fries. Yeah. You know, yeah. Like french fries. Yeah. It's too early for a hamburger. Yeah. Right. You know, so you're telling me, I can get this. You're right. And I can get fries. And all I got to do is poison myself to kill myself. Right. It's, dude, here's the other, here's the other thing too, because I was thinking about this more. Bro, I know a lot of people too, that got it who had other health problems. Yeah. Well, so, so there, here's the next piece. There was a, he's an OB-GYN, his name is Dr. James Thorpe. He delivered one of the most haunting moments of the hearing. He said that COVID shots mirrored the effects of chemical abortion drugs, and the government knew what it was doing. Dr. Thorpe pointed to the now infamous Shimaburaku study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which claimed a 12.6% miscarriage rate following COVID vaccination. But when you isolate the data, this is the important, because 12.8% doesn't sound like much, right? No, here's the thing, when you isolate the data for women vaccinated in the first trimester, the miscarriage rate rises to 82%. There's no way they didn't know that. There's no, that's intentional, dude. Now, do you have more? Oh, yeah, bro, I mean, let's keep going, because I got a lot, I know why they're doing this, and I'm going to explain it at the end. I mean, like, here's the study right here, impact of M-R-A and inactivated COVID-19 vaccines on a variant reserve, right? And not to mention the global fertility rates following as the world is getting older and living longer. It's not a good sign for humanity. Depends on who you are. Peno who you are, right? Now, here's my thing, because they finish us out in that, as of April 25th, there were 38,000 deaths reported to VAERS. And 1.6 million adverse events worldwide associated with the injections. Here's the other thing. All right, what classifies that, though? I mean, that seems like very under-reported. Well, so here's my theory. All right, because as much as they propagated this, the mask, I think, no doubt about it. Everybody was wearing the shit, right? It was definitely mass. Not everything. Not everybody, but large majority went along with that. I don't think that many people actually got the vaccine. I don't. And that's the only, that's the only logical question I can come to with this. Like, like, I mean, they tried it. They made it, if you remember, the whole psychological operation was to make everybody feel like everybody else was doing it and you were the outcast for not doing it. For not doing it. That started with the mask, all right? Everybody wear a mask. And there was lots of people that were like, I'm not wearing a mask, but they did it anyway. All right, so it was very intelligent how they did it, because they made it seem like everybody was going along with it. When in reality, everybody that I know was like, this is ridiculous. But then they would go out in public, because they didn't want to deal with it. And they would just wear it, and which we talked about a gazillion times. You can't wear the mask if you don't believe in it. And this is why, because it creates the perception that everybody's going along with the op. And when most people don't have the ability to stand on their own two feet and say, no, they just don't have it. They don't have the confidence. They've never done it. They're uncomfortable doing it. And it's human nature. People will go along with the herd, all right? And so it created the perception that the whole herd was doing this, even though most of the herd didn't believe in it, all right? And that created this perception of, well, I better do what they say. And this is actually dangerous, and this is real. And then you combine that with the drastic actions they took, like closing parks and arresting people on the beach and putting out videos in the first few weeks of COVID where people were literally falling over in the street. Dead, which never happened. Okay. Then they were digging potential mass graves in New York. They had these hospitals. Yes. And fucking bodies. More body trailers. Yeah, right. Hospitals that were completely empty. This was all about creating a perception so that people believed they had do it or they were the outcast or they were the conspiracy theorist broke to survive that amount of propaganda without doing it. It took an exceptionally strong human being to do because I've never seen any sort of propaganda movement like that of my life. No. But that created a scenario. And I think you might be right because, dude, when it came down to the vaccine, I think people drew a line secretly. And then they were, if you remember, we were talking about this, bro. They were saying 80% of people are vaccine. 80% of who? There's no way. Yeah, because most of the people that I talk to in my life did not get it. So, and that could be my echo chamber. But I've talked to enough people that they said, yeah, nobody I know is gotten it. Nobody I've known is gotten it. And the ones I know that have gotten it have dealt with health problems. And I've been fucked up. That's what I'm saying. So it's like two things can't be true at the same time. You know what I'm saying? That's what I find hard to believe. Like if this data is that data, and I say that is right, even under reported stuff, because again, you got to, you got to lump into the fact too. Like there were plenty of people who were killed in the car accident that were being labeled to the COVID-19. And then they were incentivizing hospitals at $15,000 a pop for the death reporting. So they were reporting every single death, a suicide. They gunshot wounds. Bro, they talked about this. They incentivized the hospitals to report these people at, bro, the PCR test. Yeah, the PCR test that was, that was, we had an expert on the PCR test. Come on the show and explain how it works. And they, the way they do it is they sent, they set the sensitivity up to the maximum level. So that even if you don't have it, it still is going to give you a positive reading on it. So that inflated the case. Oh, but you're just asymptomatic. That's what it is. Dude, dude, dude. So why do they do it? Is there more? No, no. Okay, so why do they, why do you think they did it? I think like as far as the whole everything, what was their intention of doing it? Depopulation. Okay, but why? I mean, now know what I know, it was because they like, there's going to be a lot of people that are not going to be needed. That's what I think too. That's what I think too. Yeah, I think that too. I didn't see it like four years ago. I think they had it. I think AI has existed for many, many years. And I think just like what they did with Lifelock and Facebook, where they took it from the government and then released it in public, I believe the AI has existed for a long time. Yeah. And I believe that they let it come out. I think it was the end of 22. And I believe now it's progressing so fast that it is literally going to take most people's careers away. And they don't know what to do with those people. Yeah. And so I think this was a twofold, I think this was a twofold strategy, bro, which is why they were finding people like me or trying to find people like me if I didn't make my employees get it. Well, here's the thing, but hold on, there's more to this. So they lied and said that humans are polluting the earth and ruining this and that and this to make people think that that was like the thing. That's not the thing. The thing is they don't need you. They don't need you. What do they do with you? There's no way to put you on a universal basic income. They can try, but it won't work. Can I go over the last one? Right. So that's one thing, bro. Dude, it's weird. When you look at the, like, who are the people that would be losing jobs? They say, yeah. Isn't it crazy that those are also the same demographic of people who should be taking this vaccine or would be taking the vaccine? But that's why they said they're supposed to be fucking dead, bro. That's what I just said. It's crazy. No, that's what I said. That's why they leverage people like me who employ people to force them to get it. Fuck. Dude, I, listen, what's Bill Gates' primary, and by the way, this is speculation. This is my personal opinion. What's Bill Gates' primary business? Technology. Bring that all along. That's where he started. You see what I'm saying? Oh, yeah. That's how, dude, that's how it, in my mind, that's how it comes together. Yeah, and I think what happened, what ended up happening, well, I mean, here's a scary thought, right? And this could be, this could also be why people who, we think would have stood up for it, didn't. Bro, I mean, here's a scary thought, right? Because, and this just further leads back to the theory here, like there wasn't many people that took it. Well, AI's still here. So again, you know, Universal Basic Income ain't gonna work. So what's the plan? What's the plan now? I think we've all seen, I don't know, Bill. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, I do. I don't, I don't. Gergialoans, man. I, you know, I mean, look, man, I, listen, this is speculative show. Yep, comedy. Yep. Uh-huh. Yeah. With the New York Hills all. Yeah. But like, dude, it certainly appears to me that, listen, I don't know, I don't know everything, obviously. But I have, I feel like a pretty good ability to connect dots. And what makes sense to me is what I just said. They, they had AI. They needed to, they wanted to let AI out because it would benefit the people at the top. And they didn't know what to do with the peasants. So they pushed this out to shorten the lifespan of the peasants so that they could be replaced by literal fucking robots, which allows the earth to belong to the elite, the complete earth. Okay, we don't have to, you know, like, these guys aren't gonna have to like, uh, you know, deal with the issues of poor people and run down cities and all this shit. You see what I'm saying? And by the way, when I'm thinking about it now, it almost starts to make sense why they're letting shit get so crazy because that way when, whenever something happens to all those people, some of the people, instead of saying, oh, that's wrong, they're gonna say, well, fuck, I didn't like those people anyway. I didn't like what they were doing. They're making my shit fucked up. You see what I'm saying? Like, I mean, with the India palace, I mean, it's very, it's very, it's, it's just, nobody jumped on that nobody talked about, it's just bad. Nobody said shit. That'd happen. It's very, uh, it's very disturbing to think about. And I don't think I'm that off base. I mean, maybe I am, maybe I'm, maybe I'm, maybe I'm, maybe I do too. Maybe my brain is just fried. But, uh, you know, I don't know, the evidence of the world doesn't seem like I'm fucking stupid. I'm just saying, if I'm stupid, like, I don't know, I must be making all the right stupid decisions. You know what I'm saying? So, like, I don't know, man, like, I don't, I'm not in these circles. I don't fuck with these dudes. They're not my friends. I don't know them. I don't know how they think. I don't, I don't know what they're thinking. But from the outside looking in, it doesn't make sense. And it was, they prioritize the vaccination to the poorest people. Oh, it was free to them. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, bro, you can incentivize an intelligent person with a fucking hamburger to, to take a shot. You see what I'm saying? Uh, they tried me, bro. Yeah, I know. And if you didn't work on you, bro, come on, it's fucking working. Yeah, I'm saying I gotta be a, gotta be a good burger. I was, I was, but like, dude, for real, man, like, it's just a, it's a scary, like, do we have some very evil people? And remember who orchestrated this? It was the globalist. It was Klaus Schwab. It was his little crew. It was these elite people. And, dude, you, your theory could be right, bro, because like, you know, now all of a sudden, Klaus Schwab's out. Now all of a sudden, these people seem to be falling apart. It almost feels like their plan didn't work the way they wanted it to. I don't think it did, bro. And, dude, you know, like, I hope the Trump administration, dude, look, this is crimes against humanity. It's the worst crimes against humanity. It's ever been committed in the history of earth, ever. It's bigger than any genocide period. These people deserve to fucking hang. Real, real talk. Like, the people who orchestrated this should be sought out, had a military tribunal and dealt with. I mean, I mean, I'm a, I want to see it, bro. There's some deep shit, man. Yeah. Guys, dude, you think Fauci's going to do all that shit to animals, do that shit that he did with AIDS? Like, do all these, remember those kids that he killed up in New York? Yeah. Like, this is an evil dude. This is not a good dude. He's not doing this for the, like, they're leveraging the good heart that most people have against them, against them. Like, Fauci's an evil person who's in a position of power who has played mad scientists with people and animals his whole life. You know what the number one trait of a serial killer is? It's, it's violence towards animals. Yeah, bro, bad. Like, this dude is a, this guy is a bad dude. And like, people, people, people have a hard time reconciling that. Like, yeah, just because you wouldn't do it doesn't mean that they won't. And that doesn't mean you should lay down and take it. You know, we, we got to find the backbones, bro. You know what I'm saying? I'm with you, bro. Yeah. I'm with you. Guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know down in the commentary what you guys think, man. Now, that being said, let's get to our final segment. Yeah, show us always guys. We have thumbs up or dumb as fuck. This we're bringing ahead. My name is talk about it gets one of those two options. You like historical things? Yeah. Would you like to own some historical things? I do. Okay. I think we need to clarify what type of historical things. Well, yeah. Okay. What kind of historical things do you have? Yeah. They're free. Maybe they're free now. Didn't check the fuck out. Yeah, man. Historical things, right? Like I've gotten you some historical gifts and artifacts. Yeah. Some stuff. Yeah. I got you some stuff. Yeah, bro. DJ got me a coin that's, it's from 900 years BC. During the reigns of Sulla. Yeah. I have it in my office. Yeah, it's sick. Yeah, cool shit. Like it's cool, right? There's there's a So with that in mind, all right, Abraham Lincoln's blood stained gloves from the night of his assassination or among 144 artifacts on auction. Damn. I think I don't I don't think I would want them. I bet they're expensive. Oh, yeah, they're very expensive. I bet they're in the seven figures. Oh, they are in the seven figures. They are. Yeah. But I don't I don't think I would want them. Like if I could, I don't think I would want that. I don't think that like to me, that's like a bad old man. That's what I'm saying. Like I don't want that shit, you know. Treasure artifacts associated with President Lincoln were on the auction block Wednesday, separated from a collection that was intended to be available for public display forever, but wound up in the middle of an interagency feud amid a lingering $8 million debt. The blood stained leather gloves that were in Lincoln's pocket. The night he was assassinated were among the 144 items up for bid, 136 of which sold the auction. They were auctioned off to pay off the remainder of a two decade old loan that the Lincoln presidential foundation used to buy a one-of-a-kind cluster of Lincoln artifacts from a California collector. The auction of Freeman-Hinman's in Chicago raised $7.9 million, but that includes buyers premiums of roughly 28%. Tackle it on each sale to cover the auction houses administrative costs. The gloves were the top-selling item, bringing in $1.52 million, including the premium. One of two handkerchiefs Lincoln had with him on April 14th, 1865, the night he was shot, went for $826,000. There was also a wanted poster featuring photos of three suspects in the assassination conspiracy led by John Wilkes Booth. Those sold for $762,000 far higher than the top estimated price of 120. It's wild. That's what that stuff costs, bro. Those artifacts, the real thing is they're expensive. Yeah, so we got some pictures here. There they are. These are Abraham Lincoln's gloves. Still have blood on them. And he had these in his pocket the night he was shot, man. That's fucking crazy. To me, I don't feel like something like this should even be allowed to be sold. Why? You know what I'm saying? Well, because I feel like it should belong to the people. Like let boo people, like the Americans. Yeah, like it should be in Spence only. Yeah, put in the fucking city. That's something. A lot of these things are bought out of museums, dude. That flag up there is bought out of museums. It's true. I got a flag in my office here that is blood stain. From the Civil War. Yeah. I mean, it was not cheap. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Uh, but I mean, dude. Like when I go up there and look at it and I see like blood on it from dudes who fought the Civil War, it makes you feel a certain way. Yeah. Especially when you're having a hard day. Uh, for sure. Yeah, when you go up there and you're like, look at it, you're like, well, these were just tough bad ass motherfuckers. Think about the problems you got growing like. I can handle this. Yeah. You know, like. Yeah, fuck me. I mean, like, but the gloves with his fucking blood on it, like to me, I don't know. Like we lose blood on that flag. Yeah. So what's the difference? I don't know. I just feel like this is a different level, man. Like this, it'd be like owning like JFK's fucking uh, Lincoln. What's I think somebody? I think it's in the Smithsonian. Yeah, like I guess in the like, I guess what I'm saying? Like that's where it should be at though. You know what I'm saying? I want to see somebody rolling around and JFK's fucking Lincoln. You know what I'm saying? Like, you don't do that. You don't do that. I mean, yeah, I mean, I, they've, yeah, but like dude, shit that's in the museum. All has a price usually. Like art. Yeah, sure. You know, most of the art and the, the things that alone in it. Yeah, people own them. Yeah. It's crazy. You know, sometimes like when the people die, they might leave the entire estate or collection to a museum. But a lot of stuff is people own them. So yeah, man, I mean, I'll be real. Like I, I thought it would be more expensive than that. Really? One point five. Yeah. I thought it would be like eight or nine million bucks. Really? Yeah. Would you have been it on this? No. No. I mean, look, I got my limits. It's not, yeah, not for over a million bucks. Yeah, that's real. You know, that's real. I mean, I'm a car guy, bro. More than anything. You know, I got a little budget for my, not a little budget, but I got a budget for my, for my fun stuff and my fun stuff goes to cars. Yeah. It's crazy, man. All right. Well, what we got on this? I mean, it's cool, but I mean, you know, I think it stumps up. Yeah. You know, I, I feel like the guy got a deal. Whoever bought it. Yeah. That's fucking crazy. I mean, that, you know, that's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy, man. All right. Well, thumbs up on that, man. Guys, Andy, that is all I have. I got real question that we're for you in the show. No, now I get your bike back. That's what I wanted. How'd you know? What the fuck are you guys? I said, all right. Don't be a hoe. Share the show. Yeah.
