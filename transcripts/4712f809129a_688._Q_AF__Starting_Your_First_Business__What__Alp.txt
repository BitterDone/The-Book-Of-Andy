we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus where someone who's completed the 75 hard program which is the initial phase of the live hard program they come in they talk about how their life was messed up before how they got it corrected using the 75 hard program and how you can do the same if you're unfamiliar with live hard and 75 hard program you get the program for free an episode 208 it is the world's most popular mental transformation program in history and it's free and you can get a book there's a book on my website called the book on mental toughness it's not required but if you're somebody who likes to know the ins and outs and the ups and downs and all the details I'd recommend the resource it gives you the entire live hard program plus 10 chapters on mental toughness why it's important why you need to cultivate it and how it can change your life there's also case studies on some very famous people who you will recognize who talk about how they use mental toughness to become the people that you recognize all right now guys we have a fee for the show the fee is not monetary although we do appreciate when you support my companies you support what we got going on that

going on not the much man yeah yeah you know just doing the thing what's the thing today I actually wasn't what much today no thing then no no no thing just we're doing this thing yeah yeah we're doing okay what's going on with you man anything new now man what's cracking what's what's crack a lacking I was gonna say something else but we can't say what we got saved for CTI okay that means that means it was likely racist probably maybe yeah no man everything's good dude just you know like we talked about with the Michael Chandler episode I'm going hard trying to get my body finally back from this injury that I've had and everything's going good I'm definitely on track and I feel good and just just everything's firing man dude how about just such a good genuine good like just good dude yeah he's awesome dude I really I was like I mean I like chat chat rights always me I think he's always gonna hold that number one spot for me man but like fuck man my Michael Chandler made it made it hard yeah dude you know what's cool about that too is like like we talked about on the podcast you know he comes he has built this it's not this thing that he was naturally gifted at you know like he talked about he wrestled 103 in high school right he was 411 and he's built this you know like he said brick by boring brick and I think that's an amazing story and I think it's a testament to what you can accomplish if you're willing to what we call here master the mundane right most people lack the ability to master the mundane tasks they get bored very easily they don't feel like doing things they don't understand that to build a life it is mundane it is the same things day in and day out operating at a high level holding a high standard executing with discipline and most people just can't do that because they don't have the endurance to do that they don't have the afford to do that they don't have the perseverance to do that which is why it's important for you to build yourself into someone who does that way you can follow the path to success because there is only one path and the only path there is is day by day by day by day over the course of a period of time so and depending on how big your goals are that could be two years it could be five years it could be 10 years it could be 30 years we don't know but at the end of the day it's all built the same it's one day at a time one win at a time for life yeah and there is no opportunity if you're gonna operate at a high level to deviate from that really at any time yeah I think the coolest thing too man it's like you know it's what you talk about it's the there there is an equation for success yeah it's very very simple it's time or it's it's inputs right but but plus the time variable yeah like and I think the most the coolest thing is like being able to see people and talk to people who who have practiced and actually put in that fucking equation right you look at a guy like Mike Chandler because he got in the UFC in what's who that 2020 right and four years later here he is fighting the fucking biggest fighter of the fucking sport you could possibly think of right and it's like that wasn't luck that wasn't you know anything other than the inputs that he put in plus the time right 2021 it's three years yeah three years yeah and he's just beating people's asses you know what I'm saying like like to me I think that's the coolest thing about that dude man it's like it's like that there's a real world there's real evidence right there like it works it works man I thought that was just man it's crazy to think about yeah man any it's just you know I feel like after doing this all these years you know people get used to me saying the same things over and over and over but that's because there's only so many things right but to have someone who's also done something you know built it from the ground up anytime we can bring someone on you know like James Lawrence or you know Michael Chandler or M.I. let like these guys they confirm what we're talking about and it's it's frustrating to look out into the internet world and see all these people trying to shortcut it trying to hack it trying to you know supersonic speed their way to success when literally every person they look up to is telling them the same way and dude it's just indicative of people's impatience and need for instant gratification that they continue to search for some sort of shortcut do you not think that Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant or any of these people that you look up to in business or life do you not think that if there was another way they would have found it right like there is only one way these are smart hardworking bad-ass mother fuckers bro and I'm telling you right now there is only one way and it's day by day by mother fucking day over the course of your life you don't get to do it for five years and then never do it again like that's the fallacy right I'm gonna retire at 40 I'm gonna sit on a beach no you're not because you don't have the right mentality to get there in the first place if that's what you're doing it for you're never gonna get to that point you know oh I'm gonna I'm gonna at 35 I'm never gonna have to work again yeah okay let's see that show me that show me that person right that the person doesn't exist because the people who actually build things it's in their fucking blood these are builders these are creators these are contributors these are people that have to have a mission and have to have a purpose and that purpose is to build and create and contribute into things that materialize and if you are trying to materialize this life against those kinds of people when your whole goal is to get to 35 years old and sit on a fucking beach with a corona you're gonna lose okay because these motherfuckers are doing it because they love it they're doing it because they're competitive they're doing it because they want to change the world you're doing it so you can have a couple corona is a fucking Riviera Maya it's a different kind of want and and skill set and do people just don't understand the competitive landscape there's you know people talk about abundance right abundance mentality yeah there is abundance mentality but the abundance is shared amongst the most competitive most skilled most disciplined people it is not shared with people who do not possess those traits and skill sets so yes there's plenty of abundance for hardworking discipline high skill high drive high work ethic people plenty of abundance that abundance does not spread to you if you're not doing any of those things and that's what people think and while I'm on it I want to say something else you know I look all over the internet and I see all these people writing about their journaling and their cold plunges and they're fucking touching the grass and they're getting in nature and that fucking therapy and all this shit and you know what the problem is with most of you motherfuckers it's that you don't have a purpose you don't have a mission and it doesn't matter how much therapy you go to it doesn't matter how many cold plunges you do it doesn't matter how much you spend grounding it doesn't matter how many months you spend in the van it doesn't matter any of the shit but how many journal pages you wrote it's never gonna make you feel good if you're leaving it on the table if you're not exercising your potential if you don't have a purpose you don't have a mission the reason you feel like shit is because you know that you're letting your potential die on the vine you're letting your potential go to waste and that is an underlying condition that's causing you this anxiety causing you the stress causing you this uncomfortable place that you're trying to fix with all this modern day and by the way the shit might work okay it might help it might make you feel a little bit better but the reality is you need to solve the underlying problem when the underlying problem is you're not exercising your potential and for that reason you fucking feel like shit that's it so you know maybe maybe instead of journaling some more and co plunge some more and touching the grass some more and fucking whatever the fuck else you guys do maybe you should get the fucking work and maybe you should try to build something great and maybe you should try to do something that fucking matters and you won't feel like shit all the time what love it it's the truth I'm so sick of seeing it dude I'm not against any of that shit I'm not against it but so many people are out here trying to optimize and what are you trying to optimize you don't do anything so what's what's five times zero zero okay so if you go out and you do five self-care things and then you're leaving your potential on the on the table as a zero that means you're gonna zero yeah there's no multiply yes yeah like fuck bro we're here to create we're here to live we're here to build we're here to contribute that can look a lot of different ways for a lot of different people it doesn't mean build a business it doesn't mean it means doing your fucking best and leaving none of your potential on the table and dude if you don't do that guess what you're gonna feel like shit it's just reality true shit man that's real on the out of that but like next time just make sure you give me a heads up and doing the math math questions why you know that should get me sometimes yeah well everything times zero zero that's true yeah I thought about that quick on my fuck yeah alright yeah sweet man well I got some good ones for you man let's keep this heat moving guys Andy question number one hey Andy just wanted to say I love your content I came across your stuff on Facebook and TikTok to start listening to your podcast my question for you is I want to start a business in my trade I've been a machinist for the last 15 years and I want to open my own shop how does a person like me that is barely scrapping by do that I've heard many times in this trade that you have to have money to make money I feel that's a bunch of bullshit but I could be wrong I don't know jack shit about opening a business and only have a little knowledge on how to run it properly I thought a few times about just running something small out of my garage and then eventually working my way up the ladder what are your thoughts on this first time getting going very simple one bring your lifestyle way down okay whenever your lifestyle is if you're serious about starting a business and you're serious about building a business sell your fucking house sell your fucking nice car sell all your luxuries and downsize into something that you can tolerate not that's something that is ideal okay that's number one two work to save as much money as you can all that money you're paying over here work to fucking builds of capital three you're on the right track start out small start in your garage a lot of people go out and they try to borrow money or they try to have this nice shop with their name on the door and their business that ain't business bro that's called play in business business is actually doing work and trading a good or a service or information for people's money okay it doesn't matter how nice your office is it doesn't matter how cool your business card is and a lot of people get caught up in that shit they think that's what matters it doesn't fucking matter at all it's a zero factor okay you need to do good work and you need to you need to exceed customers expectations and allow the word of mouth of your service of your good of your product to spread all right so those are the three first steps after you start the cash flow after you start to make more money from doing this small in your garage which you've already figured out then you're going to start to make investments you're gonna continue to save money you're gonna you're gonna continue to take the money that you make and you're gonna invest it into more equipment you're gonna invest it into more resources to to produce more goods you're gonna invest it in all the things that make a business run this is totally doable lots of people do this but most people do not have the dedication to actually execute it because they refuse to make the cuts in their lifestyle so they would rather live a slightly above mediocre lifestyle and not have a business then they were are to take a step back humble themselves maybe look a little silly to their friends and family and just start the business but you're gonna get the last laugh because in 10 years you're gonna have a machine shop that's doing that's kicking ass that's do it by the way you're gonna be doing what you want you're gonna you're gonna be building things you're gonna be creating things I imagine you like to work with your hands so this is this is how you do these things you take a step backwards and by the way you might not be able to sell your house but my point is downsize your life downsize your financial commitments take that money invest it into what you're doing as you make more money continue to live as small as you can for as long as you can as long as you can okay don't be the fucking internet dumbass who goes out and tries to buy a fucking Lamborghini after two years so he could show off on the internet okay be the guy who like me lives well below his means for the first 10 years in business okay does everything at the lowest possible denominator of cost all right which will allow you to scale your business a lot of people when they hear my story and I talk about how the first seven or the first three years we may know money the next seven years we made six hundred ninety five dollars a month for a grand total of fifty eight thousand dollars for ten years right combined they hear that and they say holy shit dude how did you endure that how did you get because man I wanted to scale and I didn't have any financial resources and now here we are a company that does hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars and sales and we don't have any debt you know why we don't have any debt because I learned to operate on our own cash flow long ago and the way that we got to this was we were able to when we started making money see people here oh ten years but what they don't realize is that like six years in we were making money and we just kept all that money in the business and continue to live below our means over the course of the next four years right until we got to be a little bit older we were making quite a bit more money and then we started you know doing some things and then we started doing really well you know our lifestyle increased and you'll know when that point is but the point is you should be go this is how you know these these entrepreneurs on the internet are fucking dumb asses because they started business and the next thing you know you see them driving a Lamborghini year s SUV which is the biggest fucking poser car in the fucking planet if you have one you should fucking sell it because you look like a fucking clown okay so the reality is they go out and buy this shit so they can pretend to be successful and they're cutting their fucking nose off despite their face they want people to think they're successful but their business isn't actually growing at the rate that it should be and they think that fake it till you make it means look the part of success and so people believe that had fake it till you make it doesn't have anything to do with other people it has to do with this pretend you're already that successful person and then emulate their behaviors how does the hundred million or how does the billionaire live their life for real how do they do it what do they do what's their systems of operation how do they run their life so you how do they treat people how you fake that right that's not you you behave that way and then it becomes you that's what people don't get when you want to change your life bro you can change it today you can become a different person today by changing your behaviors today now the results of those behavioral changes take time to materialize in reality for everybody to recognize but as long as you're not behaving like that fat piece of shit from fucking the last six years you're a different motherfucker today you see what I'm saying yeah so it's adopt the behavior not adopt the lifestyle and when we talk about fake it till you make it so many people misunderstand what that means that doesn't mean what people think it means and sell your fucking yours holy shit wasn't it what was it apple or Microsoft that also started in the garage wasn't it apple what what's the company's dead bro lots of company and I think people just like they will hear that or they see that they don't understand like that's what the real sacrifice looks like that's what real success first form started my garage yeah started my garage I used to drive so we had a deal with a manufacturer to consult and then when we consulted with them then they started to that deal fell through we have made an agreement for them to make product they allowed us to make small little runs I used to pick it up with Scott Halsey in the back of our fucking pickup trucks we didn't have a warehouse all we had was the we had like 10 or 11 stores at the time and we'd we'd go put it in my garage and then as the stores needed we would distribute it through from I would distribute it Scott would distribute it he would take half the stores I would take half the stores we'd put the shit in the back of the pickup truck we drive it to the stores as needed right and when we started doing that bro each store we need like two cases which is fucking six six bottles of protein so it's 12 right yeah so the a lot of people start like this and and dude it's just it's a very simple equation downgrade your lifestyle increase your available cash make the investments that you need to make to start small do a great job make a great product over serve the customer to the point where they're talking about it and they're spreading the word and then scale up as you go and you make more money and that's how you do it and then live small for as long as you can I love it I love that man guys any question number two hey Andy and DJ I'm 23 years old and I am number nine of 12 kids in my family damn yeah that's a big family like a do it I'm also married to plant some fucking seeds yeah it's a farmer haha I'm also married to my perfect girl the whole time we dated in high school she liked me because I was sweet forgiving and patient I think growing up as number nine I was often overlooked and forgotten so I was never very confident and thus became sweet and easy to forgive because I was afraid to speak my mind that being said I've been listening to your podcast for a little over a year and I loved it instantly I've been trying to develop the fuck you mentality for the past six months or so looking back the last six months as I've been more assertive and stern and saying what I mean I've noticed myself being much more pissed off easily annoyed and honestly being a dick to everyone around me unfortunately that has unconsciously included my sweet wife who loved me and married me for being sweet loving and non-judgmental I took a deep look at myself this past Sunday and realized I really want to be that alpha guy who speaks his mind whenever I enter a room but I can't find the right way to do it without ruining relationships around me after realizing this I talk to my wife and she started crying saying that she has missed the real me and she still loves me but I'm not the same man she married and not in a good way so my question is how can I remain patient loving forgiving and kind while still speaking my mind in a stern manner I want to be that alpha guy let's still be gentle to my loved ones first of all congratulations on your wife and you sounds like you have a great family it sounds like you're a really good dude there's nothing wrong with that no like what's if it ain't broke don't fix it bro like and just because you have an idea of what alpha is alpha is not running around just because I have an aggressive disposition does not mean that you have to adopt that that's just who I am I'm that's my authentic self and by the way I think if you ask the people around me how I am most of the time most time pretty fucking nice but you got the biggest heart I've ever known yeah so like dude this it you have to retrain what you think alpha is there's a lot of fake alpha fucks on the internet who call them first of all if anybody calls themselves alpha they're not alpha okay second of all yeah true so you got to understand alpha is not about being a dick alpha is not about being mean it's not about saying curse words it's not about any of that dude alpha is about being a man standing up for what's right telling the truth protecting the people around you providing for the people around you and being kind and being caring and then having a having some boundaries when people step on your toes you might have to stop on somebody's throat okay so that part of it is little one percent of your life right and you have to you have to understand we're fed especially someone who feels like hey man I'm trying to figure this out right we're fed this idea of alpha male that is isn't real right alpha male is like my brother okay who treats his family really good who handles his business who takes care of everybody around him and yeah sometimes who fucking let you know when you're fucking up but isn't that real love isn't real kindness telling someone when they're stepping in the wrong hole or they're fucking their life up and being honest about it because being kind and loving doesn't mean letting people mess up their lives it means hey man this ain't cool that's not good it's holding a standard and so when you think of like what alpha means brother that doesn't mean you got to change your whole personality dude in fact it sounds like you got a great personality and it sounds like you got a great wife so you know let's let's keep in mind here what what true alpha is is being your authentic self man and then you know it sounds like what you're struggling with is that you don't have a boundary okay and so what you need to work on is in the only change you need to make here I wouldn't change my personality you don't have to be a dick you don't have to go out of your way to let people know you know that you're an alpha that's not what we're talking about what we're talking about is being prepared when someone steps on your toes what does that look like for you and I bet for your most of your life you kind of just say oh that's no big deal and you brush it off and I bet because you know it's wrong and it's violating your own integrity with yourself it's lowered yourself a steam and it's lowered your confidence and the reason you're struggling with confidence is because you know that there are things that happen to you that you are not okay with that you pretend to be okay with and you have to understand that is 100% okay to let people know when you are not okay with things that's just called communication and when you have a boundary and you do all the other stuff I talked about that's what makes you an alpha dude alpha is not one of these dude and it it it fucks me it fucks me up because I know a lot of you guys like you you hear me talk and you know I got a beard I got scars and I got tattoos and you like oh bro that's not that's that has nothing to do with it yeah that's not that's just handling my business you know I'm saying that's just being me and I'm an authentic human being and and dude I think being authentic and just you know having boundaries and being kind of being respectful having man or bro there's nothing more alpha than having manners you know what I'm saying and treating people right there's nothing more alpha than that so like dude look man I feel what you're saying but don't try to emulate someone else just identify the little problem that you have which it sounds like it's just boundaries start holding that boundary when necessary and even when you hold the boundary it doesn't mean you have to be an asshole now if they escalate it you can be but you don't have to be in fact some of the ways to enforce boundaries are very simple very calm very very very simple convert hey I don't like that man you're supposed to be my friend friends don't do that you see what I'm saying very easy yeah and that sticks with people a lot more than screaming at him you know no so bro it sounds like you're doing good man and it sounds like you're just reading too much into it and I think you I think your wife is right you know you need to pull back a little bit and just realize your problem is letting people do things that you don't agree with and then pretending like you agree with them that's what's hurting your confidence and if you just fix that little aspect of it you're gonna feel a lot better and you won't feel so guilty about the way that you're behaving yeah I think Jordan I love that man I think Jordan Peter Peterson also says something on this is like you know somebody asked me like oh you know being a man that means you have to be violent he's like no you have to be capable yeah that's right yeah that's all it is right and so like you're not have to walk around ready to fucking kill everybody no but you but you have to be capable of it yeah for sure yeah right and I think that's ultimately what it comes down to you man like that's a that's a big deal and there's so much like I see these reels and shit on Instagram of like you know bro oh my god fuck out of here like dude right let me get my man bun someone fucking you know grub a beard like come on man let's like I saw this one last night like I see this one all the time and it just irritates the shit out of me wanna make moves and silence real real bosses make moves and silence you realize that you're putting this on the internet right which makes it not silent yeah it's not silent at all and by the way if you were actually making moves the results would tell the story yeah but you're not making any moves you're just trying to tell people you're gonna make moves so you could feel good right now yeah when in reality what you need to do is let your results do the talking stop talking about all these moves you're not making and stop embarrassing yourself saying I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that I'm gonna make these moves you'll never see what's coming I got a little bro and never nothing ever happens you look like a fucking idiot okay so stop making yourself look like an idiot shut the fuck up and go build something and then come back and say all right I made some moves and silence yeah dude I get so tired of these young kids saying this dumb shit yeah you're fucking 20 years old you don't know shit about life you shouldn't be life coached anybody fucking 22 year old course fuckers I'm fucking I'm life coach you had to make moves the silence fuck up a fucking build something dude and what they don't understand is they're gonna ruin the reputation and then they're not gonna be able to build anything real but what the fuck do I know you know yeah I'm just a podcaster in a youtuber I love it man the guys Andy are third and final question question number 380 in the last fucking 22 years old dude will fucking make seven million dollars and fucking every week from my basement yeah fucking drive the Lamborghini yours moves in silence yeah doing all in silence fuck out of here so fucking sick of these fucking clowns dude I do it all in silence oh man all right guys Andy question number 3 80 80 in the last four years I've lost my dad my sister and cousin to suicide I'm no stranger to depression and I'm having struggles of my own I feel like depression might get me unless I find the strength to get back on track I have a wife four amazing kids and a high paying job and I still find myself in dark mental struggles from time to time my question is do you still have times of mental darkness even though you have amazing things in your life and how do you get yourself back on track when you're not in a good place mentally man this is a tough question answer because everybody's so different in what they struggle and how they struggle and what their internal dialogue is and while I believe that therapy has become very predatory I believe in certain cases there is a need to talk to someone and kind of work through what the root cause is with the understanding that you're not going to talk to them for fucking ever right okay if they start trying to get you there for the next seven years they're just milking you for money there's a lot of predatory shit about therapy all right they try to talk get you to talk about focus on your problem so hard that your problems actually just stay at the forefront of your mind which makes you more miserable than what you would actually be okay so there's that too stop focusing so hard on how bad you feel and start focusing on what your mission is in life what's your purpose what are you trying to build what are you trying to create who are you trying to become and when you take that focus off of all your problems and you start focusing on moving forward this turns the noise down on on how bad this seems to be okay when you look at a problem and you stare at a problem and you get obsessed with a problem and this is what a lot of these people do with the self care right they're trying to eliminate all problems from their life they call it optimization they're trying to eliminate all anxiety from their life let me tell you something and save you years and years and years and years because I went through this myself you cannot eliminate all the anxiety from your life anxiety serves a purpose in your life and that purpose is to remind you when something needs to be addressed that you're not addressing okay now can anxiety become overwhelming sure it can but guess what curious anxiety action towards the thing that you know needs to be done so my question to you would be what is it that you think needs to be done what is it that you are putting off what is it that you are afraid of what is it that you are thinking about doing that you're not doing what do you know you should be doing that you're not doing that's where you're going to find the answer of the direction that you need to go to move away from this place of constant focus and constant dwelling on your depression so that you could turn the volume down on that okay that's the first thing the second thing is bro there are medications for this and I think that I think that there is I think that these things are way over prescribed I think they're over prescribed by 95 percent but their situations where they're appropriate and you need to talk to someone who's got a reasonable mind who uses common sense to decide if that's an option for you and I don't like to recommend that you guys all know how I feel about those things but there's still a purpose for these things in some cases okay but my opinion on this with all that being said is that we live in this culture right now a victimhood we live in this culture where everywhere we turn and everywhere we look on the internet we see people talking about mental health we see people talking about their depression their anxiety their frustration their stress their negativity etc except bro when you surround yourself with that it's like swimming in a swimming pool full of negativity all right and when you look around and all you can see is people that are talking about how fucked up they are your natural reaction is to start looking at yourself and say well fuck what's fucked up about me right which is okay if you look at it and you say all right I could improve here I could get in a little better shape I could treat people a little nicer I could do more productive things I could read a little more I could do a better job at my career that's okay but when you start analyzing yourself so deep and looking for problems guess what's gonna happen you're gonna fucking find them because every single one of us has a past every single one of us has things that we regret every single one of us has situations that have happened to us every single one of us has things that bother us from our past and when we constantly dwell we constantly focus and we get obsessed with those things and we start telling ourselves this story well I can't feel good because this happened to me or I can't feel good because of that happened to me well that happened to you bro how the fuck can you change that guess what you can't so what you have to do is you have to come to terms with the reality of what has happened you have to give yourself some grace you have to forgive yourself you have to let yourself understand that thing that happened to me wow it wasn't ideal and it wasn't great and it was very painful and I might have handled it wrong I learned a lesson from it and by the way then after you learn your lesson you move forward and don't do the same shit again all right and if it's something to happen to you what did you learn there was something out of your control what did you learn I got stabbed in the fucking face bro my whole face is fucked up okay I got one here here all the way across here and in my back all right I could have lived my whole life saying fuck dude I got stabbed in the fucking face I can't do anything everybody looks at me weird you know to this day people come up to me they're like fuck dude what happened to you right it's been 20 years 21 years since it happened all right I've lived my most of my life with that in my life I would have been it would have been very easy for me to say that traumatic event happened to me but I couldn't do anything instead I said hey that traumatic event happened to me and because of that people remember me I'm memorable and I'm gonna leverage that into building a life that I want and hear the fuck I am okay so we have the power to change the perspective about the events that have happened to us and either use them for us or against us there's a famous story about a man who was an alcoholic and he had two sons one son grew up to be an alcoholic they asked him why are you an alcoholic and he said well that's what I learned because my dad was an alcoholic the other son never drank a drink in his whole life and they said how come you never drank and he said because my dad was an alcoholic okay and that's what we get to choose when hard things happen to us when they were out of our control now if it's you that did the hard thing you have to learn a lesson you have to forgive yourself and you have to move forward how do you forgive yourself it's very simple okay how would you talk to your friend if your best friend came to you and said hey DJ fuck man I fucking did this I did that I fucked this up what would you say to your friend you would say something like this bro come on dude like everybody fucks up yeah right yeah that's not good you shouldn't do that again but everybody has something like that dude the soul like just don't get into the fucking world yeah just don't do it again and move forward bro and that helps you get rid of the shame get rid of the guilt and get rid of the weight that you're carrying which causes all of this negative feeling right so and then on top of it dude you know you need to get yourself in the best mental shape possible you know so like doing something like live hard or 75 hard is a great idea for you because it's gonna get your mind right it's gonna get your body right it's gonna get you feeling great about yourself it's gonna build trust with yourself it's gonna build confidence grit fortitude self belief self-esteem the ability to endure and when you can follow through on the things that you set out to do when you say hey I'm gonna do this and then you can go do it without any hesitation bro you believe in yourself you trust yourself you start to love yourself and you say damn dude I'm a bad mother fucker okay and guess what happens to your confidence it goes up all right so yeah dude I do struggle with these things but I've also learned how to manage them and how to move through them and how to manage them and move through them is by getting everything else in order and by focusing on what my mission is what my purpose is executing against that and then making sure that I'm doing all the things that I know I need to do to move me forward and by the way if you're doing all those things and you're focused on your mission and you're focused on your health and you're focused on improving and you're focused on moving forward and you're focused on moving your body and all these things bro you don't got time to worry about your fucking past okay so uh yeah that's that's what I would say bro I think it's a normal thing that people struggle with I think it's way overblown and way over exaggerated because of the culture that we live in you know in the fucking 1990s bro nobody was talking about this no nobody came out and said you know oh I need a mental health day you know I'm saying like dude it's way it's way overblown and the reason that it's way overblown now has a lot to do with how society is in the 90s there was no internet so you know what people had to do they had to go fucking work okay or they starved now we have a situation where people can stay home they can scroll all day they can get a check from the government they can fuck and bro that removes their entire mission their entire purpose in life and just like I was talking earlier if you don't exercise or or or draw out the potential in yourself you are going to feel depressed you're going to feel anxious because you know in your heart that you are leaving everything that you could potentially do and potentially become on the table and that is going to bother you that is going to fucking make you feel depressed that is going to make you feel dark so what is it you're trying to do what is your mission what kind of shape are you in how do you eat how do you train what are you reading what's your environment like are you spending all this time scrolling are you spending time moving forward all right so those are the things that that you can do to manage it and by the way um you know I I think it's if we're getting down to to brass tax here I think it's as simple like and people are going to hate that I say this but I think it's as simple as this look around at all these soft mother fuckers crying about their lives and realize that you don't want to be one of them yeah you know what I'm saying when I look around at all these people crying about their fucking sad story when honestly they haven't had shit happened to them right you never hear the people who've had real shit complaining about their lives you've never had the burn victim complaining you never heard the physically deformed person complaining you never heard a guy who lost an arm or a leg complaining all you hear is a bunch of fucking pussies complaining about basic shit it's called life and when I look around and I see all that shit bro it just makes me not want to be like them so I'm like fuck that I'm not doing that I'm not a victim I'm not a bitch I'm not a pussy I'm gonna go fucking do this no matter how I feel and that fixes the problem for me no okay that's real shit man I love it yeah I fucking love it well guys 80 that was three yeah don't be a hoe sure the show bank road can't fold doesn't know here's shot case closed closed
