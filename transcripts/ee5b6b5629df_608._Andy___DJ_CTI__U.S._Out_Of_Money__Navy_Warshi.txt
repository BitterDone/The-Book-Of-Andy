rest of her life at a minimum yeah like dude no that's when you think of the ripple effect that she's actually created because of what she did she's created so much division so much animosity so much damage so many lives lost because of her wanting her own self to be president like it's it's it's I think she's the I think she is the worst person I think she's the worst American that I could currently name the worst and this isn't a Democrat Republican thing I don't fucking like the Republicans either this is just the truth not a woman she for for her own yeah glory she helped destroy country in a culture and she is a responsible for that yeah you know she's still talking about wanting to get in the race this year listen go ahead everybody hates you go ahead you lose again be

well cool thanks for playing wasn't that bad no but that bad had a few surprises in there that was all good yeah all right well guys it is C.T. I so let's get into these headlines let's start our crews remember if you wanted to see any of these articles pictures links videos go to Andy for seller.com you can find them there if you're watching on YouTube check down in the description below you can find that link there as well so without being said let's get into it headline number one headline number one reads White House warns Congress the U.S. is out of money nearly out of time to avoid kneecap to Ukraine now this is an interesting little story that just came out and I got some context for it but the Biden administration on Monday and that's today when the show is being recorded sent Congress an urgent warning about the need to approve tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to Ukraine saying Keves wore effort to defend itself from Russia's invasion may grind to a halt without it in a letter to House and Senate leaders and also released publicly Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young warned the U.S. will run out of funding to send weapons and assistance to Ukraine by the end of the year saying that would kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield she added that the U.S. already has run out of money that it has used to prop up Ukraine's economy and if quote if Ukraine's economy collapses that would not be able to keep fighting full stop quote we are out of money and nearly out of time she wrote now now so far to date there's been about 111 billion dollars has been sent to Ukraine Biden is seeking another 106 billion dollars wait wait wait wait wait wait so this whole time there's been 111 now they're trying to send another 106 correct yeah so so two date Congress has already allocated 111 billion dollars now this this new effort is actually going to be a wrapped up package with a nice little bow and it's supposed to include stuff for Israel and there's other needs that are not disclosing at this time but yeah 106 billion dollar a package that's been rejected by Congress multiple times it's still going so uh so yeah and then they've used allegedly about 97% of that money they stole that money a hundred percent so lensky has multiple millions tens of millions of dollars homes he has multiple yachts these people stole the money and now what they're trying to do is they're afraid that potentially they're not going to be in office a year from now so like fuck let's try to steal another hundred percent of cash in everything yeah dude let's see the bank records of these people no at the money yeah dude uh you know where's where's i'll say this i know who's not out of money Biden because uh also at the time of this recording just comes out we got the actual proof now it is uh verifiable without a shadow of a doubt absolute proof Biden absolutely got paid from Hunters firm uh all all of the evidence is out it's been disclosed today at the time of recording so if you guys have not yet seen that uh this headline reads Biden got recurring 1380 dollar payment from Hunters firm starting in 2018 so president Biden received a recurring payment of 1380 from his son Hunters law firm beginning in late 2018 shortly after a bank money laundering officer warned that the same account was receiving millions of dollars in Chinese government linked funds without quote any services rendered now a source told the new york post that at least three recurring payments were made on September 17th October 15th and November 15th of 2018 totaling a little bit over $4,100 quote today the house oversight committee is releasing subpoena bank records that show Hunter Biden's business entity a wasco pc made direct monthly payments to Joe Biden this wasn't a payment from Hunter Biden's personal account but an account force corporation that received payments from China and other shady corners of the world uh that's James Comer um the committee chair quote at this moment hunter Biden is under an investigation by the department of justice for using a wasco pc for tax evasion and other serious crimes and based on whistleblower testimony we know the justice department made a concerted effort to prevent investigators from asking questions about Joe Biden I wonder why now nobody wants to talk about it none of the mainstream media is talking about it but again I've seen the documents the proof is out there um but you search it none of the mainstream media left left leading news agencies are covering it right now um and that's at this time um but we know we have the whatsapp messages do you remember back when um it came out that you know they asked Biden about being in the room and hunter was making that call with China right here's the video from that conversation um there's this testimony now where one of your sons from our business associates is claiming that you run speaker phone a lot with them talking business is that what we ever talked business and I know you'd have a lot of these questions well what do you it's why is that allowed to question because it's not true thank you mr. President even though it's now allowed to ask him questions that aren't true that actually are true I mean this is the direct text message from hunter Biden to Z uh in China please have the director call me not James or Tony or Jim have him call me tonight I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled um you know or the time when he was asked about all of the uh the payments that were sent to all of his members of the family over a million dollars into direct payments any ration to house yield is memo about your family dealing sir any ration to house yield is new memo about your family dealing sir yes you're um revealing that um hunter Biden's business associate sent over a million dollars to three of your family members and he responds to that report yeah even though it is true we've got all the bank statements approve it anybody got on this well this is just a tip I mean this is just the beginning of what's been going on you know it's it's very obvious to anyone who's been paying attention and I realized that a lot of people haven't been paying attention but when you look at the situation of our country and you look at you know all the things that have happened since this man has has took office and you don't just blindly listen to what they say you know like inflation is not real and you know inflation is overhyped and inflation is not really a concern and then all of a sudden now it's inflation is your fault all right Biden op it by dynamics works then why is it eighty five dollars to go get some fucking snacks for your kid like my buddy Hayden posted today you know I was one of my good buddies on the internet it does very well for himself you know he's he doesn't go to the grocery store a lot okay that's but he goes and he's like holy shit this bag of snacks for my kids was eighty five dollars and you know you like we talked about last week you know you ask people about their current living situation and they're very honest about it they're like it sucks bro it's the worst it's ever been our money is going not it's not that it's not going as far it's not going anywhere right you know and uh this in my opinion from what I've seen in the evidence that I've seen and I think anybody who's been paying attention would would come to the same conclusion that when we look at you know what's happening at the border when we look at what's happening with crime in the cities when we look at the division in society when we look at the state of our economic you know our dollar when you look at you know our military equipment being sent to Europe and left there when you look at the money being sent to Ukraine when you look at all all of these things we could go on and on and on we keep going the reality is is those are intentional decisions and and it would be one thing that this man was coming out and making a good case for these intentional decisions but that's not actually what's happening what's happening is they're making these decisions and then they're sending out uh you know KGP onto the press secretary stage where they deflect and and they don't apologize they don't admit that they made any bad decisions they basically presented as if this very old senile man is just stupid and when you really like think about that it makes sense as to why they would have this guy in the position that he's in because he's so seen aisle and he's so stupid that he can do all of these things and we all know that he's not calling the shots we all know that this man is not in charge and who is most people believe Barack Obama's in charge all right and Barack Obama's been seen in clips saying you know hey uh would I ever run again no but like if I could be in the basement and have an earpiece I would do that well that's what he's doing and when we look at the situation of what's happening um and you look at how they how they take how they deflect accountability for this situation kind of blame it on him being a little bit stupid or senile it makes sense what they're doing to me which is this guy's an actual traitor he's actually compromised he's actually been paid to make these decisions on purpose they're intentionally destroying America to get it into the globalist category so they could create a one-world government like the w e f talks about all day long and have written books about and most people you know are starting to kind of understand what's happening there we've been talking about it for years here and other people have been talking about it for decades like Alex Jones who gets made fun of all the time right um the reality is is he's intentionally destroying the country and they're doing so for economic benefit and as we had Tim Parlatory on here last week that's that is by definition a traitor and that's what we're dealing with we have a number of people inside of our government who have been compromised for financial gain for themselves and are making intentional decisions that are not in the interest of the American people at all all right they look at the people like we've said a million times on the show as slaves and the little slaves go to work and we get to tax them on half of their stuff they think half but actually we know because we understand the scheme that it's much more than half because most people focus on income tax but they don't talk about you know sales tax or tax to own shit tax to tax to you know put gas in your car by grocery like we don't talk about any of these things property tax like and then when you die they hit you with a death tax which takes seven or 65% of your entire wealth generation over the course of your life so if they're taxing you while you're alive I don't know that yeah listen when they if they tax you while you're alive and if you add up your income tax plus all the other taxes you pay that tax is going to be greater than 50% for every income class in the country okay understand that so first of all you work for the government all of us we work for the United States government more than we work for ourselves then when we accumulate wealth out of this very oppressive system and we we actually manage to somehow scrape our way out of it and start making some money what happens we live our lives and then we die and when we die they hit you with a death death tax that takes 65% of your personal wealth which means you are actually the minority business partner in the business of being you you are partners with the United States government and you are the fucking minority shareholder so people people do not understand how what is the death like what is that money go they take it and they send it over to Ukraine or put it in their pocket or send it to Ukraine have a kick back to them I mean bro it's it's these people this is fucking not free we're not free it's it's real shit we are not free people and we are told we are free but we are not free and if we were free and let's say we did agree that a certain tax percentage was owed like what they say in the bible 10% okay we could shrink the size of the government and actually make it so it serves the people not profits from the people and now we have a situation where everybody's contributing what America is supposed to be everybody contributes the government exists to serve nobody's getting rich in the government and we have a scenario where everybody else would be free to accumulate think how much more wealth you could accumulate if you didn't have to pay these taxes if you only had 10% tax all in meaning your income and all the other shit you pay what would the what would the world look like here it would look completely different because every single human being would be able to accumulate more and more and more wealth and they convinced poor people that this is a stupid idea because they convince them that people like me who have worked their whole lives and built something are somehow the enemy and we'll just take the money and put it in their pocket but they don't understand how business works if that's truly true and you think I'm a greedy fuck well then if you didn't tax me I would spend the money on growing the business and what's required for me to grow the business oh careers you see what I'm saying right so like the logic that they put on people to make them believe that tax the rich is a good thing is absurd and it prays on people's uh financial literacy all right so when we talk about you know who the rich people are the richest people don't pay any tax they're not paying and if they paid 10% everybody else wouldn't have to pay 50 60 70% all in they wouldn't have to do that okay so if everybody gave 10% every single human being in the country no matter who you are and then you made it so the people only the people who had a job and paid the 10% could vote we'd have a much different looking country we have a country full of well why don't they want citizens wealthy because they're hard to control this is long the idea of a free America went by by a long time ago and it's now replaced with this idea where they sell you the idea that you're free but in reality we exist to fund them and that's why so many fucking criminal people go there because they go there to get rich you shouldn't be able to get rich in the United States you shouldn't be able to go in there worth x and then come out 100 times x that's not that's not what this is it's supposed to be service it's supposed to be just like a soldier who serves this country well you know for some people they didn't serve their country but like for me right like let's say I went out and built a great business eventually I would start looking at service which would be serving as a senator serving as a congressperson or serving in my state government or serving serving so it's service it's not a scheme to get rich and it's now a scheme to get rich this is what we're served what we're told we have and what we actually have are completely two different things and people don't understand that because people will just go oh well yeah what are we gonna do well it's real easy like it's real easy everybody starts demanding that shit changes and shit will change but just thinking like you know and then look how they try to intimidate you with the IRS you know what I'm saying like do I just saw something they're increasing the tax penalties if you if you underpay well I mean dude look make it way harder they make it so that if you start making a whole bunch of money they come after you anyway like this is about slavery through financial restriction if look okay look at you I must look what he's doing would he be able to do that if he had gotten if he hadn't have gotten that rich no what if what if what if a thousand other people had gotten that rich because they had the financial if you understood what it took to actually turn a profit in a business like most people don't they just say oh they're raising their prices they're gouging the prices if you actually understood what it takes to get to get through the fucking United States tax code and make money you would you would be a Paul it's disgusting like you get taxed at multiple different levels throughout the process like you guys think that if you buy if I buy this and I get a hundred dollars and I make this widget and I sell it and it cost me fifty dollars and I sold it for a hundred you think I just made fifty dollars it's not what the fuck I made I get taxed on that fucking fifty dollars by fifty percent so I actually only made twenty five dollars so how the fuck am I supposed to take that twenty five dollars and reinvest it into another widget that I just sold one and make another one it's very hard to do and it takes a long time this is why there's businesses are suffering and this is why people are frustrated and this is and they they instead of saying you know uh instead of people saying well fuck their taxing us too much or the tax like we threw a revolution over a three percent tax bro and over the course of the last two hundred and forty seven years we have gone from three percent to where now we're back to a situation that's even worse than what happened when the uh colonial Americans came and tried to break away from England like we pay more taxes than those motherfuckers ever did in their entire lives it's insanity and look what we give for it it'd be different if it'd be different if this whole country look like Dubai right and there was no crime and everything was beautiful and there was no litter and people got along I think people would be okay paying a higher tax but that's not where we get what do we get we get shit we get literal human feces in the street we get homeless problems we get crime problems we get fucking all we don't have shit we got shitty streets we got shitty buildings we got a shitty country because these motherfuckers are stealing all the money from us that's what's happening it's real it's real and people don't understand it because people are too busy trying to survive like bro if you're born into something like that it's just like the matrix like you're when you're born into it you don't know any better right so you're just like this is the way it is but like what what is happening in our country regarding the tax code of the citizens a lot of people like to say taxation is theft it's not theft it's actually extortion because if you don't pay what did I put you jail that's right so it's you fucking work for me give me most of your money and if you don't fuck you you're going to jail that's where we live does that sound free to you it's not free we're not free and then you don't really have any input on we're not free all of these political candidates the vague is the only one that said 10% tax the only one the only one Donald Trump's not saying that shit why not why aren't you staying at Donald Trump why aren't you saying hey you'll correct the tax code for our country to be normal why aren't you saying we'll downsize the government and fucking clean it out why aren't you saying that that's what we need that's the here's the other thing need to abolish hold on here's the other thing fuck this it's that's the first thing that here's the other thing okay let me ask you this all right what happens when these big companies getting big trouble like in 2008 or 2020 what does the government do in response they create bailouts right okay so they print more money and prop these companies up now what would the other alternative be what would the other alternative other than printing money be it would be to wipe the fucking debt clean okay so you have these bank institutions that are so powerful and have been around so long and they and we owe them the citizens of this country and the country the government of this country owe them trillions of dollars okay when are they going to take the hit for once because every time they print the money it just puts us further in debt where are we gonna say hey no fuck you your fucking debt is wiped out you could start over will still work on the same system or a similar system with lower taxes and make them take the hit for once when is that gonna happen why is no one talking about that oh that's because they'll figure out a way to get fucking unalived because they say it like do we live in the biggest fucking scam that's ever existed you think Bernie made off was a scammer bro our fucking government our banking system is the biggest fucking scammers ever in the history of mankind and people don't just shit about it and these people are a thousand years old fuck them dude no I'm being serious fuck them yeah fuck them it's time to say it dude it's time to be done with it these people should be fuck the the real president will come in and look at them and be like nobody owes you shit you got fucking trillions of dollars you're the richest people on the planet fuck you everybody else your debt is gone all these institutions and these loans they're starting at zero and it would collapse shit but it would put people in a position of power to start over again as opposed to collapsing shit and everybody being fucked yeah they deserve to be fucked for once I'm with that man guys tells what you guys think on this topic no one talks about that why is Donald Trump not saying hey we're gonna do that why not why not because that's what fuck is needed to actually fix the country yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments below hashtag come on man let's know what you guys think dude think about how think about how much the country what we think about how instantly the country would be in a completely different place if all the major credit cards and all the major loan institutions and all the major banks had to forgive the debt that they've put out look imagine what that would do they've never had to do that they've never said hey we got to take the hit this time they always put it more on us print more money print more money print more money print more money which fucks us and we don't have anybody and bro these people understand this these fucking these government presidents and congressman the senators understand that you know why they don't say shit because they're all on the fucking take bro all of them because it's a logical solution that could happen instantly if you got the right mother fucker in office but they but these people are in control of three letter agencies and what do they do people like this silence they fucking unalive them dude we got we got a we our government the way it's set up right now the the the the the the talons of corruption are so fucking deep inside of it and we take it's gonna take a total it's gonna take a total a total restructuring for it to work that should be wiped period we actually live in an opportunity right now where this could all be corrected it's first time in history where this could all be corrected if people demanded it but people people are so financially illiterate they won't say shit or they're scared you're intimidated say it you know what I'm saying they're already taking all your money man with the fucking scared of what you got to lose guys that was our first headline at this time to cruise some comments got a good one for you man this is the OG post right here and uh yeah those cruise

supposed to do be smart enough to figure out what the actions of a winner look like and execute on those for one day you have exactly what's required to win at the highest level you could ever possibly win at because all you have to do is look at it like the day is over and I'm starting over tomorrow and today I have a score of zero in the second day and at the end of the day I want to score a hundred okay and if you score a hundred the first day that means you can do it again the next day and that means you can do it again the next day so this is why it doesn't matter where you come from or what your background you're in or whatever it doesn't matter where you are if you start to understand the game which most people don't and understand that it's just cumulative days stacked together that produce a result over the course of your life and you do that you can't be stopped nobody can stop you nobody can hate you into like losing doesn't matter what people say it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your skin color is or what the fuck you you know your parents did or what they didn't do or any of this shit it's about stacking wins in accumulative fashion over the course of time and when you do that winning is undeniable so understand the game today you may not have understood the game but the game is this win today win tomorrow win the next day and then win a thousand fucking days in a row and if you do that you'll be just like this dude here saying man my life is better than I ever expected it could be that's the reality of the game what are the episodes 58 and 64 58 and 64 on real AF feet so go listen to fucking 16 58 and 64 in succession and that will teach you all you need to know about what it takes to win yeah I fucking love that man I love that yeah yeah great job brother I'm well I'm right it does right it works listen you can't lose that way you cannot lose that way most people like to pretend that there's magic to it but the reason they like to pretend there's magic to it is because it allows them to defer and deflect accountability for their own decisions that they made they can say oh it doesn't matter even if I made the right decisions it's not gonna work out that's bullshit you're your own worst enemy because you don't understand how it actually works I'm a dumb mother fucker from St. Louis Missouri bro I figured out one thing I figured out how the game actually works and I play the game the way the game is supposed to be played and because of that I might be dumber than you I might be less skilled than you I might be less talented than you I might have less advantages to you but I win bigger than you because I play the game exactly as it's supposed to be played every single motherfucking day I wake up I try to win the day I don't win every single day but I win enough to produce a fucking life of winning and that's the game so learn the game play the game and there's gonna be no limits to what you do what you say they were again 58 and 64 16 58 and 64 and real AF to teach you a whole fucking game for free I love it guys we appreciate you guys as always thank you guys for liking commenting sharing make sure you guys are subscribing to see when get all the new episodes coming out we got some fun stuff coming up yeah we do yeah so so keep being real ass fans we appreciate you guys let's get back into our crews man headline number two and you are a man of leadership so I thought this would be a nice little topic conversation here let's talk about it so headline number two Pentagon US warship multiple commercial vessels attacked in red sea so a US Navy warship and multiple commercial vessels came under attack Sunday in the red sea the Pentagon said marking a potential escalation in a series of maritime attacks in the mid-east linked to the Israel Hamas war quote we are aware of reports regarding attacks on the USS corny and commercial vessels in the red sea and will provide information as it becomes available the Pentagon confirmed according to AP the USS corny which is the destroyer's Oli Bert class guided missile destroyer there is no indication yet it returned fire on its attackers the US official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters said the attack began about 10am in sauna Yemen and have been going on for as much as five hours there was no immediate comment from the Houthis however a Houthi terrorist spokesman earlier said quote important statement would be really shortly the AP report said now three weeks ago the USS corny shot down three land attack cruise missiles and several drones launched by Iranian back who to forces in Yemen and a potential widening of instability in the Middle East initiated by actors backed by Iran got that going on British they've also been having some issues they've been having some drone attacks on some of their vessels and there's just this this string of just poke poke with no response right um it's not just specific to the United States like said British has some issues this headline actually just came out a few days ago from Australia i'm not sure if you saw this but this said I read Australia says its navy divers were likely injured by the Chinese navy's unsafe use of sonar listen to this so Australia on Saturday accused the Chinese navy of likely causing minor injuries to Australian naval divers by operating its sonar while they were trying to clear fishing nets from their ships propellers the Australian government has expressed its serious concerns to the Chinese government over what it called the unsafe and unprofessional conduct earlier this week defense minister Richard morals said in the statement on his official website so this Australian boat was was out in the ocean right being Australian okay fishing that got got caught in the propellers is Chinese destroyer pulls up next to it right the Australian ship says hey we got sailors in the water right they're fixing it fucking Chinese destroyer turns on its fucking active sonar right now problem is is that at those anytime you're in the water that sonar bro it could rub share drums organs internal bleeding like it gets over 140 decibels if you're in the water it's really really bad for you um the divers sustain minor injuries likely due to being subjected to the sonar pulses from the Chinese destroyer um and uh China basically they didn't even uh respond at first but there is a response i'm gonna show you the video blasted Beijing coming a fortnight after navy divers from hma s to womba were injured when a nearby Chinese warship switched on its undersea sonar something lujian chow denies happening China did it in a very professional way we didn't nothing that harms the the sailors the the naval people or or that ship which is certainly not the view of Australia's navy chief with unsafe it was unprofessional i think such small instance could really escalate if you saw properly managed managing the relationship with china is difficult even at the best of times but ensuring incidents at sea don't escalate is trickier still if the two sides don't even talk we don't have a direct relationship between our navy and the PLA navy got it this is an issue for government even then it's not clear if differences can be resolved but you say that to know Australian sail south as well cursed that's not the Australian view go for the other picture do we have the best vacations and then buying out the banks yeah what what are the facts you know you're you're telling you're over here the little best or we're giving out you're coming out facts contested as much as the south china sea androproban nine news yeah so i mean there's my question any any you got you know 500 something people under roof here right uh even just your team what happens with somebody fucks with your people like what's your response well i i mean i think we know what my response is i fucking and race them okay um from being able to do that in any way shape or form doesn't matter how yeah i don't necessarily go on social media like a lot of these pussies do and talk about it okay but i guarantee there's repercussion it's handled people fuck with me they get fucked with back and they never even know it's me yeah that's why you don't fuck with people have resources ever should never fuck with somebody's got more resources in here because they have the ability to make your life real fucking miserable without you really being able to do shit about it yeah and they can do it for as long as they fucking want okay so that's the first thing second thing um i don't trust our own okay so like when they're saying that there was these attacks in in the middle east you know from all i can observe you know these the media and in the government they they kind of want to war you know of some sort so i don't know how you know are we talking like you know i'm the captain now like some dudes riding up throwing fucking rocks at the ship you know like right or what are we talking about where's the evidence yeah that's what i'm saying like where's the video of you guys shooting down these cruise missiles i mean i think for the amount of violation of trust that's happened over the last few years we're gonna have to see what's actually true and what's not true and all these reports coming like the tech bro you can't walk down the street look you could track a vehicle anywhere they go in the United States country with the license plate program okay so you're telling me there's no video that exists for them shooting this down and they could just say look these guys shot at us and we did this and here's what's happening where where's that where's that you know what i'm saying it's just like in Ukraine they're really trying to pull the justification of people correct American people they would want that right correct so i don't trust you know what they say you know and then how severe was it is it is it is it you came in vicinity because i could we not agree that our media is so irresponsible that even if a warship of ours was in the vicinity of a uh on the captain now type pirate ship that they would make a report out of it like do you think they would do that i mean i don't know maybe well they they shut the world down for a fucking cold i'm saying they they would they would probably definitely jump on it okay so so i could see them doing some things like that to escalate tensions and escalate you know the we got to get them right now if it were real stuff and we're really getting attacked i would say that we would use force to eliminate those people from the planet immediately like i before the news even ever hit so why having that that's my question well that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying how how do we know it's true because wouldn't that be the response wouldn't the response be if you were really attacked that you would retaliate fucking immediately yeah and bro apparently these attacks have been going on daily yeah and you know i so i don't know and also there's things i don't there's things that there could be a lot of things going on that we don't know and and you know they said that these are backed by Iran we keep saying that yeah but who do they want to go to war with around right right right so you know how do we know that there's a bunch of little gangs and tribes and terrorists organizations all over that area of the world bro we don't know who's backed by who fuck half the motherfuckers use us weapons okay so yeah so we don't know what's going on and so to say like this is what we should do i couldn't responsibly say because men's lives are at stake and i would have to know the actual facts but in general if we were attacked i would fucking kill them immediately i mean that's how i look at it bro it's like you know if we know who they are and we know where they are like my question is just how how much longer does this continue before american troops actually are hurt by these attacks and then what's the respect do we like when we i mean that's my point we don't know and then like we think about how they're trying to weaken the reputation of the united states our government yeah working to weaken yes and so what would pre-set a weaker country than someone who just gets punched in the face a bunch of times under shit about it nothing to write like dude bullies have to be punched back and they have to be punched back harder than you then they punch you okay so like like i was saying a minute ago when someone fucks with me which is rare i got a good relationship with most people when someone steps out of line i make it real painful very painful like for a long time and that's what trump does too that's his whole style trump's like well fuck out fucking ruin you bro like and that's we need you need to have that level of fear for people to respect you and i fuck with you because even for people who may not you know want to cause harm if they know that that's going to be the reaction guess what they don't do anything correct they don't fuck with you correct you know it's necessary so do we have to fucking we have to fucking you know know what's actually going on and we don't and and as far as what's going on in australia and china i mean yeah it does seem like the chinese fuck with everybody yeah but at this do they that's what i mean i feel i don't know man i feel like they do like i like i know you do but that's because every story that you've ever read in your entire life because you live in the middle of the united states of america says that yeah so are they really i think we have to assume that none of these people are telling the actual truth at all because there's a genna's at play this is all propaganda dude there are there are a genna's at play for these people to make money stakeholders yes and they are going to they are going to do whatever they can to get people to be on their side of whatever they're trying to cause right and so i would imagine australia's agenda from the political top is probably some somehow you know in contention with china you know what i mean like you know and also there's another thing like when your own governments do and fucked up shit don't you think they want to blame it on their enemy the enemy Putin did the election Putin Putin Putin rugs trumps colluding with Putin and then it ends up being made up lie completely made up by our own members of our own government know what stream pipelines i mean see what i'm saying yeah it's a great point so there's too much to there's too much there's too much bullshit man it's impossible to know what's going on which is what they want guys tell us what you guys think let us know down in the comments what you guys think on this topic hashtag it never happened let us know but guys with that being said man let's get to our third and final headline of the day headline number three this is a good one i like this guy man he's really picking up some steam kind of McGregor announces political plans on social media ahead of ufc return you

country back from the globalist elites you know they got AI pictures running around over now you know i you know i i think i think it's an unfair criticism of him to delete for him to take his post down and people saying you're not in or whatever i mean look dude this guy's unlike most people you know he has a lot to fucking lose and a lot to think about and a lot of responsibility like he just said really no different than i do in a different way and i take shit down all the time you know i'm saying i post it up just for the reason he said so it gets out people start sharing it and i take it down and part of the reason is from my own mental health you know i'm sorry how many notifications are you getting while that's up fucking you know i'm saying i'm sure that's a part of it too i mean fuck he's getting millions of impressions on those tweets bro have you not seen those stories i've been posting where i show my my mentions that's what i'm saying yeah let's see any of these fake influencers fucking post their fucking mentions we'll find out who's got fucking real depth in their following who doesn't yeah that's real let's really let's really fucking see that let's check it out you know they can fake their fucking followers and their traffic but you can't fake that shit okay and it does get overwhelming and it does take a lot out of you and you know sometimes real talk you know like sometimes i'm high as fuck and i say some shit and then i'm like fuck i want to just say that but like we're not i see Andy tagged you with something i go to oh he didn't see the thing is is like i don't hold back on here i tell you guys everything i think i don't think there's anybody listening to show could think i'm holding back because i'm not yeah you know what i mean this is these are the conversation the conversation we have here is the conversation people have at their home around the around the fire pit around you know what i'm saying yeah and we're just having it in public there's so dude there's so many millions of people that feel the way that you and i feel that just don't talk because they've been bullied in the silence and really guys if you want to change what's going on you guys got to break out of that being bullied in the silence and stop giving a fuck i've been telling you for years the arrows have all been took you could see it look at look at

high school that's not enough we have to protect the country we have to protect our freedom we have to get our freedom back we don't even have freedom to protect anymore anyway i love what he's doing i i understand why he's doing it and i think it will be hard for a regular person to understand why you would do things a certain way that's different than everybody else's but you're also not him yeah you're not a world famous figure you're not someone who ever that guy cannot go anywhere ever on earth without everybody knowing who he is you know what i'm saying there's other things to think about here so and i don't think he's trying to protect uh his image i think he says what he fucking wants to say no that it's it's not like i mean the law suits the stuff that i'm affected because even if you do delete it they still there like you know i'm saying like they got they already got it like i think i think that dude's just an idiot but i wanted that brought this up though because it really made me think that's just troll shit just troll shit but it just made me think about this man like i do i'm starting to see or at least feel that there is a resurgence of just young and i say young i'm talking you know in the 40s right like that's young compared to biting in all of these guys but just these young leaders man that are stepping back up and that's because it's our time dude it's our time it is the 40 year old third it's the 30 and plus 30 to 50 time to lead yeah and because you guys have always been reliant on these older men to lead we are not stepping up and leading it's time to lead it's our time to lead it's our time to run shit but i don't know what to all you men out there that are between the ages of 30 and 50 fucking years old it's our time now this country was founded by people that were your age or younger like it's our time you want the world to be fixed step the fuck up that's what it's going to take and that's not just here in the united states that's everywhere in the world and we the reason we have elderly people who can barely talk or think or communicate running our countries across the globe is because we the most powerful men out here physically okay are allowing them to because we're deferring it to them because it's always been them how long are you going to let your fucking dad wipe your ass bro it's time to stop it's time to step up it's time to build something so you have some leverage in this game like i don't know what to tell you yes it is necessary for young men younger men that are under 50 years old to step up and say we're done with you old crusty motherfuckers this is our shit you're not going to ruin it anymore you're not going to steal from us anymore you're not going to take any more of our shit and fuck you and that's what needs to happen across the fucking globe they these old people have no problem sending people like us and younger to fucking die for their fucking fevery so they can keep running it it's time dude it's time it's time it's time for people it's time for grown men to stop being fucking pussies and stand the fuck up and say i'm not with this shit anymore whatever that means to you i'm not saying you have to agree with everything i say whatever it means to you you need to stand up and be a leader about it i can't wait to start doing rallies oh bro that gonna be fucking amazing

having sex with men who are who don't have their shit together who not standing up and who are not being real men that's a big problem in the dynamic of society men and women are not meant to compete with each other they each have a role and we're all confused on that role because we got all these fucking idiots out here saying one thing or the other thing trust with sides as what I don't know what the fuck it is it's it's a combination of feminism and 15 years of trying to belittle men into like into boys you know into into soft feminine creatures and now women look around you're like where's all the men where's all the men well I don't know you shamed them all into fucking what they are now so now demand that they go back the other way they will and men you need to fucking realize like by the way just so you know young men nothing's more attractive to a woman than a man that stands up for what the fuck he thinks he says no when he means no he stands for what he thinks is true that's very attractive even if they pretend they hate you they still like you yep not like it too dude it's it's there's so much bad information about dating and like the men women dynamic I hear

we're sorry we like femininity we like soft the softness smell to hold on some of them do fucking we like soft feminine the we like the opposite of what we're supposed to be like exactly and these dudes think that to get a woman they got to pretend to be that way okay you're missing the point they like the opposite of what they are which is what oh it's called a man like like you're the proof

something get your fucking acid shape make some money like provide protect this this is the shit like you guys think you're gonna become the friend of these girls like I'm gonna be like the girl I'm so sensitive I'm gonna send her some love songs and I'm gonna send her some fucking Taylor Swift you know fucking bro yeah I'm gonna Taylor Swift with you out sitting the front row and then you wonder why she won't fuck you yeah like holy shit man you're trying to this I'll keep getting in the friend zone I'm like yeah cuz you act like a fucking girl she thinks you're a girlfriend bro listen every motherfucker out here unless they're fucked up knows I'm telling the truth where where's the lie every woman knows I'm telling the truth tell you that tell us in the comments where's the lie let us know but man let's get to our thumbs up let's get this is a good one all right you like bison right worm on the hats this has to do something with a bison okay our thumbs are gonna be stupid as fuck what did you expect our thumbs up huh huh huh our thumbs up or dumbest fucking headline reads you tall man gourd and seriously injured by bison he tried to pet admits he's definitely an idiot in this scenario this is what I'm talking about this is what I'm talking about this guys watch too many fucking cartoons bro too much yellow stone bro yeah yeah so you tall man was brutally gourd by a bison last month when he went to pet it in an idiotic move he quickly realized that left him with a lacerated liver and an 8 inch gash hailing car barajol hope I'm saying that right car barajol that looks right right whatever man hailing yeah cool man was man hey just leave it van hailing yeah was severely injured during the stony attack though he admitted stunning he was who would have thought he was the quote idiot in this scenario for approaching the bison on his way home from an early things given with his girlfriend he noticed the herd of bison on a neighbor's property and decided to get a closer look quote I was definitely an idiot in this scenario I crossed through the fence I started walking back near the fence Roger ball explaining to kutv quote by the time I got back to the fence he had followed me all the way over and I was like oh that's pretty cool yeah he tried to be a friend yeah I get out of my yard man I kind of did want to pet him so I was just being naive about the whole thing so I did that and yeah he just rocked me pretty good oh man I described the stitch he described to the station how the animal dipped his head down right before his horn punctured him and flipped him over he quickly escaped just like being badly hurt carajol suffered an 8 inch gash to the stomach a broken rib a lacerated liver and a banged up lung according to the go fun yeah it's dude he was airing to the ICU he spent seven days in the hospital is lucky to be alive man this was right so so hold on so I miss I missed took this guy for being one of these lip like when I first read the headline I thought he was one of these soy boys no no he's probably from his hell this guy is one of our homies and had a couple beers he's like hey watch this I'm sorry that every fucking super bad injury that I've ever had it first of all involved alcohol and second of all almost all of them except one started with this hey watch this shit yeah every time that's what this all right hey I think this is pretty funny yeah well you know let's send this guy a hat yeah let's send this guy a hat you could tell he's one of us by his belt buckle in the way he's dressed yep let's do probably this is the show now he's are you probably sitting in fuck you think Andy DG are gonna talk about me on the show this is bro you know man god dude he's lucky as fuck he is you know what you know what they say man you mess with the bull you get the penis that yeah that's true that's what they say he got fuck I've heard that lots times yeah look at this guy bro they're massive whoo that's look at that things head holy shit man bro they're awesome they're awesome animals they really are they're awesome man is that your spirit animal I would say so yeah man like I really think so I think that the the the the the American bison or buffalo whatever you want to call it I mean I think it represents our country I think the coolest thing and the reason I chose it for the logo on our hats and our American freedom gear is because like bro it's a it's a it's a very intelligent animal like it instinctually knows that when a storm's coming you walk through the storm because you spend less time in the storm yeah whatever animal does that that's how you get through life when shit happens and bad shit's happening you fucking don't run from that shit you go right through it and and that's what I love about these animals and by the way they've provided for civilization here in this country for not just hundreds of years but for since the history of the country and human inhabitants here ever existed I mean they deserve food they deserve the respect and they deserve the the admiration that you know I think a lot of us have for these animals they deserve to be left the fuck yeah and why the fuck do we have why do we have two symbols for our political parties that it ones are fucking donkey okay donkeys ain't that cool jackass yeah and then ones are African animal or an Asian animal like that doesn't even make sense why do we not have an American animal being the the for the American part of the rotation of the park yeah and that's not what this is by the way this is not this is not about politics this is about personal excellence it's about being the best that you can be it's about pushing through the hard shit and showing yourself to be an example for what it looks like to actually give a fuck in your life and and to take the responsibility seriously of setting a good example so that the people around us know what that looks like and can can do the same we have too many people like what we spend 20 minutes watch it what was the account we watch earlier uh cringey cringey and we're watching all these people doing all this funny shit and they're getting millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of views but one thing's in common with every single person on that video not a single one of mother fucking one of them's trying they're not even trying they're making fun of them so these are sad people these are people with no purpose who have just bought into the matrix so hard that they think that like oh well well i'm just you know an unemployed fat person and it doesn't and it's funny it's not funny like dude did you see my face when i was watching oh yeah like bro i think we recorded you guys should put the fucking clip of my face when i was watching i didn't even know it was fucking real i didn't even know i'm like is this real or these people pretending and i'm so like it actually upset me because it made me feel like we're wasting our time doing this like who the fuck are we talking to you know i'm sitting out guys i know you're out there i fucking see it but there needs to be more of us which is why it's important to fucking step into that idea of personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion so that we can bend to culture in the right direction make it cool again to be someone who actually gives a fucking tries hard to be a great person and all the things that being a great american or a great human being wouldn't body i think the bison represents that very well and they're bad at here they are
