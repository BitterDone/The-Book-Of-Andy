What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the real estate about of the lies the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today We have 75 hard versus as you guys know these are occasional episodes. They're not regular episodes, but we have a very special one today because last summer when you guys If you remember we had a 75 hard contest and we had a deal where we're gonna fly out two winners To be on the show and spend a day and work out and go to dinner and they are here today So I wanted to say welcome to Chris Ibs and Carly Thackerie. What's up guys? Thank you? Hi, it's great to have you guys here. Yeah, it's so great to be here. So where are we from? I'm from North Texas North Texas. Stuff holes. Yeah, okay, and I'm from Ventura California. All right. Yes, cool quite different places. Yeah Minds more similar to here. Yeah, I would say yeah, I think Texas is real close to Missouri man Every time I go to Texas I feel like it's home, right? She's a little hotter. Yeah, right on everywhere good barbecue Yeah, that's a good spot good people. I don't go to California. I know I told you, I'm like I'm from your favorite. Yeah, favorite place man. So I'm not allowed to California anymore. I know So well, it's great to have you guys here. So we're just gonna get right into it guys These episodes are basically, you know, like we say in the intro every show they're basically just you know people who have Discovered 75 hard who have completed it who have changed their life with the program. We let them tell their story so How do you guys hear about this? How do you come to cross 75 hard? I was on a walk in 2019 and it was the first episode you announced it I believe in the second I heard it I was like I have to do that Mm-hmm, and I never got the message cross where it was a fitness Immediately I was like no, this is gonna solve my deepest darkest demons the shit that always holds me back the stuff that I never quite Fix never quite you know get rid of in my life where it's always this yo-yo or I'm in this hamster wheel of a cycle right where I'm doing good Then I'm not so I failed it at least a dozen times before my back was up against the wall last August and I just said this has to be done So what were you like before that? What do you mean before 2019? Yeah, were you training? Where you do yeah, so my background is in martial arts, okay? Black belt in Taekwondo. I fought for 10 years when I retired. I met my husband. He's also a fighter as well 2009 we opened up our cross-it gym ran it so our training in Taekwondo and fighting was really similar to CrossFit So it was like a natural progression 2015 we sold everything it took everything online so I was in the fitness world, right? But I just struggled so much was staying consistent. I struggled so much with Yeah, being dialed in my nutrition and da da da da da da and it was honestly the lies that I told myself Like I got this it's okay. I can I've been good for 30 days and I can go have a glass of wine or I can go have a cheap meal and it always It always created the it's interesting. It's interesting because people's criticism of 75 hard is what do you do after 75 days you keep going that's right and they don't understand They think of it as a fitness challenge. It is a mental program. Yes, two completely different things and if you're having problems Like Carly's describing where you're up and down up and down. I was very similar over my life. I discovered That I had no capacity and maintain I was hot and then I was cold I was hot then I was cold then I was hot then I was cold and it wasn't until I started seeing it as a mental A mental aspect to my game that was weak Then it changed my perspective right and so I I think it's interesting because the people who don't really understand they haven't looked into the program Maybe they just heard about it or they see it online. I think it's a fitness challenge or 75 date Workout program or something they don't understand that this is actually the way that you do maintain Yes, because you're fixing what's going on upstairs. It's causing the up and down 100% so it's really cool to hear you say that especially coming from Someone who's been in that game their whole lives. Yes, absolutely. It literally my whole life. Yeah, and I mean since I've been a little grime I've struggled with weight and nutrition and being consistent. I'm either on the boat or I'm off the boat right and so Yeah, it's um, it was the subtraction of stuff that Really led me through the breakthrough. Yeah, and 75 hard makes you subtract. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, thank you What about you brother? Well, I originally started following you back in 2017 and when you were doing the MSC you a project And I was back then I was basically the kind of person that needed to be hearing that kind of stuff But I just started implementing any of it till probably a year later where I there was 2018 and I kind of went through a breakup So I was forced to make a decision to change things and then 2019 I started working in the oil field Which is what I do now doing contract well-service and well-testing and basically opening up new wells to production and just started Basically doing the hard things and knowing that it's going to take time to build something up from that And then I started focusing more on becoming a better father to my daughter. I have a 15 year old daughter right now And so at that time she was still 10 or so, but just putting more time and effort into that and then so you had the What was it 2019 2020 when you 2019? Yeah, so you actually 75 hard was a March fifth is five years old. Okay, so which that's pretty long time for a fucking fat, huh guys? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it keeps getting bigger too. I don't think fads get bigger after five years I love when people say that. Oh, yeah Well, so I remember you announcing it and everything got and I tried doing it probably about four times I failed it But I would always fail because I was drinking still And then I made a made a commitment to stop doing that The first time I completed 75 hard was the end of 2022 I did it and I just got done with it and I felt like accomplished and like a really good job I had a similar transformation But I felt like I could have did more yeah, so Whenever that you announced the contest I'd already been planning on doing the program again on September 1st, which you announced the contest on August 27th, I believe to start on August 28th. Yeah, so I went from about 235 to 205 or 27 around there, but You guys shredded bro. Thanks. Yeah, well, I was expecting to do a bodybuilding show But I had a job come up that I needed to be on and and then I just went on that instead. Yeah more Yeah, this is more It was a smarter decision basically to go to go work and so spend money on that bodybuilding show when you guys started with 75 hard What were you expecting of it? What were you? What were you expecting to get out of it versus you know, what actually happened? And I always like to ask that yeah, I was expecting it to heal my my crippling depression my stress my anxiety and I mean I So I had a similar kind of journey on I was like okay, August 28th. I'm going to start I saw Emily was going to do it as I cool. I love to follow her on it Then I found heard your podcast of like hey make sure to tune in And when I heard your testimonial about your journey through it and what it did for you and especially with self-harm and suicidal thoughts And it was just like it pierced my soul and so I was like And I was battling with that so immensely and That's what I I knew like of course you want to look strong and lean and good and stuff, right? But I knew that Would be the byproduct if I solved this shit right? I had to go in and I had to slay my own fucking demons with this program And that was my focus and that was the only thing I focused on every single day I knew if I checked off every single thing Every single day and gave it my all that this would finally be solved and it was like that Like Andy I couldn't it was like a whole year of like just absolute utter hell In my mind in my soul yeah, and within three days I was like springing out of the bed. I couldn't get out of bed before 7 a.m I was struggling to be a mom to feed my kids. I was struggling with suicidal thoughts I mean it was just like the darkest year of my life and Within three days I was springing out about at 4.30 in the morning by day five I remember my husband looking at me he goes you got your spark back didn't you and I go I sure did I go in this program. I'm doing it for the rest of my life like I'm in so what do you think it is about the the What do you think it is that makes makes you feel that way so fast? Um, it was the removal of all the vices that I was using to numb out runaway and escape And when you already are dealing I was already dealing with a certain level of depression and sadness and anxiety from some experience I had and then you put on alcohol And then you put on shit food and I said it just compounds it like crazy, right? And so it's normal It's quote unquote normal. It's what everybody does yeah Yeah, no more. Uh-uh, no way and so Um So once I eliminated all that and then started stacking wins and be honestly doing something That's so many people attempt and so few finish I was like fuck yeah, I'm back. Yeah, I am fucking back like it Ignited that part of me that had been buried so long So fucking I helped you find a purpose again 100% 100% and a pathway Like I was so lost. Yeah, you know what I mean And so now I know I just have to do this yeah, if I do this then I'm the best fucking version of me Yeah, and you wake up every day knowing you did it like when you wake up shitty and you're in a bad mood And you're like fuck today's well, I have 72 days in a row where I did everything I was supposed to do. It's kind of hard to feel bad And how about when you hit the your head hits the pillow at night and you're exhausted from kicking ass Yeah, doing the shit that nobody fucking does. Yeah, no matter what happens Like I didn't you heard my story from yesterday. Yeah, I still got my day done on 75 hard I did my 45 minute workout through customs and the baggage claiming. Yeah, you know it like you just You were so fucking empowered by this. Yeah, like what's gonna stop me? Yeah, you come out on the other nothing. Yeah, so Yeah, that's cool. It's so it's it's like the most powerful drug. Yeah, right? Yeah, I dude look I talk about this all the time. You know, there's three elements to being happy and people think being happy is being you know Be in a better mood, you know do do what you like You know do something that makes you happy and they don't understand that they can manufacture their own happiness Right, there's three components to it one you got to be grateful for where you are You got to look around you got to say hey, you know what shit's not exactly the way I want it, but I'm pretty good. This is all right. It could be a lot worse All right, there's a lot of people who have it a lot worse than me Two you got to have a purpose every single day. What's your purpose? What are you getting up for what are you getting up to accomplish? What are you getting up to to do human beings are driven by purpose? And when we lack purpose we we seek purpose and even if it's not consciously It's unconsciously which creates anxiety and it creates uncertainty and it creates this feeling of Something's just not right. Yeah, and it's because we're not meant to sit around and you know Scroll the internet. That's not what we're meant to do We're meant to go do things and accomplish things and build things and create and contribute To things outside of ourselves and when we don't have that purpose we can't be happy and three We have to exercise discipline If we do not exercise discipline We are never going to feel confident in ourselves. We are never going to feel powerful. We are always going to feel powerless We're going to feel like we're floating through the wind and you know Who knows what could happen five minutes from now and that's not an empowered way to live You know, so if you're looking for being If you're looking to be happier and you think it's going to be You know sitting down by the brook as the stream crashes over the rocks reading your book Yeah, that might make you happy for a couple hours dude But if you lack these three things in your life on a consistent basis It's impossible to be happy and that's something that for the program that I have come to to learn When I am find myself in a dark spot or a difficult spot which we all do There's no way to permanently get to it and I think that's another lie right another lie that we're told is We're going to find ourselves permanently in this content happy place That's not the way life works man life goes up life goes down things change the weather changes Relationships change the way we see things change we go up we go down we go up we go down We go up we go down So it serves us to understand how to create these things when we want them when we're lacking them and every time I'm ever in a bad spot in my life if I look and I could like every single time I can look and usually for me It's gratitude because I'm pretty disciplined And I have purpose every day So usually for me gratitude is the thing that I lose focus on because I'm so focused on Moving forward that I that I lose sight of where I'm at you know where I'm at now or this is the shit I used to dream of right so I have to remember that but I think for all of you guys listening You know if you find yourself in a place where you're not feeling right Ask yourself what's your purpose? Are you grateful for where you are and what kind of discipline are you exercising? I guarantee you dude you're gonna have problems with one of those areas if you're not being happy right now So that's something that that I've took from the program. What about you Chris? Well the main thing I wanted to gain from it was confidence Yeah, believe it or not. I've worked out for like 23 years now. Yeah, I can tell bro. You're jacked So I've been in shape most of my life right But I didn't have the confidence. I would go around everywhere self-conscious still And maybe it's like the body to smart thing or I think everybody who's built. I mean let's be real dude The reason we work out and get big muscles and shit is because we lack confidence. We're a little insecure That's reality. That's reality. That's where achievement comes from that's where drive comes from That's where having shit to prove comes from yeah Insecurity is a natural human characteristic that we all have at certain times. We just gotta learn how to leverage it You know Well, that's not the reason why I started working out though Yeah, but it didn't come from being not self-confidence But originally I started because I wanted our dad to stop beating our ass Yeah, well, that's a good reason too, but I feel good doing this. Yeah, keep doing this since then Yeah, but now the confidence was the main thing I wanted to gain from it and then doing Getting that mental toughness that comes from doing the hard things consistently every day and having the purpose I you're talking about where you when you're on the program you have a plan to follow right so you go through the tasks daily But the main test is whenever you get off of it if you're gonna pivot and Change those critical tasks to fit your life and their goals that you are trying to achieve That's where people are are failing They think it's just gonna be the 75 days or it's gonna be the phases But it's the taking the discipline that you gain during those the the phase or the 75 days And in changing it and putting it into working on the forward. Yeah for sure to and so since then I've just been able to I mean, it's just it's a it's addictive trying to go through and pick every little hard thing that That you can throughout the day you're able to start being aware of Each individual you know decision that you make is this gonna make my life better or is this gonna make my life worse If you can be able to adapt that That mentality you're gonna be able to make a lot better choices and then Get your get closer to your goals every day and just know that You know with your lessons you show the way of how it's gonna take a long time whether it's gonna You're not gonna notice anything for a long time you just got to know that you have to keep putting in the work and Now I don't have that issue with confidence. Yeah, that's for sure. It worked. I'm good. Yeah, that's good man Well, the one of the things that I did during the program for the contest was First of all, I told my daughter. I was gonna win the contest when you announced it And like I said, I was gonna do the content or I was gonna start 75 hard that week anyways But you said to do the contest that day so I started it that day and I posted a YouTube video every single day I'd started a YouTube channel last summer with my daughter doing just cookie reviews We were ordering cookies off Instagram Which you guys hooked me up with the set in my locker. So that's pretty cool Cuz I hadn't had that con yet. So we're gonna do that. But uh, I couldn't do cookies on 75 hard Kids love YouTube, bro, right? Don't they? Yeah, they want to be youtubers now, man Well, I want to do yeah, well, I see these people making money off bro. You just want listen. Let's not bullshit. You just want to eat some cookies Well Both of them But yeah, I see people making them yeah, but I want to try something But I couldn't do cookies on on 75 hard. So I just decided to post a video every day how I felt what I was doing that day. It wasn't like some elaborate edited video or anything I was just sitting wherever I was because I was in a lot of places. I travel for work and sometimes I'm Two hours from home sometimes I'm six hours from home And I was still managing to you know make those long drives work 12 hours and Do my workouts outside of being at work. That one of the things where I made it a point where I had time during my 12 hour shift I could have threw my rug on and and started stepping yeah, right? Well, some people might not be able to do that and I was trying to show the way that if you have a construction job Or you work outside or you're doing these things that is still possible. Yeah, that's one of the things people talk about They don't have time that how I have this going on or have that going on. See there that or they can't quit drinking for the Yeah, yeah, well dude. That's hard. You know when you're normalized in alcohol culture That's it like dude. I can remember when I got out of drinking dude like It's not that not sorry to cut you off But like the alcohol things important bro because I was in alcohol culture. It sounds like you were too I'm on yeah, yeah with me by myself drinking well, fuck dude for me It was like all my friends drink all the time. That's what we did for fun. We went to restaurants. We went to brunch Drink same St. Lucie drinking town. That's what we do here. We drink and watch the Cardinals. Mm-hmm. Sometimes fight That's what we do like um And getting out of that culture super hard for people, you know, they can't imagine their life without it Well, they most of them do it every day. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm saying Just a terrible example to be setting and honestly, it's like it's not necessary. Was that the hardest thing for you the drinking? Now I was I mean also tired of doing it. Yeah, whenever I look back at it It had been like five or six years that I was doing it basically every day I would leave the gym at 10 a.m. Which is when the liquor stores open in Texas and I would go by a half point Southern comfort 100 That's not very much, but I didn't buy the bigger bottles because I knew I would just drink those Yeah, then come back the next day and get yeah, whatever size that you know, yeah, yeah, I tried to limit myself like that But so you were you were like really drinking Yeah, yeah, but still like functioning. Yeah, yeah, I wasn't out driving around doing. Yeah, no, I get in the bar Yeah, nothing going on. Yeah, you drink it all now. No, yeah, it's been Since October 2022. That's awesome. I'd quit when I finished the program the first time so I didn't even drink till Yeah, I mean still yeah, so this last time I did the program. I didn't have that there wasn't an issue Yeah, whenever I started it, I was 10 pounds lighter than the last time just because I didn't have that bloat from yeah Drink an alcohol bro. I don't miss that no that alcohol bloat or even that feeling gross waking up the next day Yeah, dehydrated headache feeling. Yeah, that's the worst and then it's just the example. That's being said. How old are you? I'm 36. Yeah, well you I feel like shit when I wake up anyway I don't need more alcohol stuff bro. I'm 44, bro. I feel like I'm gonna fucking die That's one of the things that's good about being on the program and you're following a diet. Yeah It plays a big difference because since I've been off the program I'm so again because of that. Yeah So when you when you think about like Where you would have been or where you'd be without that you think you still be drinking If I would have had nothing to force me to know. Yeah, I mean, yes, I would have still been drinking. Yeah. Yeah Dude me too, man. I feel like with the alcohol thing it I never meant to like quit And I still haven't quit totally like there's two three times a year while I have some drinks But I don't ever think about it. Like even on the days I do drink like the times I have alcohol It's like on the moment decision where I'm like fuck it, you know one day out You know, it's probably three times a year and it's never like Getting drunk. It's like three or four or five beers tops. Yeah, you know It's changed my relationship with alcohol completely same. I don't miss it either. Uh-oh Yeah, which I which dude I could never get over like when when you were talking about You know basically going up and down and up and down and up and down I think a lot of the reason that I was going up and down my whole life with with my fitness Especially was because I could never get rid of or shake the alcohol habit same Yeah, yeah, because the alcohol for me always led to shit food choices Yeah, right and then it led to bad sleep and then the next morning I'm tired. I'm paying the piper because I drink the night before yeah And I feel blood and now I don't want to go the it was just this whole Yeah, yeah, and um and then you know being in the fitness community, right? I walked around with like so much shame and regret and guilt and like I have to be this leader and and I'm like yeah, there's pressure in that for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, so one of the things that people Say when they talk about 75 hard and completing it is that it like we're talking about alcohol here, right? Yes It did fundamentally change my relationship with alcohol. Yeah, and I think it's fundamentally changed my relationship with food too um and people Yeah, like what do you Speak on that for a minute Chris Well, I mean it makes you aware of everything that's going on around you. Yeah, you you just Constantly everybody's being you know berated with just chemicals every with everything that you do and You just watch people that aren't aware of it and you I mean Yes, you're judging them, but not no like a negative light right that you can see that they have way more potential than that They're putting out and they're they're wasting their lives basically and they're just setting a terrible example And they're not you know leading the way for the people that are around them, especially their kids So if they're just constantly you know out of shape eating all these terrible things They're that's just something that's gonna be passed down. It's One of those things that they know what they they hate the way that it's close fit them or the way they feel going on Public and that's just something they're passing that pain down to their kids and it's yeah, it's just a you know People need a lot of your motivation was for your daughter man Yeah, that's so important to me. It's like don't really the most important thing to me for the last like I said I had to change something that five years ago. I've basically stayed single since in that amount of time except for like a six month period, but uh I just I work out of town a lot so it's one of those things where I don't expect somebody to just be okay with that So I don't even put any effort into trying to get some what's anybody yeah, and then whenever I come home I'll go make some money. I'll come home. We'll we'll go out to you know some beach somewhere Yeah, so we go on a lot of trips. Yeah, that's just what I put my money into yeah. Yeah, yeah, I feel like I've You're trying to set the best example though. Yeah, I don't know if it's that for sure that and I don't know if I'm trying to like make up for whenever I was a loser There's probably some time, bro And then also like the fact that I know that what I wanted whenever I was her age as in a dad That so I just gave that to her. Yeah, and so she has a better chance in in this world. Yeah, for sure She can see for sure in the fact that I told her that I was gonna win this She's known that about you and me listening to you for for these all these years. Yeah, she was listening to them FCO project with me That's awesome. So it's fair to see that what it's what happens whenever you put in that work and then Dude, it's everything come here. That's what that's the whole thing That's the whole reason the world is where it is It's because more people aren't taking that responsibility seriously exactly who'd bigger respect for that man Thank you. Yeah, I feel like a lot of people who right now. I think there's a cultural movement of people who are Realizing, you know, they're now in their upper 30s or they're in their 40s and they're like holy shit We're the leaders now like we have to get our lives together We can't just like rely on these people who are now 70 years old to lead the way right and uh, it's really cool to see that in culture man Really cool that you did that for her. That's bad ass man. Thank you. Yeah. What about you in terms of how's changed your relationship um With food, alcohol, just people or things that you see your perspective in general Yeah, um that was probably one of the most surprising things that came out of all of this for me um It feels lonely Because I really had to remove myself from the environments that I was typically in right like I wasn't going out on a Thursday and Friday night anymore I wasn't hitting up the breweries on a Saturday or going to a bar on Sunday to watch football games and drink right and Most people do that and I had to completely remove myself. It was making me so sick and so um So it it's lonely. It's it's kind of lonely like not many people are living a life like this and um So I'm kind of in this like I feel like this weird space of like I left that table And I want to go to that table, but I'm still like I still need to finish you know all of live hard like I still have so much more work to do Yeah, and so um But I wouldn't trade it for the world. I would never trade Going back to that ever again And then with my food, I mean yeah when I eliminate the foods that trigger me because I'm a recovering anorexic Beliemit compulsive overeater and I had a severe eating disorder in my early 20s and When I finally got really honest and said you know what these certain foods trigger you all the time This alcohol lowers your inhibition you go into these foods then you're bingeing or purt you know whatever the case may be So like I said before it was the subtraction of all the stuff and it was really just getting super clear and honest and stop Lying to myself like now you've got this. Yeah, you can go back into that you can kind of dip your feet No, it was never a dipping on the feet, right? Yeah, it was a full on slip and like a tidal wave taking me out so um So it's just been the the best reset and It came from a place of just having to get absolutely clear on me Let's talk about that for a second you mentioned the the Lying to yourself. Yeah I think At least for me the biggest thing that I get out of the program and living the live hard lifestyle which I do And I have for five years is the awareness of my internal dialogue what I talk about in the program the bitch voice and the boss voice before the program I was not aware of that dialogue the way that I am now now I knew I knew it was there, but I didn't Pay attention to it the way that I do you know and and that's something that's really helped me develop Personally is just becoming more aware of the justifications that I make for things and I found that that has translated into The situation where I examine my justifications in all areas of my life not just in these areas that encompassed the program and so it's made me a much better person In general, but it's it's also triggered the over the last five years. It's triggered the a massive amount of work Because I've had to be honest with myself because that awareness is not just exclusive to Don't eat that food or it's okay To not exercise today because you worked hard. It's literally everything now. I'm like in tune with everything That I have going on and the two the two influences in our minds, which is you know the voice of the week and the voice of the strong which we all have yeah I was a Complete Myself for fucking I mean fuck dude up until five years ago, you know what I'm saying? I could justify anything I could justify anything to myself I could say literally in one breath. I could look you in the face and say I'm starting my diet tomorrow I'm going to do this and this and this and then tomorrow in the afternoon you could see me in the pizza I'd be like yeah, dude, you know what? This happened and I'm gonna start tomorrow like that's that was the thing I was dealing with I couldn't even stick to something for a fucking day It'd be if if I got the three or four days I automatically went where you were talking to my earlier Chris where I'm like oh dude I went four days dude. I'm I deserve that I deserve that pizza. I deserve those beers I deserve that night out And that's how I live my life so I could never make any real progress Let's let's talk about that a little bit like what what kind of awareness has it brought to your guys's internal dialogues That maybe you know you didn't have before or did you have it before and just you just ignored it Yeah, I at least for me. I mean this program when like you said like you get really honest with these Things right these these six things right they either did get done. Yeah, or they did not get done Yeah, the score is a hundred or zero right that's it and that type of mindset when you're training your mind at least for me every day It starts to bleed into relationships that you don't have Maybe how your parenting. I have two little girls finances home at it just bleeds into everything and all of a sudden like You're this person that just speaks the facts I get you centered into reality Yes, because and also because I'm not numbing out anymore with food and alcohol right and so I have to feed that that was probably one of The coolest things. It's like you can't numb out with food and alcohol anymore, Carly So you got to face it right now and the solution was solved like that Something I've been putting off for five seven ten years subjects that I didn't want to talk to my husband about or whatever the case Like let's go time. Yeah, like let's do it. Yeah, because you don't want to stay in that pain. Yeah all the hard things become much easier Completely. Yeah, dude. I get that a hundred percent. Yeah, like It's it becomes very simple to just address things for what they are yes, there's no bullshit There's no and and it takes it does take that clarity get to that point. I think for a lot of people You know a lot of people live their life in that cloud of well It's not really that no motherfucker. It's that it is. Yeah, it's either this or it's that yeah, you know You either are or you aren't and I feel like so many people nowadays spend so much of their life in the nether region of indecision or justification to where they can't make any decisions to do anything like you're saying, you know 10 12 years you're holding on to things that you want to address or want to do or things that are maybe you know need to be taken care of And they cause you anxiety they cause you frustration they cause you stress they cause you pain and and then like do when you get clarity on it you're like This is over in two seconds. Yeah, you know, and I think I felt that way too. What what about you It was something I was always aware of yeah, but I would always fall victim to it. Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't listen to the boss voice Yeah, I would I would you know cave and go drink or I would eat the The crap food or whatever it is, but a lot of people just never Aren't there an aware of it because they're They're Used in all devices are drinking or they're eating the foods that are full of crap and then just like you said in that cloud So they aren't even aware They aren't they don't set goals. So they don't know what it's like to achieve goals And and that's been so long so that they've done it that they just don't think that they can do anything So they have that doubt and that that They're not able to just Make a decision and start doing anything and then they just Keep going back and forth to the same that cycle of just starting something and then stopping something and trying to find a new A new thing trying to change the plan. They'll even try to alter 75 hard to make it fit there They don't even understand that that's their whole problem Your whole problem is that you're taking the circumstances and trying to mold them to you as opposed to just addressing them in reality It's unaware of this pro Do you know I it's also unaware and it's you point out a really good thing Is that when you tell yourself you're gonna do something and you don't do it over and over and over again What do you think happens to the trust factor you have with yourself or the confidence you have in yourself? Right you know this and you know this but I'm talking to you guys listening You guys have to understand every single time you tell yourself. I'm going to do this I'm going to do that and then you don't do it You are diminishing the trust and the belief that you have in yourself which creates lack of confidence It creates doubt it creates low self-esteem it creates a bad personal identity it creates all of these things simply because you were lying to yourself Just like if you had a friend who came to you every single day and you said hey, I'm gonna do this for you I'm gonna do this for you I'm gonna do this for you at the end of the day none of the shit's done And then you go in and you find them you know laying on the couch and you're like hey Why didn't the yard get cut? Why didn't this happen? Why probably some of you guys feel this way with your kids You're like hey, why did this not happen or why did that? Oh, you know and then after you know a week of that you're like Dude what the fuck and they don't realize that that happens to yourself We do that to ourselves and so a lot of people a lot of you guys who were living in this place Where you're not happy with yourselves you think low of yourself You're frustrated with yourself you have doubt in yourself. You don't believe in yourself You are creating that by making promises that you do not fulfill and that is the power of the program The power of this program is it is very black and white you either did or you did not and if you did You can actually go see that you did and that creates and builds the confidence that builds the self-esteem That builds everything that you're lacking now and it reverses the process And I wish people would just understand that it's actually very simple. This is not you know You don't need to have a psychotherapist to figure this out bro You're not gonna trust your friend who lies to you every day and once he lies to you for 30 40 50 days in a row you're probably gonna be like fuck this guy now imagine that over the course of 10 years Imagine that the course over 20 years You're gonna fucking hate that person So a lot of you guys that struggle with your own self-loathing you look in the mirror and you're like Brahma pieces shit blah blah blah the reason you feel that way is because you don't follow through And any of the shit that you say you're gonna do ever not even a little shit So start somewhere and start building it. That's what it's gonna fix your problem. Yeah That's exactly why yeah, that's how you get the confidence. Yeah, dude the program the way you're supposed to be done Yeah, that's why that's where it comes from yeah, it's interesting how many people don't understand you know like They think they think it's a fitness they it's not fitness bro look I said this gazillion times if you want to get fucking fit if that's all your goal is Here's the problem with it all right. Yeah, there's better programs that probably get you more fit quicker all right Training twice a day doing all these things Are there other ways? Yeah, they're probably are but here's the reality the reason that you go up and down with your fitness Is because you haven't trained your brain to understand discipline in a true fashion And so we have to start looking at things differently. It's not It's not and this is this goes for all areas of our life. It doesn't just go for our fitness. This goes for Our Relationships what we do in our career Uh, what we do in our friendships what we do you know in any area It's easy to justify the easier route every single time but until you start addressing the truth to yourself and handling problems It's literally impossible to feel good about yourself. You can't you cannot do it You can go to every therapy session You can read every book you can go to every seminar you can Fucking say all the affirmations, but at the end of the day, dude It's where the tire hits the fucking pavement and it has to be done And that's what people want to avoid all this shit. They want to avoid the hard stuff You know, I want the easier out. Give me a give me a pill. Give me a this give me a that you know I'm gonna say some nice stuff about myself cool man. That's all good stuff But the reality is until you legitimately start building life to where you can look at yourself in the mirror 50 days into the program or a year into the live-hard program is a holy shit, dude I am a completely different fucking human being now you're talking about real confidence Now you're talking about power because you understand that you are in control of the outcome Like dude, it's hard to be confident when you think that you're not in control of the outcome And I think this is the biggest lie that we deal with in society right now We have so many people that believe that the way they are has to do with you know some sort of Cause that is outside themselves and so because they believe that they abandon every single controllable that they could possibly have saying well Fuck it. You know what my parents are fat. I'm fat. My parents are broke. I'm broke Everybody else is a loser. So it is what it is and we start telling ourselves all this shit And we abandon all the things which is most of them that make a difference in our lives What we eat what we put in our mind how we treat people You know like what we actually do how hard we work these things build a sense of self-worth that cannot be replicated any other way than just doing it And the controllables are very simple What are you putting in your mouth? What are you putting in your brain? How are you moving your body? Right? Like these things are simple and everybody can control them And when you start to control those things you can learn that the outcome is very predictable On the other side And I think having that knowledge which both of you have expressed that you feel that now that control over your lives How much different does that make you feel about things? You know, I don't think people ever really truly I think people some people do but I don't think people ever truly get to a point where Through to traditional fitness, okay, they get their body fit All right, but that person's and you you guys are both examples of this you trained your entire lives. All right How many times were you fucking ripped before you did the program? I'm planning plenty how many times for you planning me too. Yes, okay? So I'm out here saying You know people are out here talking like oh, it's fucking physical. No, it's not physical, bro It's about teaching you that the controllables that you are in control of can very predictably Control the outcome of your life And when you start to realize that it's not just in the wind and it's not just up to chance And it's not just luck and you are actually in control That's a powerful fucking feeling dude That's the ultimate confidence That's that's where we're trying to get people to and I think if we had a society of people that understood that How much different would society look? Night and day, I mean come be the completely opposite of what we have yes most problems were probably gone. Yeah, you know, yeah, yeah Dude, I don't know man, you know I mean if you guys seen that like like people have people that you know have seen you do what you do like talk about that because like You know the people who have seen and then been inspired. I want to hear about that stuff Yeah, I mean, I'll speak. I mean we yeah, it's you know what trips me out Andy is People have seen my transformation and people know my story and You see a picture of me and I looked just like you and now you see me and they just sit there and they're just like One order of pizza and I'm like, huh? Huh? Like I Don't you want to get from point A to point B? Yeah, you're right where I was yeah, like what are you waiting for? Why are you leaving so much on the table and I have so many people and it pains me so much that are in that spot And they won't fucking move. Yeah, they won't and it's just like it's it's so simple How much of that do you think is the ignorance of never experiencing anything other than what they currently have? You know Maybe I think it's a lot of ego I think it's a lot of ego. I think at least it's what I feel like it's like Now I'll figure it out on my own. I'll do it this way. Yeah, it's never worked that way You've been sitting 30 40 50 pounds over wait for last six years. I just transformed my life in 75 fucking days. Yeah You know what I'm but but you know I was talking to my husband about this I've always been and I think it comes from sports I've always been like if somebody is killing it right and is doing better than me and has an edge I'm always like what are you doing? Show me I want to know because that's how I always made myself better as a fighter So I think I developed that skill you know where you you don't have the ego and you just like give it to me Right and so yeah, it just it blows my mind because I see so many people that are in that space addicted to the alcohol You know Just you know they're good for a couple days and then Thursday comes around Friday Saturday So and into there just back into that cycle can't even go the whole January dry, right? You know they get to day 28 or 29 so um It feels like an ego thing like yeah, she did that but I'm gonna do it this way and I don't need to do all that I you know it I can and it's just like no yeah, this is the pathway. I think a lot I mean we can't force anybody to change right like you have to get so fucking sick of yourself that you like Literally look in the mirror and you're like I fucking hate that motherfucker. That's how I was yeah I was too and and and and I think most people can relate to that feeling at some point in their life, right? Um, and that's okay. It's not supposed to be that way guys You could fix that yes, and the thing is is I feel like a lot of reason that people don't choose to go To really get their shit together is because they are ignorant to the fact of how good they're supposed to actually feel because of how normalized being Like what we would call normal is right like we turn on the TV dude All we see is pizza commercials snack commercials alcohol commercials And then pharma commercials, right When we when they show us a normal what a normal man supposed to look like at it in his late 30s or 40s What are they when they talk about? Dad bought you know, oh, it's okay to be a little shitty, right? It's okay to be it's okay to be soft and you know what dude? Sometimes you are a little soft and that's okay. That's life. You know, we're not talking about Living this every single minute of your entire life That's why the programs broken up into phases because when you start to recognize that your edge is getting a little dull It's time for a little tune up and you're in control of when you do those phases except the first and the last one so You know, I think there's I think there's a big problem with how normal it is to For people to Live below standard and how we're propagated that in society and I don't think most people realize like how good they can look How good they can feel how good they can feel about themselves and how good they can feel about other people and how much control They have over things that they seem to not have control over you know like dude Chris, you know when you're talking about alcohol, bro You know, I know that guy like I know what that guy's about like dude if I come to you on Monday or you Monday Chris starts his diet and I come to him on Wednesday I said hey, let's go get some beers. He's fucking saying yes. Yeah, no matter what yeah like dude I was that guy too. I was the guy that could not say no someone said a beer in front of me. They said I know you're on a diet, but dude come on I had no power like none and it wasn't until I like really like thought about it very simply like very simply And looked at that beer and I was like That's a fucking inanimate object That has that is nothing that's a that's a glass with some fucking liquid in it And I'm letting that control my life fuck that yeah, and that was where I got to with it I got and I got that way about food too. I started looking at food and I'm like That's a fucking pizza, bro. That's not like like Fuck that pizza, you know what I'm saying like as stupid as that sounds like that's the I almost got like mad at this shit You know where I'm like dude You're not gonna tell me that this fucking food or this brand or this advertisement or this urge It's going to control my life You know and I think when you start looking at it that way of flip switches for people You know, it's not just about looking good at the pool, bro It's not just about being fit It's not about having muscles and abs when you think about it like that It's very superficial. Yeah, when you think about it as an actual mentality that you need to have in all areas of your life It changes your shit and um Yeah, I don't know man. That's For me that's been a big that's been a big thing is understanding, you know And and and controlling what I can and not allowing things that shouldn't control me to control me Yeah We think well, it's easy to let things just take over your day Especially if you don't aren't aware of what you're doing to yourself. Yeah, people will just look at Their journey of they have to lose a hundred pounds and just at how hard it's going to be Yeah, but they don't take into the consideration the person that they're gonna change into as they're you know Yeah, reaching that goal. So they're they think it's just so far away and then They don't realize how far they've already actually came yeah, so they just don't start and they don't realize what The feelings that come as you're losing that way you're gonna feel better. You're gonna be more confident Yeah, just feel better about everything in general But it everybody's just looking for the easy fix the overnight success the The shot the pill whatever to lose the weight fastest That's the work the fucking ozemic shots. Yeah, yeah Well, I've always been the in shape friend. So people have always came to me for work out advice that most of them never took So it came to the point where I just got tired of giving it because People I've had people take advice for me and then go pay for a diet from somebody else and get the same thing Of course, and not do either one. Yeah, so I just got to where I'm like If you're gonna pay me, I guess I'll do it, but yeah, that's not something I started offering or anything Yeah, I'm capable of doing it But no, it's just it's a matter of just taking initiative and and Accountability of your life and it's a matter of you know setting the example that you need to set for the people all in your In your circle whether it's just your friends and your family or the people you work with You need to be the one that steps up and changes things that way they can see what is possible They may not see it in their own life or have people around them there It might take two to three you shouldn't understand. Yeah, but as long as you're living that example in your constant reminder eventually It's gonna catch on man. That's yeah, that's how I feel where I'm at right now people are people are starting to come around to it in my life Or people that are seeing me doing it and I would like I said I was probably a loser. I would say five years ago. Yeah, whenever I started, you know, taking more initiative and and Stop playing the victim. It's what it was. Yeah, thinking I was owed something and changing your story from being a victim to Overcoming the shit exactly. Yeah, bro. That's a huge deal man Change in your entire identity. I just posted about this today. It's it's it's about changing how you see yourself. I think that people People lack the ability to understand That who the reality that you're currently living Is actually the byproduct of somebody else that made choices for you Which happens to be a past version of you many months ago, right or even years ago and You don't have to accept that so when it comes to changing your identity and who it is you are you could actually change who you are right now The thing is though is that you have to back it up with those actions And that's what's going to change the reality 30 60 90 days from now or a year from now or two years from now or five years from now However big the play is you're trying to run and so that that's how I think about it. I think about it like If you want to be a different person you can be a different person today But you have to start having the different person behavior to produce the reality and that takes time And so like when people you know like because I was that guy. I was 350 pounds right now I'm looking at the mountain. I have to climb and I'm like fuck How am I going to climb this and I'm a climate just like everybody climbs everything One fucking step at a time and that's the reality dude and if we could plug in Every single person on this earth if we could take their finger and stick it in like an electrical socket And that they got a like they got like a one hour experience of what their life would actually be like What they would actually be like how they would feel how they would look how their relationships would be how their careers would be How their parenting would be how much better everything would be if they took care and took their mental Discipline and toughness games seriously because that's the core problem the core problem is your inability to make the correct decisions Consistently enough that is the core problem the problem isn't that you're fat The problem is you can't make the right decision when it comes time to eat The problem isn't that you're a drunk The problem is you can't make the right decision when you start to drink right? Yep That's the problem so we need to fix the core problem And if we could take every mother fucker on the planet and stick their finger and a fucking electrical socket that let them experience For one hour what it would look like to actually be the optimal version of themselves Every single fucking human on the earth would stop every single thing that they're doing And dedicate all of their time all of their energy all of their resources to becoming that instantly because that's how much better It is so if you're sitting there and you're like fuck I hate where I'm at I'm disgusted by myself good That's a great place to fucking start Now let's change that today and let's start following that up with the action and eventually And depending on how far you are away from it if you're 500 pounds could take a little longer But the reality is for the amount of time you've lived in this unacceptable version of yourself and you've been miserable the time to correct it is minimal In the big scheme of things and one year and I don't care who you are in one year You can change your entire fucking life and and and dude I see it every day. I see it by the thousands and At this point by the hundreds of thousands But I just wish we could come up with a way That would legitimately like make people like let people experience what they could actually be and be like Because dude you can't comprehend it when you're living that life dude when you're when you're drinking all that alcohol And you're that much overweight and you're looking in the mirror and you're like fuck I'm gross You put on your pants you know, they don't fit, you know You don't go to pool parties. You don't go to weddings. You know, you dread going out in public like all of these things This takes away from the human experience in such a drastic way And people get used to it. They start living in that reality and and it becomes their normal and they're just like well This is what I got no motherfucker. It's not what you got what you got is the potential to be because everything that you want to be And you're not exercising any of the actions that will materialize that potential in reality And if we could just get people to understand that as a whole Fuck dude The entire everything about the world will look completely different completely how people treat themselves How people treat others like Fuck I go on and on and on It would be literally like walking into first form Everything would be operating. It would be trash on the ground places. There are people Yeah, bro people would be taking this to yeah to go do the extra all the extra work. It's just That's cool. That's what when I run for president bro. That's gonna be my campaign Yes, I'm visit first form and that's what it'll be like. I love it. Yeah, I love it. Yeah, we got some awesome people here man There's no doubt about that Everybody is super jacked just see y'all know everybody is walking around just jacked If they're not super jacked they have a tremendous story of where they came from right? They're working on it It's amazing. Yeah, everybody here works hard. Yeah, it's badass. It's a great place to come every day. I wake up dude. I legit It's one of the things I think about literally every day. I'm like fuck dude. How Lucky are you to come to a place every single day where everybody's trying everybody cares everybody's trying to be better just to be in that environment It's it's amazing. Yeah, feel very fortunate to be in that situation Okay, I'm proud to be a part of it. I'm a part of the Legion air pro. Yeah, join me to Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, just a couple days ago really I passed the interview with Connor. Yes. Yeah, that's what's up. Yeah, that is what's up. I'm so excited. Yep I pretty much I think I sent signed up the same day I sent in my essay for the contest Mid-November. That's cool, man But yeah, just I mean you stand for what's right and for for our freedom and for our rights and you're taking a hit and you know I've ever you know want anything in return So for people to live to their highest standard and And support each other. I do want some things in return. Well, I mean, yeah I want some motherfuckers to actually go out and fucking do shit You know what I'm saying like I don't want you guys just to consume my shit and sit there and be a Successes on me or one of these weirdos that goes to every summit. This is why I got out of the seminar stuff Like I won't even go to the shit anymore because every time I go to one It's the same fucking people and it's like bro. You're the same. Yeah, the fuck are you doing? Yeah, it gets old man And by the way, I also want you to buy my shit. I'm just gonna be real about that too Yeah, that's I'm giving value. I want to support me. Yeah, please You know, say it like I'm not gonna see her bullshit Yeah, I can fucking real, but you know, I tried to over deliver the value So I appreciate the fuck out of that man for both you guys. Yes, badass. Yeah, you changed my mind and my daughter's life in the same That's awesome man, you know process So it means a lot to me too. Yeah, for everything I used to it up for and never gave up all the stories You have of all the times where you could have yeah, and you didn't and then this has all been created And is still well those stories keep coming bro that like look dude if you're gonna be on the path It's a constant thing and this is why mental toughness and discipline is so hard man. It's it's and so it's so crucial You know, if you're gonna do anything man like whether it's building a life as a family or building a great family or building a great business or uh An organization a charity a church whatever whatever you're trying to do These things are abnormal. It's an abnormal thing. Just let's just take it from a life aspect right? It's an abnormal thing which is weird, but it's an abnormal thing To want to go out and be your best like that's the society we live in it's like you're looked at as a weirdo Yeah, you know, what do you mean? You don't want to do this? What do you mean? You don't want to do that? What do you mean? What do you mean? Yeah, like this is what we're supposed to do? Yeah, you know, and that's that's where I'm at now So it does there is a loneliness factor to it In terms of you can't really relate the same way that you used to be able to to everybody else But the people that you do connect with the people that are on that wavelength the relationships are much much much Deeper and better and that's something that like I'm very grateful for too So it does shrink your circle But it improves the quality of of those relationships at least that's that's been my experience same Yeah, I have far less people that I talk to on a regular basis But the people I do talk to are very Their quality individuals that contribute to what I'm trying to do and I contribute to what they're trying to do exactly Yeah, can I kind of I want to circle back on you know identity and habits and yeah Um, I you know, I mentioned that you know, I am recovering anorexic believe me close to you I had to go into rehab. I have spent thousands upon thousands of hours in a hard thing to beat Yes, in a chair with a therapist. I've been on PAXAL. I've been on you know, anti-depressants Nothing has rebooted me as fast as 75 hard Nothing so if somebody is looking for a pathway Somebody's looking for a program to create a new identity and they become the best versions of themselves It is this it is this fucking program right here And I I mean, I was up against the darkest hours of my life I was up against the gnarliest depression I couldn't believe that I had fallen off the horse after 20 years like how could I be worse off than when I was in rehab Like this is crazy and to be rebooted in 75 days and to feel that like I said it's like the most powerful drug, but it's like what can't I do? Yeah, stoppable. Yeah Like so I just have to say if anybody is looking for a pathway It is this What do you think? What do you think about this though? Because this is something that people say and I experience this too What about when you're not on the program? Oh, so I'm miserable. Okay. I don't know about Chris But I am miserable. Can I tell you something so I was off of it and oh, I I hated it and the second I logged back in I'm February 1st literally and I go oh Thank God I felt home. Yeah, and I felt safe from myself. I felt safe again like I didn't it was like Here we go. Yeah, it's a go time. Yeah, and that's it's interesting because it's my favorite Do you do you agree with that or yeah? I'm good when I'm on it and I may have done a good job I want it, but I'm still not to the point where that that incorrect me all the way And it's not gonna correct somebody listening to this. I think it's just gonna be 75 days It's gonna be the rest of your life. Yeah, yeah, that's what I think is cool I charge version or boost to get you going is the 75 so yeah, well, dude That's what I think is cool about the program the way it's laid out is like you can adjust the program Um In terms of when you do the phases as opposed in terms of when you think you need it And that's where the awareness aspect comes in right yeah, like there's one thing to have awareness of your internal dialogue There's another thing to have macro awareness of your overall life where you can look at it and you can say all right I'm slipping a little bit a shit ain't on point. I don't feel right It's time for me to get shit broke back in for 30 days, right? And then you go back to the 30 days sharpens your blade you go back out there You fight a little bit your blade gets a little dull and you repeat that process over and over and over again And for me and I know everybody likes to have their own opinions of and that's okay But for me that's been the only way I've been able to maintain I've lost 110 pounds in 2016 And I have and I'm in the best shape of my life. I continue to get better and better and better um I wouldn't I've never been able to maintain like that ever And it's because of the awareness that I now have Because of what we're talking about you know people say well what about after 75 days Well if you go off the program, guess what if you did it right you're gonna feel like shit You know and that that shouldn't surprise you because you feel so good when you're doing what you're supposed to do That when you don't do what you're supposed to do guess what you're supposed to feel like shit So like it real lines your baseline standard in a way where like it's it's you can't you really can't live another way Unless you're totally abandon it completely and you just act like you never fucking heard of it over It's it's like a it's like one it's like one of those things like once you see it you can't see it You can't see at all at all in every area of your life right and it's um Yeah, I think that's like Even though it's a hard thing like when I'm not in it. I'm miserable But it's so good to know that this is home. Yeah, and I also know that when you are feeling off you know the solution Exactly, I can come back to home at any time and sharpen my and that is so Empowering because I can't tell you how many times I've done this program or that or I've sat with this therapist with that And it's just like you're just out in outer space like and I'm like There's nothing worse. There's nothing worse than being a place that you are Or in that dark hopeless doubt Growshtout with yourself place and then not know what to do about it. Yeah, like that's that's what creates the hopelessness That's what creates the shit where we're like well fuck. I might as well just give up You know and one of the things I like about the program is uh Is this aspect we're talking about because like dude once if you do it right you're kind of fucked You really are like there's no going back now. Yeah, when I told my husband it was day five and I go I'm in this for life and he goes he like goes I go well it's 75 days and the other ones are 30 30 goes okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's do this Let's do this and I mean it's a total part of our whole culture of our family now, you know, I mean My little girl my seven-year-old got up at 4 30 in the morning on the day I left that was yesterday. Did it was that yesterday? Yeah, you're going on no sleep dude. I'm on like two hours of sleep um and Did my 45-minute outdoor walk we're out the door by 5 a.m. I mean they everybody is just all hands on it's a It's a part of the culture of our family, but it started with me first Right, and it's like you always talk about it starts with us then our family then our neighborhood then our community city state country They're right. That's it. That's the fucking thing. That's the gym right there. Yeah, everybody wants I you know everybody wants to talk about what's wrong in the world But they don't want to address the source of it. Yep. The source of it is our own selves It always is it's always gonna come down to that And you can pretend that you're not a leader you could pretend that you don't matter You could tell yourself that no one cares, but those are all bullshit lies And usually they're they come from one of two places one you either have just beating yourself to the point or you've been beaten to the point By the world that you truly believe you're irrelevant, which is not true. Yep. Okay, you have drastic amounts of relevance and importance and contributions to make that you're not being able to make because you're living this life that is just so below your standard and you become accustomed to it um Or two they think it's someone else's responsibility and there's some way there's some other way to fix it I don't know how to fix I don't know how to fix the world without fixing the individual. Yeah, I mean, I don't how can you do that? You can't yeah So like and the cool thing is is people then people will say well You can't fix the whole world. Okay, that might be true But what if you start to live a better life and what if all the people around you become aligned with the path that you're on and now your entire world is that way It makes life a lot better a lot You know because you're dealing with people who are aligned who are pushing you or helping you We're picking you up when you're down. We're making your life better as opposed to just some drinking buddies You know, and by the way, I like my drinking buddies But I don't want to be around them all the time because we're not on the same path so I think one of the best things that came along with doing the program is they like people probably look at you and see You don't really if you took a loss it's not as big of a deal or maybe it is a huge deal But it doesn't affect you as much as it would have Earlier in your business or in your life and even for me, especially I've noticed I would dwell on things that were weren't gonna matter in a few days or whatever I went to spread them out for months. Mm-hmm. How something I was able to just You you're able to handle and able to work through what you're dealing with a lot faster So it doesn't seem like as much of a loss as you would if you weren't controlling the things that you are You're capable and you're able to yeah with the water and the workouts. Yeah, all the things that you put in your brain Yeah, that's one thing the one of the best things. I can't I've got out of the program Yeah, dude. It does you know We have to recognize the importance of what Chris is talking about because what Chris is talking about here is reducing the amount of time That it takes for you to realize that when you take a loss that there's a lesson there and if you can become more aware And reduce the amount of time that you dwell or feel frustrated or angry or stressed because you had a loss You have more time moving forward The right to move forward the right way and so a lot of people do that bro They take a hit or they have a problem or they get sick or they go through a divorce or they have a business problem And it takes some years to get out of it when in real real simple terms if they would just say hey Okay, this is what happened. This is what I learned and I'm gonna move forward not worrying about that anymore And I'm just gonna get back to it and I think that's uh that's part of You know coming up with the uh start back from day one the next day. Yeah, right which You know people either do or they know right. I see that a lot. I see a lot of people like oh, I feel 75 on my trial again Two months. No, that's not the point. Yeah, the point is get back at it tomorrow um But yeah, dude, I agree with that 100% I agree with that It's very helpful though if somebody's dealing with that and they have a whole you know history of having the I mean most That's probably most people yeah, they take their losses and it's take them too hard. Yeah, and they dwell on it because their identity Yeah, I'm a loser. Yeah, right. That's their whole yeah, and they try to it's just a race to the bottom Yeah, I like how would you talk about yourself, dude? You talk about how I was a loser Yeah, because you know, you're not anymore, right? It's fucking cool exactly. I noticed that right away the first time you said it So so let's talk about this for a second and then we'll uh we'll kind of get into some final words You know Can you guys talk a little bit about how you've noticed the impact of the characteristics and the skills of discipline grit fortitude perseverance In other areas of your life besides just this after the program How has this affected your life? In every in every way I'd take pride in everything that I'm doing now I'm walking around if there's trash on the ground picking it up if there's a cart that's out next to me I'm putting it away and that translates into every other aspect where I'm spending Every little time any little time I have with my daughter or I'm finding something to either Talk to her about if I'm not in town or just any little detail with that or also whenever I'm at work It's translated to that where I'm trying to do the best job just so it's looking good for me And as well as the people that I'm working for directly because I'm working under a contracting company And I'm out as a contractor So I'm representing Several people basically so it's just a matter of taking pride in everything that you do and it just you do the extra work You are showing up on time, you know looking proper and then just Doing the extra going extra mile basically everything everything and how do you feel about yourself living that way? You got you take you have You know, it's immense confidence you feel superior. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, people don't like that shit. They think you're better. You think you're bet no motherfucker. I know I'm better I'm doing all the shit you won't do. Yeah, so that's that sorry about it Yeah, I like that. Sorry. I'm not sorry either man. Fuck you do the shit. Yeah, that's how I feel too brother Like I'm with you. That's why I said that because I want people to know what you're really saying what you're really saying is I do the shit that you motherfuckers won't do so I feel great about myself and you don't That's what you're saying. Yep, right or wrong. That's what I'm saying What do you think? Yeah, it um You know, I Did this program so that I can show up for me and then I can pour into my family and my girls And my husband and my friends. I mean, I was so absent and not locked in and um, it just it bleeds into every aspect of my life, you know So yeah, everything is done like I just I always start the day the score is zero and you got to get to 100 And if you get to get to 100 you failed right and so I'm gonna stay at home mom. I run our house I you know, I'm in charge of a lot of stuff that makes you know my husband's world go round my two daughters world go round And it's like I got to be locked in and it just um and then I think too like Having integrity in every area of my life, you know and not Lying to myself and not just doing 80% or 70% here, but it's a hundred percent in every area and and once you do that And you talk about this it just manufactures your momentum it manufactures your momentum and confidence in like Oh, there's nothing that can stop me at all, you know, so Um, yeah, it's it's the best and then you know, I don't I'm sure you do I think we all do We have like a little Andy on our our shoulder all the time, right? Like you see you see trash on the on the on the sidewalk You better pick that up, you know what I mean or anything, right? I just you you become a better human you just do so Thank you. Yeah, thank you for this program. No, man. Thank you guys for like taking the initiative to fix your lives Like that's what we need we need the we need people to show people at scale What it looks like to live a higher standard and that's that's where we need like you know people sometimes get confused about How all these shows fit together with personal development and what's going on in the world And it's like bro, we're trying to make the world better, right? And you have to understand that all of us have a personal responsibility and obligation to contribute to that And when we look at you know all of these problems It's really easy to say well, that's not my fault I didn't do that this that the other but the truth of the matter is is we all are responsible for the state of the world When we aren't living at standard when we're walking by that grocery cart Or we're not picking up that trash or we're not following Some sort of a healthy program for ourselves or we're you know a hundred pounds overweight and thinking that that's okay It's not okay, bro Because it's not just about you You're hurting other people you're lowering acceptable standard for everybody around you Which is going to cause them to be miserable and cause them to be unhappy and cause them to be frustrated And dude if we want a better world we have to take responsibility for our Place in the world which is to set an example for other people That's all we can really do we can't make other people do things. I mean But we can't inspire other people to do things by showing them what it's like to overcome And this is when we talk about the victim culture identity that a lot of people live in It's easy to live there because there's no work But it's incredibly painful because you have to live in this prison Knowing that you know Not really that fucked up, bro. You're just not trying and that's the reality for most people Most people just are not fucking trying that hard and they say I'm trying real hard. You don't know. Okay. What's eat today? Yeah, what'd you drink today? How's your train today? Oh, I didn't train at all. Okay. Well you ain't fucking tryin man. What'd you read? I didn't reach shit. I scrolled Instagram all day. Okay. Well Like I said, you're not trying you are not trying because you are abandoning the things that you can control And saying I have no control, which is a lie. It's not the truth um Well, that's another one of the best things about the program is that it forces you to effectively manage your time and see all the day That you're wasting That's a huge deal It works for me people say oh, I don't have time for it. Yeah, you actually have way more time You have to be so dialed. Yeah, so dial when you're when you're that dialed in you realize how much time you waste It's crazy. Yeah, it's so good. I remember the first time I did it. That was like my big revelation. I was like holy shit Yeah, that's yeah, I have way more time than I thought I had the lies right yeah 100% that was a big one that I didn't see Yeah, is it that point in time, you know, I was extremely busy with with our companies and I really felt like I didn't have the time, but I did yeah once I broke it down. Yeah, so well you I mean once you're aware of that yeah, I'll catch myself now if I'm just sitting around Scroll my phone. I'll force myself to get on my treadmill at my house. Yeah, or sometimes it like I'll just be doing it like I'll just It's almost like seconds me to rush from a throw it. Yeah, I catching myself do this and it's just like you talk about how One day we need to look at cell phones like smokers. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's just hopefully I think I said that even just yes, I said a number times. Yeah, you said it today. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a day to it's true Yeah, I think one day we're gonna look at cell phones of technology and say this is a predatory technology that stole our lives It created a false reality that isn't even real And we're gonna look at it and people are gonna say dude you still I'm fucking you're still on social media bro Yeah, like I think that's where we're gonna end up Eventually because dude we're seeing we're seeing a lot of the young kids starting to like go away They're getting these cell phone blockers the block all the apps on their phone And they just want a simple phone a flip phone or I saw an ad the other day for this device that apparently is pretty Pretty popular with young people. I forget what it's called. It's like the block or something I can't remember but it's a device you put on your phone to block out all the distractions and Apparently that's a thing with like a lot of the younger people So I think they're even starting to recognize that you know already having heard of that. Yeah, which is cool So We'll end with this and I want to hear from both of you guys we talked earlier about What it would look like if we could stick you know the image of someone's highest potential in their brain and let them experience that For let's say an hour or a day all right and I'm curious knowing what you know now and whichever one you wants to go first is fine with me What would you say To the version of you before The way you were before and you you are you now what would you say to that past version of you To get them to step up and step into the the true power that they have as an individual. What would you say I think the main thing that hit me hits me is they're When they're pulling a bunch of old people there They're biggest regret as always how they the time that they didn't spend with their kids And that's so that's one of the main things that turned me around is that That's the most important thing in my life. I didn't I grew up without that figure in my life So I know what that's like and I don't want her to have to deal with that and I think that Maybe realizing that sooner because like I told you earlier. I feel like I'm on like a Like a time limit. Maybe I don't know what it is. Maybe she's because she's almost 18 or if it's maybe she's gonna get married eventually or something I'm running out of time brother. We are on a time limit. Well that yeah We are on time right so I'm just trying to make the most of it You're just aware of it. Yeah, yeah, and that's one thing that people once you get on this journey You can't there's no looking back. It's just a matter of you know, it's you're gonna have to understand that it's gonna suck It's gonna the price is gonna be different every single day You just have to keep going into it and doing each thing that you need to do no matter what that costs each day And but it's I mean it's probably intimidating looking at it like that But it's it's gonna be something that you're gonna regret not doing sooner That's the same thing with the program Whenever I did those episodes every day. I was talking about Just pick a diet and pick a book and get started tomorrow Quit waiting around till there mean after the your your event or your holiday or all this crap that people put off doing things for To just get started Like you said you can change yourself right now And you I mean so starting the program tomorrow would be the best bet for anybody listening to this Where are you? Yeah, if I could go back knowing what I know now um The first thing that comes back to me is just like go do it now Because what I would always fall into was I'm not ready And I can't tell you how many times I have passed on so many opportunities Career advancements whatever the kid I'm not ready and how that just absolutely was like Like chipping away at my soul and my self-esteem and my confidence And the universe just pounding on my door like Carly you gotta go now like there's not as much time as you think Your kids are growing your your husband's getting older you're getting older stop Warming the bench of your own life right and so fucking go Here's here's the pathway 75 hard live hard fucking go and you'll figure it out on the way in You don't need to know all the details you don't need to know if if it's gonna work on a Saturday night or a Thursday when you have all Just fucking go. It's gonna figure itself out That's what I would tell myself. I love that. Yeah. I mean, it's just the fucking truth because The time is now. Yep. Yep Well guys, I appreciate you guys making the trip in and coming on the show. Thank you for having this has been amazing more more than that I appreciate you Taking responsibility for your own lives and understanding that it's more important than just you because it's not just you It's about everybody around you and everybody around them and everybody around them And the ripple effect of the a change that we need in society has to start somewhere and it Believe it or not no matter how irrelevant or how small or how insignificant you might feel now You have no understanding of the change that you are capable of creating in the world until you start to live at the best possible You Standard and you guys have decided to do that and the impact is real And you see it in your own lives and we've heard about it for the last you know 90 minutes or so Um, and I'm just very appreciative of that. It means a lot to me It means a lot to a lot of people listening, you know a lot of us here We're all hungry for a better world a A better existence a better culture a better society And to see people step up and take responsibility for their own lives knowing That that's their role It means a lot to me personally. So you know, I appreciate you guys making the trip in but I really appreciate that part of it Thank you so much. Thank you for having us. This has been an absolute dream come true. Thank you for leading the way Yes, 100% a lot of this you guys are leading the way. Well, I'm not leading the way This has gotten so big now bro that it's you guys that are leading the way it's you guys listening that are leading the way It's not me bro. It's you guys And if you guys would think about it like that and start really understanding That it is you it's you it's not me. It's not some dude That you hear on the radio. It's not some dude with the microphone or some followers. It's fucking you You are the solution You are the reason that shit is fucked up and you are the reason that it will cease to be fucked up If you choose to go follow through with living the highest standard the best version of you Because the potential that every single individual has listening to this Is beyond your own comprehension at this point you're never going to know what you're capable of You're never going to know what your life is like until you go out and commit to building that And it is very very important that any of you struggling any of you sitting there right now saying he's not talking to me No, I am talking especially to you Okay, so understand your life matters your role in this world matters And it is a personal responsibility and obligation for any of you that care about the health of this country To go out and live the proper standard and I'm sitting in front of a bunch of individuals here because it's not just these two It's the other people in this room that do that On a daily basis and and that makes me incredibly hopeful for the future So don't thank me bro Thank yourself because you fucking did that and you did that and you guys out there listening you did that I didn't do shit. I get you guys sending me messages every fucking day Thanks for everything you did motherfucker. I didn't do anything I said some words into this fucking microphone bro You know what I'm saying you guys did the work and that makes you the leaders So if you can understand that you are the leaders Things can really change. So let's leave it at that We're from sleeping on the floor now my jury box froze fuck up. Oh fuck a stoke counted millions in a cold bad bitch Booted slow got a own bank row can't fold does it know?
