Q&A man and uh yes I got some good ones for you all right all right let's knock these out Andy guys question number one Andy Andy I used to be a useful idiot until the covid vaccine round two messed me up I've been dealing with my decision for almost two years now besides the point my old friends uh I left behind when I realized and came to what was actually happening I found your show I shared the show and I've lost more friends along the way but I have gained more because of it now I have a few of those old friends coming back around I hold so much hate in my heart for them because of how they treated me I'm not really sure how to move forward with them do you have any input well I can understand that I experienced as you can imagine an enormous amount of hate myself you know this is not just within my friend network and DJ you know this is true too you know we get on here every day and say this in front of millions of people all right we have eight figures of downloads every single month on this show um so I understand the hate it was vicious it was fucking mean it was under lens it was bullshit yeah okay and I I too have resentment for a lot of the people and a lot of the shit they said and I've had very few people apologize there's been some people who have apologized but not many right people are just assuming that we'll forget and I can tell you for sure I will never forget I will never ever ever forget my friends and my family who called me up on the phone or wrote messages to me on Instagram or the followers who fucking said hey you're uh you're you're you know unhinged you're you're a conspiracy theorist or you're this or that and call me all these names for fucking years so I understand that but here's the thing I also understand that what we were dealing with at the time was the biggest propaganda campaign that had ever existed in human history and if you think about the internet being new technology you have to understand that this was the first time that the internet was fully utilized for its propaganda potential and so they weaponized this technology that hasn't been around very long and people had never witnessed it before and I think that we have to be reasonable that people have an expectation that is very reasonable that the people who are on TV who are the quote unquote experts are actually acting with their best interests in mind and it has come to be shown over the course of the last three and a half years to most people that that's not the case and so I do have animosity and bitterness towards a lot of these people but at the same time I also feel sorry for them because just like you you fell for it when I was trying to warn you okay and now you're dealing with the ramifications and I feel like you know a lot of these people are people who had reasonable expectations to not be lied to and when they were lied to they reacted poorly and you know here's something that I think about a lot is that if you think back to the COVID hysteria and the way people were and then you think back to the argument of what would you have done during the Holocaust right everybody likes to say oh how could this have happened I would have stood up no you wouldn't you would have been one of the people saying take them to the fucking concentration camps and a lot of people are going to have to live their whole lives knowing that they're on that side of history you were wrong other people were right and people like us people who were spreading the message from the beginning are legitimately responsible for stopping what probably would have been a genocide and the reason for the genocide was to remove the resistance and if we look about what happened and the language that was used and the actions that were taken I fully believe that that was their plan you know I believe that they believe that the amount of people that were going to resist were much smaller than what actually resisted and that they plan on disposing of those people they plan on imprisoning them or eliminating them and they there was many places in the world that actually put people in actual camps there are places here in the United States that were building camps and we had leaders like Justin Trudeau saying what are we going to do with these people we had our president saying these people we have a pandemic of the imvaccinated these people should be shunned from society they should be you know basically shamed and and you know we had all these things happening bro the rhetoric was insane go back and watch it and I think if people didn't you know see what was happening they would have been ushered off and disposed of and and for the reason of disposing of people who were going to stand in the way of the 2030 agenda which is what ultimately they're trying to do so you know I don't have an answer for you I don't think people should forgive and forget I think people should be very cognizant and aware that those same people who said that you know the imvaccinated people shouldn't be putting society the imvaccinated people are are grandma killers and they're dangerous and you know all of these people you have to remember that was psychological manipulation and those same people are capable of being psychologically manipulated again into the same actions or even worse actions and so I don't subscribe to this idea of forgiven for getting moved forward I subscribe to be aware understand that they were manipulated and if they take responsibility for being manipulated like this person has is asking the question then we can move forward but I I personally after witnessing that and witnessing what's happened from covid to the vaccine to black lives matter to you crane to now what's going on in the middle east I'm very very very aware that there's a large number of people that can be psychologically manipulated into literally murdering a large percentage of people that they don't agree with and I think you know that's very dangerous and I think it's something for all of us to be aware of and continue to fight continue to work towards shining the light on how we were all being manipulated to fight each other and so when we look at the situation as a whole we have to remember that you know the only way they can maintain power over us is by dividing us and getting us to do these kind of things and this is why we see this same pattern over and over again you know we saw with covid we saw with the black square so it was two sides yes right it's this or that and pick a side and if you don't pick a side your piece of shit that that never yeah you can't even stay neutral no bro they don't allow you to so you have to stay neutral and you have to look at them right and their fucking eye and say I don't give a fuck okay and that's where I'm at I don't give a fuck what you think about me I'm going to say what I think I'm going to say what I'm observing and you could call me any mother fucking name in the book see the best things happened to me over the last three years is that I have become highly conditioned to being called names I don't care anymore I don't care I have no fear I don't give a fuck what you think which gives me the freedom to say whatever I want to say okay so if we could all get to that point and we could all get to that point where we say hey fuck you all right things will change in this country but they use fear to control us and they use the fear of social rejection and social outcasting and mob mentality to keep us from speaking the truth because when we speak the truth and we say I don't give a fuck what you call me they lose all their power okay like when people call me shit on the internet and I'm like yeah okay what can they do right right they're punching air so like be okay with that who cares you know the truth yeah I'm trying I'm this is about solutions this is not about who's right in the moment we have too many people out here trying to be right and then spouting misinformation and spouting bullshit and propaganda because they want to be right because they weren't famous before COVID like how many social media influencers do we have that nobody knew before COVID who now have a brand have a page have an away to sell t-shirts and they're monetizing that as hard as they can and at the same time propagating the the misinformation that's intentionally put out like we talked about on on last Friday show the atrocity propaganda these these tales that have been proven to not be true right and they do this because they want to get license clicks and shares and then you know they become upon for the overall propaganda machine and and dude I think it's shameful I think a lot of these people who claim to be freedom fighters and claim to be for the people and claim to be about America or not they're about themselves and it's evident by the way that they regurgitate information and try to be first so that they can sell some fucking shit okay that's not why I do this guess what motherfuckers I was pretty famous before this started people knew who I was I had the number one entrepreneur podcast on the motherfucking internet okay I was also rich okay before this happened that's just real I'm not bragging I'm just saying state and facts I've been working for 20 years to build my life and now I'm in a position where I thought this whole entire time I'd be able to live my life in peace right this whole time I've been working I've been thinking fuck dude all right I'm gonna get my forties I'm gonna fucking enjoy my life okay and you guys know this you listen to my show remember when I have been talking to you guys about how I was gonna buy a second place in Florida and do all this shit well you know what that's not happening now you know why it's not happening because I have to take on this battle now because if I don't take on this battle and I don't come in here and fucking do this work which I do for free by the way then I'm afraid that you guys who have always listened to me for years and years and years and years and years will never have the opportunities that I had to build a life that I have which is my whole entire teaching prior to this happening yeah so like understand there is a difference between people who actually want to solve this problem and create a freer better America for the future generations and then there's a lot of motherfuckers that are just existing because this is the only identity they've ever been able to create for themselves and they don't give two fucks if they're right or wrong they care about the reaction and the attention because that's the economy that we live in so to answer your question and around about way I don't forgive people for the way I was treated because it was horrible I had people break in my house I had people try to assault me I've had to arrest I don't know what a dozen people over the last few years okay for harassment all kinds of shit I've had to put up with for having this voice and for speaking the truth and it's been frustrating because I haven't been able to get you guys fully engaged behind me to speak with me because if it was you guys and me and all of us they couldn't do anything about it but because you're scared and you're probably scared of some fucking dumbass and your family who talk shit to you for 10 years because they don't want the fuck they're talking about and they shame you for everything you've been conditioned for silence and if we would all just wake the fuck up and we would all just say you know what I'm done with this I'm gonna say what I think just like Andy saying what he thinks and we're gonna stop this shit the shit will stop okay so that's what I'm waiting for it to happen I'm waiting for everybody to engage and join in and preach the fucking message of real American freedom okay I am tired of innocent people dying I'm tired of our families being taxed in the poverty I'm tired of our economy being shit I'm tired of being taken advantage of I'm tired of being manipulated I'm tired of being purposefully enraged I'm tired of the division I'm tired of the hate our life is not supposed to be this way our life is supposed to be peaceful and pleasant and filled with opportunity enjoy and because we are led by a bunch of greedy fuck tyrants we aren't allowed to have that life our whole entire life gets stolen from us that's what I'm aware of I'm in my 40s now I'm not 25 I'm not 35 I'm in my 40s time is more valuable when you get a little bit older and when you start to realize what's actually happening what's actually happening here is that they are stealing our fucking lives that we will never get back okay and that matters to me I'm not here to fight this fucking battle because these people are evil fucks we're here to fucking live life and make this place a better place and we're not able to even do that because these people are such shit bags anyway I don't forgive any of them they all need to be held accountable at the highest level your friends and family they're useful idiots they don't know any better I don't forgive them either if they come around and they apologize and they admit they're wrong and they join the team great I can fucking forgive that but trying to pretend that like it didn't happen or they didn't say this shit I'm not with that shit bro own your shit say you're sorry apologize to people that you fucking insulted okay and then we can work together moving forward to fix some of this shit going on and until that happens this these operations will continue to happen over and over and over and over again and they'll continue to destroy our lives you know absolutely bro absolutely guys into question number two mr. Fissello this shit is good yes it is does taste like a squirt you want to squirt what was it you don't even know what squirt is bro I know what fucking squirt what is it so does they're fucking great so yeah it tastes like squirt I personally like the mellow yellows I think they're underrated you ain't never had a mellow yellow bro I fucking love mellow yellow bro and the only place that I know the still serves it on fountain is like pin station pretty good mellow yellow is good bro it's pretty fucking good yeah I'm pretty sure like I saw some shit about the dye or whatever they using that you know it's whatever but yeah well they put actress in our water it makes our balls shrink so I'm pretty sure whatever the fuck is in mellow yellow is probably not that bad hold on yeah what still good yeah well just being honest guys any question number two mr. Fissello I am in my first year in college and I'm part of a division one track team one of my dreams is to become a professional track athlete but I am not a naturally gifted athlete I had to work very very hard to be in the position I am in now I struggle with comparing myself with others in this sport I have to be compared to others but I believe it rules more of my head space than it should how should I begin to attack the issue um you should attack at the same way you've been attacking it here's what you have to understand there's talented people and then there's people with less talent that have to work very hard and the people with less talent that have to work very hard if they actually do the work end up being much better than the people with just talent alone when you're young and especially in sports but this applies to business or anything else in life when you're young and you have talents you assume that you're gonna continue to be good and you assume that you're gonna continue to perform at a high level and what happens is you never learn how to actually follow that with the work ethic and we see this over and over again in professional sports and all kinds of areas of life we were just talking about this yesterday and I walked up some of being athletes in high school and I you know going back like yeah yeah yeah yeah allowing just talent yeah but what I'm saying here is that the people who have the work ethic who have less talent end up producing much more than the people who just have talent all right because the people who work they develop the work ethic early because they have to to compete and then that work ethic sticks with them and they continue to push and push and push and push and eventually their skill set gets to the level of the talented person which is the max level for the talented person but is a mediocre level for the person who wants to continue to work and so when ends up happening is kind of like what happened to Tom Brady all right Tom Brady gets drafted at the end of the NFL draft reason he got drafted at the end of the NFL draft is because he wasn't as talented as a lot of the other players but during his high school and during his college years he developed this insane work ethic and that insane work ethic he kept while he was playing professional sports and he continued to improve and get better and better and better and better and better and now is considered probably the greatest NFL player ever by most people look at Michael Jordan Michael Jordan got cut from his high school basketball team the reason Michael Jordan got cut from his high school basketball team is because he wasn't as talented as the other players so what happened to him he understood I have to work hard I have to do things that other people aren't willing to do and because of that he developed this insane process for improving himself and over the course of his career he kept on that process and he got better and better and better and better and better and better and he now he's the greatest basketball player that's ever lived and some people consider him the greatest athlete that's ever lived so none of these people that you consider the greatest of all time whether it be sports whether it be business whether it be anything are the most talented people these are people who who had a little bit of talent but had the work ethic to attach to so the fact that you're one of those people is a gift the fact that you're someone who doesn't have the raw talent that everybody else has around you is a gift if you match it with the discipline and you match it with the work ethic you're going to go 10 times further than any of these other people because when they max out they won't know how to get any better and you'll never max out because you'll continue to get better and better and better and better and better the longer you go so obviously there's limits on physical capabilities as you go but here's the cool thing about this process when you develop this work ethic and you develop this process of understanding that if I work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work I win that starts to apply to anything and this is why we see you know Michael Jordan come out of basketball and become a multi billionaire okay this is why Tom Brady comes out of football and is going to become a multi multi billionaire with all the projects he has going on all right yeah this is why I'm successful okay I I was nothing special I was never fucking special I wasn't considered smart I wasn't considered exceptional I wasn't anything I was just someone who was a little bit had a little bit of drive and a little bit ambition and knew that I didn't want a regular life and I worked and worked and worked and worked and worked and worked and worked and worked and I have a skill set of the process of the work now that's its own skill set okay now I'm going to continue to get better while all of my friends who are the same age as me who might have had an advantage or rich parents or investors or this or that they're ticking their feet up on a fucking beach in Costa Rica while I'm up here building the fucking empire you see what I'm saying so like this shit if you're one of these people who is not gifted with the natural talent and the natural ability but you understand that you can work to develop it you're you're the right kind of person to become great that's the people that become great we have this misconception that people think that greatness is like something you're born with or it's something that you're gifted and it's absolutely not there's a lot of great players who were gifted with greatness who never became great because they couldn't figure out that they needed to do the work with it so don't be discouraged all right you're on the right path you're understanding exactly what you are and exactly what you are is the best kind of person to be it's someone with a little bit of talent a little bit of skill that allows them to compete in the game but also in understanding that for them to be great they have to work their fucking ass off and that person those are the people that people write books about the change industry the change sports the change the world it's not the person that was born with the most talent it's the person who has a little bit of talent and then pairs it with the insane work ethic I love that man I love that I feel like also too right like would you agree that you know if you're one of these people you you truly do have to buy in to whatever goal that is if it's running track like you know Michael Jordan the reason he had to learn how to work hard is because he really wanted to play fucking basketball yeah you know what I'm saying so I feel like a lot of people they're not even committing to that overall objective to begin with before the hard work even starts yeah with those people don't have a chance yeah you have no chance at that you have to make a decision on what the fuck you're gonna be it's not just for nothing it's not just show up and work for nothing because here's the thing the the goal that you want for yourself has to be so real and so vivid and you have to be so obsessed about it that you are willing to suffer more than everybody else to achieve it that's the reality of achievement you have to be willing to suffer when everybody else gives up you have to be able to endure when everybody else packs it in and this is what creates greatness and without that vision of what you're trying to be without that conscious decision that I'm going to do this no matter what the fuck happens you can never achieve it because you don't have the motivation to stick through the hard times when everybody else quits that's how it works I love it guys Andy our third and final question Andy question number three Andy in my long care business my leaders at the top are completely bought into the mission and vision and that rolls downhill with most of those under them these past couple of years as the labor market has gotten even more cutthroat since covid I've noticed that some of our newer hires aren't as quote unquote bought in and they seem to just be here for the benefits themselves not the company as a whole we are the highest paying company in our markets with the best benefits in our industry 401k health four day work week etc and we treat our team extremely well are people just that entitled now or are we missing something you're missing something all right you're missing the understanding that if you make it too cush and too easy in the beginning people will take advantage of you all right so they have to learn that if they work they will be rewarded and if you give them the reward upfront without them having to earn it they're going to act as you're describing so here's the solution the solution is stop treating them like they've already won before they've won all right figure out a way to compensate them and then paint a vision for their progress that they can achieve within your company and make that vision so big that whatever vision they have for their own lives they can fit that underneath your vision right if you're trying to cut lawns and that's all you're going to do is cut a few neighborhoods these people are not going to be motivated they're not going to show up because they're going to realize that you know all I'm getting is all I'm getting now and what difference does it make if I work any harder so we have to create a scenario where they're driven to work harder to achieve their own dreams and so what does that mean for you that means your vision has to become so large that they can easily say well fuck dude if I work hard within this vision I can afford the house I can afford the car I can afford the life I don't need to be you know worth a hundred million dollars but like bro I can live in a nice hood I can fucking drive a nice car I can go out to dinner at nice places if I just help build this vision okay so you're probably lacking that aspect in your business and then you're turning around and blaming it on people for being lazy you're you've actually got it all fucked up all right stop rewarding people when they first come in day one yes take care of people yes do the right thing yes be fair but don't over deliver because then they don't have any motivation to work and then on top of it create a scenario where they can very quickly move up the ladder by executing and what you do there is you're you're creating the behavior of achievement within the culture of your company and that's creating the drive right and then here's how this works other people that you hire they come into your company and they talk to you know let's say Steve who's been here for for two years and Steve's driving a decent truck and lives in a pretty nice decent house and Steve's telling the new guy bro when I started here I don't have shit okay I did this and this and this and I moved up and now I'm winning and that's going to inspire the new guy to follow that so then you create a culture of achievement within your vision so you're missing a few things all right you're missing the motivation built in you're missing the ability for them to achieve their dreams and you're mission you're missing most importantly your responsibility to paint the big vision for them to work within all right nobody's going to be motivated to to work for a a mowing long company if you're just like trying to get by for yourself if you're already made yeah that this is a common misconception amongst employers to employees all right a lot of employers believe that they're doing these people like a big service by just offering them a mediocre a shitty job you're not do you're not going to have inspired people by offering them you know a basic fucking level existence the way you're going to get people inspired is by showing them that they can achieve a whole lot more by helping you do what it is you're doing and then you have to follow up by actually allowing them and following through on your promise to them to provide for them the life that they're after does that make sense absolutely okay a lot of people fuck this up don't feel bad that you're fucking it up a lot of people do it yeah it's fun because when I was listening to you know like reading this question and then hearing you come to it like the word that came to mind is like man the leadership it just feels complacent well that's usually almost like a ride that whatever goal that they had as a company is leadership right like and is completely counted to how are you you know to describe the vision for all of your companies right like every single company you work or you run it's day one and every single one up yeah right and that vision is massive yeah I just I just felt complied like I've had to describe it in the way well people don't understand too strategically okay in the big picture that every company comes to a point where they're either growing or they're dying right and companies will grow grow grow grow grow grow get to a point where the founder or the owner is comfortable and then they start to regress and people can't ever figure out why that happens well the reason that it happens is because you're no longer growing and the people that you are in the boat with no longer want to row the boat because they don't see any forward progress for themselves ultimately people are selfish they care and by the way they should be they should care about what they're getting out of the deal and if you're not showing them that you're working to expand the business so that they can get more out of the deal how do you expect them to be inspired to row the boat you can't you can't fucking do it right man just a few things I've picked up over the years okay yeah I would save you guys your whole fucking business if you listen that question closely bro I feel like there's a lot of fucking maggots right there man that's fucking awesome boy doesn't know
