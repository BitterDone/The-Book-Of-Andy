if it provides a perspective that you think people need to hear and that is more important than ever right now do us a favor and don't be a hoe share the show all right what's up man what's going on man nothing new you know a little Saturday cruising yeah we are you know there is some interesting stuff happening you know it's been a while since we've done any like legit 10 foil stuff it's been a minute because most of the stuff like it's come true but yeah we almost got like throw the 10 foil out I know right I'm saving mine for Thanksgiving but I think I think it'd be a good opportunity you know to whip it out a little bit and I thought this was interested we'll have to get your thoughts on this so apparently and I don't know if they used AI or how they did these right but you have you seen like you know World War 2 recolored yeah right like they take those old you know World War 1 maybe but they take those old video clips and footages and pictures and they can like recolorize it and make it look you know nice so they did that with with the Titanic pictures with some of the old you know only existing photographs and needing some some video clips of the Titanic and I thought it was pretty cool they do look a little weird I thought it was pretty cool so incredible new colorized footage has given an insight into what life was really like on the Titanic news channel four documentary Titanic and color is airing this week bringing life into the stories of the passengers of onboard the famously doomed ship the RMS Titanic famously sank on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on 15 April 1912 with an estimated 2200 people on board the unsinkable ship had hit an iceberg just before midnight and as there were only 20 life boats on board 1500 people lost their lives that's a lot of fucking people but in the program relatives of those on board tell their untold stories while colorized photos and film footage gives a unique insight into daily life on the Superliner so here here are some of the the colorized colorized pictures okay this one looks like a cartoon I'm not gonna lie but like this one's pretty convincing like dude's working out back there yeah we're doing some rows in ripped yeah you know this like one of the pictures of like one of the interior uh state rooms there fuck it's out in the mirror that was a kind of creepy done it I saw that too I'm it looks like a G that looks like a ghost mm-hmm down mm-hmm this kind of creepy but like they got pictures of like old kids and stuff playing on the deck and yeah I just thought it was interesting but I could just maybe think man like there's there is a massive conspiracy about that about the Titanic thing oh yeah absolutely right because like it's sank in 1912 right you I mean like I mean I don't know if you guys have heard it but like there's some stuff and like I've tried to find only the only people that were opposed to the formation of the Federal Reserve were on the ship when it sank that's the only families that's a fact okay so there was five or six families that wanted to form the Federal Reserve and it just so happens that the families that opposed the Federal Reserve formation were on the fucking Titanic and we're to believe this is just a freak accident no come on man don't make sense and then what happened to tinfoil that's common sense and then and then almost a year later that's when the Federal Reserve that's right let's put it that's right and the families that you know this because they're doing like pull out of that trip the last minute or some shit like yeah they were all supposed to be on they were all supposed to be on that the last minute they pulled out you know and I don't I forget I pulled it up I put it up at one I think the if you do the you know bi-dynamics conversion on how much a price the ticket would have been back then it was equivalent to like 40 grand for like a decent oh it was a big deal it was like it was like going to the Super Bowl or it was like you know flying on the Concord back in the day if you if you were a big deal you did that yeah and that was a lot of very successful financial people on that on that on that uh that boat that ship um but yeah like you you look into it and even still today like people think the Federal Reserve is like a government organization no agency department absolutely not and it's completely private it's completely private and and so I looked into it a little bit more because like I was like you know we see some of the stuff but like I'm like you know always you know president would Joe Wilson he signed into into law with the Federal Reserve Act that was the end of America by the way it was yeah people don't understand that there was um but like who but like who like who suggested this again like there were families and big very wealthy families with some very common last names um that were all a part of it just read into this a little bit uh so there was a connection between the Roths childs and the Bank of England and the Lunding Banking houses which ultimately control the Federal Reserve through their stock holdings um and bank stock of their subsidiary firms in New York uh the two principal Rothschild representatives in New York uh was JP Morgan Company and then the Coon Loeb and Co uh those were the firms uh that set up the Jekyll Island Conference at which the Federal Reserve Act was actually drafted they're all there and those are I mean obviously the Rothschilds JP Morgan Co like they're all still very influential families even to this day that controlled well no shit they print the money for the globe ha ha the world's bang listen dude these those families have more GDP worth than the entire globe put together every country every person every fucking dollar that exists on the planet those families have more money than that okay and people don't realize that um I just thought that was they control everything yeah and they print they print the money for everything okay and this is what you know people think well our taxes go to pay this how are we gonna pay our tax well if our taxes go to pay that then why do they print so much motherfucking money okay they don't need us to pay taxes because they print whatever they want the reason for income tax is not to pay anything that they're trying to do it's to keep us financially oppressed so that we can only get to a certain level of success which makes us easier to control and that is not conspiracy that is the truth behind income tax income tax should be abolished the ability for these politicians to increase net worth off of kickback insider trading and all this stuff that they do needs to be stopped we need to quit being robbed and the federal reserve needs to be abolished a hundred percent a hundred percent and really dude the people behind it should go to fucking jail forever well I mean like my my question that I'll always have like even looking at like the IRS for example right the IRS is it's not like it was you know founded in 1776 it's a very fairly new system that's right that's right so my question has always been well what the hell what are you doing you know before 1913 then while we were building a country we were building a country we had we had we had money and the money flowed in and it flowed out and it flowed in and it flowed out like a truly capitalist economy is supposed to do we when we print money at unlimited amounts it devalues everything else and creates a system where our wealth is constantly being devalued all the time at the will of these people in Washington DC and so the I make money off the loss they make money both ways yeah bro these people listen man people do not understand how financially oppressed even the regular capitalist entrepreneurs like people might look at me and they're like what are you talking about you're not financially oppressed motherfucking you know how rich I'd be if they fucking were stealing my money you know I'm saying like you know hard I've had to work to fucking get here it shouldn't be that hard and that's why I fight for this shit I fight for this shit not because I want to come on here and make money I don't make any money on the show I don't take ads I don't get paid to go fucking I don't play this game bro I'm here to fucking wreck this system I hate these people let's get real fucking clear on this because they are robbing you young people who follow me for Q&A F and your entrepreneurs and you want to become successful they are stealing your opportunity to do what I have been able to do in my life and that that is not okay for me to stand by and say oh well I got mine fuck these guys that's just not what it that's not what I'm about bro I'm wired that way I fucking hate these people and you know you guys don't hate them enough that's the truth it's real man yeah I just thought I was interested bring that up I'm like you know this interesting timing and all that and there's always been controversy it's controversy because people are financially illiterate and they want to pretend like they they want to pretend like they understand finances when they don't really understand anything okay and if they would just take a minute humble themselves and look into what's actually going on instead of just repeating what the mainstream media tells them they have to say all the time you'd actually figure out that we are tax slaves in this country you can't tell me we're not okay every single one of you people working that pays taxes you work until August to pay the government if you work until August to pay the government before you actually start getting paid you work for the government whether you think you do or not and nobody considers that nobody stops and they say well I don't work for the government I only pay 30% no working well more hey dumbass what do you pay when you buy shit what do you pay when you own shit what do you pay when you got registered shit what do you got to pay when you sell shit okay it's not just income tax it's all these other taxes that combine we're taxed every direction we go with our money and it is financially oppressive and dude Donald Trump if he's really who he says he is should be abolishing the tax and completely but I'll take reducing it to a minimum level like 10% and firing all these fucks that steal our money and create these bureaucracies and create these systems that none of us can navigate have you tried to go get a driver's license or register your car it takes seven hours you see what I'm saying like dude they're all those inefficiencies that you hate when you go to the courthouse or you go to the the DMV or when you see these lazy workers just standing around you pay for that we're paying for that it's a fat bloated system that needs to be scrubbed and restarted that's the only answer to us ever becoming financially free in this country that's real man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think um that big step and let's get into this cruise dude what's his face from uh who's the young El Salvador president uh the 43 year old guy young guy you know I'm talking about it right to him dude did you see him come speak a CPAC he said this is CPAC he said you guys are under the illusion that your taxes pay for your government and that is not true you are taxed so that you are financially oppressed he says this and people are like oh my god he's such a hero motherfucker I've been saying this for 10 years other people say it too it's the truth okay and if we ever want a real America that actually serves the people we have to get rid of this fucking shit it has to be completely wiped out yeah guys you're gonna be on this conversation down in the comments uh let us know what you guys think that being said headline number one headline number one reads national association of black journalists faces and turn her iron there we go over Trump Q&A almost got me on that one iron iron yeah um so they couldn't use a word like that we all understand trouble backlash yeah oh black lash yeah probably couldn't use backlash but um oh man come on now I would have fucked that one up um let's dive into this so Trump did this this interview into this national organization for black journalists um he uh did it did a little stage talk with him um there was a Q&A session format had a couple of uh well I guess really just one notable person on the panel uh which was Harris uh Faulkner I like her she school Fox News contributor um Rachel Scott from ABC Kadea Kadea Goba from C-M4 um and uh there's been a lot of interesting things around this right um and in particular mainly with this these two right here with Trump and Rachel right I personally think Trump did fucking amazing in this you did I think you did great I think that he handled this well and I believe that in the last you know eight years or so of press coverage they've been giving them and you know his remarks I think this is probably his best one he's done and my personal opinion um well remember dude most of these press conferences that he does don't see the light of day right he does very well all the time yeah but true they don't show that unfiltered unedited correct yeah that's a fair point um you know but I thought he handled this really really well and then this lady uh she embarrassed her whole organization she made an ask of herself yeah she didn't like bad she did you know um and uh a lot of people agree with that a lot of people on the internet she was she was trying to to make a name for herself instead of actually trying to get to the issues yeah and right now in this country people care about the issues they're having trouble paying rent they're having trouble with the food they're having trouble with their day-to-day life people don't give a fuck about your identity politics fucking bullshit fake racism nonsense they're over it even black people are over it which is evidenced by the way they reacted to Trump in this situation yeah yeah well I mean I think too like you know she was just spouting pure fucking lies yeah you know I'm saying like easily debunkable lies to very easily yeah like it's not even like you know okay I don't know about that I let me reset like I know it's like that's been proven yeah like what she said uh what she say she said come on as always identified as black there's 75 videos that where she's bragging about being Indian and she's using the Indian heritage to pander to Indian Americans and now all the sudden because they let the black vote slip because they've completely alienated the black audience like they do every two in four years and finally because the internet is so fast and communication so obvious and so transparent the black community is finally realized at least a lot of the community that the Democrats are the fucking problem for them yeah they come in every year every two years every four years and they say hey guys those white people fuck it up for you Trump's fucked it up for you and then they're like cool we'll go for you go fix it and then they come in and say guess what they fucked it up again right like that's their whole platform and then in the meantime they get all of these things funded and then they steal the money you know so come out rich yeah that's right rich is filthy rich while are while are black American communities in the the urban communities are getting fucking destroyed yeah and people are tired of it people aren't going to give a fuck about these fake racism claims that they put on Trump when they can't fucking survive no or when they can't go outside because they're afraid they're going to catch a stray bullet are they're going to have to deal with people from fucking some other country who are criminals and have their little fucking gang going on there right like for their seeing them get thousands of dollars a month in support or seeing that what did you see that one in New York where that receipt went public and it had that that migrant had 13,000 fucking dollars in this count bro what was the account what was the fucking statistic I think it was like like almost like 80% of Americans don't even have like $500 they're doing they're doing for the migrants what they promise for the black people that's insane where those conversations about reparations that you know what I'm saying it's like listen man but anyway let's check this out so I want this first clip I got here this is how it all started all right this is this is this is what Trump walked into and and it's an awesome clip let's check it out I want to start by addressing the elephant in the room sir a lot of people did not think it was appropriate for you to be here today you have pushed false claims about some of your rivals from Nikki Haley to former president Barack Obama saying that they were not born in the United States which is not true you have told four congresswoman women of color who were American citizens to go back to where they came from you have used words like animal and rabbit to describe black district attorneys you've attacked black journalists calling them a loser saying the questions that they ask are quote stupid and racist you've had dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar-a-Laga resort so my question sir now that you are asking black supporters to vote for you why should black voters trust you after you have used language like that well first of all I don't think I've ever been asked the question so in such a horrible manner first question you don't even say hello how are you are you with ABC because I think they're a fake news network a terrible network and I think it's disgraceful that I came here in good spirit I love the black population of this country I've done so much for the black population of this country including employment including opportunity zones with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina which is one of the greatest programs ever for black workers and black entrepreneurs it doesn't so much and you know when I say this historically black colleges and universities were out of money they were stone-called broke and I saved them and I gave them long-term financing and nobody else was doing it I think it's a very rude introduction I don't know exactly why you would do something like that and let me go a step further I was invited here and I was told my opponent whether it was Biden or Kamala I was told my opponent was going to be here it turned out my opponent isn't here you invited me under false pretence and then you said you can't do it with zoom well you know where zoom she's going to do it with zoom and she's not coming and then you are half an hour late just so we understand I have too much respect for you to be late they couldn't get their equipment working or something I think it's a very nasty question I have answered the question I have been the best president for the black population since Abraham Lincoln better than president Johnson you sign the voting right back can you to start off a question and answer period especially when you're 35 minutes late because you couldn't get your equipment to work in such a hostile manner I think it's a disgrace let me just ask a follow-up sir and then we'll move on to other questions here I love it you know what I love the best he said that I felt was very genuine is when he said I have too much respect for you to be late no that is a grown man thing to say and do yeah you know like that kind of have to do shit bro he could show up and he could say you're fucking 30 minute fuck you and leave just leave yeah and leave yeah that's the thing I mean because he actually was invited to this uh twice before yeah one in 2016 one in 2020 um and scared me conflict I don't know why but you didn't go no there was a bunch of backlash about it yeah they didn't want them there certainly wanted them yes yeah okay but but here he is he shows up yeah you know shockingly they didn't start on time that actually is pretty funny shocky national organization for black journalism does not start on that I think I heard a smoke detector beep bro look man I love this and I'm trying to beep is that yeah look dude I love I love that he showed up it takes big courage he walked right in there he asked professional they tried to hammer him and of course they're spinning it like he was unprofessional look dude what's he supposed to say what's he supposed to say okay the media is lied about him in in these racist claims for years the guy has 20 something thousand employees he's been in business for 50 fucking years he's done more good than most people for America period because of the businesses he's creating the jobs he's created and the and what he's done for the economy people don't consider how hard that is to do as a single person you're putting your own world on your back and you're saying these people these people right here they're going to win because I'm gonna fucking make sure they win that's a true leader bro and when you have Kamala Harris who hasn't done shit ever which is verified fact okay and a lot of these people not not here in this room apparently but a lot of people out there upper middle class white people brunch people they want to vote for someone because of the color of their skin which is literally the lowest iq you know you can potentially make and the reason that these people do this is because they feel bad because they've never had any hardship in their life so if you've never had any hardship in your life then what difference does it make who we vote for we're gonna vote for who we like they don't take into consideration that this decision and this thing that they're rallying for and the only reason they're rallying for it is so that they can feel important in their empty miserable little lives is actually going to hurt the people that they're trying to advocate for and the people they're trying to advocate for the black community understands that they can no longer vote for someone because of the color of their skin we have to bring it back to meritocracy and I think Trump is really benefiting from that realization uh then I think all Americans are having yeah 100 percent man but I mean it didn't stop you know and of course you leave it up to mainstream media Trump attacks Harris's identity saying he didn't know she was black I didn't she she's not you got a clip of course yeah the clip's good let's check this out I've known her a long time indirectly not directly very much and she was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black so I don't know is she Indian or is she black she is always I don't know I respect either one but she obviously doesn't because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went she became a black just to be clear sir do you think I think somebody should look into that too when you ask a continuing a very hostile nasty a black person but you're laughing everybody's laughing bro the crowd and you know that that that lady is getting so pissed because he's just owning her on stage I was completely rector yeah and um but uh but it's also true it's also very very true and literally like I mean dude there is like you said there's hundreds of clips out there CNN did a whole segment on her Indian heritage yeah you know I'm saying like it's there this one has never identified with her black side yeah right until it's convenient when it's convenient and that's the thing I think this is discussions getting off track a little bit here because people are talking about race so much it's almost like Trump's base is getting sucked into the identity politics over this race issue with Kamala listen bro it doesn't matter if she's black or Indian no one cares I don't give a fuck I'd give a fuck if she can actually do the job but the problem is she can't do the job because we've already seen what kind of job she can do because she did it for the last four fucking years okay and the problem and the reason that race is relevant here is not because race is relevant it's because it's an exposure of her own character all right she is willing to deny certain aspects of herself to manipulate people that she wants to manipulate that is a character flaw that is how people should be looking at is not oh race they should be oh she's a liar and that's how people should be looking at this and and that should be it the race discussion I feel like a lot of people are getting sucked into it and losing sight of what the actual discussion is here the discussion here is Kamala's never done fucking shit and Donald Trump's done a lot of shit and we're in a critical point in our country anybody who's involved in business anybody who's involved in knowing anything about what's going on realizes that we are this fucking close to losing our country and regular NPC people like these people who you know the white dudes for Harris or whatever or like these these middle upper middle class white brunch women who think they're virtue signaling and fighting for people when they're actually harming people for their own attention these people do not understand how close we are to crumbling and they don't understand that if we crumble in the way that the people they're voting for want us to crumble that they are the ones that will suffer the most the quickest okay so it's it's really dude uh we're really suffering right now because there's a lot of ignorant people that's the truth yeah yeah man guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think I would say that anybody wants that you want to argue about Kamala and Trump I don't think the argument is her race or anything like that I don't I don't think that's irrelevant and I should be about policy that's right who and again who's done what when she was when she was senator that was uh I think it was like 164 bills that came through yeah and none of them went to law not one yeah not one and so I mean so like even even that alone wrote Biden like people are like oh if you say she's a DI higher you're a racist dude Biden straight up said my my vice president pick will be a black woman when he was pandering to the black Americans in 2019 yep fact check it dude not only that Biden also said I'm appointing a black woman to the Supreme Court okay that is DI that means someone is getting a job because of their skin color not because of their merit or their skill set or their history or their accomplishments Kamala is no different she is absolutely a DEI higher and if you want to see what damage that will do vote for her your life will be shit in another four years you you think that we have a legal problem now bro she's going to take the 15 to 20 million illegals that have been here get them to become citizens and they will all vote Democrat forever then she'll bring in 30 more million over the next four years okay so you think this is a problem now just wait all right America will will never be a capitalist country ever again if she wins and that's her intention she is an extreme Marxist communist her father was a Marxist instructor a teacher okay she grew up in this these other mother fuckers like Joe Biden and all these Pelosi's and shit they pretend to believe this shit just to get their power and get their way so they can do their insider trading and and rich themselves right Kamala is a true believer of these things okay when she gets in power bro it's going to be very harsh it's going to be just like every other communist situation that's ever happened in the history of of the world and people are gonna it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna kill people people will die they will become very poor people will starve and um you know if you don't believe that go read the book red famine if you don't believe that go go look at what the Bolsheviks did if you don't believe that go study your fucking history books but you won't because you're too fucking lazy to do it guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think oh that being said let's go cruise on yeah got a new nickname for your Andy oh really all right hmm let's hear it uh from uh j dot spencerton uh oh bro flag be triggered and that's pretty good that's decent yeah I give them that is better the snowflake as a good one take it I you know what bro flag you're my little bro flag baby you're you're my little co co bro flag yeah all right Jay hey you know what I can respect it that's a good one that's decent coming from that field man that's decent that's a good one that's a decent hey I give credit where it's due you bro flag how are you I don't know if you would say triggered I'm just passionate yeah that's all that is I don't get triggered no now now to another comment because you know I do listen I think it's important I think it's funny that people think because I'm intense and passionate that that's some sort of bad thing like do how would we be as a country if more people have the attitude that I had about their love and their passion for this country and people being free including j spencerton over here you know I'm saying maybe we would actually be free look a little different yeah a little different so you know yeah I do get pissed off but only reason I get pissed off is because I know what America could be for all of you and they're taking that away and you don't realize it so even though j spencerton he's having a little laugh here I can laugh too I'm fighting for you bro you still know it yeah now this next comment you know I think it's important for everybody to you know at least attempt to try to understand liberal logic and I tried and you failed and I need help I need help this comment comes well you know you know why right what it's because you don't know how to use a computer that's what it is yeah that's what it is you need you need the white liberals help I need to save your police hands me because this comment from Ken Boyle says just to clarify we vote for ticket president and vice president with the understanding that the vice president could possibly be president so to say we didn't vote for candidate is not correct did I say that oh what he's saying is okay what he's saying is wrong but yeah no what he said they like to talk about technicalities right so what he's there's a lot of arguments going on right now that there was a coup amongst the democrat party and nobody voted for her to select her as president as the democratic primary candidate but what he's saying is because they voted for as the vice president if something were to happen to Biden the people who voted for Biden understood that she would be president he's technically correct but wouldn't that be also admitting that something happened to Biden well yeah of course but the point of this is that in this situation no one voted for Kamala Harris to be the presidential nominee they voted for her to be the backup if something were to happen if the guy were to die if he were to have this administration that's correct and so now we're entering a new election cycle where a lot of the democrat party is very very upset with the Biden and Harris administration because quite honestly they lied about a lot of shit to these people so while he's technically you know correct there's another side to that coin and the other side of that coin is a lot of these people want something different and they didn't get an opportunity to vote for something different and we're okay with that a little bit later yeah so I get what he's saying but I don't I don't necessarily agree yeah all right but I I mean it's a fair point okay yeah I'm like yeah okay um this next one comes from at Christopher Cranes 54 61 he says bluegrass is why people's great and I think it is I think that's official I think it is that's why I like grape though if you got named Christopher said it's probably yeah probably true hey man dude I never understood the bluegrass shit like every like people drink a blue slurpees and blue gatorades and bluegrass and you all you motherfuckers drink a blue shit there's something wrong with your brains really yeah huh you like that you like blue stuff I like I'll drink half of it see if I have to pick bro I will drink I will drink red shit or purple shit over blue shit oh red red red red like if I'm getting slurpees or snow cone it's red red yeah I'll do purple all right but I'm not getting blue no right if I'm getting slurpee red's my choice and maybe root beer I'll do some red like that the red root beer slurpee pretty good and that's you know like root beer no white people shit isn't for sure is root beer white people shit absolutely yeah you guys don't like root beer hey okay fine I do like root beer yeah you know what's good about me is I like everything that's a prize yeah except communist I agree with this comment this makes sense to me I mean listen Christopher crayons is dropping bombs yeah I like it that's a that's a that's a sharp comment right there you know that's high IQ guys we appreciate you for being a real ass fans keep liking and commenting make you guys are subscribed I'm really thinking about this now what this makes sense I mean every white motherfucker I know loves bluegrass and every black person I know that's great I like great better so what's that mean I don't know I have to check the computer yeah you don't just sucks you know how to use it you know if only you had if only you had a white a white liberal lady to teach you how to use the computer bro oh man guys they had lined up too let's keep this cruise moving this isn't it's a restaurant one that came out there's a lot of I'm gonna try to tune in to like the handler for Joe Biden in this this this man what a job bro oh that's it's hard did you see what the fuck you did last night bro listen I got it wait is that we're gonna talk about oh yeah you're talking about when the the hashtag thing oh my god dude it's bad it's bad and again did you see them watching him do it bro they didn't know what to do I got it all right let's see it's bad yeah I don't want to ruin the I don't want to ruin the surprise it's bad it's it's pretty bad it's pretty fucking bad let's talk about it so uh feed up diplomacy Joe Biden celebrates freeing slew of Putin criminals including elite assassin for us hostages um so everybody's been you know talking about this this prisoner swap this prisoner exchange president Joe Biden on Thursday hailed the complex prisoner swap deal with Russia that freed unjustly imprisoned Wall Street Journal reporter Evan uh Gert Gershka Chowff uh I probably destroyed that um farmer US marine Paul Whalen and two others in exchange for prisoners including Russian assassin Vatim uh Krasikov uh as a prodigious feet of diplomacy uh Biden said all four of the recovered prisoners were convicted in show trials by Russia for absolutely no legitimate reason whatsoever um so in addition to uh Gershka Chowff Whalen the free detainees included Russian American journalist um Al-Soo Kermasoffe and Vlad Amerikara Musa a US green car holder uh and Washington Post contributor who was sentenced to 25 years in prison in April for speaking out against Russia's invasion of Ukraine um now in this deal all right just so everybody's clear uh Russia in total released 16 prisoners four of those 16 uh were you know in one shape or another American citizens green car holder um but in in exchange Russia got eight from us um they were being held in the west um and so you know you got that and then and then this guy and then Biden decided to try to be witty about this right they're oh really you know we got four people out you know right and he was questioned and he tried to throw a little zinger I'm over this prisoner uh swap but uh he if you fell flat on his face let's check this video out so he was asked by a journal wait wait this is not what I'm talking oh no I got you okay all right um so he was asked by a journalist um about this swap deal let's let's check this clip um the motherfucker was just arrested in April bitch two out of the phone so Trump was supposed to get a guy out when he was arrested it fucking four months ago when he was president oh my god yeah man and uh and it's funny because left media jumped on that too right and that they started getting fact check everybody ran with this um but only two of the three Americans um two of the three American citizens they were uh we're not in custody when Trump was in office only one of them was um and and so they've been getting fact check so that that's cool um but let's get to the uh to to this other part real quick too and I think it's important you know they're brokering this deal they broke it this deal who knows how much money we have to get Russia to do this as well who knows like those those they said none they said none but I don't know if that's true because Trump was uh Trump was all hot up on you know how much money to give him wait till they tell you how much money they gave him and he's typically correct when he talks about that so I I would be willing to bet it's gonna come out later that we get a bunch of money a shit to my money because the thing is like I mean think about it like they gave a ron what have billion dollars what have they done in the last four years that have been avid ages or truly in the people's you know favor what are they done in the last four years I think this is going to be any fucking different I don't think so um and and and it kind of makes sense because again like they they have never broken any deals that have been in favor of the American people or the American public um you know like this shit that's going on right now that I'm trying to keep eyes on Biden's involvement in pleadio with the 9-11 terrorists now under investigation by republicans an uproar that death penalty was scrapped and so yes so we have one of the one of one of uh there's three masterminds of 9-11 allegedly not even allegedly these guys have been convicted um that uh where the masterminds behind 9-11 um they're apparently getting off the the death penalty um and Biden's getting slammed about that so I'd like to see you negotiate some shit about that um but that's in a different story let's get to the actual prisoner exchange here okay um and I think the handlers I'm gonna say I'm gonna try to type into types into the handlers here um I think the call was I abide and give me something I abide in on the Biden's on the field Biden give me something um and let's see what he what he decided to do not need I'm still alright your stuff of these president for a while kid there's no way out okay you got me from least another hundred or ninety days or so all right that didn't work pull Biden get calmly in there you see communist message you mean the one that wasn't scripted or soup salad yeah let's let's hear this this is just an extraordinary testament to the importance of having a president who understands the power of diplomacy and understands the strength that rests in understanding the significance of diplomacy and strengthening alliances this is an incredible day true true incredible uh what's the transcript of that and he tried to do that try did this is just an extraordinary testament uh to the importance of having a president okay who understands the power of diplomacy sure and understands the strength uh-huh that rests in understanding the significance of diplomacy right right right right right yeah you know looked at that's the real Kamala oh that's real yeah like that is real look dude I've given a thousand fucking talks in front of people I don't even know more than that never one time if I used a teleprompter ever a single time that is that is a skill if she does not possess and the reason that she does not possess it is because nothing that she says she actually understands or believes okay if you are to go out and talk to people and make comments to people live without a script or you're going to talk without a script you have to know what you're talking about you have to have the right intent okay and you have to actually care about what you're talking about and she doesn't have any of those three things all right and this is why when she goes and stands up on a podium she can read and sound okay but you get her without that she's fucking horrible because she's a nobody bro she's a fucking chick who fucking legit got handpicked all the way up the ladder because of her fucking race because of her walk yeah well I don't know yeah I heard that too I'm saying yeah it's out there but um but I think this this was a good quote I mean I listen I think you know yeah do you have that clip I sent you what I do is breaking it down the facts on her yep that's what right here I got you it was really good but people get upset when you say that she you know it was just picked up for her wet race well let's listen to what this man has to say right here Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump just the facts you can fact check me it's all true Kamala she graduated from Hastings College of Law the law schools rank 82nd out of 196 law schools she graduated she took her bar exam she failed she failed the exam she has never had her own business never had any of her own employees ever 2017 to 2021 she served in the California Senate during those four years she worked in 164 pieces of legislation not one of them ever became law what makes it worse is that she's a liberal governing in a liberal state and she was still zero for 160 for so during the four years she accomplished nothing as vice president she has a record the lowest approval rating ever in the history of this country 28 percent Donald J. Trump he graduated from Penn's Warton School of Business it's ranked number one out of 124 business schools in the country he has run many businesses over 53 years employed hundreds of thousands of employees over that time currently he has 22,450 employees split between men and women that equates to hundreds of millions of dollars over time that have flowed into the economy personally I don't just vote blindly along party lines I just vote common sense let me keep it simple if your parents had a company and you inherited this company and you didn't want to or couldn't run it yourself who would you pick to run it Kamala or Trump someone that has never run anything or someone that has run companies worth billions now let me extrapolate for a second forget about this company I was saying your parents own what I'm really talking about is a company called the United States of America again please common sense thanks well yep okay so if those are all the facts which they are and you can research those please do why is she where she is? mm-hmm one acronym that's right what? what? bro she might have it she might still have it I did not that's gross is it grossed me? what? or her having it now her having it let's hold on sound a little liberal there hey that fucking old bro no man but this this quote man I thought it was very very powerful it reminded me of another one and this is this is a fact she said today is today yesterday was today yesterday tomorrow will be today tomorrow so live today so the future today will be as the past today hey you know what it is bro you know what her deal is she she she wants to be unburdened by what has been your huh her Indian family and and uh what's the other part of that to be unburdened by what has been to become what can be yeah so she she can become anything so she's become a black person and I think it was at this moment the handlers got back on the radio set to be like okay get common with the fuck out of there yeah let's give it back to Joe and now let's see what Joe had to do before I even preferences this motherfucker hold on this okay look I don't think many people saw this because this got like memory hold real fast what playing does the president fly on what playing United States Air Force one everybody knows that little kids know that what color is the playing it's a big blue Air Force and what and white it's blue and white and it's huge it's massive okay little children know this right okay let's watch the clip yeah the motherfucker gets on the wrong fucking airplane for those of you listening this old man who doesn't know what his own this guy doesn't even know where the fuck he is dude bro bro you you you have to the airplane is the biggest airplane they make for for people to try it's a 747 bro it's got a big old hump on it it's blue and white it says United States of America like this motherfucker bro he got on the plane that the hostages got off of did you see them watching him like oh what is he doing service guy yeah they didn't know what to do the secret service guy was like oh fuck you know what you did what would you have done if that were me oh man we would have to play it off I was thinking about this today when I was watching I was like he wanted to buy one guys he was just looking at no no you you would I know how it would go you would come on and you would say hey bro you got on the wrong plane and I'm gonna be like no I didn't and you'd be like yeah you did and I'm because I would definitely say no right away and then and then you would and I would go oh really and then you go yeah I said what are we gonna do and then we would have to make something up like we would have to be like oh we had a meeting on the plate like I wanted to check out the inside I think like yeah like you think about buying one yeah see what I'm gonna get one for hunter see she ping was gonna pay for rock man dude bro that's so bad yeah yeah man she's just as bad bro like the thing is hold on man why the media is trying to prop this woman up as if she's mega popular all right she's not she's not pulling well everybody doesn't like her yes they're why are they doing that why are they propping her up why are they spending two three hundred million dollars and ads to make her seem like she's so fucking popular because they're gonna cheat the fuck out of the ocean okay that is exactly why their goal because by the way she did get the nomination today which means I got it all you do okay well we talk about it then yeah I mean dude like they're gonna cheat yeah they're gonna fucking cheat they're gonna cheat and so let's talk about how they're gonna do it yeah headline number three I think it's important to start this off I don't know I was talking to Joe Gehman about this earlier you know Fridays are fear fear headlines I put that out there it never failed every Friday there's gonna be some type of like fear stoked induced you know panic the chop put people in and I do think it's interesting stock market is in due to get this morning nope I'm in the open global stock market global stock market meltdown as fears grow US economy will collapse so shares across the world template Fridays investors panicked over signs of weakness in the US economy the S&P 500 was syncing by 2.5% in midday trading on pace for its worst day since 2022 the Dow Jones was down 954 points or 2.4% as well at one point in the morning the tech heavy NASDAQ was down 3.2% meaning it has lost more than 10% from a record high on July 11th this is NASDAQ here they looking too good all three benchmark US indexes had also sunk the day before after a batch of weaker than expected reports on the economy on Thursday the selloff is a blow to Americans retirement savings since 401k's are heavily invested in stocks but the gloomy news does mean that the federal reserve will have to cut interest rates in september by a bigger margin than planned and maybe several times again before the end of the year if they're trying to save the face for the democrat party but why did that happen well job growth in the US badly miss expectations in July in the unemployment rate jumped to the highest rate in almost three years employers added 114,000 jobs last month according to labor department data released Friday far below the Dow Jones estimate of 185,000 I think this is very important these are not jobs that people are getting these are two different metrics here we have unemployment rate which is how many people are unemployed and then how many jobs are being added to the workforce not not added and like taken just simply added okay and now we have the US unemployment rate it's it's the highest it's been in almost three years private payrolls they only grew by 97,000 average hourly wages rose by only 0.2 percent below the 0.3 percent that was expected by economists compared with the year ago average hourly earnings are up 3.6 percent but below the 3.8 percent gain record last month and the smallest year over your gain since May of 2021 there's also the average work we tick down from to 34.2 hours from 34.3 hours so people are even working less now which is interesting average on average they're eliminating full-time jobs and adding part-time jobs yep yep now it never fails it never fails that a finger has to be pointed and guess who's fault it was Trump's it's Trump's ding ding ding job 80 that's my bro flake yeah he's the reason everything gets fucked this is fault yeah it's his fault Harris blames Trump for latest dreadful jobs report nearly a full term after he left office it's his fault that makes perfect fucking absolutely me but that's the that's the thing though it doesn't matter if it makes sense yeah because the people who believe her hate Trump so bad they'll just gobble it up because it confirms what they already believe jump fault yeah yeah people are insane we did it Joe good job yeah now while the economy is suffering and it's harder for us to buy groceries and fill up our gas tanks you know it's not suffering that I thought was interesting 80 uh Harris's campaign funding I thought was interesting because it's not suffering at all Harris doubles Trump's July haul with stunning 310 million dollar fundraising bananza she's she they're doing just fine so vice president Kamala Harris recently rebranded campaign claims so have shattered 2024 fundraising records with a jaw dropping 310 million dollar haul across its committees during the month of July in one month in one fucking month 310 million fucking dollars and donations okay let's let's dive in there a little bit yeah let's do let's do that um and and and just so we know the article continues it that's more than double the 138.7 million dollars former president Donald Trump's team uh titled across its authorized committees in July and the Harris campaign is dubbing dubbing it the best grassroots fundraising month in presidential history um that's a that's an accomplishment for sure Peds how you do it how'd you do it yeah I think that's an important question um so there were 4.2 million contributions all right from only 3 million donors in July and they're saying that two thirds or 66 percent of those donations came from people who donated for the first time and that's coming from the from the campaign okay so that's two million people out of the three million this was that first time ever donating to any campaign okay and then they said that 94 percent of its contributions were under two hundred dollars and that the typical occupations were teachers and nurses the campaign said quote from historic grassroots fundraising to hundreds of thousands of new volunteers one thing is clear as vice president Harris continues to prosecute the case against convicted felon Donald Trump voters are fired up and ready to beat Trump again this November DNC chair Jamie Harrison said in the statement um and I think it's also important too that out of that three hundred and ten million dollars okay two hundred million of it was done in one week two hundred million dollars in one week two hundred million dollars in one week and again 66 percent of those came from people who never contributed to an election or a campaign ever and I thought this was interesting because there's a video James O'Keefe who used to be a part of project veritas project veritas now he has O'Keefe media yeah he did this amazing expose on this because you know he looked into this and and watch this clip let's watch this FEC data shows that some senior citizens across the us have been donating thousands of times per year some of these individuals names and addresses are attached to over two hundred thousand dollars in contributions we went and knocked on a few of their doors to corroborate the data that we received we're wondering if these donors are victims of what appears to be a money laundering scheme Cindy no of Annapolis Maryland who in the year two thousand twenty two would allegedly contributed over one thousand times to act blue totaling eighteen thousand eight hundred and forty nine dollars and seventy seven cents that means Cindy would have had to donate three times a day every day for the whole year my name is James O'Keefe and we're doing a story on the number of people that have donated you did donate to act blue right once in a while what about eighteen thousand eight hundred fifty dollars no I don't think so you know people are using your address I don't think so yeah that's just one case right and then I want to turn our attention over to this gentleman his name is Parker Thayer he is an investigative researcher for capital research America's investigative think tank okay and he's been diving into this a little bit this is his Twitter handle here and he's put out a couple of things he said this is one post he said I've censored their names to prevent doxing but act blue donors all over Michigan exhibit suspicious patterns a single donor in the small town of Monroe has supposedly donated over twenty thousand times since 2019 totaling forty thousand dollars that person lives in a thousand square foot house that was built in nineteen fifty six there's one example there's a fact we'll link all of the stuff on the website where you guys is all as always there's another person so so so one person one person don't don't don't people need to understand this one person made twenty thousand six hundred donations you heard what he said about that woman that means she had a donate how many times a day three times a day three times a day this guy is donating this would average out to ten donations a day yeah ten donations a day every day every day for five years okay here's another one another donor in brighten Michigan has donated over twenty five hundred times since October 2023 their list of the dress is a retirement home his act blue scamming a retiree by convincing them to repeatedly sign up for recurring contributions because that person would have had to donate seven times per day here's another one the third donor in Milan Michigan has supposedly donated over nine thousand times since 2019 and fifty five hundred of those donations occurred after January 1st 2023 meaning this person would have been donating roughly ten times per day for the last five hundred and seventy five days there's the proof now Parker Thayer ends this by saying there are dozens more donors like the examples above and there's only two explanations here all right the first one is that act blue which is the the money arm of the DNC the money arm of the Democratic Party all that money from BLM got funded into act blue right and all of that money gets to go it has to go somewhere yeah they funnel it right back into these campaigns that's right so he says there's only two options here the first option is that act blue is praying on seniors with poor memory by repeatedly sending them request to sign up for stacking monthly contributions that's a possibility nobody has a poor memory of ten times a day it's a possibility it's a possibility but then there's another option is that there's some sort of bullshit straw donor scheme that's happening here i believe that's more likely me too i believe it's more that is what's happening that's exactly what's happening right and then that act blue took all that money i mean you got think they got ninety million dollars that was raised from BLM just in the year of 2020 right how cool because there's limits on what can donate to a campaign right people i know there's people right now being like what do you mean couldn't they just be like people what they say here i look dude here's what's happening let me explain to you in real basic language they're using these people's addresses and then very very very wealthy people are funneling massive amounts of money through these people addresses through multiple donations a day that these people are unaware of okay so it's not that these people are being on there on a recurring multiple bill scheme because if you were getting billed ten times a day for anything your credit card shut the fuck off anybody's okay so what's happening here these people like that woman that they interviewed you know she didn't give eighteen thousand dollars no she probably gave like fifty dollars right hundred maybe and then a company uh... uh... uh... what do you want to call bad actor or one of these mega funders you know for example someone like a George sorrows is then funding and i'm not saying it's him i'm saying someone like that it's probably him but is funneling all this extra money to skirt the funding laws of the elections by using these people's addresses and when he says there dozens more there's thousands more the thousands more now my question is is why would they do that why would but like DJ Andy why would they do that is that because they can further manipulate the manufactured support for this woman because they can go online and say that sixty six percent of their donations come from first time people you don't think that that changes people's idea of support for this one nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd and that's what people that's what these people understand they understand that if they create the perception that everybody's jumping on the bandwagon that weak minded people who are in between may jump on that bandwagon okay so what they're trying to do is they're trying to one create that scenario where people who are in between and maybe they just don't know they start to look at what's going on which is most people by the standard of yes most people look at what's going on and then they join the crowd they join where the most people are that's a basic psychological studied fact that by standard effect no the bystander affects something different the bystander effect is when you see a fucking crime and you think someone else is going to okay I'm going to stop the crime and ever nobody stops the crime because everybody thinks someone else going to do it but what what but what's happening here is the these people who and you gotta think about it dude when people are unsure of their position which most Americans are because like I said on the show many many times these people are so busy trying to survive that they cannot and by the way there's very little availability of real information right now you have to dig and dig and dig and dig and dig and dig I mean we do this shit for the show and we have to dig what do you think the regular person who has bills to pay a family take care of who's struggling financially do you think they have the time to dig into this absolutely not so their goal here and their play here is to create as much fanfare and as much falsified manufacturers support for her campaign Kamala's campaign that they attract those people who are unsure to say fuck I don't know it looks like Kamala's gonna all right I'm gonna join that right they just don't know all right and then the second thing is they're trying to pump her up so big that it doesn't really matter if people show up to vote or not because if they have a massive fanfare for this person that's manufactured through the media then and they also have the ability to cheat which we all believe they do then they can cheat much more effectively because it's believable it will be more believable for them to cheat with Kamala than it would be for Biden okay so this is what the play is and it looks and it appears like Michelle Obama will not be the selection I'm still not sure there's still things that could happen but as of today they made her the official nominee all right so I might have missed on that I still don't know we're gonna have to wait and see but it could happen yeah but the reality is guys is that we have to be very aware of what they're doing and why they're doing it and what they're doing is they're trying to manufacture enough clout behind Kamala Harris a much enough fanfare to where if they cheat a massive gap it's believable remember the dude down in Venezuela just tried to cheat when it was 66 to 30 okay and he was the 30 and he tried to cheat that 36% all right they're gonna do the same they Kamala Harris is pulling on a real poll at 28 fucking percent and Trump is almost 70% okay these polls that they're putting out on media uh they're polling selective audiences which are all Democrat all right you think CNN's going out and doing a poll of a but a fair poll no they're going to the place where it's most likely that people are gonna vote for Kamala and they're pulling 100 people and that's where they're getting their data from it's not a true poll the true polls that are happening the real information that's being uh gathered is showing Trump at a substantial all right so they're trying to create it so like if they cheat and Trump has massive momentum and if they cheat people could say there's no way they cheated look how famous she was look how popular she was she was on all these she was with Hollywood she was one that she raised she was on the view right look how much money she raised she was withdrew Barrymore she was here everybody loved her dude the best thing that's happened in the last four years that these people haven't counted on is that Hollywood is crumble they're no longer credible in fact when people from Hollywood endorse people it almost turns everybody else off at this point all right and it's the same thing for these talk shows the only people that watch these talk shows like the view or drew Barrymore are people who are you know they're they're not changing their mind they're bought into this shit they are so far they are so far uh buried in the sand there there's no convincing them it's not gonna happen so what they want to do is convince those people that she's so famous and show popular and so cool that when they cheat those people will fucking fight to the death to defend it they know that in November there is going to be a massive argument over who actually won the election we're gonna not know for four or five days again they're gonna cheat their fucking ass off I'm calling it right now they will shoot the there will be pipes burst there will be things that happen it might it may be something completely different than last time but there will not be a winner decided the day of the election which is how it's supposed to be that's how it's always been in the United States America outside of a few times and those few times have been the latest times and the reason they've been the latest times is because the people who are running the elections and who are in control of the country the Obama's the Clintons the fucking elite cabal those people that little group have made the elections cheatable so now we're dealing with the situation I mean dude it's a banana republic this is communism all right and and to the guys comment on cruise the comments when he said you know well technically we voted for yeah technically you did but but most people who voted for Biden are very pissed and a lot of people who voted for Biden still don't want to vote Republican and they wanted a voice they wanted a chance to pick a better candidate and the reason that they didn't allow a better candidate to be chosen is because she has been part of the plan to usher in this communist Marxist state into this country people who are voting for her are so ignorant to what it's going to do to their own lives it is going to completely destroy the people who are voting for because there's only one kind of person that votes for her outside of the political elite class and that is the very very very poor person well there's two the very very very poor person or the the upper middle class white woman and it's going to destroy both of those people because the very very very poor person is going to get much poorer all right because communism never makes people rich it makes people equally as poor and then secondly that upper middle class white woman who might have a husband or you know she's she's got a family to support that dude's not going to be able to go out and make the money that he could have made okay it's going to destroy the economy it's going to make it harder for him to succeed and survive and and they're not taking that into consideration dude and so like dude these people are voting against their own interests because they've been manipulated and marketed to effectively enough and then culturalized to be anti Trump no matter what like a lot of these people bro they would rather eat fucking shit then have Trump in office like it's it's it's it's really is that really I know it's insane dude yeah so it's very very very important that we all have conversations not just about you know these stupid superficial internet conversations about someone's race we have to have intellectual conversations about who is the most qualified to do the job and we have to have those conversations with these people that I talk about that are sort of undecided or maybe in 2020 they voted Democrat or they voted Democrat forever and now they're just like yeah I don't like it but I don't like Trump either we need to have unifying conversations with those people this this argument that we keep getting sucked into around identity politics and race this only makes the common sense American the middle and the right American seem more extreme all right so when when people like for example like the boxing story all right the boxing story where they said this was a this was a man fighting a woman it wasn't actually a man fighting a woman it was a woman with a with a some sort of test australian disorder it wasn't at a technical trans person but they put the story out as if it was a trans person and everybody got in rage especially the right and dude what's the campaign the Democrats are using right now what's the key word they're using weird they're just weird so so what happened with that boxing story was they put out the narrative that this was a trans man everybody fucking freak the fuck out turns out it's not that and then they can look at those people and be like look at those people they're fucking look how crazy they are everybody's a trans man exactly dude and so like dude we have to fucking quit arguing over this identity shit and we have to get down to the actual issues that matter that are above the line and what I mean by above the line is the crime the safety the economy okay and and foreign affairs so that we don't get fucking nuked because some crazy bitches in office last little thing too I want to add on this act blue stuff before we miss it of course here in the great state of the zary we got some great people that are in office that are representing the people that are sticking to that and so attorney generals from Virginia and Missouri and Wyoming secretary of state they're all launching investigations into this exact thing with that blue I'm over these allegations of money laundering yeah look dude I want to say this too if you're a Missouri you have to vote for Andrew Bailey you have to know about in the primary you can't you have to go vote in the primary and you got a vote for Andrew Bailey okay period yeah so guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have a thumbs up what dumbest fuck this is where we bring a headline in we talk about it it'll get one of those two options so with that being said our thumbs up a dumbest fuck headline reads seven year old notices elderly woman eating lunch alone and decides to eat with her god had us in that space at that time I thought this was pretty cool yeah let's hit let's check this out so when a seven year old boy noticed an elderly lady eating lunch alone at a restaurant he chose to sit with her and brighten her day on June 7th crystal to mezz and Ezra one of her four children were eating lunch at Brahms a burger joint in rock wall Texas when Ezra spotted an elderly woman sitting alone behind packing up his food as we said mom we have to go sit with her a nervous Mrs. Tamez hesitated at first but seeing how determined her son was she didn't want to deny his request and agreed after politely asking the 84 year old woman if they could sit with her Mrs. Tamez learned that the elder was battling the depression and the wake of her husband's passing a few months ago quote she was having a hard time getting out of the house and so she really appreciated Ezra noticing her and coming over Mrs. Tamez told the epoch times in a conversation that lasted for about 30 minutes as was spoke to her about his interest in football quote he told her that he loved football and he was a quarterback Mrs. Tamez said adding that the elderly woman went on to ask him questions about his siblings when Mrs. Tamez got up for a refill she noticed just how sweet and precious the moment was and thus decided to capture it on video his clip that's cool that's pretty cool something very clean that fucking table now that's all I saw bro all I saw was how dirty that table was in that floor oh you think that person you think that fucking store look like that if I ran it I'll fucking all man I would have fucking already clean that shit myself like I want

something to be said about like I don't know if it's like a old diner spot you know I'm saying because there's something to be said about it being a little you know I'm saying if that's not diner though that's not diner no a diner is like copies diner in Pennsylvania that that my friend Rachel has okay eighty eighty seven year old diner that's a diner with a counter yeah but you know I'm like a little old burger joint you know I'm saying like I could like it could get a pass I don't know how you remember Rachel and Jack they can yeah I'm in a birthday yeah we got to go up and eat it copies

can't do that let's get people stink and now it's just you know well you know how I feel about will be yeah it is it but it's nice it is nice it's a good touch man I think that young man's got a good good head on the shoulders yeah well probably good parents too yeah like Shelby Cobras too it's on a shirt yeah I was that he's got to be pretty cool yeah you know that that's a really good story man yeah it's cool that's what America's about bro real talk well supposed to be about it's it is what it's about like if we go out in the real world that's what it's about we don't deserve to be tortured by the media and these politicians and this fear porn and this crazy shit all the time but we do have to address the fundamental issues and get these fuckers out of here so that we could get back to living our lives so bro that is the character of the United States right there in one picture bro dude I'm telling you man and it doesn't matter if you're black or you're white or you're gay or you're straight fellow Americans are always there for their fellow Americans and we have to get back to remembering that and living that way we have to stop this identity politics bullshit we have to stop talking about race or the first this or that or whose fucking fault it was for shit that happened 400 fucking years ago mother fucker this is now and this is our lives and if we don't live our lives now we're gonna regret it so why don't we all get together and say fuck all these people get them to fuck out and make America what it should be that's what it has to happen and we need to do that by coming together in a united fashion and stop harassing each other about who's right or who's wrong there's a saying there it's amazing what people can accomplish when they don't care who gets the credit so leave your fucking ego at the door and just be a productive member of trying to unify people have conversations try not to be assholes if their assholes don't be an asshole back just fucking go to the next person all right we have to get this country back on track and it's gonna take us remembering who the fuck we are and we are not mean people we are not bad people we are good people the care about each other the care more about each other than any other country on the planet that's ever existed especially people from different cultures we are the most non racist country that's ever existed but yet that's all we talk about we're the only country in the history of earth where multiple cultures have come together and produce greatness think of all the amazing great inventions the great civil movements all of this things that these country this country has provided that our people have created these people are not exclusively white or exclusively black or exclusive the Asian they're all different kinds of people from all over the fucking world so let's stop getting sucked into this divisive shit and let's get on the same page and realize bro that we're being victimized by a system and if we don't stop it it's gonna take everything that we have all right so that's my little soapbox for today i love it man guys Andy it's all good all right guys don't be a hoe shut the show
