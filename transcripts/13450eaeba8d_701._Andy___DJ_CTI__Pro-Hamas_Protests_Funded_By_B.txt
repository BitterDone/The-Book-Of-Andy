the fucking the logo what you got Colonel Sanders bro you got the logo no I want the chicken the actual trigger why is it why is it now for white people as much as black people you guys got like that sounds racist you know raising canes bro you got raising canes white people love that shit you just say that because it's got raising in the title I didn't even think I didn't think about that that's good no I know I said I said that because it's like there's no seasoning I'm tired of this racism it's around all the good foods and drinks well hey listen you know my people we had to learn how to adapt and survive and that was kind of like a defense mechanism as you know we made the foods by you see with season and then you shit so that way like we would it warded off all the all the all the whiteness yeah yep that's racist yeah boy all right can't win them all well anyway this was funny I enjoyed it a man then then is always good hey at every opportunity man address it that's how I that's my motto I give them a thumbs up to be getting in the show I like it I like it that was actually pretty fucking funny dude no I was great did you see 60 seconds get roasted no who did it was it it was somebody it's like the same bro they have a roast for dinner white no but like one of the guys called him out I forget who the fuck did it but he said he said something about like you got more you put more immigrants in cages than ice I think I who the fuck it was it was great though that's pretty funny it was great yeah where's a OC when you need her yeah fuck man yeah I don't know I like it I fucking like it time Brady's a goat too though I mean oh yeah he's a goat he does look a little little weird but you gotta look weird bro he you know what it is he spends so much time with with his super model wife that he became like a super model dude he does he does he's get a little more rugged okay have a heart roasted time Brady on that bro Kevin Hart's funny his funny he's funny he's funny he said he said bro he said something about he said he's like you you fucked your coach almost like Jazeal fucked her karate teacher oh he said it oh shit he said who the fuck goes to create who did he say well that's the point of the roast nothing off limits oh bro he's said who the fuck goes to karate class eight times a day he's still got a white belt listen dude you could say whatever you want about time Brady I tell you this he might look you know like you know he's good looking dude kind of that motherfucker's tough as fuck here we're fucking head off I believe it you can't be great like that without that I wish I wish we could see that side of him though we do see that side of him sometimes now I like it yeah like he's starting to let loose some of his content he's starting to talk some real shit I mean that guy's that guy's a killer dude don't don't make any mistakes about that you know that's really tall he's big too he's like six four I don't know I mean dude the thing is he built his career off like six four yeah look dude here's what I respect I respect people that take the talent that they were given and master it and he's one of those guys you know he was never a standout guy in college he was okay one of number one draft pick no he was like in that last round yeah so like or six round or something so this guy took the talent he had and he fucking mastered it bro and became the greatest quarterback ever and that's a lot more impressive to me than someone who is a great talent but doesn't like sharpen it you know what I'm saying like Jerry Rice right like Jerry Rice ran a four fucking seven you know four seven that's pretty slow oh line man that run four sevens you know what I mean but he was so good and his work ethic was so strong he became the greatest wide receiver ever you know and I almost feel like when we're talking about that kind of champion that usually the greatest ever are those kind of people because Michael Jordan right he was good he was okay in high school got cut we all know the story he was he was got better in college and then in the pros he was untouchable because to go from that insignificant guy in high school to that significant guy in college to the champion that he became you have to develop habits bro and those habits create the greatness and so like you know I can respect someone with a tremendous talent right they're physically strong they're intelligent they just happen to be good and athletic but those guys who are the greatest those three names are the greatest ever in their sports okay and they grunt they grinded that out day by day by day and it goes into what I talk about on Q and A F all the time man you know like dude just because you weren't blessed with the best physical talent or the best situations doesn't mean that you can't create and become the greatest ever and those guys are an example of that we go down the list more and more and more I feel like people who come from a disadvantaged situation actually have an advantage whenever it comes to being successful because they're so dissatisfied from where they came from where someone who was born with exceptional talents exceptional abilities and an exceptionally optimal situation they don't know that they don't know what that pains like you see what I'm saying so I just I got a lot of respect for those kind of guys I love it man I love it well I want to do some cruising yeah yeah guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to eighty for seller dot com guys can find them like this with that being said hell on number one um shocker not shocking right hell on number one reads pro amaz protest funded by Biden's own political donors now this is making waves all over the fucking social webs into webs today for whatever reason a lot of people are shocked by this but why that's my question have you not been paying attention have you not watched who funded BLM did you not watch who funded Ukraine did you not watch who funded all this shit the destruction of our fucking country it's his donors and we're in shock no yeah so the pro Palestinian anti-Semitic protest on university campuses across the nation hold on it's not anti-Semitic to say we don't want people to get fucking genocide it okay so let's stop with that fucking bullshit it is not anti-Semitic it's not anti-Semitic to criticize the government of a country all right this is a total lie and I'm so fucking sick of this term getting thrown around if you say I hate Jewish people because they're that's anti-Semitic that's it that's it okay I hate you because you're Jew it that's anti-Semitic saying Israel is a bunch of fucks in their government and they're fucking killing all these people for bullshit that is not anti-Semitic that's called a fucking fact okay so let's stop with this nonsense no 100 percent which they're actually continuing right now as we speak they just started bombing the Stado Rafa right now but stilling it the these protests that have been happening all over the country they're all funded by President Joe Biden's own political donors which could explain why he hesitates to condemn them and won't investigate them now this is where see I think what it is dude is people that are starting to connect dots you know I'm saying that haven't been really paying attention to those dots and now they're trying to like oh okay it makes sense now right and I think I'm I'm trying to give some type of like you know I don't want to call that patience or like you know just let them kind of wake up that fully but like dude it's like no shit no shit where the fuck have you been oh that's right believe in everything they fucking feed you you know and so this is just interesting to see but Biden the article continues says Biden equivocated last month when I asked to react to the protest saying that he condemned the anti-Semitism but also condemned those quote who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians which puzzled observers researched by NGO monitor and others into the donors behind the protests has turned up familiar names from the Democratic Party bankroll including George Soros open society foundations and other liberal philanthropists they're not liberal they're communist very communist okay they they try to hide under that term liberal they're not fucking liberal they're communist no and and then continues Biden's department of justice is notably refused to investigate the civil rights abuses being committed by the quote unquote encampments against Jews journalists and others it has also refused to consider Rico conspiracy charges well I mean here's the thing like that's just not even sound legal like there's no sound legal foundation there to to really press on any of those things but nevertheless I don't know I mean wouldn't Soros organizing all this shit that would be yeah on the Soros side but not just like on the actual protesters themselves the regular students who you know no but I mean but how couldn't they yeah absolutely I'm saying well and it's funny you say that because the house just actually just launched an official investigation into the chamber US Chamber of Commons the tax status over the Soros linked donations to these foundations just came out today there's actually they're actually officially opening up that investigation into that but it's the house it's not an actual you know government they're not gonna do shit and I tell you why because 330 of these people voted to censor speech okay do you know why it was 330 of those people because every single one of those motherfuckers getting their money from these people that's why they did it if you want to know who the fucking corrupt motherfuckers are in Washington DC go look who voted to limit speech regarding anti-semitism in the law right go look at who did that those are the fucking 30 of those are I don't know it was something 300 something yeah those people are the people causing the disruption in this country and that's not anti-semitic the fact that you can't criticize another government you can't so so we're gonna make we can't criticize other government but you go to jail yeah you can criticize Russia that's fine no no no we're gonna make a law about that can't criticize Russia either see I'm saying see I've served it sounds when you put in it can't we're gonna make a law that says we're gonna you can't criticize Mexico now let's substitute that like it sounds insane okay but because it's Israel and because all these people in our government are dual citizens and getting all their money from these motherfuckers they they think it's okay and people have been brainwashed and I think you know like dude these people to come out and say oh is Israel first that America bro fuck you get the fuck out of our country yeah fuck off the way off yeah fuck off I don't have nothing to do with Jewish people bro more we covered this on last cti more than half of the citizens of Israel are opposed to what's happening in Israel and Gaza more than half so it's what I've been saying for years and years and years it's evil motherfuckers using the regular Jewish people who are good people as a shield so they cannot be fucking criticized yeah to your point Andy one of the foundations so two of the main kind of organizing groups on most of these campuses there's two of them the one is if not now right well guess what the other one is Jewish voice for peace that is the one of the other organizations behind all of these protests that are supplying the tents and you know I'm saying the garbage cans and shit like that right until it's like to your point there is a very large movement I guess of actual Jewish people that are also against what's happening right and more more more Jewish people are against what's happening in Israel than are for it yeah yeah so to say it's the Jews is an inaccurate statement but they want you to say it's the Jews right that that's what they do in the media they they push that narrative intentionally so that they can fucking catch you in anti-Semitic speech right so they don't understand they're doing the same thing to anti-Semitism they were racism it's the boy cry will yeah no one cares absolutely nothing you can't call people get called racist you know like yeah okay bro thanks yeah 10 10 years ago it was like oh my god bro no absolutely not you know and that's the same thing that's happened with anti-Semitism it's and it's fucked up because in both those cases with racism and anti-Semitism now if there's real cases of it no one can fucking no one knows you know now here's the thing you know we got all of this stuff going on and like I said man this stuff is always a smoke screen show right it's always you know look over here not over here right that's not the main headline today that's not the bigger story that's happening right now here's a story that nobody wants to talk about do you remember this was like three weeks ago we had talked about that base in Niger right and I said there's gonna be some issues here right well little DJ diamonds going on right now headline reads Russian troops enter air base in Niger where US soldiers are stationed now this comes in right I'm like man this is that's that's interesting right into like for just for a quick catch up this this this base in Niger where we have a US military act of that the country no longer wants us there right we have about they count about a thousand US military soldiers there right and the the government of Niger is like yeah get the fuck out right we're not moving quick enough for them and actually you know we got Russia's Russian troops Russian soldiers just landed at that base right now this is very and they're and they're like right next door to each other in aircraft hangers yeah so so let's dive into this a little bit so Russian military personnel have entered an air base in Niger that is hosting American troops after a decision by Niger's junta to expel US forces from the country the military officers ruling the West African country have told the US to withdraw its nearly 1000 military personnel which until a coup last year have been a key partner for Washington's fight against insurgents we have killed thousands of people in the displaced millions more a senior US defense official speaking on condition of anonymity told Reuters that Russian forces were not mingling with the US troops but were using a separate hanger at air base 101 which is next to Deori Hamani International Airport in Naimi Niger's capital the move by Russia's military puts US and Russian troops in close proximity at a time when the country's military and diplomatic rivalry is increasing acrimonious because of the conflict in Ukraine it also raises questions about the fate of US installations in the country after a withdrawal quote the situation is not great but in the short term manageable the officials said now I remember when they when we had a different situation that was manageable I remember that um you know but and then this headline comes out US soldier detained in Russia officials say now this just came out apparently a soldier had left Korea um may have been uh may have committed a crime allegedly and then now he's uh he landed in Russia apparently on his own free will um but now Russia has detained him so you got Russian troops next door to American troops in the country where they don't want American troops and now we got leverage or now Russia has leverage because they have an American soldier an active duty American soldier now and and being detained over there um there's a lot of stuff going on right now and he can we make any sense of any of this you know I don't know man um you know I I think it's probably a tense situation for the governments but I bet you on the ground I bet they're probably drinking vodka shit together um because everybody Russian troops and American troops and all the troops that made up of the actual citizens of the countries are fucking tired of these lies that were being told like all these wars that have some sort of noble cause they all know better okay so that's a great point yeah and so uh you know but it could be a very dangerous situation and an intentional abandoning of our troops in Africa to create some situation where some of them get killed by the citizens or the military uh of Niger or the Russians and so we have more of an excuse to get involved in what's going on so you know we could fly a thousand motherfuckers out of there in a fucking two hour span and they're not doing it and we have to ask why they're not doing it and so then we have to ask well why are they doing anything why why are they why are they letting the Eagles across the border why are they inflating the currency why are they leaving Afghanistan and why are they doing all these things that intentionally harm the countries well you know that's their mo because those people in Washington right now uh are intent on destroying the America that we have always known and creating a communist country and that is led by people like George Soros and these other donors who are funding you know all of this shit and so bite you know it's interesting because Biden has all kinds of protests that are pro-America going on all over the country right but he still won't speak out in support of them why is that why is the president of our United States not saying a positive word about you know the the patriotic american standing up to what's happening why why is that you sort of saying like wouldn't it make sense for him to take the side of our country not the side of you know funded protesters but he can't do that because and by the way most of these protesters aren't even students at the schools you know and by the way i think they have a right to protest because all their fucking people are getting fucking killed for no fucking reason oh there's a reason Andy blah blah but no there isn't nothing justified that's right yeah they killed 600 people now you guys have killed 40 fucking thousand of them mostly kids and you know why you killed mostly kids because you don't want to deal with the kids when they grow up that's genocide all right and everybody knows it everybody's aware of it and anybody that's still going along with it is a fucking fuckhead yeah yeah the entire world is recognizing what's going on here and dude netanyahu won't fucking back up and i tell you why you won't back up he won't back up because he knows he has all the shit on all these people he owns these motherfuckers and they don't have a choice but to back him up that's the truth that's real shit man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think what if you had all the information on Joe Biden and everybody else and Biden calls you up and he says hey man you just stop you're saying hey fuck you dude i do whatever the fuck i want i own your ass i fucking fund everybody in your government all those people in your government i fucking pay for our donors pay for you know what on top of that um i got everything on you i got all the dirty shit you did and all your fucking cohorts i got their dirty shit you want me to fucking let that shit fly because i'll do that and then joe biden goes over and sits his fucking old ass down says nothing because he's a bitch it's real shit man it's real shit guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think uh with that being said let's check some out yeah joe bines a fucking pussy ass bitch uh this this comment comes from at free america 2024 one of my visualizations for the next 30 days will be visualizing andy as president and dj as the press secretary that would be a sight to behold they're never going to allow that fellas if we want that we're gonna have to take it here but i appreciate you yeah yeah i mean illicit i could promise you this none of this shit would be happening no none of it we wouldn't be paying any bullshit tax either we'd have it we'd have a safe country we'd have no crime we'd have beautiful architecture we have a thriving economy we wouldn't pay it very very little tax under 10 percent all in everybody would pay it people who don't pay tax wouldn't have a fucking say into what's going on because that's really the problem here we'd have every single government official obeying the laws that they make there would be no diplomatic community if you fucking violated the law and you're in the government guess what you face the consequences like everybody else i'd eliminate lobbies i i do that could fix this shit really fast okay fuck man that sounds awesome yeah it could all be fixed in like a day yeah fuck that sounds so awesome yeah well that's what I would do and and dude that's what needs to be done and that's what trump needs to do if he gets back in no otherwise he's gonna be a failure too you know i think i would be a good press secretary yeah what would be my like tagline though because i feel like everybody everybody like you know what was uh the one lady circle back what was her name jensaki yeah fucking socky fuck her man but she had circle back um and then you got kgb she just she just lies i feel like i need a tagline though i don't know what it would be well you think about that and let us know yeah i'm just saying dude i could fix this shit real easy yeah bro you know that's a thing it's like they could fix this they could but they don't because all of these people they return limits you wouldn't be able to invest if you were in fucking government see all this shit that i'm saying they'd fucking kill me for yeah because that's their money train these are ineffective people bro you guys have been taught to believe that the people in our government are the best and brightest they are not the best and brightest they run for government so they can flee sure of your tax dollars spend you know ninety thousand dollars on a bag of washers and fucking put 89,995 dollars in a fucking pocket like people don't realize what's going on and for us to ever be the country that we could be it's gonna take radical change not a little bit of change radical reformation that's what's needed and the only way this will ever happen is if the culture changes first which is why we talk about winning and personal excellence and personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion because when you unplug yourself from their system they have no power okay when you're fit you're not consuming their food when you're intelligent you're not consuming their data when you're building great relationships you're not you know keeping yourself in this bubble like there's all these things when you're healthy you're not buying their pharmaceuticals like these are all the things that fund their shit and so for us to fix what's going on we have to unplug ourselves from their system first and then we can install a leader that will fix the actual system because politics is downstream of culture so a lot of people are like why don't you run for office because it wouldn't matter because culture so fucked we have all this victim culture and all this loser shit like dude I was talking to my buddy my buddy Chris he was he made a post and and he screenshot it he started he has a podcast and and they were he was talking about selling merch on the podcast and somebody's like oh so you're gonna sell you're gonna sell shit now that oh so this is about money it's like yeah bitch this is America it's capitalism you're supposed to make money you're supposed to provide and we have all these fucking idiots out here they try to guilt everybody about that's what you're supposed to do that's what you're supposed to do and if you don't you're failing one of the fundamental requirements of being an effective citizen of this country and we have all these people that fucking cry and bitch about you know oh you know you make it some yeah no shit you should try it you life be a lot happier bro we have to stop letting people vote that don't pay fucking tax we the biggest problem we have in this country is that people who do not contribute to the country have a major say in the direction of the country that is hurting our country in a massive way and the reason that they're bringing in all these people and the reason that they're impoverishing all these people intentionally is so that they can continue to get those people to vote because what they want is they want those people to vote so that they can come in and legally confiscate your fucking hard work and your wealth and your buying power and make everybody poor that's the point it's not about giving it to them it's about taking it from you and so like dude you know it's useful idiot shit we are we cannot is this country is to survive we cannot let people that do not contribute have a say in the direction of the country it would fix everything it's real shit man it's real shit we got one more comment here quickly from at sunny top boy 4975 top boy huh it's interesting name I'll be honest but he has a good comment says love and the indian dj black and white banter this is how it should be not people dividing us yeah man to which it was replied um this is how life was every day until Obama became president that's the fucking that that's exactly right bro we do listen to true people that aren't of a certain age do not understand it that's why we have all these knuckleheads out there thinking they're at the front of the

you gotta can they touch do they touch or not they can they can cross and cross but that means something else that's like that's like extra racist oh what's that that's it just is I don't know that no well I just made it up that's probably why you know yeah guys have not them too have not them two reads judge Juan Marchan holds Donald Trump and contempt again for violating gag order now we're getting to a scenario Donald Trosh is gag this motherfucker with his dick that's a gag order you know sometimes you know like if you ever like you say something and then or you hear something you picture it in your head nope does that happen to you guys you haven't see you okay I know I didn't I just picture it that statement and I don't want to picture it DJ you know what that means what you're gay that's not what that means yeah no everybody does that just saying you said gag when I'm just like orange pubic hair just like just popped in my mind like uh uh the old gulk gulk specials they're just uh the old gulk gulk 5000 yeah uh okay all right but yeah I feel like I feel like I feel like Trump's in a in a weird position man well not not Trump uh that well that would be a weird one I feel like this judge is putting himself in a very weird position um he's gonna find himself and jail himself the judges yeah well and so like I mean so there's a term in psychology right it's called FOS and what FOS means it means full of shit okay and so essentially the the idea behind it is that if you that is technical term well it's what what uh what the professor's coined it okay um but what it is is that when you set out consequences right if I say that you know if you do this this is gonna be the consequence right and then I don't follow through on that consequence if you do it I am full of shit right and like you're threatened them with all of these things but this is like the 10th time he's done this bro he told he said today he's gonna put him in jail for that's what he's saying go ahead dude yeah that's it go ahead bro listen listen i do it listen i mean that's what i'm saying so like i mean i mean you should have did it after the first time or second time maybe third time maybe but like bro you like i was Trump i start running my mouth as hard as hard as you fucking make him put you in jail i'm gonna call your bluff yeah i'm gonna call your fucking bluff man like i walk out of me like oh that one merchant he's a fucking fuck huh fuck this guy straight to the Trump yeah Trump so polite about how he says shit it's almost like he knows that they're unraveling themselves and he's just like bro think about think about the uproar that that would cause yeah that's why i want him to do it like fuck bro listen this month and the judge knows it's a it's a big deal too that's why he's like does he yeah that's what he says man he said uh so so he's fine Trump a thousand dollars for a single violation so they're i believe he's that like 10 grand now because there's been 10 different violations here um and so the judge said uh quote this court will have to consider a jail sanction mentioned told the court quote at the end of the day i have a job to do part of that job is to protect the dignity of the justice system oh yeah really really well he's doing a sheshot of that really yeah i mean uh he said the violation is quote uh direct attack on the rule of law cannot allow that to continue he added uh Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg alleged Trump committed four violations including comments about Michael Cohen David Pecker the former publisher of the national acquirer prosecutors alleged speech directed toward witnesses was a violation of merchants gag order now here's the interesting thing because you know this judge is talking about you know protecting the dignity of the justice system and you know and all of this good stuff and it's interesting because as soon as that comes out this comes out that one of the fucking prosecutors that are assisting this case guess where he worked at before where under the Biden administration and guess where he worked at before that the dancey under the Obama administration hmm they're all in the fucking playboy fan club man that's what these people have forgotten there's going to be justice for this yeah there's going to be justice for this bro they're playing with fucking fire they're playing with fucking fire man uh so the democratic national committee paid Trump prosecutor Matthew uh colangelo thousands of dollars for quote unquote political consulting in 2018 Fox News digital has learned colangelo delivered opening statements in the unprecedented criminal trial a former president Donald Trump and currently serves as a top prosecutor with Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg's office on the case colangelo joined Bragg's office in December of 2022 after the resignations of mark pomerance and carried dune uh both prosecutors who were investigating Trump and resigned in protest of Bragg's initial unwillingness to indict the former president colangelo left a senior role at the Biden justice department to join Bragg's team Bragg afterward brought chargers against the former president in April of 2023 raising questions among some in the GOP about alleged politicization of the case house Republicans are investigating colangelo uh and his past work as he prosecutes Trump so there's uh there's ongoing investigation on him right now but it's just it's just interesting it's not interesting we all fucking know it so this guy comes yeah so before he was with um missy so so his his kind of like the the timeline here is he's at Bragg's office now before that he was working for Biden's DOJ okay which means that he had all the intel or anything that he needed to have in his hands he was already pre aware of all of this stuff um and during that time he was also getting paid as a consultant for the DNC right um and then before that he worked um as uh he worked inside the uh president or Obama administration as the deputy director of the White House Economic Council um he's all tied in with them and so it makes sense that they picked their boy um he kind of looks like Josh howley a little bit looks like Fauci Fauci those sunglasses on their motherfucker that looks like Fauci I said Josh howley just a little bit now that dude looks more like Fauci Fauci put some fucking glasses on that guy that looks like Fauci dude I can see the look like the Louise and weaselness of it little ratness yeah I see that yeah I see that hmm interesting any anything on this so so Trump you saying Trump do it Trump Trump needs to just come out talk some shit and call a bluff well look I think one the it's very clear that the more that they push on Trump with the shit the more people are realizing what's going on they're losing voters across the board on every demographic quick two people are realizing that if they can do this to Trump that they can do it to anybody all right three I believe that these people have grossly overestimated their own power and ability to get on TV and lie to the American people thinking that they are going to be believed because up until recently it's worked it worked with COVID it works with Ukraine it fucking has worked and worked and worked it worked with Black Lives it worked with all this shit and so now people they think that anything they say people will believe which historically has been the case but because of the internet and the quickness that the information information spreads which is ironic because they created the internet to control people thoughts and interactions of speech and to control narratives with fake bots and fake traffic and the boosting up of narratives that they want now it's actually blowing up in their faces and showing people what the actual truth is so when you combine all of these things like the censorship the questionable election practices which was fraud the all the shit that Biden's done you know like the opening of the border like people are starting to feel that remember months and months are fucking years ago when I told people like dude you're going to have issues where these all these men are going to come here start attacking the women this and that and now people like oh my where are all the men well you fucking voted for this bro right you voted for this because you dude you don't contribute to the system you don't think it through okay so now we have all of these things that are actually touching people and affecting people and they are they know someone who's been affected by it so they're starting to open their eyes and so I think that the Democrats and the media and social media conglomerates big tech all these things they still believe that whatever they say is going to be accepted as true when in reality people have had their trust violated so much that anything they say people are saying well the opposite must be true and that's where we're getting to now so the harder they push the more power they're going to create through their opposition's momentum against them and it's very clear in the numbers so you know go ahead put them in jail watch what happens you know because that'll eventually if you did if they did I'd be very surprised if there weren't lifelong or life ending ramifications for them once the power finally changes yeah let's see what they must be pretty confident that they're going to win to even do this shit I just don't think people are going to accept it if they cheat again no no there's no fucking way here's a clip of Trump's response after all of this stuff let's watch this real quick my constitutional right to speak I was in Miami this weekend and recorded the rescue questions the same questions like you're asking me and I have to say I have a gang going or I can't speak about it never happened before ever number one number two it's a fake trial they have no case and it's been absolutely proven now that no case whatsoever this is Alvin Red doing it from political reasons for biting this is a bite for trial is a crooked president now it just came out of Columbia just canceled their comments axios Columbia yeah so it seems like it's kind of taking your taking the advice there listen man I listen I'm smarter than every motherfucking advisory has that's truth okay he better be real careful about this vaccine shit all right oh you got that oh come on oh no I got that yeah Trump Trump's got some other stuff to be worried about man let's actually just go head over there guys drop down in the comments section let us know what you guys thought headline two let's get to headline number three because this there's some shit happening here all right I want you guys to look at headline number three now this is from the New York Times um headline reads thousands believe COVID vaccines harm them is anyone listening all vaccines have at least occasional side effects but people who say that they were injured by COVID vaccines believe their cases have been ignored and it has this like picture of this guy like you go to the website link this is what it looks like it's this it's not thousands it's tens of millions now uh should be noted you know this article was written by a poor of a man de volley um who her bio says that she spent more than a year talking to dozens of experts and vaccine science policy makers and people who said they had experienced serious side effects after receiving COVID-19 vaccine okay now this article was published May 3rd 2024 updated on May 4th um so let's dive into this because I got something about her I mean this is this interesting um but let's just dive into this so the article starts off it says within minutes of getting the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine Michelle Zimmerman felt pain racing from her left arm up to her ear and down to her fingertips within days she was unbearably sensitive to light and struggled to remember simple facts she was 37 with a PhD in neuroscience and until then could write her bicycle 20 miles teach a dance class and give a lecture on artificial intelligence all in the same day now more than three years later she lives with her parents eventually diagnosed with brain damage she cannot work drive or even stand for long periods of time quote when I let myself think about the devastation of what this has done to my life and how much I've lost sometimes it feels even too hard to comprehend doctor said doctor Zimmerman who believes her injury is due to a contaminated vaccine batch the COVID vaccines a triumph of science and public health are estimated to have prevented millions of hospitalizations and death uh yet even the best vaccines produces produce rare but serious side effects and the COVID vaccines have been given to more than 270 million people in the United States in nearly 677 million doses and it continues to say that doctors eminence account is among the more harrowing but thousands of Americans believe they suffered serious side effects following COVID vaccination as of April just over 13,000 vaccine injury compensation claims have been filed with the federal government but it's a little let's a little avail only 19% have been reviewed only 47 of those were deemed eligible for compensation and only 12 have been paid out at an average of about 3600 dollars so that's where they're staying um here's the picture of uh doctor Zimmerman now it's interesting man because you know uh this this journalist a poor of a mendivali right you know I went through and look looked at some of her history of like what she's been reporting on right and you go back and you'll find headlines like this COVID vaccine prompt strong immune response in younger children and in this article she's pushing and advocating to giving kids these vaccines or this one in September 10th of 2021 will vaccine mandates slow the pandemic yes science is safe but not immediately um again another push to get to get the vaccine or this one uh the Pfizer biotech vaccine is said to be powerfully protective and adolescents again a strong focus on these kids um and we've all seen the videos I know we shared a few of them on here where like you know the one mom she's at like some type of committee hearing or something her daughter's in the fucking wheelchair right um we we share that now this is also what I found to be interested in when I was researching a little bit on this topic you know you go to google and um you type in vaccines out effects which you know a year ago shit six months ago you would have been met with uh what do they call those things um fact checks you'd be met with CDC statements you'd be met with all of these all of these FDA you know blips and and you know all these fact check articles and stuff like that but that's not the case anymore you type in that now look what you got it's all down the the news search everybody's talking about it now right um and everybody's talking about it even Chris Cuomo let's see what he had to say there are times released an article that's getting a lot of play that says that there are thousands of people who say they're still suffering side effects they believe from the vaccine and that those have been ignored now one of them is nurse practitioner Sean Barkovich he says he got his first dose in 2020 had side effects just standing up sent his heart racing stinging pain in his eyes mouth growing uh those have gotten a little bit better but he still has what they call tenitis that's a ringing in the ears we know that vaccines can have unintended consequences aka side effects but nobody's really talking about it because they're too afraid of blame and they just want it to go away but the problem is people like Sean and me and millions of others who still have weird stuff with their blood work and their lives and their feelings some you know physically are not going the way Sean Barkovich joins us now Sean why do you believe it's the vaccine and what has happened when you've tried to get a clinical analysis of it or answers why do I believe this it's not a belief it's a fact and as soon as I was injured a 15 20 minutes in my first dose I had numbness tingling up and down my injected arm that over day spread to my face in my eyes I went to see a neurologist he ran some tests he's like well this is all new we don't know much about it but the hospital is going to mandate it you should get a second dose and everything in my medical bot mind and but my in my bones was telling me no if you have a reaction after something don't do it again but the pressure was immense and then three weeks rolled around I got a second dose and after that everything blew up now it's interesting right so so Cuomo has this talk you know he does this on the show and but does anybody remember how bad this stuff was pushed especially from people like Cuomo who's now admitting that he has a vaccine injury allegedly I didn't forget there's a clip of him actually when he was talking about Brian Donald let's see what he had to say this is this is when he was still seeing in the reason has to be part of the reason that you're seeing what you're seeing in Florida is because of vaccine hesitancy and an aspect of vaccine hesitancy is politics especially in your state don't vouchy Florida we all know that was about do you feel responsible for spreading a message where I'm not going to take it because I don't care what Biden wants by Randonnell is not going to take it because he doesn't care what Biden wants you think that's a good message for people to hear well the first thing is my message was never about Joe Biden the message is about me and my own personal health I'm not getting vaccinated because I don't want to oh no no no I want to read your words I want to read your words no no no no I just don't know you don't get to come me off it's my show go just listen it has nothing to do with what Joe Biden wants it has nothing to do with what Joe Biden wants funny I never brought him up when I was deciding whether or not to get vaccinated why did you a reporter asked me on a news show and I said it has nothing to do with what he wants I chose not to get vaccinated because I chose not to get vaccinated I already had COVID-19 once I'm 42 years old I'm in very good health I actually get checked regularly and do all those things that's a personal decision for myself members of my family my wife my three kids they've all had COVID they're not getting vaccinated they're all healthy that is a decision they've chosen to make you ask for doctor everybody to understand is this hold on here is the key thing you need to understand if people in the United States are concerned about contracting and being hospitalized and dying of course from COVID-19 please go get vaccinated I will never tell you not to get vaccinated what I'm saying is I made a decision not to get vaccinated and as a matter of it's you where Joe Biden or anybody else that's going to stress or want me to get it I'm not doing it because you're making it silent but that's just because you're not on the barn that doesn't make you just a free person all right freedom isn't just defined as the bold and ability to be strong and wrong it's about doing the right thing the best thing you say if people are worried about getting sick or dying then they should get vaccinated what about if people are worried about giving COVID-19 or a variant to others which you very well could do you could be doing it right now and not know doesn't that matter you know so that's a little bit that's that's interesting right this flip do you feel responsible for spreading that message by Randall I don't know come on do you feel responsible for pushing that message for two and a half years shutting the country down ruined in businesses ruined lives making people get the vaccine and now they're injured including you because it feels to me like you're just trying to cover your ass because you know what the fuck is coming that's what it feels to me what's coming well what I believe is coming and what I've been saying I don't know for three fucking years is that towards the election they will start to be honest about the damage that these vaccines have caused and because Trump keeps saying over and over and over and over again all the vaccines were a wonderful thing they're going to try to put the blame on operation warp speed and Trump and say he killed all these people and committed crimes against humanity when in reality he was listening to everybody around him and if you remember back in that time what would have happened if Donald Trump the media already hated him you know the media was already destroying him ever for three fucking years what would have happened had he come out and said no this is not doing this we're not shutting the country down bro you had he would be seen as a total rogue president you had a Fauci you had the NIH you had a WHO you had every single advisor every single doctor every single media person threatening people to get the vaccine or you're going to get fined or you're going to be excommunicated from society or you're going to be you know like you're a grandma killer you're killing people we had people in the stores fighting people over a fucking mask which the science says unequivocally does not do anything all right this was complete political theater to destroy Donald Trump in 2020 and now they're going to flip it and do the same thing in 2024 so you guys can say oh well he did do operation warp speed he did what the fuck he was told to do by the people around him who were the experts regarding that okay so yeah so at the end of the day bro these media personnel personalities they have a lot of balls to sit here and say oh well you know the vaccines real dude we don't forget we remember the only people that don't remember are the people who hate Trump so much that they can't get past how much to hate him everybody else remembers which is why the fucking tide is turning so hard I remember anybody who refuses of who refuse the vaccine remembers very clearly because they'll never forget in their entire lives that their neighbors wanted them to go to fucking camps because they wouldn't get a fucking shot you don't forget that kind of shit and I wonder how many people you know as sad as that story is about that doctor I wonder how many people she fucking shamed and she talks shit too and she called this or that right dude do we not remember the language do we not remember the accusations do we not remember the pressure to get vaccinated dude it was insane yeah yeah and it was crimes against humanity committed by the people at the highest points of power in the world and Klaus Schwab wrote a fucking book about it called COVID-19 the great reset you can go read it and people still think that this was an accident COVID-19 the great reset came out in 2020 how the fuck could he come out with a book that outlined all this shit they were going to do with COVID-19 if it wasn't intentional and all of these people Klaus Schwab the NIH the WHO the fucking medical experts in our government these people organized this crimes against humanity for a bunch of different reasons one for depopulation two for ruining the middle class and imposing communism three to get Donald Trump not reelected like bro all of this shit was intentional and they do we covered it there's nobody out here there's not a single person out here that covered it more than us more accurately than us more consistent than us starting in 2020 not a single fucking one not a single one go back and listen I got the receipts and I told you all this was going to happen and here we go with it so I will I could bet I would be willing to bet everything I fucking own that before November they're going to turn all these injuries on Donald Trump because he won't fucking say anything to the contrary yeah yeah yeah that that that that's man listen that's one of my biggest gripes that I have with him is like he gets on there he's like oh you know operation warp speed how good was that you know like he continues to take dollars from big pharma yeah you know well I think that's a big problem for a lot of people I think a lot of people really don't like that about Trump yeah but they're going to vote for them anyway because of all the other shit that Biden's doing but it almost makes you wonder like why the fuck he's doing that why is he doing that well why are you still taking money from pharma yeah why are you still bragging about something that clearly hurt tens of millions of people but fucking death rate across the world is up almost 40% all cause deaths what do you think that's from yeah yeah and I think two men adding to that you know with that report that came out you know a week ago whatever we're talking about how the CIA withheld allegedly withheld information and intelligence from you don't think all the mother experts in the room and it's table that's a great point you know I'm saying so that's a great point you have the CIA on James O'Keefe's undercover story talking about how they limited the information that they provided a Donald Trump you don't think that all those motherfuckers did that they all did it they all did it here was their mentality fuck he won well okay we can't let him get too much in control so Pompeo tried to handle him and pretended he was his best friend and they held all the pertinent important information details from them they let them have generalized information and you know for effect they were telling them did if you don't do this bro tens of millions of people are going to die in this country mm-hmm because that's what they were saying on the news bro do we not remember that's a tracker did that's what I was going to say the death tracker where they when they was counter they were tracking cases of COVID they were counting deaths from COVID by people who had COVID when they died people who committed suicide who happened to have COVID and by the way everybody had COVID inside of them because when they tested it they tested with a PCR test cycle rate was up over 10 times what it should be so if you even had one fucking particle not enough to get you sick but even had one particle in your body which all of you do even today it would test positive so if you test to positive post modem which everybody did they counted as a COVID death they totally lied a society it was a complete fucking lie Chris Como was at the front and the tip of the spear of that lie and while I appreciate him saying what this is it feels like a big gaslight to either A cover his ass or B pile on Trump when it comes out so that's how I see it yeah bro we could go but go back do you guys don't believe me go back and listen all the shit you won't do it because you fucking you won't take the time to do it but I could promise you when it's all said and done whatever happens no one could fucking say that we weren't on this shit and call it accurately the entire fucking time we did not fucking miss the only thing we missed on was in 2020 I thought that those people were gonna get arrested then before Biden took office and two I thought the war would start at midterms in 2022 and it actually started this year right so our bad yeah so you guys can fucking say whatever you want but dude I got receipts and they're all on the fucking internet no one else has that now guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think is gonna happen with this and let us know down there with that being said man let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumbest what this will bring hell on up we talk about it will be one of those two options you know now Tarzan was here the other day and we had talked about like going to Africa right see my people you guys talking about the real Tarzan on Instagram yeah yeah and I'm hosting yeah growing back to Africa here to my people and shit and we talk about like doing safaris and shit and seeing all that stuff and it's funny because this headline comes up which kind of
