We're gonna have CTI which stands for cruise the internet. This is where we put topics on the screen We speculate on what's true. What's not true? What are little theories are on things and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world Throughout the week we may have real talk real talk just five to 20 minutes of me giving you some real talk You might call it a rant. It is what it is and then we have occasionally 75 hard verses that's where people who have completed the 75 hard program come on the show They talk about how their life was before how their life is now and how they use the 75 hard program to get their shit back on track Okay, if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard it is the initial phase of the live hard program Which you can get for free at episode 208 on the audio feed again. That's 208 on the audio feed. It's not on YouTube Okay, if you're unfamiliar with live hard it is the world's most popular mental transformation program ever And you can get it for free, okay? There's also a book the book is not free, but it is much more in depth. It's available on my website Andy for cella.com It's called the book on mental toughness that covers the entire live hard program plus a whole bunch of other chapters Regarding what mental toughness is and how to utilize it to build the life that you want now one thing about this show That's different than every other show Is that we don't run ads on the show, all right? I don't take money from corporations that tell me what I can and can't say Finance the show completely out of my own pocket and I ask very simply one thing in return 1.5 things in return But one thing in return is we ask that if the show brings you value if it gives you Information that you use to help you if it makes you think if it makes you laugh it gives you new perspective Do us a favor and share the show okay the show only grows if you share it and then the point five is very simple by my shit Like this amazing for energy That you can get everywhere and if you can't get it everywhere You'll add them about getting it. What was that? That was a town magical. That's how that's it's magical It's what happens when you let a 60-year-old work of sound that's what happens when you touch a form energy, especially the great Well, sometimes you hear sirens Hey By my shit support the show and don't be a whole week show the show all right. Yeah, man What's up? It's going on bro nothing man. I'm not a whole lot dude. I thought that was he shines magic carpet riding Bro, I heard music I Thought I heard a little snake come out here a different sound I hear a different sound. I grabbed one of the great ones But yeah, no dude. I was what's popping man? We got a new an A's yeah, man. We missed a couple weeks on them. Yeah Should happens hey, it's it's a busy time of year This is this is the busiest time of year for me personally, you know, we got summer smash We've got a bunch of new things going on. This is kind of when we're starting to plan for next year and You know, I got a real job. I'm not a professional podcast. Well, I am professional podcaster amongst other things. Yeah It's on the resume youtuber You know Back that's quick out what huh? Professional joke teller is out of this well, you're not I'm I'm amager All right, I am amateur not a little bit. Yeah, nothing much man. Just you know You look a skinny dude. Thanks man. What's going on? Thanks man? I do listen anxiety stress Crack cocaine crack actually We know it's not working out. No, well, honestly what it is dude. I just This because you know, I've had a few you know big pushes where I would go and then fall off Right and like you know every time I've I've approached it a little different and this time I was like I just do basics Don't fucking eat too much and I'm getting at least 10,000 steps a day It's real simple, dude. So just move it now like you know, I've realized I like it's I'm down like 35 pounds right now since like March None of my suits fit so the bullying works bullying does work. I mean, it's always worked It was just in different phases, but um, but not man, you know, just hitting my steps eating eating Healthy and and and within a reason and just moving man. Well, it's working bro. You look good. Thanks man Yeah, none of my suits fit. It's too big too big really like bro I'm kind of a good feeling though It's way better feeling than when they don't fit the other way no 400% there's no doubt But like bro, I put this fucking suit on the other day because I had a few to go to and I put this fucking suit on I look like a fucking giant cardboard box. Was it one of your nice suits? No, but those don't fit either Really we got called chat. They'll they'll redo it. They'll help fit them for you really. Yeah, okay. Well, yeah I mean, but like it'd probably be a lot of fabric coming out like brother fucking rap it like it's weird But yeah, no, it's a good. It's good. You know, so I'm on it. I'm I was 278 this morning good and Someone can we keep moving and then you know, just slowly work back in my goal I would like to be like 255. Yeah, 26 when you're gonna start lifting that's what I was about to say like I'm gonna start like Working that back into it You started lifting you know that weight loss going to slow now a little bit. Yeah, and I think that's like it's a mental fuck up At least for a minute. Yeah, it's a mental fuck up because I but dude you can't work bro As long as you keep hammering away. Yeah, the scale doesn't fucking matter. Yeah, like what matters is did you do the shit or did you not do the shit if you do the shit Even if the scale doesn't say the number you want you're gonna look the way that you should look yeah, you know Like I always used to tell myself. I'm like bro. I need to get down to two thirty five Do you know what I would look like a two thirty five crack it? I would look like I had like I was sick Mm-hmm, you know and and you know I happen to look pretty good at like two fifty five and that's not the number I like but that's where I look the best. Yeah, you know, so I don't really pay attention to where are you at right now? I'm like 260. Yeah. Yeah, yeah That like but that to me that like I think that's when you look the best because you look dense You know second a good way. Yeah, but it's like I feel I As I get older I start to feel better being a little bit lighter and like Like it sounds stupid no, no, it sounds stupid because like you don't think five pounds makes a big difference big difference But it does I'm so in tune because you know, I've been training for 30 years I Can feel a big difference like if I get like one pound above 260. I feel I Could feel it if I get like if I be if I get to like two sixty five I feel like it's a 30 pound difference So yeah, that's why yeah, but it's good because when I was heavier like you know A lot of you guys don't know but I was 350 pounds when I was that big bro, I could gain 20 pounds and not notice it because I was always wearing like shit to hide it and I was wearing like you know Workout shit all the time and you can't really see the difference Just kind of get bigger and smaller of the same shape and dude you could put on you know 20 pounds and not really notice it and I don't know man. It's I've struggled with my whole life. So I'm very empathetic to people who Go up and down and you know, that's that's one of the benefits of the 75 hard program dude like you know when I I really started it Seven eight years ago living that way I mean dude, I haven't even when I was not able to work out for like a year and a half for my shoulder thing I was I didn't go backwards. Yeah for sure. You know for sure, man. It's about just developing The ability to adhere yeah, go crazy. I think that was my thing Like I wanted something that like was sustainable and like not every day You know how it is brother with busy bro. We there's more than just podcast in here. And so it's like I know I can get 10,000 steps a day Yeah, like no like even if I'm just chill. Okay cool. Let's go outside the lab. You know, I'm saying like that's very sustainable Yeah, and then once you get a street going you don't want to bust it. Yeah exactly exactly. So yeah, no, it's good though, man But it is Monday. So let's let's make some people better today. I got some villains for you. All right good I got some hopefully we got some call ins man. Let's let's get Jordan on the phone. Let's give him a call Jordan what's up, dude DJ what's up man? What's going on man? You were alive on the air. What's up Jordan? What's up, man? Did appreciate y'all taking the call yeah for sure bro. How are you? Where are you at right now? I'm about 20 minutes out of Nashville down in Austin. Oh, that's a good beautiful country down there. That's good. That's good spot. Yeah, it is. So what so what's what what do we got for us today? All right, I'll give you a little back toy and then I'll ask the question. So about a month ago, four months back completely from the bone just had a surgery and this is about far the biggest setback, you know, out of space. I Maybe you had that major shoulder surgery a few years ago too. One thing I've noticed is that when people go through Made the setbacks whether physical or whatever else Two things usually happen made a spiral out get a lot worse You know, they come back better than they were before and it's interesting From the people you know talk to you to reach out. They're like either too far I'm so sorry this happened or what an opportunity you've got here I think you're gonna look back and be happy that you went through this and that's kind of tough to see in the moment when you're going through it So I guess my question for you is After a major setback like you went through with your shoulder surgery something that you can't just get over in a week It's six months 12 months two years. What did you learn about yourself in that process that you didn't know prior This healthy kind of stronger than the two days today, bro. It's funny that you bring that up We were littered like before we called you. We were literally just talking about this Yeah, Andy doesn't get these questions. I have yeah, so like we we I was just talking about going through that two minutes ago before we called you That's perfect family. Yeah, sure man Look I look dude. I get where you're at It's demoralizing To have an injury that Literally keeps you from training and it's a completely different thing You know one of the things that and for those of you guys that don't know back in 2021 I completely destroyed my shoulder. I tore my super spinatus my lab room my rotator cup my bicep tendon and I had to have major reconstructive surgery to fix it and I went through about an 18th month Recovery on it to where I really couldn't train it took me five months to be able to put my arm over my head It was it was brutal. So that's what Jordan's talking about and At the time that it happened I was in the best physical shape I'd ever been in and I had worked so Hard to get into that shape and then like literally I was in that shape for like a week And then that injury happened and so it was super demoralizing bro and So I understand where you're at dude like that's I felt that same way I went through you know, it almost sounds goofy, but I went through like this weird like grieving process where I was like you know Having these conversations with myself like you know fuck this is You know, I can't believe this happened. Why this happened to me? Why I didn't deserve this I did this and and dude So you you kind of go through this like big emotional dip and and I would say that stuck with me for a while I Would say I was like that for good six months, but what I did do during that time As I still did what I could I did every single thing that I could in fact the day I had my shoulder surgery I did cardio after the shoulder surgery So I kept moving I kept trying to eat the best that I could I Did everything that I physically could do and Here's what I could tell you man, you know when you're where you are It's it's it's hard. It's hard to see the other side of where you're gonna come out, but having gone through that myself What I learned about myself is that I Have made a permanent change in my ability to push through and persevere and Handle very tough situations where things don't go the way that I want them to go You know when things don't go the way we want them to go we kind of You know depending on who you are. I'm just not used to that, you know I a lot of people you know nothing ever goes the way they want it to go because they're not willing to do anything to make it go that way But when you're willing to do anything that you can to make things go the way you want them to go and then still doesn't go that way It's very fucking frustrating, but here's what I'll tell you dude When I look back on that time now I Think it was like the ultimate test. I think it was a huge test You know we talk about test days being you know, I don't want to work out today, but did I get it done? And and the reality is is you know, that's a small test But you really don't know what you're made of or who you are until something big tests you until something that you know You can't get through in one day and that's what you're going through and I think the way you should be looking at it, dude Is that you're gonna push through this? You're gonna you're gonna get to the other side and I think you will be glad that it happened to you because it will reaffirm that you aren't a bitch, you know what I'm saying and just for lack of Vocabulary you know, I think it's a good opportunity to prove to yourself that You're not gonna let something major derail you I think it's a great opportunity to build confidence and trust and self-esteem and worth And a probably the biggest scale because it's one thing to like you know, let's say do 75 hard or have some sort of goal and hit it But it's another thing to have to push through something where you're literally not allowed to do certain things that you would normally do so Yeah, dude, I can I understand where you're going through I went through the same thing. It was a huge mental mind-fuck But after going through it now I'm physically better than I was then I'm Three years four years older than I was then that was a big concern of mine too I was like shit dude like am I too old to get back where I was and And I and I have and I surpassed it and I'm proud of myself for it And I think you know as long as you keep things in check, you know do what you can keep moving keep your diet going and Really dude, I think it'll come back sooner than you think Yeah, man, this is I really do your story so much because I had just finished 75 hard I think a group of guys through it and then I was on like day 24 of phase one and Basically that ended that second workout and I'm definitely You know mid 30s in the best physical shape of lean-ness fastness drinks that I've ever been and now we're just trying to get back to Baselon it's a pretty big You know mind hard a little like you're getting on yeah Look at back to 20 years of weight training and now Just to get to where I'm at and I'm a hard Pathocized in six weeks and I can't move it so this has been super helpful Well, I will tell you this it comes back super fast So you're at your age your muscle memory is pretty pretty set in I would recommend you know make sure you're eating enough protein regardless of you're able to train or not that'll help with muscle wasting and Make sure you move and dude, you know keep as much of the good momentum as you can One thing I did is I did 75 hard During my injury, but I did it with just two cardio workouts a day So I would just do one inside and one outside So that allowed me to keep my discipline and check keep it operating at a high level and that way when I healed I was able to kind of jump right back into it and dude, you know We've all seen this before bro Like think of all the people that have an injury like this and then you know like you said Which is what we were talking about before we called you know they they go all the way back they go they they go to Literally an untrained human and you know they gain a hundred pounds and then they got a dig out of that hole and and I was just telling DJ and the guys here One of the things I'm most proud of and I think you will be too is that I was able to Basically confirmed to myself That these changes and who I am are permanent and real Because if they weren't dude, I would have been 350 pounds again, you know what I'm saying? Oh 100% good it. Yeah, bro. Just big appetite over here. Yeah, just keep just dude just do what you can and Try to keep the habits and the ability, you know the mental Sharpness in check and I think you're gonna be fine man. It's just frustrating right now dude. I Do have a little extra on this question So I Did put a lot of I guess my mental strength and mental toughness I guess a lot of it did come from the physical pursuit and I'm sure you can relate to that too Did you just dive more into books? Not being able to go hard because I'm not a big runner, but I enjoy running or I do it because it's tough and it trains the brain But right now, I mean I came wrong for 12 more weeks, you know And way trying to stop coming around anytime soon. So was there any other kind of pool did you feel that too? Well for me dude, you know my my life is pretty hectic every day, you know I'm always working on new projects. It's just a nature of my life So I wouldn't say that I You know poured more onto that or even poured more into it either I personally just did what I could you know when I couldn't and by the way I didn't run one time. I just walked every time Yeah, and you know dude. It's it's not about the physical exertion. It's about the adherence to the Pattern all right, it's about saying hey, these are my five six things. I have to get done today Did those get done? Yes, and then that contributes to your discipline and it builds that skill set up So it really doesn't matter bro if it's you know reading pouring yourself into a new project or You know learning something new and bro, you know what? This is a great time to learn some new shit We're going through this big change of society where you know AIs becoming a real thing and you know Maybe maybe you could use that to pour yourself into something else like that But I would recommend at a bare minimum dude that you keep the structure going the best that you can that way whenever you heal You're you're very quick to come back and let me tell you bro. Remember you're mid-30s I didn't I was 350 pounds at 36 Okay, so you're you're way fucking ahead of me bro. So like just keep that Yeah, dude look I Feel you I understand how hard it is mentally man But it's a good test because dude There's gonna be other things in your life that aren't gonna go your way There's gonna be things that happen that you know We don't want to deal with but we have to deal with and that's just the nature of being a human being and these kind of things Prepare us for the really hard things and so I would try to look at it like that brother and I would you know Just remember you're gonna be fine. You're gonna come back better and you're going through a test, bro And it's just up to you to pass it Man, that's awesome again. I appreciate it. I was one of the Speak I've been listening that was 24 and I think you took a look at my life You probably see that Okay, thank you guys about You guys keep doing the show. We'll keep sharing it all right, bro. I appreciate you Jordan. Hey in there, bro All right, man, fuck you Yeah, that's gotta be a tough thing. I guess just Battling the the awareness of how much momentum you actually have going and being aware enough not to fuck it up When big setbacks like that happen like that's got to be the toughest piece of that Because I felt like a lot of people lack that like they're not realizing like how much steam they actually have moving forward So it's like oh, that's whatever. I'll just fucking Well, sometimes these these types of situations where you can't do the thing I can't do it. Yeah actually create a situation where you appreciate it even more when you're through it You know like one thing and I didn't mention this on the phone, but I should have is that Going through that dude like there's not really a day now that I go in the gym and I'm like oh this fucking sucks Yeah, like I'm very When I came back from that injury, I mean I couldn't lift my arm over my head Yeah, you know, I remember putting the 10 pound plate on the big deal. That's what I'm saying I was just getting ready to say that when I when I started training again When I got hurt I was shoulder pressing four plates, okay When I started back I was shoulder-placing a five pound plate five pounds Okay, so and it if I be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me that was like how the fuck am I gonna get back to where I was? But lo and behold I'm back there. So you know, it's the same it's the same shit, bro It's it's you do what you can every day you you stay consistent you push a little harder and things happen man and It's a good metaphor for life. That's why I love weight training so much in terms of like how parallel it is To your success in life. It's just every day Monotonous shit over and over and over and over and over again and you know Every two weeks you notice a little bit of improvement and a little bit more and a little bit more and over the course of you know a year you're a completely different human and It's just a very strong parallel to how business works, which is a whole another like kind of confusing thing to me because I see a lot of people in fitness who are totally fit they have all the discipline to You know eat the right amount of food do the training drink the water But they suck at everything else. It's like fuck bro. Like it's the same thing. It's the same thing You have the skill set you just got to apply it over to here, you know, so Yeah, man It's just it's a test, you know, are you gonna pass it or you not and some people do and Some people don't and I think most people don't I think most people don't pass the test and they end up getting worse and they stay there And then they tell a story from the next 20 years man I used to be a great shape, but I blew my shoulder out and then you know and 89 Yeah, all right, then you're like, yeah, when was that? Yeah, that was a 1997 and it's like What the fuck you been doing almost 30 years ago? Yeah, so like it's just you know I don't know man. I it's a test. You're gonna pass tests or not. I love it man. I love it We got it right in let's let's go to question number two Guys Andy. Hi Andy. Hi I'm an interpreneur at a local business local small business in my hometown I first started six years ago at a basic entry level position and using the lessons From your podcast. I have moved up all the way to top management under the owner which I've been for the past two years now My question for you is what do I go from here? I'm a very ambitious high-driven individual who wants to keep climbing the ladder But the owner of the company has seemed to lose his hustle and has actually started downsizing our crew From at one point nine guys to now three I don't want to start over but I'm nervous that I'll just be stuck in limbo any help is appreciated Thank you for your time what business he say You say no just small small business dimly dimly say it all no Okay, well first of all You're you're not starting over Okay, because you've developed this this massive skill set that most people will never develop By applying the things that you've read and learned and listen to into your career for real all right I'm gonna toot my own horn here. We give away fucking gold here, bro like gold But here's the reality most people don't do it. They will listen. They will come to the events They will go to everybody's you know the buy everybody's books go to everybody's retreats do all the shit But they don't fucking do what they know to do And that's the difference and you Have taken the information and you've applied it to your life and it's made you and Reaffirm to you that these are the things you need to do to be successful So no matter what if they close the business today You still have this experience and the skill set to go provide value to anyone else Really doing anything because no matter what it is you're doing whether it's you know You're working on cars or you're building the house or you're working in IT or AI or fucking CPG or any of this shit The principles of success are always the same so You are not starting over so just remember that and a lot of people won't change Their career paths because they're afraid of starting over not realizing that they're not gonna start over because of all the experience They've had they're gonna go right into wherever they go And they're gonna provide a much of value and they're gonna move the fuck up real fast If they get in the right place and that's that takes some discernment but If you want to stay where you are You probably are gonna have to have a talk with the owner and say And and this is this is what I would say and this is real shit, okay Owners get tired They get tired all right running a business is hard It I've been doing what I do for 26 years now I'm fucking I'm fucking tired bro the only re I'm not doing it for myself anymore the only reason I go hard anymore is for everybody around me It's not about me anymore and if someone and that's been for about 10 years just so we're clear The most people never come to that understanding that they have an obligation to the people around them They just never figured out and that doesn't mean they're bad people they just don't think about it Because that's not what society says there's no business guy besides me telling CEOs Hey, man, you know, you have an obligation your employees to create a good life for them too Most people that are operating a business look at their employees as if they are just cogs in the wheel Hey fire that guy. Hey replace that guy. Hey do this and then they ask me Well, how do how can I build a great culture? Well, you can't because you don't give a fuck about your people Okay, so and that doesn't mean they're bad people That means they've never opened their eyes to that reality because it's it's it's not what people talk about so Having a conversation with him saying hey, man, you know We've put a lot of effort and time into this business and we care a lot about it And you know, we noticed that you're kind of slowing down and We get it like you've been doing this a long time you could do whatever you want with your business But that kind of puts a limit on what we're trying to do man and I'm not like threatening you or anything like that But we would like to continue to grow the business. Well, you can't get mad. Yeah, yeah so Is there a way that we could continue to grow the business and you know pick up some of this weight that you've been carrying for so long And continue to grow our careers and then have that conversation with them and he says no then you know, you say okay Well, I'm gonna I have to look out for myself and you know That and that becomes a different conversation of where you're going to move on to or what you're going to do But a lot of times communication just solves these things man having a real talk um Hey We've been working really hard for this business and we noticed we went from nine guys to three guys Are you checking out? Good. Yeah, or do you have another plan? Well, you know, I'm getting older and you know, this is we're pretty good and I want to say Spend time with my family and this okay cool How would you feel about us taking the reins? Do you trust us to run the company We could do this in this and this and then go to him with a plan Because dude a lot of guys they don't feel like their team actually wants to grow the shit They you know a lot of owners broke They're dragging their team and dude. I'm gonna tell you when you drag people for fucking it's heavy so Presenting him with an opportunity to grow the company With your effort and your teammates effort is probably going to be well received by him if you go to him with a plan so That would be how I address it first. I would go have a conversation. I would have a plan. Hey, we can do this Uh, and then you know, I would see what he says and if he says no, I'm not interested in that You know, I would say okay. Well, is there an opportunity for us to buy the company from you? Would you finance us to buy the company from you so that we continue going Uh, would you let like lay out the options of what potentially could be and uh, you know Maybe something will happen and if it doesn't happen like I said in the beginning You're not starting over you already have a skill set you've been doing very well with it So you go find somewhere that you could fit in that is committed to growing I would say too also in a You guys have to be very selective about where you go to work as an entrepreneur You know, not all careers and jobs are not created the same Being with a company Especially a small to a mid-size company that wants to grow and win is a huge deal It's rare. It's it's rare and you have to be able to identify it as an employee Otherwise you waste your fucking life right is the company moving forward Are they trying to grow do they have big goals or is the owner 20 years in and kind of just happy where they are If you sign up to go work for that second option You're automatically kept by the owner's lack of initiative to grow the company at this point in time anyway You see what I'm saying? So So I just a little add on to that question is you guys have to understand that You have to be aware of the direction of the company before you take the job if you want your career to grow um And I think a lot of people are just like I got the job If you just got the job and the place is dying it doesn't do you very very much help you know I mean it's not very good. So I like the point too about I mean even because it is a mind you have to shift your mindset But like you know, let's say you know your your company cut three people out right well that's three salaries that are open now So can I do some work that they were doing that you know? I'm saying like can I can I make myself more valuable yeah, but it's not just money man. It's long term like yeah You might get a raise and even if you got a 50% raise today is that all you ever want? Yeah, yeah, you know what I'm saying. Yeah, that's deep. It doesn't this person here Does not sound like they are going to be satisfied Regardless of how much money they make. I know a lot of people come to work and they want to make money But there's also a different kind of person There's the kind of person that wants to build and wants to create and wants to become and evolve and grow And the money's great But more so they want to contribute to something that's that's building yeah, and There's not many people like that But there's enough and he sounds like one of them whoever that wrote that in so love the fucking game Yeah, there's people that do I'm like that. Yeah, I don't Necessarily care that much about the money at this point, you know Now that's because I have some but You know, but yeah, but the reality is is like I'm all the things I'm doing. I'm doing for a purpose. They're not for the paycheck. Yeah, and You know, I've found that to be much more fun and fulfilling I'm having more fun now than I ever had and I don't even take a paycheck for my companies anymore I'm having more fun. I come in here. I I work with the teams. I have fun with them. You know, I help them grow and It's because the mission. It's the mission. It's it's the purpose. It's the and I think you know when we look at people who are depressed and unsatisfied with their lives The number one thing that we can identify is that they work very hard with no real Purpose, you know, like it's very hard as work for what yeah Like dude working hard is not the only thing that matters you have to work hard with an outcome in mind If you show up to work hard and there's no long-term outcome in mind whether it be More money or whether it be a purpose or whether it be Some sort of mission You're you're you're gonna get burned out bro like you're gonna hate your life because it's just straight monotony with no reward and We can go like all of us do and hit the rock as hard as we can every mother fucking day But once the law we want those fucking rocks to break, you know, and if you never have one that breaks dude You're gonna burn out. So you have to you know, you have to be Cognizant of that, you know, and then there's jobs that pay a lot, but don't have a mission You know, and that's that that's the same thing. So many people are unhappy too exactly you're gonna be miserable dude And maybe maybe Maybe your mission is outside of work. Maybe your job allows you to finance your ability to travel and do missionary work or something like that But you got to have a purpose bro, and the purpose has to be real and so many people Just don't have one because our society doesn't really cultivate purpose There's not a lot of companies that are purpose driven now. They're becoming more and more popular because the younger generation Has identified that that's how they want to work and live They want to work, but they want to work towards something not just towards a paycheck But it's still few and far between and if you look at how our societies portrayed in The propaganda which is our television shows and our movies. What's it? What's it do? It says you wake up You go to work you go home you eat dinner you go to sleep You wake up you go to work you go home, and it's just this repetitive cycle No one talks about what we're actually trying to accomplish and what we're trying to do like even with this podcast We have a fucking mission our mission is to open mother fuckers eyes to their role in truly revolutionizing culture Okay, our mission here on this podcast is to Create the understanding that we will never fix society unless You fix yourself We do that through personal development. We do that through awareness of what's going on in the world And then we do it through quality, okay? So everything that I'm involved in has a purpose and I don't think people think about that enough They don't think about like what am I trying to do here? And the ones who are just trying to make money It really never lasts now there is people that like all they care about is money, but that's just not most people man No, you know, so I love it. Well, we got we got one more question. Let's get a call in here. Let's get Tommy on the phone Let's give him a call Hello Tommy Hey, what's up, dude? What's going on DJ? Oh, nothing much got big into you. What's up Tommy? How's it going guys good bro. How are you? Oh, I'm not too bad for a Friday, man. Haha, what are you calling from time? I'm from australia, California, man. Oh sick. I'm sorry. Yeah, sorry. Sorry to hear that. Yeah You know, I don't necessarily line with all these politics over here I don't know how many people are here You know, California is a great place. It's just that there's There's enough crazy people to make crazy the weather's nice. Yeah, it is nice. It's the best fucking weather ever It's nice 75 degrees right now. Oh, man. Beautiful. Sunshine and man. That's what's up, dude. So what can we help you with today? All right, so just a little background story, man I I had a project manager slash super intended for underground pipeline company out here. Oh, and I've been on the Pipelayer. Hey, that's my best pickup one at the bars bro Um, anyways, yeah I've been with this company for about 10 years. I started out the bottom as an apprentice thing kind of worked my way up All the way to the position I'm in now um But this crew that I have an issue with they I mean, I've been with them for the past five years and they started working under me And they made a stupid decision That kind of cost us a reputation um And now the owner wants an answer out of me. So what am I gonna do is far is firing or Refer me any the whole crew or just a form it in charge wrong is I mean One of the good main guys in charge is that crew is my dad. So it's like, okay. How do I? How do I kind of approach this? What? Well, what happened? Um, we're installing a new water system for uh good customer bars. I've been doing for about five years They took a shortcut and they tried to hide it And then one of the inspectors came back and saw it and laughed at us all over emails and everything saying we're kind of fuck over fuck them over and hide stuff from them did this uh Did you have you guys what have you guys done to try and make it right? Uh, so far what we did was we took the whole crew off that job right now um and put a new I ended up putting a new crew out there and new form it in charge um And that's kind of where we're at right now, but the developer they want answers of what we're gonna do So do you have any indication of how this actually happened like who made the call on it? So far what I got out of it is it's uh The four people involved the four men the lead guy my pops and one of the other guys So your dad was involved in it? Yeah, yeah, that sucks bro. So what what is your uh, what is your superior saying exactly? um They just said you know it It's your choice. Do you handle how you gonna handle and I'll back you up, but they're leaning more of firing the one man in charge, but to me I kind of It you just fire one person or everybody who made the mistake or just a referendum Get rid of them. Is this the first time that this has happened? Yeah, do you know that for sure? Uh, it's the first time getting caught I believe that's what I'm saying I'm sure there's other issues where they kind of ran into and shortcut it's being and getting it caught, but You know, I just I feel disappointed because they were my guys back then and you know my standards not that yeah Yeah, and so it comes down on you I get it bro Yeah, that's super hard to deal with you know like I was actually just having a conversation earlier um Kind of similar to that not where a It's very hard when people that are on your team Don't hold the standard and then it falls back on you and as a leader That happens literally every time that's the Role of a of being a leader and so I can understand how frustrating that is um, I guess The thing that I would be concerned with if I were you and I were your superior would be Is this an opportunity to where they can learn the lesson and never do it again? And If so Then a reprimand may be appropriate and here's why because A lot of people will just fire a crew okay, they'll they'll say okay, you're all fucking fired But the problem with that is that when they hire a new crew The new crew will end up doing the same fucking thing again because they didn't learn the lesson so the question becomes Did they learn to not do this and why and can I trust that they won't do it again because of that And I can look at this as a cost of their education and development Or is this egregious enough to where I have to fire them And so I have a similar not not at the exact same thing But I could I could tell you a million stories, but I could think of one off top my head One time back in the early days of my business Um, we were ordering t-shirts and we ordered $12,000 worth of t-shirts And I know that doesn't sound like a lot But for us at the time that would have been the equivalent of us ordering 10 million dollars worth of t-shirts It was a lot for us And the person on my team that ordered the shirts Did not measure the proper size on the back of the shirt So when we got the shirts the logo was so big on the shirts that we couldn't even use it because it looked ridiculous And it was all because she didn't measure it properly and At first my instinct was like I'm firing her. This is bullshit. This costs us 12 but then I Thought about it and I'm like, okay Is this gonna happen again if I hire a new person and the answer Is probably so if I were you I would determine with your superior. I would take your dad being a part of it out of the equation, okay, because There's nothing you could do about it. He already put himself in that position When it comes to these kind of things there's There's a way you can do it and there's sometimes you can't do it So take the emotional part of it out of the equation and look at it very simply like this Are they going to do this again if we keep them and if you guys determine that they will then you got to get rid of them if you can make it to where You know they won't do it again Then you should look at this as an investment and their development Realizing that if you hire a new crew, they're gonna find ways to cut corners anyway if you've been leading anybody for any amount of time You know that everybody finds a way to cut corners because it's human nature very few people will not try to find a way to cut corners and So the question really becomes Can we save ourselves this mistake again or are we for sure gonna have it again with a new crew and that's how I would look at it so um if you can reprimand them and it'd be assured that they're not gonna do it ever again then Then a reprimand be appropriate if This is the nature of those guys and they're gonna shake their head. Yes, and then go do it again and cost the company uh the reputation Then you got to get rid of them, but I think it'll happen again with a new crew um So that that's what I would talk to your superior about say hey look here's the situation man. I thought this through I appreciate you letting me Sort of think this through on my own and here's what I've come up with If we hire a new crew We're probably gonna end up dealing with this again because they're gonna cut corners and I don't want that But I'm a little concerned that if we keep these guys That they're gonna do it again because they already did it So how can we make sure that they don't do it again that way we don't automatically run into it with a new crew and that would be the way to you know salvage your dad's career And also you know do right by the company and then on the top of that There needs to be some extra form of goodwill to try and correct this with the customer um And I don't know what that is because I don't know enough about your business, but it needs to be made right So that that's how I would look at it if I were you bro. Does that make sense? No, it makes sense Yeah, I mean dude. I've led thousands of people over my career and People fucking make mistakes people do dumb shit Sometimes they don't even have a good reason for it But as long as they don't do it again is what really matters because hiring new people training new people That shit's expensive. It's hard. It takes time and if they are able to learn the lesson right there on the spot You know sometimes you got to give them a smack on the ass, you know figuratively, but um You know It's still cheaper than finding a new crew. It's just math I mean, let me actually this time you while you're on the phone too Andy Is there anything from his position as a leader that he can learn from this? You know, I'm saying like was is do you like Tommy? Do you think this was a situation where your eye was kind of off the ball Not really on the team not really you know making sure the day-to-day stuff was going on like what what's the learning opportunities for it for Tommy in the situation? Well, I mean look I'm gonna tell you from my experiences that if you take your eye off the ball and you don't have the systems in place to a sure That things are done specifically perfectly You're gonna always drift off the mark um always have speeders. Yeah for sure So so yeah, unless you have a governor on the fucking truck right? So which is why right? Which is why work trucks have GPS and governors? Yeah, because they have to they can explain to their people all they want Hey, don't drive like an asshole. It hurts the company if you do, but guess what they still got to do it So that's actually a great example. So they still put GP. Yes, so they put governors because they know that a little sticker on the Yeah call if that's right. Yeah, so System scale and systems regulate and when you have a Team that is moving off the mark when you take your eye off of them That keeps you from being able to scale because every time you turn the other way and try to grow they fuck up So what that tells you is that you need a system to regulate their compliance on the procedures. So I don't know what that is in pipeline. Yeah for sure, you know, but that would be a systematic Procedure or checklist or certification something that allows for For Tommy to have 100% assurance that that does not happen and so a lot of times and bro You this is a really good point a lot of times these things are really good opportunities to fix holes in your company's game that you didn't see before so So So yeah, bro, that's how I would handle it man. It's you know if they're gonna do it again You gotta get rid of them if they're not it's an investment in their education Because if you hire a new crew, they're for sure gonna do it again. That's how I look at it Right on. Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely what I'm gonna do then I'm heading back to my office right now. I'm gonna talk to them. So yeah Yeah, I mean dude, it's tough situation, but look man This isn't anything that anybody that leads is unfamiliar with like everybody that leads people knows about these situations. So Have a talk with your boss You know give them the rundown give them your concerns ask him for his guidance And then ask him what he thinks about the system that should be in place to regulate make sure and what that's gonna look like too Bro is it's gonna make you look like you really thought it out and he's gonna appreciate that bro like I would start the conversation with like look I know you're gonna think that I don't want to fire these guys because it's my dad But here here's what I think okay if We fire them and we hire a new crew and run this things the exact same way This will likely happen again eventually And we don't want that if we are able to assure that This crew will not make that mistake again by punishing them in a way that's Severe but not so severe that it costs them their jobs Are they able to learn that lesson and not do it again and then on top of that what system can we put in on top to make sure no matter what it doesn't happen That that's a well thought out strategy if somebody came to me with that I would say all right this guy's This guy gets it. He's a good leader. Yeah, so and then you know take responsibility for it You know, hey ultimately bro. This is the ultimate mr. Boss. This is my fault. Okay, and Here's what I think we need to do to fix it and I think if you handle it that way bro. It's all gonna work out good Love it, man. I appreciate it. Yeah Well listen man, it won't be the last time we're dealing with something like this, you know, so It's a good learning opportunity for everybody Yeah, for sure 100% man, but I just want to say thanks to you. I'm on my 375 hard and I try to do it every year Yeah, that's awesome. I'm wearing that now because of you guys. That's awesome brother. Well good work, dude. Keep it up and You know, I hope this all this all work out for you man. Just uh, you know Run the play. I just gave you dude. I think that's the right way to do it Awesome man will do all right brother. Well, you have a good afternoon and uh We'll talk to you soon bro Thanks man. Appreciate you guys. All right. See you Tommy Yeah, I like it and I think too you got to keep the dad relationship out doesn't matter. Yeah, shouldn't it It's it's and unfortunately, you know It is what it is. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's business man I mean a lot of times people get in business with their fucking family and their family is in the one Biggest speeders that ends up ruining it that because they know they can so yeah um Look, I it's human nature man people try to cut corners. They try to make things easier They don't understand that by doing things perfect every time you're instilling a habit in yourself that carries into every area of your life It's unawareness, you know, I don't understand why this matters I don't understand why I should have to do it right and This is a good opportunity to show people why it should be done right. Yeah, well You know, it's tough when people do that especially when you care about him bro I mean, I've had a number of situations over the years where people that I've really fucking cared about I've made really bad fuck-ups and Sometimes I've had to fire them sometimes we've been able to Make sure it never happens again. It just depends. Are they going to understand Why this can't happen or are they not and you'll know when you talk to them. Yeah 100% man. I love it man. I love it guys That was three. Yep. How do I start a week man? Yeah. All right guys. Well, uh Let's go out. Let's kick some ass and we'll see them all on CTI millions in the code bad bitch. Oh, that's what got a own bank row.
