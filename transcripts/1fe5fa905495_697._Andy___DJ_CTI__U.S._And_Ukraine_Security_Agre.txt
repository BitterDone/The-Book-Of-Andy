That's how it goes for me bro all those people that like yeah you know like they're sending me the shit now yeah that's because they they they're just figuring it out and they're like oh dude check it out it's like yeah motherfucker so that two years ago yeah we've been trying to tell you it's still great though it's great I appreciate it but it's needed yeah it's needed we got to have that but yeah anything going on new before we get to it you good how you feeling. Live in La Vita Loka yeah for sure yeah living that that crazy life yeah I don't think I have anything new I'm just training yeah doing a thing running the businesses you know being a real entrepreneur you know the kind they actually write books about tell the America dream story not the other kind that populates the internet which is the kind that I'm American greed you know I'm saying so I am a real entrepreneur I'm doing real I'm not doing it. I'm doing real entrepreneur stuff I'm not selling people on bullshit just doing the do yeah shit takes time so I'm up here every day cranking away I love that man yeah talking shit to the internet that's how I like that that's been great and we got some shit talk about the day yeah there's you never see me it's like what do grown men do instead of going to therapy and it's a start of podcasts well that's fuck they're talking about us. I like it I like it all right sweet well uh guys hope you guys had a great weekend and great start to your week it's Tuesday so let's let's give us this cruise dude did you see that meme that air Schmidt shared uh that it was announced from the White House in August of 2021 that said if you're fully vaccinated you're now allowed to go outside like dude I don't think people remember how bad how bad this shit was and how tyrannical and crazy it was and how harmful it was to relationships to the economy to people's health who broke into people's families it wasn't like it was just one fucking day like bro this was two years yeah bullshit yeah so they can fucking steal our your money now they're allowed yeah allowed to go outside now now you got these fuckers trying to pass a 44% capital gains tax on top of the 60% death tax that they have okay so do you know what that means that that means that you work your whole life and along the way you pay 40% income plus another 20 or 30 to the state right when you add it all up then if you build something which is hard to do because of how much they fucking take from you on your on that side of it if you happen to build something then when you sell it you got to pay him 44% okay then when you die you got to give him 60% if you don't have a will set up or a trust set up whatever's left yeah people don't understand this for that makes the government your fucking partner in life no matter what you do no matter what you do that's crazy yeah people don't understand taxes bro that's why I don't teach to you in school and get better odds is getting a fucking divorce bro listen dude that it's total 98% of people do not understand taxes they don't understand it'll give it yeah yeah if they understood it bro they realize holy shit dude I'm getting fucked like dude imagine that you work your whole life to sell a business and then they fucking take 44% of it when you sell it that's insane dude it's fucking it's it's fucking communism bro that's insane the gut listen the whole the whole system has to be completely read on or burnt down and rebuild like it's so big it's so bloated it's so corrupt that there's really no correcting it because the people who make the laws that are there are gonna always make laws that are in their favor they're not gonna make laws that are favorable to the community and the people that they serve this is no longer a government that serves the people and that's a fact just a fact of the statistics yeah and then they've learned to you turn that and use that on the people and like yeah incentivize certain behaviors to get more of those behaviors and then those people then vote so that way they can keep the fucking incentives bro let listen so you make a hundred thousand dollars a year okay they print they they tax you okay so you pay them half your money they're getting about 50 more than 50 when you add it all up but we'll just say 50 so you're left with 50 thousand dollars all the while they're printing money that will which is causing inflation which means that your 50 grand is worth less and less and less and less and less and less so for us to protect ourselves from that we have to buy assets real estate gold your business right that helps you escape the inflation and then when you escape the inflation then they raise the capital gains tax so that when you sell your assets you got to pay them 44% which makes it impossible for them not to be steal from you they are stealing from you every fucking day and most people because they're ignorant to the way to actually work they can't they don't understand it they just go to the store like fuck everything so expensive yeah because you keep voting for these fucks that are taking all your fucking buying power in your wealth they've got a scam figured out that you can't figure out because you're ignorant you're watching Netflix you're fucking watching football yeah they focus on everything you're fucking on Instagram bro like dude you you're not paying attention and dude and then and then they get you to vote for fucking abortion they get you all emotionally stirred up about abortion because they don't want you to understand how they're stealing your money so that you don't vote for that and fucking change it you see what I'm saying and now we're to a point where we don't even know how much our votes even fucking matter because every single mother fucker that goes to Washington DC is in it for themselves bro with the exception of a very very very small minority the people in Washington DC have to be replaced by patriots that are going to pass real laws that put restrictions on what these people can and can't do they shouldn't be getting wealthy when they're fucking Washington DC bro that's like saying a soldier that serves them in the military should come back with a hundred million dollars that's a better case than fucking those motherfuckers yeah especially when the base salaries like what is a top off as like 150 grand I think wait for for congressman women I don't know it's like like yeah it's like 135 I think I think it's like the top top out yeah every single one of them magically fucking makes the perfect fucking stock trades right right out of here yeah it's complete bullshit bro we need to fucking we need a real fucking realignment of the same thing as country and there's only two ways to do it one if our votes still count which we're not sure that they do to vote in actual patriots that are going to fucking do what they say and then hold under the fucking fire to do it or two there's going to be a revolution at some point because they're taxing us to to literal fucking slavery we're tax slaves in this country dude we work for the government more than we work for ourselves and that is not some bullshit that statistical fucking facts statistical facts we work and pay more of our money to these fucks that are supposed to serve us than we get to keep that is fucking wrong and every single human being in this country Democrat Republican that should be your absolute number one priority for whatever's happening with the government absolutely but it's not because they allow people to vote that don't put into the kitty they allow people to vote for the government they allow people to vote that don't pay any taxes they allow people to vote now that may not even be a citizen so they're voting for you to get tax more you the hard working american who does what they're supposed to do they're voting for you to give them their fucking lifestyle on your mother fucking back the whole while they're screaming about capitalism being bad because the people make money off the backs of employees and they're fucking crying because they want your shit they can't that is that not can we not see the hypocrisy enough it's fucking bullshit dude it's insane it's thing guys jumping on this conversation let us up down in the comments what you guys thought yeah you better say fuck taxes 2% man I just 2% we should listen dude we really we really don't even need to pay taxes because private industries and private citizens if they were not taxed would have they would take care of the fucking problems there would be companies that would build roads that your community would gather up the funds to pay for how the fuck to shit get done amongst the community now when someone sick we have a fundraiser you see what I'm saying what I'm going to be like you know you're saying no taxes like that has that ever been tried anywhere does that work anywhere as far as income tax we have income tax to fucking 19 13 and do by doesn't do it there's lots of places don't do it so do like these these people are robbing you and you're sitting

any for sell it I come you guys can check them out there hell on the more reach US and Ukraine have started work on security agreement Zelensky says this is an interesting topic coming up I could have some major implications here in the very near future so allegedly Kiev and the Ukrainian administration they have just signed a several 10 year security agreements with NATO countries that outline outlined long term Western support for Ukraine in the face of a Russian invasion now and it's third year quote our teams Ukraine and the United States I've started working on a bilateral security agreement Zelensky said in his evening address on social media adding that it could be a quote truly exemplary deal the agreements signed so far including with Britain France and Germany are not mutual defense packs but have symbolic importance as a show of commitment by the west to support Kiev militarily politically and financially for years to come Zelensky had a telephone call with the US President Joe Biden earlier on Monday after the US Congress advanced a long stalled package of military aid for Kiev over the weekend the Ukrainian leader said after the call that quote all the dots have been dotted in the agreements on ATA CMS or the Army tactical missile systems for Ukraine the longer range missiles which have a maximum range of around 300 kilometers or 190 miles Now depending on the ammunition supplied were first delivered to Ukraine last year and what both sides said will be a boost to Kiev's battle capabilities now a 10 year deal A 10 year commitment not like seven more years senior was sitting on like 10 years yeah, I know 10 after 10 a like seven eight nine ten ten years 10 Fucking years of a commitment now like here's my concern before I cuz I got something else I think it's actually pretty cool about all of this here's my concern you know Why why sign something why put something in If you were truly worried I mean the dude has what you know less than a couple of months left in in office from a Biden here Why would you put together a 10 year deal knowing If you knew that it would get just reverse the moment you say they don't they think they're gonna win bro They're gonna win is that thinking that they're gonna win is this confidence bro they believe That they they are showing the same level of confidence that they showed in 2020 yeah, but they know that they are going to win Which should be a huge red flag for everyone Uh, they know bro. They already know what they're gonna do That like I saw that only get to the fact that we're doing that any of this fucked up shit or fuckery is allowed at all by the citizens is insane These people are supposed to represent us and represent our will and instead they decide that they're just gonna do whatever they want to do No matter what we think no matter what we say and they're gonna rig the game and they're gonna stay in power like dude That is the definition of a tyrannical government that is what they wrote in the constitution about that is our Responsibility to dissolve that kind of government. It's written in the fucking founding documents of this country Yeah enemies of the state man enemies foreign or domestic Now now here's the cool thing about all it is this helmet comes out nothing and I do you like said it It's important to to you know we talk about good shit We talk about you know good Americans great American specifically even those there are in our political Landscaping this country this headline I thought was pretty cool this story Hellenries this congresswoman was born and raised in Ukraine. She just voted against aid for her homeland Yeah, she knows they're fucking stealing it. So uh, and this is coming out of Indiana So you as representative victorious sparts the first and only Ukrainian born member of congress emerged early on as a natural advocate for supporting her native country and its war with Russia, but When 61 billion dollars in additional support for the war effort came up for a vote in the house recently She voted against it instead she's called for better oversight of us funds and opposed giving quote blank checks To the Ukrainian cause she says US border security should be a bigger priority That puts her more in line with conservative house Republicans and more notably with voters and her deeply conservative central Indiana congressional district She's locked in a tough reelection fight on the May 7th GOP primary Made all the more complicated by her public announcement more than a year ago that she wouldn't seek another term Decision she let it reverse now the aid package Uh, part of a larger bill that also included assistance for Israel, Taiwan and other global hot spots was approved by the house on their 20th Now the sit-in on Tuesday And sign into law by president Joe Biden on Wednesday sparts said she is quote kind of appalled At the notion that her heritage should dictate support for Ukrainian cause if she feels the money would be wasted quote My responsibility is the protection of American people she said during a recent interview Sparts spoke at an event hosted by the Hamilton County GOP at a community center in Sheridan, Indiana A town of a few thousand people the event in a hall just off the town's main street was attended by eight of the nine GOP primary candidates who were able to make Uh their uh their case to vote voters In county Republican officials one at a time during a meeting greet That also included short speeches by the candidates Um, so I thought that was I thought I don't know. I thought that was just cool, you know to see see some because bro Yeah, yeah, we're she been a whole time. Well, here's the thing. I mean we talk about these people flipping She's a Democrat. She's a registered Democrat. Is she oh is she flipping or does she have a fucking primary coming up on May 7th? So that's a good point. She fucking flipping bro. She's acting in her own interests like all these fucks do Okay All right, yeah, the same fucking nothing. This is her pandering. Yeah, instead of serving Go on with the win. Which ever with a winner. Yeah, that's all these people do They're fucking preservationists Yeah, right at the last minute. Yep. All right. I mean listen There's she can fuck hey listen. Here's what I tell you she can fuck off with all the rest of them. How about that The fuck out of here. It's been done before It needs to be done again. I'm getting pissed bro. I'm getting I'm starting to get pissed off I know a lot of America is too. These people are rogue. They're running Unibated with our money on our backs and telling us that we're shit And we don't know what the fuck we're doing and that inflation is our fault and we're all like bro It's totally abusive The way that they treat the people they're supposed to serve and if we're gonna have a country if we're ever Going to have the United States of America represent anything Like what it's supposed to represent Every single one of these motherfuckers with the exception of maybe two or three or five Gotta go they gotta go And the American people have to get smart about the election process. They got to get smart about Lower level elections. They got to get smart about their community and without that understood And that's assuming that the game isn't completely rigged because these people are so Irrigant and overly confident considering they're getting their ass beat everywhere and everybody's pissed off About him.

This is being challenged in the UK right now Um, the pharmaceutical giant is being sued and it class action Over claims that its vaccine developed with the University of Oxford Caused death and serious injury in dozens of cases lawyers argue the vaccine produced a side effect Which has had a devastating effect on a small number of families the first case was lodged last year By Jamie Scott a father of two who was left with a Permanent brain injury after developing a blood clot and a bleed on the brain that has prevented him from working after we received the vaccine in April of 2021 The hospital called his wife three times to tell her her husband was going to die Asha Zinnika is contesting the claims but has accepted in a legal document submitted to the high court in February That it's COVID vaccine quote can in very rare cases Uh, cause TTS TTS which stands for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome causes people to have blood clots and a low blood platelet count 51 cases have been logged Lodged in the high court with victims and grieving relative seeking damages estimated to be worth up to $100 million Asha Zinnika's emission made in a legal defense to mr. Scott's high court claim follows intense legal wrangling Colleagues a payouts if the drug firm accepts the vaccine was the cause of serious illness and death in specific legal cases Now the government has pledged to underwrite AstraZeneca's legal bills That's the interesting part Right that little piece right there the government has pledged to underwrite AstraZeneca's legal bills Why would they do that Why would they do that why would the government say that they're going to foot the bill for whatever Oh Because they probably forced them to do it because they were the ones forcing everybody to fuck and take them Yeah Right now I know the UK laws are a little bit different right like here in the US there's You know very limited liability that our pharmaceutical companies have right they can make whatever and put it down Especially with that emergency use authorization I'm not an expert in UK law don't don't don't want to pretend to be But that is an interesting piece of this case here in a letter Of response in May 2023 asha Zinnika told lawyers for Scott That quote we do not accept the TTS is caused by the vaccine at a generic level But in the legal documents emitted to high court in February asha Zinnika said quote It is admitted that the AZ vaccine can in very rare cases calls TTS the casual mechanism is not Further TTS can also occur in the absence of the AZ vaccine or any vaccine causation in any individual case will be a matter for expert advice so That's happened. That's a big deal now It also made me think of this and I saw this and it's like it's so funny when these things happen Do you remember Alex Nalveini? Right The Russian dissident that was reportedly he died suddenly Right in Russian prison right and everybody came out and was like oh no Putin killed him Right And the initial autopsy that was done said that he died from SDS or sudden death syndrome where I'm sure you guys have seen these there's been videos going on where people are just literally You know, they might be playing basketball and they just literally just drop Yeah, playing soccer and just drop right like there's plenty of videos out there like this But this is Russia's stance. They said it was you know, that's what Alex Nalveini had And you had everybody from Our government our administration the president Many people saying no Russian killed him and it's funny because we actually did a The United States a natural intelligence report on this And this head on reads Vladimir Putin did not order death of opposition leader Alexi Nalveini the US intelligence fines So we just some after they reported it like it was fact for months At the time Biden said the US did not know exactly what happened to Nalveini But that quote there is no doubt that his death Was the consequence of something that Putin and his thugs did that was from our own president go out no doubt And so I just think that's interesting with all this vaccine stuff I think now you have a very interesting theory About what you think they're gonna do with this vaccine. All right With the adverse reactions side of it And I think it's very very interesting because you know, here we are. It's almost May My fucker. I see the future. Why the fuck you think I'm here in life Bro, they know what the fuck's going on here. We are in May. We got November coming up very very quickly Now all of a sudden the desert coming out and they're gonna say oh Trump operation warp speed fucking he crimes against humanity And all the same people who were hysterical about saying you better get the vaccine you grandma killed piece of shit Fuck you the hope for three fucking years are now gonna fucking turn that energy on Trump. Yeah, it's exactly what's gonna Because they're losing they're losing those same people right now, bro I know because of the fucking israel israel palestine shit, bro. I know So what other what better way to get them back? Yep Well guys go back and find all my clips to say in that for the last three years so that we can be sure to put them in the show whenever this happens Fuck man. Anything on this any uh, yeah, it's fucking bullshit Like everything else that we fucking cover like everything else these people do. Listen, we got lied to we got played We got manipulated we got turned against each other we got divided for money for distance of the ability To be unified against what's going on they closed our schools they closed the pubs because the seeds of revolutions are Happening taverns They fucking stole the fucking middle class as money They made people watch their loved ones die over zoom and in allowing to have funerals But they let hundreds of thousands of millions of people protest in the street didn't say fucking thing with George Floyd Got a gold cast get by the way while you couldn't even go to fucking walk go up to the casket because you couldn't be close to anybody when you're fucking loved ones die right Fuck they forced you to take this vaccine or fire you they fired fucking millions of people And now they're saying oh The the job growth of Biden has been the best in history ever Yeah, because you're fucking fired everybody and now they're not firing anybody anymore and we need the workforce It's a complete Fucking lie that all these little kids on college campuses are fucking eating up and these dumb suburban housewives are eating up And these dumb motherfucking leftists are eating up. Oh, that economy is great. Best job growth ever Yeah, what happened right before that? Oh, they made everybody stay home They ruined the economy the economy went to an all-time low They closed off the middle class businesses. They let all the fucking big businesses their buddies open stay open They fucking closed every all the taverns all the schools they they fucking made you take a vaccine or your fire There was no economy no fucking jobs and now they're saying oh, we got the greatest job growth in the history of the United States and people are buying it I Mean that's word growth. So listen dear job creation You guys don't mean jobs field Oh, and who's getting those jobs? It's funny. You say that did you see the uh, why don't you hold on? Why don't you go Look at the data as to who's getting the new jobs. It's not fucking Americans No, in fact the uh, the secretary of the navy Just came out and said that uh, they're planning to invest like 15 billion dollars in our naval ports to build the ships and fill those jobs with immigrants. I know It's insane, man. That's insane. This is domino effect though, man. I think I think within the next my mind if I was a place of bid. I would say within the next few months you will see um Pfizer fall you'll see Um, what's the other one they're all gonna blame Trump J and J you'll see all those guys coming out.
