we rely on you guys to get the word out so don't be a hoe show the show all right hey what's up man it's cool we're getting hammered right now fucking snow yeah it's all that oppressive whiteness yeah I mean like when you guys hear this it's Monday but like that's it's coming down pretty hard out there mm-hmm never seen anything so pressure well I like it it's very it looks pure out there like clean pure you know I watch out for that black eyes no man you know honestly though I've never like I'm okay with the snow man like what I don't like is when it's just cold and it's not doing anything bro what I don't I don't mind the snow I just don't like the gray I don't like when there's no sun for fucking six weeks at a time here in midwest like holy shit man yeah like why the fuck did anybody decide to live here yeah and how the fuck did I end up here and how to how do all these good people end up here we're all good people we could have thought a little better huh well I mean we got we got some good things here Missouri we got some great things but we all made a dumbass decision by where to fucking live this needs to be by the way don't come here yeah don't know you stay where you're at hey bro did you see this thing so I was just working out and yes this is Monday so this will be old news by the time this airs but I don't care I'm gonna say this did you see this thing online today about Taylor Swift giving a hundred K to the family of the people the woman that was shot yeah I saw that bro did you read the comments underneath the post every fucking comment was like she should have gave more money she could have gave more she could have done more every single comment was like that from a motherfucker that didn't give shit that didn't do shit didn't give him a mother fucking dollar and we're dealing with the entire internet talking all this shit and dude this is the problem with society that's so stupid bro it's the internet you cannot please these motherfuckers on the internet no matter what they they don't do shit with their own lives their spectators in the stands they watch everybody else who's doing shit and any move you make you're gonna get criticized for it's fun and by the way I don't give a fuck about Taylor Swift yeah I mean there's no dog right this is just the point of someone decided to do something they didn't have to do it came out and everybody's roasting her for it and it's like bro fuck you you're a fucking piece of shit you're sitting at your fucking computer with your fucking hot pocket and your mom's fucking basement not doing a mother fucking thing with your life and you are criticizing someone who spent their entire life building their life since they were a little bitty kid and you're criticizing them for only giving a hundred grand when you can't afford to give a hundred fucking dollars fuck you yeah that's insane bro I'm sick of it man I'm gonna tell you this I'm sick of these people on the internet dude these fucking spectator motherfuckers that don't do shit they call everybody everything's fake everything's bullshit everything's wrong everybody's fraud everybody fuck you you're not doing a goddamn thing bro you're sitting there on your fat fucking ass sucking down the hot pocket juice off of the fucking shitty microwave fucking paper plate and the basement on the internet with your fucking mom upstairs like dude you're a fucking loser you know I'm saying and by the way you're a opinion matters bro it doesn't matter and by the way all of those people will live their whole lives wondering why nothing good ever happens to them and the reason nothing good ever happens to them is because they hate everything that is represents what they're not like bro winners are inspired by people who are successful they tell the world fuck bro look at that person winning that is badass even if they don't really like them they're like dude I think it's cool that they're winning they're not really my cup of tea but that's cool yeah and that's putting out the right energy the right vibe the it's telling the universe I like to win I want some winning and the universe says you know what that dude likes when I'm gonna deliver some winning to them you know but most of these people don't understand this concept they think that like there's no actual anything happening around them they're super unaware and they hate on everybody's shit and then they wonder why they get shit it's because you're telling the universe that you don't want anything to do with winning you don't want any success and you gotta stick you can get around this like you think you can like this is not about what you say it's about what you feel and what you say and so like dude if you're a jealous person if you're a if you're one of these people who criticizes everybody you need to learn to keep your fucking mouth shut and correct your thoughts otherwise you're not gonna have anything ever bro yeah that's real shit you don't have to believe that it works like that but it does they still know different the gravity we can argue so gravity we go step off that building over there bro you're gonna fall on your face you know like I'm just sick of this attitude bro we have such a poverty mindset in this country we we think that being poor and being nothing and doing nothing and creating nothing and becoming nothing is somehow morally superior to people who have gone on to achieve and create and become and do that is not morally superior to be less than what you could be it is not some sort of metal that you win by being less than what you could be the metal comes from going out and being all you can be being everything that you can be with the potential that you were gifted that's where the fucking awards are that's where the credit is and by the way that's where the hate is too was evidenced by this and bro like I said I'm not a fucking Taylor Swift fan but that's some bullshit yeah that's fucked up all you guys making those comments bro enjoy your fucking shitty life and your shitty hot pocket because that's all you're gonna ever have that's real shit man fucking I'm fucking tired of it dude you damned if you do you know bro it's not that it's that people legitimately feel morally superior to people that are actually going out and doing things in life what is morally superior about sitting around doing nothing living on the internet and criticizing everybody else over the people who are actually out there in the game creating building becoming doing what is morally superior about them it's a fucking fake culture that has been implemented to make people believe and that somehow sitting around and being a lazy fuck is somehow a great thing and it's not bro you guys are not morally superior to the people I hear doing it I'm sorry and you all like to say well they think they're morally superior no they don't they're just out doing their life and you think that because that's your insecurity bro I don't every successful person I meet dude and you've been around a lot of them because you've been around me for a number of years they're fucking down the earth they're cool they're humble and the reason that they win is because they are humble they realize hey man I don't really know shit I've done well so far but you know what I'm gonna do everything I can not go backwards right and that's how they look at you can do it too yeah bro and and do we have all these people who are just like fucking straight up haters bro and if you're gonna build a company and you're gonna build a brand and you're gonna build whatever it is you're building these are the people you're gonna deal with you're not gonna ever be able to police them they're gonna attack you at every chance they get they're gonna try to poke a hole in everything you do they're gonna question everything you say you could fucking walk on water and they're gonna fucking say it's because you can't swim you could cure cancer they're gonna say you're full of shit there you could do everything right and these people are still gonna talk shit bro and there but here's the here's the reward you're gonna win and they're gonna have a shitty fucking life their entire life so we need to fix this in culture yeah stop celebrating being a loser it's not fucking cool it's not good for anybody it's not good for you it's not good for your family it's not good for your coworkers it's not good for anybody it's setting a terrible example and somehow we've got it so backwards where people think oh fucking humble I'm modest I'm I'm listening to that I'm better than you know you're not you're not doing a motherfucking thing bro you're barely fucking surviving and anybody's fault but yours well things are hard right now yeah okay well what'd you do for the last 10 years when things worked that hard right same shit you're the same shit man anyway if those people bro that's what I'm saying I'm fucking tired I'm not gonna fight with Taylor bro I'm tired dude but but there's the end of the day bro doing good shit is doing good shit it's bullshit you know you know she showed a game she should have gave a million dollars she should have gave 10 man fuck off you didn't give a dollar how about this how about you go out and you create a life that earns whatever amount of money you think is appropriate for you and then you give the appropriate amount that you think you won't do that shit will you because you won't dedicate the next 20 fucking years of your life to becoming anything because your softest fuck anyway that's what shit man yeah I'm over it yeah I love it we're off to a great start I love it I love it guys is getting to our questions maybe guys I got three good ones for you I fucking can't stand it I did it bunch of fucking basement dwelling fucking dumbasses the hot pocket juice almost took me out bro that's what they do they sit that dude they're so unaware of how shitty they actually are as a human and they project all of that dissatisfaction that they feel that they cannot identify as fought with themselves on to other people on everybody else yeah bro and everything's bullshit everything's fraud everything's fake everybody's foolish shit everybody's bad everybody this fuck you you're the problem dude it's ain't everybody else when you're looking around and everything in your life and you're saying everything else is the fucking problem there's one common denominator with all of those problems and that common denominator is you yeah fuck maybe it's man you know anyway I'm getting back to straight up savage mode I like just so you understand I'm coming back like I'm not I'm done being nice to all you motherfuckers you're a bunch of fucking bitches real talk those people for sure no they are bro they are those people that do that unchecked for so long that's the thing man they they've been in their little safe spaces yeah you know fucking and listen the pen on them is not wrong I don't even want any of those people around me in my entire life none of them well I mean but there's the other side of that two bro like they don't exist in the real world bro they don't come on the real world because they can't play in the real world they can't make it you won't see them I don't know I've heard some pretty rude comments in the real world about my life in front of you yeah it must be nice yeah it was nice for the last 25 years when I was working my fucking balls off what have you done for the last 25 years when I was working and you hadn't done anything for 25 years except breathe there right take shit to eat food yeah it is fucking nice it's nice to have it's nice to have a little bit of reward for all the shit that I've done that's nice I like it it is and you know what if you want it too then go fucking do it I'm just tired of I'm ready bro I'm ready well guys let's get into these questions guys Andy question number one Andy I'm 28 years old and I've been listening to your show for the past three years and I mostly enjoyed the CTI episodes as you bring daily clarity until what's going on in the world and you indeed you're a funny as hell however lately I've really been focusing in on the Q&A episodes as well as a lot of older MFC yellow episodes and books like Tim Grover's winning and relentless to learn more about winning because I felt stressed about how much money I make currently I'm an aircraft maintenance technician making just over a hundred grand with the company that manages a few private aircraft for a family I enjoy the work and I take on extra responsibilities to make myself more valuable completing special training to ship Hasbat parts researching ordering specialty tooling to make us more efficient etc but I still feel like I need to be doing more to make more what is the process of brainstorming business ideas for coming up with the next company I have thought about solo contracting which typically pays a hundred and one twenty an hour by my work schedule constantly changes and makes it hard how can I find something that I can commit the rest of my life to where the time of day doesn't matter well look this is an end up to answer I think that there's nuance to okay so before you get into it understand there's always an astrate there's always a what about this part or what about that part with every answer I give okay I want that to be clear I like sometimes I answer these questions and people are just like when about this and that no shit bitch I'm fucking aware like we're talking like I'm assuming you have some common sense here yeah I'm assuming you have a little bit of fucking IQ power right maybe I'm giving you too much credit all right but here's the reality to become someone who is creative in ways to generate income you have to first understand how the game is really played the game really is if you are the best you will earn the most if you provide the most value you will earn the most all right it is free market shit and yeah there might be situations where you're in a company and your boss is stepping on your throat and not letting you progress then you're in the wrong company but at the end of the day however good you are is how you're going to be rewarded that is fucking facts okay so if you're in a position like this guy is my first step would be how can I create more value in a position that I'm in that could potentially earn me some more money now that's not going to take you from a hundred K to 500 K but it might take you from a hundred to 150 or to 200 and that's a pretty big fucking difference okay so there's that that's the first thing I would think of beyond that and I appreciate dude what I think is cool about this question is like this is someone because our audience now is really it used to be everybody wanted the personal development and now it's everybody wants the current events and so it's really cool that like the current event people are coming in and they're understanding that the actual solution to this problem is society is us having personal excellence you know I got the problem yeah right and that's what we always talk about we talk about the problem being what's going on society and the solution being our individual responsibility for personal excellence okay that means be everything they don't want you to be if they want you to be fit if they want you broke be wealthy if they want you stupid be smart if they want you alone be with people if they want you to hate people don't hate people love people it's doing everything the opposite of what they actually want to create personal excellence to set that example in society so that other people see it and follow along that is what we will shift the culture of America to the place that we want it to be and this guy is recognizing that and so I just want to identify it that I really appreciate that a lot so when it comes to being creative on new ways to make income you have to be obsessed with the game all right the this means being a student of the game this means dedicating your free time into reading books by entrepreneurs you know reading Seth Godin's books I'd read every single one reading Jeffrey Gittermer's sales books reading all of these legendary books Dale Carnegie Napoleon Hill you know all of these authors that have written personal development entrepreneurship books okay there's there's fucking thousands of them that are great okay and when you're immersed in this okay your brain naturally sort of like thinks about it all the time all right and when your brain is kind of always in that space what ends up happening for me is ideas start to flow all right and this is how I get in the creative space of evolving and creating new ideas or new companies or new lanes within the company or new ways to do things within the companies I have to be immersed in the information and then in my free time I let my brain sort of like cook on it and eventually things start to just kind of click around if you're spending all your time worried about sports and you're spending all your time worried about Taylor Swift and you're spending all your time examining everybody on Instagram like we talked about in the intro and criticizing everybody else you are not investing that time in immersing yourself in the entire game of business and entrepreneurship which is going to prevent you from thinking creatively and keep you from coming up with ideas that quite honestly most of the time are pretty obvious most of the best ideas I've had to increase business or grow business or increase income are like their ideas that after I thought of them I was like dude why didn't I think of that two years ago right like this is obvious and so we have to just get ourselves in the environment and immersed in the information and then just sort of like be in it it's kind of a there's a it's a it's a hard thing to explain but you have to understand that whatever information whatever environment you're in that's where your mind is likely going to default to right like if you're always around animals all the time you're you're going to always think about animals and whenever thoughts you have that sort of pop in your brain and come in they're probably going to have to do with animals right like in some way shape of that yeah and if you're thinking about uh and this is why this is why people who like overly obsess with anxiety don't really understand what they're doing to themselves because you start to obsess and obsess and obsess and obsess and obsess and also when you obsess over healing right and you've got all this shit going on bro you can never truly get past it because that's all you think about and your brain automatically goes there all the time and then the minute you feel the trauma attack you or whatever right or the anxiety you know you feel yeah bro you run out of hot-pockshaw anxiety goes up holy shit man I can't do anything I can't get past this anxiety it's trying to be crazy I'm the only one in the world that bro you're focused on at 24-7 it's all you fucking talk about every single post talks about how fucking much of a victim you are and how much healing you have to do and how much shit you gotta do like you're immersing yourself in this environment that's gonna always bring you back to that same place and so we can either use that process proactively or we can use it to self-destruct and most people are unaware of it so they naturally use it in a negative way right they're distracted by sports they're and I like sports but they're distracted they're obsessed with sports they're obsessed with things that don't matter the all these distractions entertainment Hollywood music fucking shit social media social media and they get caught up in all this drama and gossip and what's going on and bro you don't give your brain any time to think about the things that are actually gonna affect your life right so my my recommendation to you is twofold one see what you can do in the position you're in to add right now because that's the quickest way and two immerse yourself in this stuff 24 dollars a day when you're not listening to the show you should be reading books you should be reading not in not 50 shades of bullshit either you should be reading books that are gonna make you better okay uh and there's there's fucking thousands of them dude you could literally go on Amazon and like point your finger at shit and and pick up something that really works you'll pull something out of that yeah that'll that'll be good for you can let me actually this man because uh and I'm not saying that does that make sense no 100 percent yeah 100 percent like I love that because you're either gonna be focused on bullshit and you're gonna get more of that or you focus on the positive 100 percent um but I want to ask you this because this is this is something that I thought about when when we were talking about this question and it's like you know and I'm not saying that this is this person right but it was just like a knee jerk reaction my like thought in my head it's like okay well like how honest are you being with yourself when it comes to the amount of work that you're actually putting in well bro most people completely lie to themselves you know you know I'm not saying that this is this person listen listen to you most most people completely fabricate to themselves how much actual shit they're doing to improve their situation I'm glad you brought this up because this is very important for people to realize there is a high likelihood that you are drastically overestimating what you are putting in and you are over expecting what you should be returned on that investment okay most people think like the the difference between reality and expectation of success for people is is it's polar opposite almost yeah most people drastically underestimate the amount of work that it's gonna take for them to get the result that they desire and I think that's by like a hundredfold I don't think it's by like little bit yeah I think it's because dude the culture of entrepreneurship has become so fake and so fucking ridiculous and so filled with bullshit you know you could be rich in two weeks you know by my shit and I'll teach like you know I'm saying yeah bro like dude not even a hundred million dollar numbers are throwing around on YouTube shorts and Instagram like it's like it's fucking five dollars right so when Taylor does a hundred came people think is nothing yeah bro shit to the money yeah bro look man the the internet is like 95% bullshit and people have to understand that most of these people are here telling you they make this or make that or do this or do that they're trying it's branding they're trying to sell you some shit and so because of the way that the environment is an entrepreneurship the expectation for the return for the amount of work put in is very skewed okay we have to understand that it takes literally probably ten times what you think it takes to get the result that you're thinking that's reality so whatever you think it's gonna take you need to multiply that by ten and the reason we think this is because the culture is all fucked up and wrong and full of shit and also we don't know because we've never done it and this can be a blessing too by the way like had I known when I was 19 years old it was gonna take the what it took and be as hard as it was I probably wouldn't have done it you know what I'm saying I'm sorry like that that that ignorant saves you yes the ignorance is important in some aspects but you also have to have a a realistic expectation about the work that you're putting in you know I learned this like I met Gary V. Barrow back in like a 2014 I think and the reason I met him was because I read his book Crush it all right and like 2000 like right when it came I think it was 2009 or 10 or something like that and I implemented a lot of the stuff and dude like you know we had we built an amazing business and during that four years and I wrote him a letter I said hey man just so you know probably a lot of people read this book and didn't do shit but here's what I did with it and I sent him this letter and he calls me up and he says hey dude come up to New York I like to meet you so I fly up to New York and we're supposed to have dinner and I meet him at this little bar forgot what it was and he's sitting there and you know this is the first time I met Gary I have a friend of them for a long time 10 years now and um he sits I sit down with them we're talking and our meeting was at uh fuck I think it was nine to 10 all right or 10 it was scheduled for like 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. or 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. what I couldn't remember what it was but it was late it was a late dinner and I thought like you know well it's New York man people don't go out to relate soon to sleep yeah right it's different you know out here in Midwest bro we're eating dinner at 630 yeah right on saying um but that I just kind of thought that way and we sat down bro and we had a couple drinks and we were talking it was great everything was awesome and uh the hour came around okay like it got to the end of the hour and he was like all right man well I hate to do this but uh I got another meeting and I'm like bro it's fucking 11 o'clock and now he's just like yeah I got 11 to 12 and at 12 to 1 and then a 1 to 2 and I'm like holy shit and I walked out of that meeting realizing like bro that's the level of real work that these motherfuckers who were winning are putting in and people don't understand that they think that's bullshit they think when these guys go on the internet who are winning big and talk about what they do they think it's a lie they think it's nonsense bro like I'm on the phone every single fucking day to this day 25 years in I'm on the phone till 11 12 a night every fucking day and you know 10 years ago it was till 3 in the morning you know what I'm saying right like we're the work required to have this Instagram life that people think is real is so much more and you have to understand that and so if we understand the work required and we're willing to do that work we could produce the result but if you underestimate the work required and you never get the result and then you end up blaming you and say I don't have it or it's just me or it's just how I'm doing or I don't I don't have what it takes no dude you're misunderstanding the game because the environment and the culture is telling you that you're playing a game where you should be successful in a year right when in reality that's not how it works yeah or you blame everybody else yeah right that lost don't see me that's what most people you know I'm saying yeah I mean I'm not talking to those those people are a lost cause for sure real talk like if you if you if you look around your life and you're and you're blaming other people and you're saying the reason I'm fat is because of my genetics the reason I'm broke is because of my boss the reason I'm unhappy is because my girlfriend's a bitch you're saying all that shit bro you're the bitch that's it you just don't get it you haven't figured it out yet you're the bitch it's you you're the problem you're the common denominator and you got to be honest with yourself before you can ever fix yourself I love that man another guys and let's get to question number two Andy with all of your responsibilities you just mentioned you know you're still up on the phone super late now right with all your responsibilities the companies you're running how do you prioritize your time and energy into everything that you have going on like I know you you do the power list which I love and also use but like how do you determine what distractions or challenges get your attention first I just determine what's the most important I bottom line what the most important shit and here's the most important shit whether you like it or not if you ain't got no money you don't have shit okay yeah if you don't have no money your life is infinitely harder you can't eat you can't live where you want to live you can't do what you want to do you have far less freedom you got to answer more people the biggest problem most y'all have in your lives you don't have enough money and if you listen to your buddies at church or you listen to your your humble buddies they live up the street and they say must be nice and all this other bullshit they're gonna lead you into the path of just like them you're gonna become who it is you listen to who it is you're surrounded by that's who you become you hear this saying all the time surround yourself with five successful people you're gonna become the sixth that's true you surround yourself with five losers you're gonna become the sixth that's reality okay so you're gonna become who you spend your time around and who you listen to and so you have to understand that your biggest problem in reality real talk your biggest problem is actually discipline that's your problem but your biggest problem outside of discipline and mental toughness is your money all right so I prioritize my thing to make sure that the money keeps flowing that way the money keeps flowing I can solve problems easier and everything else comes after that and people don't like that but that's a real answer yeah did you ever I mean let's go back to when you were 19 hold on and the reason I say that the biggest problem most people have is discipline and mental toughness is because that's all the requirements to get to that point where you can handle your money and then everything else after that right no you've got to become the best weapon you can become you've got to become the best tool that you can become okay up here in your physical and your heart everything's got to be the best it is and if you're the best if you have the best tool and we're out here in the world and everybody else you see as a as a tool right those people are less effective tools than you so like if you're building the house do you want to use the most effective tools or the least effective tools you're gonna use the most effective and the house is our game of life all right so we're building our life do you want to go at it with a saws with sharp blades and hammers with fucking no hammer on the end of it you see what I'm saying like we have to build us first which is the whole purpose of the live hard program that's why give it away for free because it's the ultimate shit that can fix you and get you to a place where you can handle all these other problems all right and all the problems that you're gonna handle with your mental toughness your discipline your your fortitude your grit your toughness all of this shit that will solve your fitness that will solve your mental that will solve a lot of the problems that you think you have and when those are fucking taking care of now the next problem is your money okay so I just want to be clear on that yeah I love it uh let's go back to the 99 2000 real quick yeah 99 2000 I know I want to actually this though because from that area well of course I have that that's not not good you're working with it yeah yeah uh now I want to actually because I feel like most people man when they when they get a really difficult like there's a problem there's a situation they see it they feel it they know it's there I feel like the the the number one thing that most people do is avoid it yeah or they try to like postpone it or they try to right and so like I guess super question like when you were first getting the business and problems come up like did you have those same issues of like well fuck man I really don't want to deal with this right now let me just or like has it all like how did you walk through that has it always been you know I'm gonna just hit this shit head oh dude had I known this when I started it wouldn't have taken me fucking 25 years do what I've done yeah the first 10 years of my life I was fucking worthless okay listen this is how it went for me the first 10 years I didn't know shit all right not only got not no shit I thought I knew shit which made it 10 times worse all right so when I say when when you guys hear the story of oh man it took them 10 years did not get paid yeah that's because I'm a fucking idiot all right and by the way I reinvested the last three years of that 10 years back into the company 100% so I made some good smart decisions too but the reality is is had I understood what I tell you guys now I wouldn't have had to go through that that's what I'm trying to do that's why I do this I'm trying to save you a decade of your life and I can because if I went back and talked to fucking Andy from 1999 I promise you bro I'm saving him 15 years 50 there there is a lot of value to an actual mentor there is a lot of value to an actual coach yeah the problem is is that the coach thing has gotten way to fuck out of control all right so what here's how you have to evaluate it how much would you pay to say 15 years off your life okay and whatever the fucking costs right yeah because that's what the fuck I would pay yeah and if you have a guy if you have someone who could actually teach you that then it's a fucking deal it really doesn't matter what they're charging but you have to qualify that person have they done what they say they've done what has their experience been are they the kind of person I want to be have they built anything real do have they built what I want to build what it you know what I'm saying like we have to be intelligent and pre qualify who we're going to listen to because oh your money there's so much shit out here you see what I'm think you see what I mean absolutely so so yeah dude my first 10 years were I had to learn the hard way um and then my next five years after that when I started figuring some stuff out I still was soft I still wasn't mentally hardened I still you know tried to skate around obvious issues that needed to be addressed like my body and my mind and I was still drinking all the time and I was way overweight and I made excuses for myself I would say things like well yeah I'm I'm fat but I'm strong I'm stronger in everybody each right yeah that's right or I'm yeah I'm fat but you know what I'm making money but yeah I'm I'm not as healthy as I could be but I work harder than everybody else and I told myself all this shit and back 2015 bro you know what we're doing fucking major business even back then and I'm like well look at this I don't need to be all that shit and I was wrong because when I decided to take care of all that the the mental the physical and get myself into the condition where I could handle shit the right way then I really started taking off and that's what it takes bro if you're not your best self you're not gonna create your best outcome that's just reality there's nothing you can do about it you can lie to yourself you can tell yourself that's not true you can make excuses for yourself but the reality is you're not gonna produce the best result until you are the best that you can be at this moment in time and as you pass through more and more and more life experience you will have the opportunity to get better and better and better and better and you should and that will increase the level of your outputs on the backside so um you know did I ever fucking run and hide and neglect yeah of course like everybody else dude but it wasn't until I stopped doing that the things got really good it's human nature dude all these people out here that pretend like they don't struggle that pretend like they got all their shit together the pretend like they never made mistakes and pretend like they're perfect and they're superhero and all this shit these people are all fucking liars all of them all of them are imposter syndrome people all of them have days of doubt all of them have days of loss of confidence all of them have days where it's hard as fucking they'd rather do anything else than show up and do what they do but the difference is they show up when they don't fucking feel like it and they execute and you don't and that's a massive advantage because if you can execute when you feel good that's okay that's good because most people can't even do that but if you can execute when you feel good and we don't feel good dude you're operating on a completely different level than most people most people can't fucking do that they cannot do it so that's your job your job is to build yourself into the person that can have the best competitive advantage possible and that takes you investing in yourself in getting all your your your tool as sharp as it can be and keeping it there all the time I love it man I love it guys Andy are third and final question question number three hey Andy I have a question about quitting what are your thoughts on quitting because what you're doing depends on what you're quitting yeah well yeah no shit what are your thoughts on quitting when what you're doing no longer aligns with you and you're not really it's not quitting out of fear for context I owned a food company for four plus years it was my first business and I realized in those four years that my heart belongs to marketing it's what I'm good at it's what I love to do I'm currently in the process of selling my food company to pursue something new in marketing and public speaking I've accepted and feel good about this decision why the fuck would you do that why would you take a real business and then want to become a fucking speaker okay why would you do that no the fuck are you talking about take your marketing skills and build your real company and something that's worth a billion dollars bro what are you talking about most of these people out here to speak they're here real fucking companies dude you're saying you got a real one right here yes you already got a real one dude this is the problem okay you guys have to understand the internet is very difficult and murky and hard to see through but I am telling you right now a lot of these guru people they tell you to create a funnel or do this thing or get leads and all this shit and they're teaching you skills these are skills these are not the main thing you need a main thing you need a skill yes fuck bro you're telling me you want to get rid of your main thing and then become someone who like the gazillion other people out here who just talks about the skills as if that they're it's their main business I understand you think it's cool I understand you see people with lots of followers and on stages and people clapping all this shit but bro I'm telling you right now the real shit is in building something that is a real thing that is an asset that you could exit later on in life and if that's not like what you're telling me is you want to be a marketer so fucking market your main thing dude let's see what you got because that's the real game dude yeah I respect people that own real shit that have built real companies that's what the fuck we do in our itay we don't we're not in there telling people to become speakers that's not the fuck we do we take people with real businesses and we give them the tools to scale those businesses out that's the best that's what every single one of you young people should be doing you should be thinking that that's an entrepreneur you should be thinking what's my main thing and how am I going to grow it and how am I going to use these tools to grow it and just because someone has a million followers and you see them at some of these events doesn't mean shit all right some of these people don't have anything else this is their main gig all right you don't want to be that person you want to be the person that builds something real that can put the work in use the skills and by the way I'm not saying people don't have things of value to teach they do but fuck bro if we're being real dude this is this is what's fucked up with the internet well I mean there's a practical application no dude this is what's right you got business professors they can they can meet you with textbook about business and how to they drive a fuck like are they really doing it have they ever really done it have they put it into practice look man that was this final product I mean he like am I wrong for one to want one tip to pursue something different or should I have put more more time into my business I think you should take your main business and you should work on growing that main business and you've already got to start and you've already got it going and you realize that you have a a flare for marketing cool go run the marketing people go do the marketing for your business let other people run you I don't run the back into my business I got people to do that you know what I help with I help with our apparel I help with our marketing I help with our design I help with our brand those are the things I like right so that's what the fuck I help with and it fulfills me I like the people I do it with it's exciting we're facing an uphill battle because a lot of that shit is new to us and we're compared to the companies that we're competing against we have far less money even though we've been around for a long time you know when you look at a budget of a PepsiCo or a Nike fuck bro we're not even a booger on their nose so I have to be creative I have to and that's the biggest misconception people have about me they think I fucking done but I haven't even fucking started you have no fucking idea yeah okay so I love that shit I love the game I love the upside I love how hard it is and we have to understand just because you like a certain area of your business doesn't mean you sell your whole business and go do this one thing can you can we touch on to like because I also feel like there's something here too like like can we talk about the significance of the business owner in the world we're living right now like in this country for business on this right like it's necessary I feel like it's necessary to have more business we've lost so many businesses as it is in the last four years you know I'm saying to have something that's brick and mortar with real people why do you think they've eliminated all the businesses because they want people to go try to just you know build their marketing skills up it's not it's not just listen it's not just because they want the people in the lower class let me explain this big picture the reason they want to put all the middle to medium small-sized businesses out of business is not just because they want all the money and all the business that's not what it's about it's about that but it's about something else that most people don't understand and what it is it's about controlling the culture narrative it is far easier to put down rules and standards through ten different big-ass conglomerates and all their subsidiaries than it is to do that and then have millions of small businesses doing their own culture and their own rules and doing business their own way so to answer your question it's extremely important because the culture that has bestowed from the organization of small business and medium-sized business is actually what controls the culture in society because people spend most of their time at work and whatever rules or atmosphere or culture they have at work is usually highly influential on what they do at home so it's not just about them eliminating the jobs to push everybody into the lower class that's not that's part of it that's part of it but the other part is without all these small and medium businesses out there they can control quote unquote how things work by making things the way they want inside these big corporations making the rules making the standards you know the all of these special things that they make people do the political correctness the cancel culture the DEI the ESG all of these social initiatives are easy to push down if they have ten companies or really just like three companies that own all the rest of the big companies and everybody has to go there because then the the contrast to that ceases to exist this makes sense okay so yes it's very fucking important that you young people start to understand that it is far cooler and better to go build a real business than it is to become a speaker way cooler bro way fucking cooler just because you see these people on the internet doing this shit does not mean that that's what you should be doing first of all most of you don't have the skill to get on stage and speak that's fucking reality the reason I have the skill is because I've been doing it for 25 fucking years I've recorded a thousand fucking podcasts I've given 10,000 fucking speeches and meetings at my company if you're in 20 years if you build a real company you'll actually be a great speaker because it's going to be something that you develop during the time but you guys go out here with no business experience no fucking business at all and you say I want to be a speaker that is not aborable that's not real dude it's it's real for very fucking few people very few people have the ability to go on stage and change people's lives and make a living doing it without something that they've done to build massive credibility and yes there will be people that come and go that come on for a little bit and go away for a little bit and come on for a little bit and go away for a little bit and the reason they come on for a little bit and go away for a little bit is because there is no real thing behind them okay you know people will point at Tony Robble Tony Robbins started as a speaker yeah Tony Robbins is one of the best speakers of all fucking time bro like he is gifted that motherfucker started out it 18 years old under the guidance of Jim Rohn another fucking ridiculous speaker and he was able to go out and get paid to speak and then turned it into a multi billion dollar portfolio of real business do you think do you think he did that because it wasn't the best thing to do right you see what I'm saying bro growing a real business is where you learn the skills that you want to be admired for now I want to be a speaker in a marketer you want to be a speaker in a marketer go grow real business for 10 fucking years and then come out and start speaking you'll smoke everyone that's real shit and you want to you want to be a great marketer go grow a real business from zero to a hundred million dollars and you're going to fucking know what the fuck you're doing all right so stop idolizing the shit on the internet that most of it's bullshit and start realizing that we need young entrepreneurs to build real shit that creates jobs and employs people not just because it's going to make you better in these other areas that you want to enjoy but also because it's going to fix what's going on in the world entrepreneurs are going to cure what's going on in this in this crisis in the world and they're going to do it by controlling the culture so that's my answer to this I'm I get so tired of these young bucks coming out so I don't want to be a speaker I want to share the stage with you motherfucker I hate speaking I want to run companies you give it I'm saying my speaking ability is a byproduct of me running companies not the other way around and it will be for you too if you truly want to go out and speak and you truly want to go out and do this shit fucking build something real bro and then go tell people how you did it that's going to be the shit that people resonate with we'll listen yeah anyway I love it man well guys Andy that was three yep go pay fee hot shot cAKE CHO
