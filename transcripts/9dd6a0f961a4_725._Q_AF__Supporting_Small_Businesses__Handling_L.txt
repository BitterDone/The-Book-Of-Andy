What's up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about the lives of the thickness delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality. Guys today we have Q and a F that's where you submit the questions and we give you the answers. Now if you want your questions answered on the show, you can submit them a couple of different ways. The first way is guys email these questions into ask Andy at any for solid.com or you go on YouTube in the comment section and ask your questions there and we'll choose some from there as well only on the Q and a F episodes. Other times you tune in we're going to have shows within the show we're constantly growing constantly getting new listeners something to go through this real quick. We have CTI that's what you're going to hear tomorrow that stands for cruise the internet that's where we put topics on the screen. We talk about what's happening in the world and then we speculate on what's true what's not true and then we talk about how we the people have to fix these problems going on in the world. Other times we're going to have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes of me giving you some real talk and then sometimes we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus where someone who comes in who's completed the 75 hard program talks about how their life was before how their life is now and how you can use the 75 hard program and live hard program to drastically improve your life. All right. A lot of you guys wonder like what does the 75 hard program do is it some sort of tick tock challenge. No, it's not a tick tock challenge. It fixes the fundamental flaw and most humans, which is this you know what to do you just lack the ability to do it consistently and that's what the program fixes fixes your ability to adhere to a plan so that you can get from where you are to where you want to go. It's massively successful. That's why it's lasted for almost six years now. Some people say, oh, it's a fat. Well, Fad's don't last six fucking years assholes. So that's that now we have a you can get that program for free at episode 208 on the audio feed we weren't on YouTube whenever we launched that program. So get that for freed episode 208 and then the other thing is there's a book that covers the entire live hard program called the book on mental toughness. We just got some of those back in stock. If you go to Andy for sell a calm, you'll be able to pick that book up there. It goes through the entire live hard program top to bottom. If you're one of these people that needs to know all the details, that's an excellent resource. It also gives you 10 extra chapters on mental toughness. Why it's important how you need to implement it and then case studies on some very famous people how they use mental toughness to improve their lives. Again, you can get that book at Andy for sell a calm. We do have a fee for the show. The fee is very simple. It means share the show. We don't run ads on the show. You're going to notice that's a big difference between our show and most other shows. I don't think there's another show of this size that doesn't run ads. In fact, I know there's not. And the reason we do that is because I don't want to listen to what companies. I'm not going resource this show season with stands out. The website opens with a website that I need to talk about it now. In a social media director for once, I call Andy deem acceptable for me to talk about this show's called Mill AF. It's not called, I say what you want AF. I'm not going to do that. In exchange for that, I ask for easily that you guys help us get the word out. Don't be a hoe sure the show. Yep. That's it man. Yeah, that's a good color. Are you is it? Thanks What now that's how you do it good. Yeah good. Yeah, I was just thinking I was thinking about How many people don't understand the dynamic between the show of current events and also personal development? Like the reason I started doing this show for those of you guys who were new I had a number one podcast called the MFCEO project, which was the number one business and entrepreneur podcast on the planet. We're also Consistently ranked number one with this show And it was strictly business and then we pivoted in 2019 the end of 2019 to talk about what was going on in the world And the reason we do this is because this country has been very good to me and I've been very successful with the soil The freedom has provided and we as entrepreneurs have to take responsibility Not just for our own success, but also preserving the ability for the people that come behind us to build and grow success So that's why we talk about what's going on in the world and then we talk about how you can actually go build success sort of like peanut butter and jelly That's why we do that. So I Don't think anybody else does that. We got a unique format here And I think if you stick around and listen, you're gonna enjoy it So for sure, I mean, then like all the issues and problems that we talking to dressed about on TTI This this show is well, how do you what do you do about it? Yeah, that's right, right? It's increasing standards man. It's personal development. It's winning. It's kicking ass. That's what we're here for So let's let's let's do that. Yeah, let's do it guys Andy question number one Andy What's your view on supporting other small businesses as a small business or more specifically those Who don't support you back? I run a gaming lounge called never bored we opened in November of 2023 But before that I have supported small businesses in the area for years Spending thousands of dollars supporting various companies and even helping them clean up when they prepare it to open But when we opened not even one has come through the doors And just for an example of one that made me extremely salty my girlfriend asked a bakery operator in which we've spent thousands to let her sign come play games to which she replied quote, oh, he has games were good Which I can understand but damn 20 dollars ain't much compared to us being one of their top five customers and supporters I haven't been back Since and stop spending at small businesses in the area period. Do you think this will backfire or does it even matter? Small businesses helping out small businesses. What's the outlook on that? Well, the first thing is The reason you're supporting small businesses is not because you believe in supporting small businesses because you think that they should support you back That's not actual support. That's a trade and since the Boundaries are the rules or the trade wasn't discussed up front these other people aren't given their part and now you're bitter All right, you should support small business But you should support small business because it's the right thing to do not because you're gonna get something back All right, and this leads into something else a lot of you guys are fucking entitled you believe that because you open a business Or because you show up to work or because you breathe air that you're entitled to winning Winning is hard. There are very few people that win. It's not something that you get by just showing up at your job every single day over and over and over again for years You have to decide what it is you want and you have to go after it with every fucking ounce of energy that you have Every available resource that you have and there's this misunderstanding about what winning actually is and who gets to actually win that's come from the internet and this fake entrepreneur culture where it seems like everybody's rich and everybody's kicking ass and everybody's winning and that is not true All right, just like on a professional sports team. There is limited amounts of spots for the winners That's in the same in life and just because you were born and breathe air and you think you're special and your mom thinks you're special and your dad thinks you're special Doesn't mean shit, okay, so let's get that out of the way You have to decide what it is you're going to do and you have to go at it with every single ounce of energy that you can possibly Muster and then you have to do that for years and then there's still no guarantee that you're gonna win So you guys who think that you're just gonna win because you're you you're sorely mistaken Those of you who think you're gonna show up at a job and eventually the boss is gonna come to you and say Hey, I think I want to give you a whole bunch of money That's never gonna happen fucking anywhere You have to become an Innihable solution and if that's in your business that means your business has to solve a problem that is very very real for people And it has to solve it better than everybody else if you're not doing that you're gonna fucking lose If you're an entrepreneur or you're an employee and you want to build a career within a company If you show up every single day and you think it just because you show up and you take a shower and you breathe the air and you Do your job at a Satisfactory standard that you're somehow gonna make it you're fucking wrong Okay, you're gonna spend your whole life exactly where you are because there are always going to be people that come in Take a serious give it everything they have and they're gonna beat you and that's reality So if you're one of these people who thinks That you're entitled to winning because you think that you know You're gonna show up and it's just gonna materialize you're fucking wrong And I'm telling you this to be real with you because I don't want you wasting another five ten years in your life And then wonder why you got screwed over you didn't get screwed over you misunderstood the rules of the game And you play a game that isn't in congruency with the real game. That's where you're messing up So I that's this is an entitlement problem amongst a lot of young people all right So with that being said With your business you are not entitled to any trade you were not entitled to anybody referring You were not entitled to anybody coming to shop with you just because you shop with them You should be working to support small businesses in your community if you want to Build a community where everybody supports each other Maybe you should use your energy to create a network or a group where everybody supports each other But that bakery is not obligated sending their kids to play fucking video games at your shop, bro Okay, I'm not even sure that that's a actual business because people can play games at home And they want to play games at home Because they want to put the headset on and want to tell their friends fuck off and eat shit and suck a dick over the fucking internet Yeah, and they can't say that in public so I don't even know if you have a good concept. I'm just being real All right, maybe you do I don't know enough about gaming to know, but I'm gonna tell you this If you operate with that attitude, you're gonna fucking lose nobody owes you a fucking thing You have to be great you have to solve a problem that is real and you have to solve a problem in a way It is better than every other available solution It is that simple and you have to do that forever That is the game of business There are too many of you fuckers that are trying to start businesses that think this shit's just easy And you think you're because you're born you're gonna make it you're not gonna make it bro When I was building my companies the first time now I'm involved in a bunch of companies now But when I was building supplements superstores from the ground up that would eventually birth first form, okay? I read every single night. I read books. I've studied people. I read case studies. I was so fucking In deep in the information of how to get better you couldn't possibly fathom it I didn't do anything else and you guys want this to you know you you guys come into your places and you're like Oh, you know, I'm not really happy doing what I'm doing you think this is about fucking being happy bro This is about winning. This is about producing. It's great if you can be happy doing it But if you're not it doesn't fucking matter all right You have to go hard and you have to be willing to be a student and you have to be willing to be Enough of a student that you're gonna become better than everybody else and a lot of you guys just aren't willing to do that work And then you want the wins you want the money you want the high paycheck you want the nice life You want the house you want the cars you want all the shit But you want to come to work and talk about well I don't really know if this is what I want to be doing But the fucker will they figure out what you want to do and go all in on it because otherwise you ain't gonna get shit You're gonna be living in that shitty apartment till you're 45 years old or older and you ain't gonna have anything in your life And it's only getting harder. So you better get to work now That's what's it any I want to hit on this this this topic of just small businesses in general man because again This is the stuff we cover on CCI we know how hard it is for small businesses as it is Right and like I think it isn't it kind of ignorant to just assume that they have the same support even just to give You know $20 or whatever the fuck it is like everybody struggling out there right now Yeah, I'm saying like small business you what what what do you say you say most businesses are Within a week or two are going out of business right Right every that's the other myth that people don't understand everybody thinks that because you have a Business you're rich right you're printing money. You're selling a product that cost you a penny for a hundred dollars And your rich is fuck that's what everybody thinks most small businesses are within two weeks of fucking missing payroll and going out of business That's reality and you guys don't get it. This is not a game. This is not a game for fucking soft people Like like it's not just something you just I I woke up today and you know what I'm gonna start a company or I'm gonna become an entrepreneur I'm gonna blow blow blow blow blow blow. Bro, you have no idea what you're talking about This is the hardest path you could ever choose a life and a lot of you guys think you can get by on it Like it's a fucking vacation I'm gonna call myself an NFL athlete and then I'm not gonna train. I'm not gonna eat right I'm not gonna go to practice. I'm not gonna run the plays I'm not gonna fucking get with my team and study film, but I want the big contract I want to play on Sundays and if I don't play you're treating me unfairly That is exactly what people do We have a big problem with a lot of you young mother fuckers. You do not fucking get it It's gonna take you way more energy and way more fucking time than you could possibly ever comprehend You are going to want to quit a gazillion times and that's not gonna stop when you get five years in or ten years in or 20 years in there are days that I come in here and I am like fuck this This is fucking ridiculous and I go to fuck home But you know what I do I come back tomorrow for more and that's the difference between an actual entrepreneur and Someone who's not built for the game the person is built for the game will deal with these frustrating times They'll deal with these hard times they'll get pissed off their yellow those screen. They'll even say they quit But when tomorrow rolls around they'll be the first mother fucker. They're ready to kick ass That's reality, but the difference between that person and the people who think their entrepreneurs is Those people get kicked in the nuts The first time and they're like oh, there's no fair no shit It's not fucking fair. No one ever said hey life is fair and if they told you that they lied Okay, no one ever said you get a fair opportunity Everybody starts at a different place. That's not fair What matters is is where you go from where you start to where you in not that Johnny down the street had rich parents or Tommy down the street, you know He inherited a bunch of money from his grandpa or he works in his grandpa's company. What the fuck does that matter to you? It doesn't and most of you spend your whole lives being a poor little me bitch And not having anything because you're too worried about what other people are doing you're counting other people's money You know the quickest way for you to have no money is to count another mother fuckers money start counting your own money That's right. I'm gonna actually this man because it's like you know You're dispelting the myth of the reality of when you're getting started. Let me actually this any your 25 years in Is this principle still hold true for you now like you want to start another business now like it's still the same thing Even 25 years. Yeah, but now it's different because I can I can jump a lot of the bullshit because I have the financial wherewithal means to jump ahead Right, but I can hire I can hire an operator I can hire a guy to build the brand out. I can fucking fund the company. There's all kinds of shit I can do now that couldn't do that. We're back then. I'm trying to sell a five dollar ten dollar twenty dollar ticket to fund that Okay, that's what takes so long But now I'm in a position because I've paid my dues and I've never quit and every time I said I was gonna quit I didn't all right now if I want to start something I could say okay We need a COO we need a CEO we need this blah blah blah blah. There's the check go fucking do it But it still doesn't I What I want what I wanted to get to is like this idea of the modest touch that like it's still no guarantee that it just fucking works No, no Yeah, just because you win it one thing doesn't mean you're gonna win it everything. That's a whole another That's a whole another Concept that people don't understand like we see this in entrepreneurship all the time People build one successful business and they think because they built one that they can build another one So what do they do instead of saying in their core competency the thing they understand the thing they know the area that they've already had success in you know They jump over here to something they've never done They think just because they're them they're gonna succeed and they end up getting killed like every business is a Art there's an art to it if you're in the food and beverage in the hospitality business there is an art to that If you're in a direct consumer CPG business there's an art to that if you're in the real estate business There's an art to that you can't just go from one to the other to the other and think you're gonna kick ass and a lot of people I mean this is definitely a down the road question Question for most people but a lot of people think that because they did one thing decent that they can do anything decent That's not the case a lot of people get killed that way Yeah, but the bottom line here is this it's hard and you guys that think it's fucking not hard and you think that you're just gonna show up in Coast and you know do Media-oker work so you don't get yelled at and eventually someone's gonna come to you and pay you a big amount and you're gonna Naturally move up you motherfuckers are gonna be broke your whole lives. Doesn't work that way your job as an Interpreter newer is to be able to go to your boss and be like look at the fuck I'm doing bro. Who else is doing this? I want to move up. I want to do that. I can do that here. Let me show you how I can do it That's your job. It's not the other way around it's not the job for the guy to come to you and say oh I recognize some potential in you. Can you do this? Yeah, that's not what the fuck it works. And then on top of it In your business like so many people now think they can open a mediocre business a business that just barely serves The the solution to the problem that's presented they do it in a mediocre way They they open a sandwich shop and instead of having the best sandwiches with the best fucking service and the bet Bro, it's got a soda fountain and they're back there making sandwiches and they think they're gonna make it bro You ain't gonna make it your product's not good enough your your company's not good enough your concept's not good enough Like this idea that we don't live in a competitive market place is the most damaging thing that these kids have ever been taught And it comes from this mentality that you get a fucking 17th place trophy for showing the fuck up See now we're dealing with these adults these kids that got participation trophies We're dealing with them as adults and they think that as long as they show up and they say oh I want to be an entrepreneur and as long as they show up and they do a mediocre job that they're gonna be like at the Top of the game and then when they're not at the top of the game It's some sort of injustice it's some sort of discrimination. It's some sort of unfairness. No You're not good enough if we translated this to sports. It would be Hey, you're a wide receiver all the three other wide receivers never dropped the ball You dropped the ball every single time. Oh, and by the way they were on 4 2 40s You run a 6 2 and you're saying oh well, it's not fair now get the plate. No, you're not good enough And that's the problem that we have with these young people you drastically overestimate your skill set and it costs you your whole life I love it man. I love it Guys any question number two This question this this question is a little bit more about lonely in this Andy we get lonely Hey Andy, he actually Oh, this is this at 20 year old from Louisiana. We answered a couple of weeks ago. We got another good question here Andy 20 years old from South Louisiana. I work nearly every day of the week and I'm a full-time college student my parents Divorce recently my family is almost falling apart. I live alone majority of the time now I've started distancing myself from friends because it's gonna be beneficial for me and my goals I broke up with my girlfriend. I'm trying to stop talking to her so much in general the only thing it feels like I have right now Is my dog and my goals and that's what's keeping me going I've never been this alone before and I don't want to get to the point where I'm anti-social And going to be alone my whole life and miss out on all the good things I want to be surrounded by caring and loving people that want to win with me I don't know if I'm making the right move by keeping my keeping to myself and embracing the loneliness to work On myself or if I need to actually hang on to what I do have any advice on this we much appreciate I didn't handle loneliness. What's the it's a concept of being lonely? What's the what's the reality of it man? That shit don't matter to me I don't even think about shit like that. I don't even fucking think about it Like it's never I've never in 25 years thought fuck. I'm lonely Never one time I'm perfectly comfortable being by myself. I could take care of myself I like myself. I like who the fuck I am. I think I'm pretty badass I got a lot of shit to do. I don't really give a fuck and if someone's gonna be in my circle They're gonna make me better. They're gonna push me down the path They're gonna offer something that makes me better whether it just be a good friendship where I can talk to them Openly and honestly because let's be real when you start to get some success and you talk about your life around all your old friends from back in the day They perceive that to be you bragging and flexing on them when in reality is just your life So when you become successful you can't really even talk about your life Except for with other successful people because everybody else thinks you're a pop is ass, okay? and So for me, I don't care. I don't think about it if someone comes in my life Great if they contribute to my life great if they take away from my life They make things harder. They're out of my life immediately. So That's how I think about it a lot of you young guys like I think you hear advice and you take it so literal that You know, it sounds to me like would you just go home and tell all your friends to fuck off? I'll tell your girlfriend to fuck like that's not what anybody's saying here, bro What people are saying is they're saying hey you either got propellers in your boat or you got anchors in your boat All right, the propellers are the friends the relationships the girlfriends the boyfriends That make you better they encourage you they help you they push you to be better They bring peace to your life, okay? The anchors are the people who do the opposite of that they make you doubt yourself They make you question yourself. They bring negativity into your life. They make things harder Okay, you want to get rid of those people and replace them with people who are the former Who are people that are going to propel you forward? So we all need friends and we all need relationships We don't need to be totally isolated some people are okay being isolated I am one of those people, but I am by no means one of the people who tells you to go like Just tell everybody each shit Which is what you sound like you did You know, but you can also take peace in in that loneliness if you're actually working though Yeah, yeah Like if you're as long as you're rowing Listen, I gotta be real dude. I never struggle with that. I never struggle with feeling lonely. I could be completely alone for fucking Unlimited amounts of time and I feel fucking fine laugh at your own jokes. Yeah for sure. Yeah, just like you It's all good man. I'm a funny motherfucker. Well, I think I think this is this I think I don't know if this is maybe just a new Generational thing because I know I think a lot of people struggle It's a real thing man because I think you know even now with these phones social media were more connected Quote, but this is the loneliest we have ever been as a society, right? Yeah, and so I think it's a real thing I don't yeah, but also dude like I don't Put value on that like I don't put that's not what I value my life. I don't value and Think about like oh man my low my I'm lonely so something's wrong. I think about it like I'm lonely because no one could keep up Okay, that's how I look at it and that's the truth. That's the fucking truth that evidence suggests that Okay, so other people that I hang out with they're also those kind of people like all my friends that I talk to you guys know them all Those people I might not talk to them for six months But when I pick up the phone, it's like totally cool There's none of this bullshit that y'all deal with with this low-level relationship shit where it's like oh You know you have a call me. Oh, you only call me when you need something no shit That's why we fucking call it the people at the top they understand that right? It's not a good question they they understand that like you're only calling me because you know shit That's why you call me too so we can help each other win. That's what the fuck we do okay at the bottom That you got all this bullshit. Oh you you fucking called Steve three times and you invited the barbecue and You didn't call you call me once that's loser shit. That's how losers act. That's how they behave That's what you don't want in your life. I don't fuck with people like that neither does anybody else who's successful They don't have time for it another thing is Is that When you're that busy you don't have room for a lot of relationships You don't have room for a lot of friendships So when you first start down the path of being ambitious it could feel like nobody's around But you better get used to it because the reality is as I said in the beginning on the first question It's so fucking hard it takes up all your mother fucking time and If you don't put that time in you're gonna lose so what time do you have for meaningless friendships? If you're actually trying to win and a lot of you guys aren't actually trying to win So you're trying to live a normal person's life with balance and a great friend group and dinner's out and all this shit And then think you still have the time and energy to build which dude that's what I'm trying to explain to you You don't okay? So when you're that busy and you're that caught up in trying to do something that matters in that area You're you're going to have sacrifices in other areas and that's why I get so pissed off with all this garbage on the internet We have all these entrepreneur people and all these faux therapists on the internet telling people that there's something wrong with them because they Want to be successful entrepreneurs or they have goals or they have dreams and if you listen to your friends They tell you the same shit. Listen to what they say. Ooh Remember where you came from oh, you know, don't forget us You know, you're getting a little too cocky, you know, make sure you stay humble. Those are all losers, bro Every fucking single one of those people should be cut the fuck out a real friend We'll say hey, that's awesome that you're doing that bro. That's badass. Is there anything I can do to help? I know what you need. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, that's real shit man. I love it. Shout out to Louisiana Yeah, bro, you you don't have to cut everybody out. You just have to cut the people out that are making it harder That's the point. You don't have to be isolated. Some people like to be isolated Okay, like but there's nothing wrong with them if they do right like dude. I feel like this whole This whole culture of social media Entrepreneurship and business. This is why I'm bringing back MFC. Yo, it's so warped That it's training these kids and these young men and women the wrong game like youth You are not going to build a successful business a successful company and still have everything that your friends have that have a Regular life where they work 40 hours. You're not gonna have everything to have but guess what? They're not gonna have everything you have They're gonna have other problems. You're gonna have problems too, but they're gonna be different kinds of problems And I tell you as someone who's had poor people problems and rich people problems I take rich people problems every fucking day of the week real talk. It's true. I love it I love it guys Andy our third and final question question number three Hey Andy, I've been listening to your podcast for a few months now and it consistently motivates me to improve my life I have attempted to complete 75 hard twice But was unsuccessful both times. I want to make a third attempt after I finish your book I'm over the past few years. I have experienced challenging times It has led to weight gain and depression my biggest challenge currently is resisting unhealthy food While this might seem easy to others. It has been a significant struggle for me Although I am not obese. I'm not where I want to be this phase in my life Is also impacted my career and left me with no motivation for my third attempt at completing 75 hard I am seeking assistance from someone who can help me be accountable with my meal preparations and stuff like that However, I perceive this reliance on external support as a sign of weakness It is that's why I find why you perceive it that way because if fucking is you sound like a bitch Okay, you're gonna let fucking food control your entire life You already said you're not happy with yourself. You don't like looking in the mirror You already said you're fucking fat. You said you're not obese, but I bet you are okay? The reality is you're gonna let fucking food Decide the outcome of your existence. This is an inanimate object. This is a fucking nothing All you have to do is stop doing something which is putting it in your fucking mouth Think about that your entire life and your happiness is Fucking being decided because you can't stop doing something It takes more energy to do it than it does to not do it Okay, and you thinking that other people are gonna fucking come support you and do all this bro That's that is weak. That's why you're fucking seeing it as weakness because that's what it is Okay, third of all 75 hard is not 75 fucking easy It's 75 fucking hard and you saying and other people saying well, I'm gonna give it a try That's not how hard things are accomplished hard things are accomplished by saying I am going to fucking do this No matter what no matter what happens no matter what happens in my life no matter what the weather is no matter what the Circumstances no matter what I will fucking die before I fail at that That is the attitude that it takes to complete anything difficult in your life Including that program so you looking at it like it's another diet like it's fucking Jenny Craig Is the reason that you're having problems with it bro? You don't even understand the main point of the program the main point of the program is not to get your fat ass in shape It's to get your mind in shape so that your fat ass follows, okay? The reason that you have trouble you said it. I can't control my food That's going to translate into everything else, okay? You know what to do other people know what to do. They just can't do it So what do you have to fix you have to fix your ability to adhere your ability to follow through your ability to finish and most people's problem is 99% of the people on this planet's problem is that they cannot adhere to the plan People understand what to do with their career. They understand what to do with their fitness They understand how to be a good person.
