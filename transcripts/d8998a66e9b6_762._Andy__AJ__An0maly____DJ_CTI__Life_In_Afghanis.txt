Share the show. Let's get into it man we got some hot topics today got some great things to talk about. No conspiracies first I got something I thought was absolutely incredible and I think like I mean like we always look for these temperatures of the society right and like you know where people are you know what what like there's words that are coming back now right and it's like you know are we cool like it now people are putting their toes in the water right. Words huh. Words. I was thinking of the same thing. Yeah. Words are coming back Sam Sam. You know yeah well I know you know no but I think it's it's cool it's very very cool to see so um and this kind of backfire and I guess in like the politically correct society um you know are you going are you going majorly baseball right now I am going majorly baseball right now all right all right uh that's not the word but yeah I'm going to MLB Jandoran okay uh had a little slip up a few days ago uh where he uh allegedly called a fan a gay slur which which one. Faggot okay now but now I will say this like well did he mean it in the context of the man being gay that's what I'm saying or was he saying it like you would say to your friends when you're eight years old right like you don't have like any missy who yeah you can be a faggot to not be gay that's correct South Park already solve this issue yes all right now there was all this heat that he got uh it is true yeah but there was all this heat he got man he got suspended you know I'm like the guy tried to write it as wrong you know donated some paychecks the charities and shit right and like I think people were expecting this massive backlash and uh the complete opposite happened and it's fucking amazing check this head line out uh red socks is Jandoran has top selling jersey after suspension for calling fan a gay slur I've never heard of that guy it's kind of funny how like even if you're not a good player like you just have to say faggot by mistake or on purpose and and you're like a hit yeah it's almost like incentive to some like you know like ninth batter this guy's gonna be like like a bird where it's crazy is just a short time ago like three four years ago you said that bro they you're done like you're done bro and you know now you get number one seven yeah yeah it's crazy I think it's fucking awesome so do you comment on this yet it is not officially commented on this just yet here here's the original clip uh that started all of this here check this out not 96 with runners in scoring position that's pretty fucking funny well it's great the fan was saying like you need a tennis racket like like a bigger thing to hit yeah yeah yeah shut up you fucking faggot well I mean look dude this is the natural repercussions of an overly aggressive cantal culture system that's been in play for almost a decade you know people are now willing to make the point that you guys cannot cancel us even if someone says something that is offensive quote unquote right um I mean I think we're gonna see more and more of this I think the more they try to cancel people the more people are gonna be like now fuck you I heard in the NBA like a few players have said no homo and they'll give them a $50,000 fine but it's not you're it's like a I'm not gay but he looks good and it's not even like a diss it's just like I'm person I'm not that yeah but he looks good no homo and they'll find him and it's like it's not even a it's not like he walked up to a homosexual like fuck you for your sexuality yeah so I don't know what they thought they were doing but nobody cares anymore bro I mean this guy is superstar yeah context matters it just does you know and always have yeah I know bro and we could use the fucking n word as an example of that like you know in black culture it's a term of indiremin right it's all on nigo that's right yeah but the point is is that it's context right like if you go up and you say hey fuck you you dirty nigo yeah I'm not gonna say that like I've been listening dude I don't think I think that if people you know I think context just matters bro and I think that we're smart enough to know that and I think society is tired of people being told what's offensive and what's not offensive which is a good sign I think for healthy conversation whether you use these words or don't use them I personally think that the word faggot is a elementary level insult that almost every person is used against their friends over the course of time and you know I don't think it I've never I've never even really heard it used as a gay attack yeah I'm sure it does get used that way but I heard it I feel like it's the I've seen gay people call each other that I mean yeah when they get mad at each other like the fuck yeah I've seen that and faggot yeah yeah yeah so I mean look at what this is this is look Morgan Walling got caught saying the N word and now he's the biggest fucking star in the world right music you know great music I'm just saying people are over the shit they're over the cancel culture they're over the overly politically correct bullshit they they're not stupid they're not gonna be bullied and believing that you know this is super offensive anybody that watched the context of that exchange right there knows he's not actually attacking that person for being gay if he is well he I mean I'll tell you if the guy was gay he's not attacking him for being gay he's attacking him for being a newsman you know his sexual yeah unless he was gay with the you know that would be a whole scandal itself we have the whole pride shit on the okay but here's the truth like I did today if you're gonna arm chair quarterback a fucking ML beer you know I'm saying like he's down there he's playing the fucking game you're in the bleachers bro and you want to like shit talk like you're a fucking faggot like it is the truth you know I'm saying like how about you shut up drinker you know $20 fucking beer I mean by that definition I've been a faggot many times yeah I'm just you know the same except it yes I've been a faggot before yeah well before it's like when I do livestream sometimes people will talk and you're supposed to be professional obviously in the MLB but sometimes you want to do it just to let them know like I'm just a person too and they're like oh I thought it's like I'm not a circus monkey just like dancing for entertainment on YouTube like if you say something funny to me like I'ma say it funny to you and you're like oh whoa it's like some of these fans they think they're just gonna talk shit and it's like he could hear you and he also has a mouth so yeah it is what it is yeah I agree with that too like a lot of people will say oh you're a professional you shouldn't look bro there everybody you can do whatever you want man this is freedom of speech if someone fucking heckles you and you have come back I mean yeah I like it better I like it too personality it's funny and I like people calling each other names and shit I think it's funny and I think if it hurts your feelings you should grow the fuck up sticks and stones break my bones but words will never hurt me when you get back to that yeah two thousand their back like gaming culture when you first got a head oh my god you know it's like you would just talk the most offensive shit out would pretend I was somewhere else have a different accent be talking shit like to someone in like Alaska those are the days yeah hey there's some racist mother fuckers on the game shit that's like 80% like oh man watchdog groups they're like we still have a problem on Xbox and it's like it's not a problem it's just like a good time like playing madden yeah it's all fucking it's all fucking night-year-old kids bro their ruthless yeah fucking ruthless yeah I'm a dot are you game is still what will game you play oh yeah well if you're gonna play a game that's a good one you talk shit when you like have a headset or no we got a video we all used to play together online and I got banned for saying some words what you say what words yeah bag how come you're Jersey did you get like I got to get the M.O.V. the store go make a shirt for him and like it's just good just like put a headline out that like someone at the at a podcast said baggy and like it blows up people like that's a patriot right there like you don't even know them they're like that's that's he he loves this country you're like man it says that game slur I think it's awesome guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think and uh that being said let's get into our first headline headline number one that's clean right there yeah that is good that's clean yeah headline number one let's talk about it uh Fox News put this article I thought this was interesting um so let's dive into this Fox News article uh headline reads after three years of Taliban rule life continues to get worse in Afghanistan and and so I saw this right and I'm like okay you know that dive into and they're on your life in Afghanistan has gotten perpetually worse for Afghans living under Taliban rule for the last three years as the humanitarian crisis continues to escalate rights for women have all been vanished and Kabul remains essentially shut off from the international I'm like reading this and I'm like I don't really care right like especially when you know our economies in the tank our homeless population is skyrocketed inflations are out of control you got massive companies doing all of these immigrants everywhere um migrates everywhere migrates and do you know I can really give two shits right like you know Cisco's laying off the shit ton of their employees they're laying off about seven percent of their workforce intel they're laying off about 15,000 of their workforce paramount global um they're laying off 15 percent all of these things on top of that like we just got this bit massive data breach right we're 2.7 billion records leaked in massive US data breach um and uh and I've checked we're all fine in this room um you know yeah okay yeah um but the names uh a lot of things were leaked in this right and I'm like this is so weird now you sure they didn't just give yours back it's possible do you check me or no it is fine I'm not gonna check you yeah sure they did just take yours and say oh my credit scores too low sitting back in the back my payment went up using this new grade you know but you got that going on and like I'm like you know I see this article I'm just scrolling like okay like who who cares like how is this the point now I will say this um and this is something that has been out there and everybody has seen this that did kind of piss me off a little bit um love to get your guys to take on it um but the Taliban uh they did this massive parade this hell I read this Taliban reminds world of Biden Harris humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan with military parade now I did see this and I said this kind of this definitely ruffles some feathers for me um because the Taliban paraded billions of dollars worth of American military hardware around the streets of Afghanistan on Wednesday near the US's former air base inside the country the Islamic extremist group which is not recognized by any country as being the legitimate government of Afghanistan how the US military vehicles helicopters and weapons at a paraded bargrim airbase um now it's been estimated that it we left about seven point one billion dollars of vehicles aircraft ammunition there was something about 40,000 military vehicles 300,000 weapons um and tens of millions of dollars worth of ammunition um and then they put out they released the fucking video right have you guys I don't know if you've ever seen the video I have here yeah uh this clip right here check this out and you guys don't look to!!! Copying finals, gets out of there right from the back中共 G-Sally. G-Sally. G-Sally. G-Sally. Look at all, they're literally all sideways. Yeah. Yeah. G-Sally. You think they just climbed in there and are like, let's just look at switches around and figure it to fuck out. Their song was cool, but it would have been cool if it was like Kendrick Lamar like, we not like, they not like us. They not like us. That would have been hard. But, first back to their music too. So they have this mass prey and that's all of our vehicles. Like that's American tax dollars right there. I know, it's fucking Ebrace. You have one. Oh, my better than that. Those are four wheel and brass. My God, six. Yours didn't get left over there. Yeah. You know, I'm like, but then there was another thing that came out about this parade is that, you know, China, Iran, both those countries sent diplomats to the fucking victory parade. Right? Where, quote, the Taliban's on forces to Soviet era tanks and artillery pieces through the former US air base and the Bahram, where Chinese and Iranian diplomats were also present. The Turkish outlet, daily sabbas, citing international agencies reported. A swarm of motorbikes strapped with yellow Jerry cans, often used to carry and provides explosive devices during the fight against international forces, also rumble past assembled officials. Now, I put all of that here for this last little piece right here before we get on it. We got all of that happening. Like I said, obviously, we cover the state of this country often. We have all of that happened. And then now, just today, release shortly before this podcast, you have Israel officials now telling the US that we have to strike Iran now within the next couple, like few days. They're pushing for a massive strike led by the US. Guys, when we got on all of this? I mean, I'll start by saying this. I used to believe, actually, I mean, I think pretty young, I kind of sought through some of the wars. And it was really unpopular and everyone hated it and said, you're not patriotic. But you would like to think that there's a level that they care about us. And like, maybe it's a necessary evil that we have to do in the world. But when you look at like our food supply, a lot of the stuff they're doing here, the propaganda they're pushing on people that just instinctually, physical wise, mental wise, it's the opposite of what's good for people. It's hard to believe that they don't give a shit about us or our kids or the schools or anything. But they're going to go to Afghanistan and fix that. Like, that's what they used to sell us. So it's just sad. Not only do we not probably do that there and waste a trillion dollars, but then we left all the weapons to our enemies that are like celebrating. It's just like, there's, you can list like 10 things. It's like, oh for 10. It's for the greatest country. It's embarrassing. Yeah, no doubt. Yeah, man, look, this is something we've been talking about for a long time leading up to the election. The WHO just declared a pandemic of monkeypox, a world emergency again, okay, yesterday. Now they're trying to get this world war, all right? We had Trump's assassination attempt. All three things I've said were going to happen. I told you they were gonna pull the fucking, all the stops out to make sure that this guy didn't win the election. And that's what's happening. It's exactly what's going on. And, you know, yeah, it's sad, dude. That's what it comes down to. It's a sad state of affairs that our government has been infiltrated and corrupted by people who do not represent the people. They are not of the people. And they certainly are not for the people. And quite honestly, you know, I think it's pretty obvious to most people who have been paying attention. And I know the people who have been listening to this show or following your content that, you know, these people are making decisions every single day in government that are anti-American. And it's to line their own pockets. These people don't believe in the fundamental America, the patriotic America that we all believed in. And I agree with you. I used to be the guy that believed in all of it. And then I started realizing that patriotic kind of means a different thing than what I thought it meant growing up. I used to think it meant supporting all the military and the wars and what were patriots. But that's really not what being a patriot is about at all. Being a patriot is about standing for what this country should be by standing with the people, what's going to be good for the people. And getting ourselves corrected, you know, because we care about our fellow neighbor, not these politicians. So, I mean, I share everything that you said. I agree with you. It's extremely frustrating to watch. And eventually we're gonna have to deal with this again. You know, these guys aren't going away. This is gonna cost more American lives eventually. I want to say with the, like, I always have to say, I don't have to, but I want to be clear because it's like, I'm not, some people are like, oh, I love Russian. Like I'm not pro-Russia, pro-to-American. You know, like I ran, these are cultures unfamiliar to me. I'm not hating on them, but I'm not like people, if you disagree with it, they'll make, oh, you support them. Like, no, I don't. Yeah. But here's the thing, it's like you look at the Olympic ceremony that everyone's freaking out about. Iran was against it. I'm not saying for the same reasons as America, Russia, all the Russians thought it was crazy. And it's like, what does America do? I notice this pattern. It's like we're going over to Russia, which is like super conservative, super Christian Catholic. And then- It's actually more traditional American than America is right now. Right. And then we're trying, and then we go to Ukraine, and then they go turn more like San Francisco. And then Russia goes the other way. We are fighting Iran who thought it was crazy that there were blaspheming Jesus Christ if that's how people interpreted it. So this time did it. And it's like we go to these places and we make them more liberal. And even people like Mike Pompeo has used the term liberal world order, which was Trump's Secretary of State. And it's like conservative is complaining about liberals in America and you're trying to make the whole world liberal. So it's, I'm not saying Iran's good. I don't want to live there. 70, 80 million people though. They got Russia and it sucks as an American because it's like I'm not saying they're the right side, but it's like clearly like our leaders, like Anthony Blinken's gonna go there and turn Russia into what? Like we don't even, we can't even fix our own cities. So it's just a sad state of affairs when you are a patriot, when you don't wanna watch enemies like parade around. Well, dude, I don't think it represents the majority of Americans. I don't think the majority of Americans wanna fly over to Ukraine or the Middle East and liberalize it. That's just our government. And I think we have to delineate that there's a big difference between our government and the people and the big trick that they've pulled is getting the people to believe that it's, the people versus the people, it's right versus left, it's black versus white, it's gay versus straight. And it's none of those things, dude. It's them who don't represent what we want, going around the world, doing things that we wouldn't even want here. And that's where you get this pushback. And I actually think that's where you get the restraint that you see from Russia and Iran. I don't believe these people are crazy terrorist madmen like the media pacing to be. Because if they were, they would have already been sick of our shit and they would have been honest already. I ran a huge country too. I see some Republican sometimes, not all of them, not to stereotype, but they'll be like blow it off the map. It's not this little place, I think there's like 80, 90 million people there. And I noticed outside of whatever, some people have a personal bias for race or religion towards certain countries, which is understandable if it means something to you or you're from there. But I noticed with Ukraine, you'll have all these, not all, but a lot of liberals will say like, it's crazy that we're funding Israel against Palestine. And then you're like, what about Ukraine? Well, we got to fund Ukraine. Why? Because the media told me that I had to care about that one, but we got that one. And then it's the opposite for the right, where they're like, we can't be funding Zelensky. It's like we just gave 30 billion to Israel. Like we need to do that. So it's like through partisan politics, like I said, some people have a religious or ethnic reason, whether it's Christian or Jewish for Israel. But outside of that, it's like the left understands so clearly that the military industrial complex is giving weapons to Israel. But so many of them in Ukraine, like they can't get it because they're so stubborn. You know, they're like, but the right in Putin and Trump, like in Zelensky, you're like, oh my gosh, you're so close, see it's so fun. Yeah, it's true, man. It's real guys, jump it on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments, what you guys think. With that being said, let's go check out some of these comments. Let's go cruise them. We got some good ones here. This first comment comes from Ed Ryan Valenciano, 2261. He says, I am not fucking buying it. DJ didn't go to Mexico. He got locked up for a couple of days for stealing too many bikes. You got me. That joke will get you locked up in the UK. Really? Yeah, I don't know. Which one? No, I'll just say what you said. Or just. Got another comment. This comes from at HP Jardav, 598. Two Pock still alive. Is that a statement? I mean, there's no question mark. I don't know. I don't either, man. I don't know what I know. Could be an Antarctica with John Kerry and Epstein, but yeah, Hitler. Yeah, yeah. It's an experience. Yeah. He's like an article in Antarctica, like, lives in the whole world. I'm not around that. I show. Yeah. Something about that because they don't let you fly over it. Like, and I read that John Kerry, that's why I said that he's alive, but he flew to Antarctica for the election. And like the news reported that, like, why would you go to Antarctica during the election? Like, I feel like they got some cool shit there. And then they just tell people, like, oh, you don't want to fly over here. Like, it's dangerous and like, penguin. I'm like, I like penguins. Like, no, you don't. They're like, they're, you know, they got like a sick, like layer there with all two pox there. You know, like, yeah, Michael Jackson. Yeah, MJ. Yeah. Did you ever see that? It's like a CNN interview of his friend, like Dave Dave. Oh, we just covered it. Dude, last show. Crazy bro. Bro, what do you think of that? Dude, I don't know. I like, I think Dave Dave might be Michael Michael. That was great. He was like, Michael was a really soft soul. Like, bro, what that was? Yeah. And I've seen other pictures of Dave, Dave. It looked a lot different. That's, and Michael used to like to dress up. There's a story of A-Con where he said that like, Michael would do it just so he didn't get like media attention or people coming up to him and he thought it was fun. And this guy came up to him and was like, yo, A-Con, or Michael, like, he didn't know as Michael. But he's like, can you take a picture of me at A-Con? He's like, if only this guy knew as Michael Jackson, he's asking to take a picture for him. So the fact that he dressed up, I don't know. I think, if I had to, I think it's Mike. He's an Antarctica for sure. Well, Dave Dave. I mean, that sounds like a Michael Jackson chosen name, right? Like Mike, Mike, choose a name for your alter ego. I got it. Which is Dave Dave. It's with Dave Dave Dave. It's like it's his middle name, too. Yeah, Dave Dave does sound fake. That's just crazy though, right? Yeah, do we just cover that? We just cover that, man. Dave Dave. Two-pock, man. I think two-pock might be down there. I don't know. You took care of both of them. You think so? Yeah. I think that's all on Diddy, bro. That's my, that's my guess. Yeah. That would suck. Yeah. No, Diddy. Yeah. No, guys, we appreciate you. We appreciate you being real ass fans. Keep liking. Keep commenting. Make sure you guys hit that bell notification on the tube. Stay up to date with the latest episodes of really F, that being said, let's keep this cruise moving. I had none of the two. Got some good news for you guys. From the first official Black Indian woman presidential nominee, we finally have a first set of policies coming through. And let's talk about them. First, hello to two-reads, Kamala Harris, to announce Soviet style price controls on food under guys of gouging ban. Let's dive into this a little bit. So Soviet style centrally administered price controls on food and grocery prices will form part of the federal economic proposals. US Vice President Kamala Harris will unveil Friday when she finally delivers an insight into our 2024 policies. Her address will mark the first time Harris offers a policy focused speech since she was anointed as the Democratic candidate in July and been roundly accused by critics since being a policy-free zone as by bar news reported. The Democratic nominee is promising to institute a first-ever national ban on price gouging and price fixing within her first 100 days in office in an effort to deflect many voters low marks for President Joe Biden's handling of the economy. So you have that, which is that's communism. I get absolutely is communism completely destroyed the free capital market where there's supply and demand that affects things, you know, taxes. I mean, there's a lot of things that go into play there. So you have that, right? And then at the same time today, when the show was recorded, you got Biden and Harris has their first appearance together in a long time where they, Biden spoke at one of her campaign rallies and and delivered this, I guess, he calls it a milestone or an achievement where and everybody's praising it. Biden administration announces results of historic Medicare drug price negotiations that will save six billion. All right. And he talks about this, you know, it's cutting costs for all of these, you know, big farmer drugs that, you know, only 8% of the population is even having to to spend on. But there's a catch. Okay. There's a catch. And like everybody's eating these fucking headlines up mainstream media left and right, like, oh, Biden, this is a Biden win. But the problem is is that the new prices don't go into effect until 26, 26, which means that all of, you know, the heart ache and the pain at the wallets and the grocery stores and the pharmacies like people are still having to deal with that right now, which is something that they don't want to address. And so you have that going on. Now the other issues on this is that, you know, like we talked about quite often is the inflation. And I saw this video. I thought this was pretty cool. This is JD Vance, where he smacks down a New York Times reporter about fact checking inflation numbers. Let's, let's watch this. Sir. New York Times. I wanted to ask you about the latest economic news from this morning with inflation now being under 3% the lowest rate since mid 2021. What is your sort of reaction to that? Well, I think the crowd reaction says it all. Look, when they say that inflation is down, they mean from a baseline where groceries are already 30% more expensive than they were when Donald Trump was president. And they're not saying it's coming down. They're just saying it's not going up as fast as it was three years ago. That is not a reputation or a record of rag on. That's a record to be ashamed of. Why did it take them so long to get inflation to where it is and why our price is so high? It's because Kamala Harris failed to do her job. So if they want to go around and this is, you know, it's funny. Kamala Harris on the one hand will say on day one, we're going to tackle the affordability crisis. And like I said earlier, Kamala Harris has been the vice president for three and a half years. And I think ladies and gentlemen, she's in effect been the acting president because we all know Joe Biden isn't home. So she's been the one controlling government policy for three and a half years. She says she wants to tackle the affordability crisis on day one. And then on the other hand, she'll say, well, we've already got inflation under control. Well, which isn't Kamala? Which is it? The simple truth is America's credit card debt is going to get higher. Americans are finding the basic necessities in middle class life less affordable. Americans are becoming especially young people are becoming poppers in their own country. If we don't do better, our young generation, they're not going to own anything. They're not going to have anything. They're going to be renters in the country that their parents and grandparents built. And then the nation is a disaster. Kamala Harris does not have a leg to stand on. I mean, you can put it this way. So you have that. And then right after this happened, Joe Biden gets a question asked to him about the economy. And if it was by Peter Ducey, who does great, but he tells Peter Ducey that Kamala's economic plan is going to be the same as his, which I think is interesting. And I mean, well, he's telling the truth. He's not lying. I didn't know he was still doing interviews. I thought he was pissed out, you know, like he retired. Yeah. So I mean, what do we got all of this? Well, I guess with the pharma stuff, it's always crazy to me that, I mean, both sides, I think are clearly working for Big Pharma. But when liberals are like, oh, we're fighting Big Pharma. It's like, on what planet are you fighting Big Pharma? It's like, they'll give them tens or hundreds of billions of dollars. They'll mandate their products. Every commercial is a pharmaceutical product. And it's like they pay for your campaigns. And yeah, yeah, they're all getting lobbied by them. Exactly. They're the biggest lobbyist. They're the biggest controller of TV. I think they're keeping the whole television, like media alive. But then they're like, we're going to lower some drugs. They're crushing Big Pharma. And it's just like, how do people believe that? Yeah. It's crazy to me. I think it's interesting that more people aren't calling out the fact of what Vance just said about Kamala being in office for the last three and a half years. Okay, almost four years. You know, she comes on every, first of all, she's not doing any interviews, okay, which is weird. She hasn't really put out any policy until today. The policy that she's put out is much more moderate than what they've displayed over the last three and a half years. How many of you believe that she's going to go into office and switch from what they've been doing, this aggressive pro Marxist pro left borderline communist policy to some sort of common sense moderate policy? How many people really believe that? I don't think very many. I know you as a businessman, like every move you make makes a difference whether you run and add or the flow. So in 2020, even though it wasn't Trump's fault, was going on in the Democrats, we're going to be worse. They display it as like he's in office. You don't like what's going on now, right? We lock this country down like you don't like it. Well, here's the new and people are like, oh, Joe Biden is going to beat COVID. It's like, how's he going to beat like what's he going to do? But since, you know, they're doing so bad, they're trying to make it like Kamala's new. It's like she's the vice president. Like you said, all her policies are exactly the same. But it's just like brainwashing tactic of like, yeah, we like Biden wasn't, they probably had all the analytics from everything and they're like, Biden's not going to win the election. We got to put her there and act like she's just like outsider, but she's literally the vice president in the same administration who's going to have the same. The same people. Yeah. But they're tricking people. Like you said, I think that people don't buy it, but I think so many people are so emotional that it's more like a, they hate the other side. I'm, I'm praying that they're just lying about like polls and stuff because it's crazy to think that even a Democrat say like you're progressive Bernie person. Like you think she's got this crazy new agenda. She's literally his, it would be like a Mike Pence ran and you're like, oh, he's got this revolutionary idea. It's like he doesn't, he works for the Republican party. He's got the same agenda. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just shit here. 100% crazy. I mean, look, if she really wanted to make people believe they would make those decisions that she's talking about right now, they have to say, hey, we're doing this right now. Today we're doing this. Today we're doing that. Today we're doing this. And for the next two weeks, undo all the shit that they did. And I think if they did that, people for sure vote for them. And I still think that would be a mistake because I think once they get back in, they just reverse it all. But I don't trust these people. I think they're fucking communist. I know they're communist. They're all right enough about communism. Know what we're looking at here. And I think it's funny that she's out there saying, we're going to do this first 100 days and Joe's like, yeah, whatever bitch. You're going to be the same shit I did. He doesn't want to like lose credit. Like oh, she's going to do so much better. Like that's what he probably should say. But he's like, no, she's going to do the same thing I'm doing. Like, he pretty much just kicked me out. Yeah. Well, dude, I think that's going to become a bigger deal than what we maybe anticipate. Because I have heard through my resources that he is very, very, very bitter about how they handled it. So, I wouldn't be surprised if we hear a little more, you know, churping from Biden, Diperswitch. The inflation gaslighting too really pisses me off because people take it all the way back to like the Federal Reserve and when it got away from gold back. But really like the big kick in the ass was the COVID printing. Like they shut down supply chains, printed trillions of dollars. Both parties did it. Democrats dragged it out for longer. And now both sides kind of play stupid. And I heard Elon must talk to Trump. And he was like, it's like government spending. Like he understands how it's coming. It's like the spending. But they all are like, when I'm in office, I'm going to fix it. When I'm like, where did it came from? Come on, it came from Trump. It's like, you guys both printed way too much money. And I remember in March and April when people were like, it's only a few months of lockdowns. And I'm like, I'm thinking economics. So I'm like, dude, we're going to be screwed for the next decade. Like of course prices are going to go up after what they did. So like now, the thing that's going to get rid of it is just like, I'm sure the interest rates and things they're doing. But we'll just like tragedies that have happened, like we'll slowly get away from it. But we're going to be eating this cost that and it's not like you could lower the prices. Like they'll print trillions and be like, oh, we got to like gouge prices on tomatoes. It's like, just stop this bullshit. And then it wouldn't have ever even happened. And it'll probably go away. But like, yeah, this communist stuff, like I can't believe people don't see that. That's why it's all here. Yeah, I think it's a hard time. It's people have a hard time believing that. I think people, like when you sit someone down, like my friends of mine, let's say, who I know are intelligent people who have done things in the world who don't pay attention to what's going on in the current events, right? And I got a lot of friends like that. You know, we'll sit around, we're smoking cigar, we start talking about what's going on. When I start explaining them, like what is actually going on? They look at me like, dude, no way. It's like really hard for them to understand that like what we've been warned about for the last hundred years and what communists have been openly saying, saying, we're going to take over America without ever firing a shot. That's what they've done. They've done that. And they are in control right now. And we have one chance to potentially. You know, undo that control in this election. But I mean, dude, like I'm just shocked more and more that people, one, don't recognize what's going on. And two, don't call her out for like, you're in office now. And I actually think that's why she's not doing press because if we were doing press and you and me were in the crowd, that'd be the first thing I'd ask her. Right. You're up here making all these promises about the first hundred days you're in office. What's stopping you from doing it right now? And she can't answer that. Right. And that's why she's not doing press. Well, apparently she's also like ordered Tim Walls not to do pressers either. Yeah. Well, that's probably a good idea because he looks like a fucking pedophile of me. So a little breaking news almost, but apparently this came out, you know, because we talk about communism here. I checked that motherfucker's hard drive for real, for real. I mean, there's a lot of issues with them, right? I guess some stolen value allegations. Yeah. He voted, he voted to classify pedophilia as an actual sexual attraction. That's weird. Yeah. Yeah, there's some like he lied about the drunk driving incident that he had back in 1995. There's a lot of interesting things, but this just came out. Tim Walls tied to Chinese secret police stations, the kidnap CCP critics. So this is a report that just came out that ties between the Chinese communist party and Minnesota governor Tim Walls are becoming more alarming with right bar new senior contributor Peter Swiser revealing that the VP hopeful is connected to secret police stations that the Chinese have here in the United States. New York Times best selling author claim that walls, who was announced as vice president, Kamala Harris is running made on August 6th is connected to CCP operatives who conduct illegal police activity in the United States. And apparently there's a lot of a lot of links that have come out about this. But again, it makes sense. I mean, I think this is like the final. Well, doesn't he has he made like dozens and dozens and dozens of trips to China and spend excess amounts of time there? He speaks Chinese too, right? I'm not sure about that. I mean, I thought I heard that. I could be wrong on that. It's weird with like the Chinese communists were like there. They don't let their kids play with our TikTok because it's degenerate and they like have them like a wholesome one. And then the Democrat, they probably think Democrats are like disgusting. They're just like, we'll just use these people. You know, because it's a totally relationship. We're like, we both have maybe similar ideology economically, but they're like all like, there's no way China thinks what this guy pushes like socially. He they probably think he's disgusting. Yeah, but they just probably don't tell him. Yeah, they're like, whatever. He's just cheap to fucking, you know, he's cheap to get. Yeah. I mean, because all these people are fucking bought and paid for. Yeah. This guy's a turd. I was going to say with a like Zalinsky, when he got in, there was a television show that was on, you know, the servant of the people and it made him look like this teacher turned president and it brainwashed the people like he's the next president. He's going to fight corruption with Kamala. She's never been on TV, but Maya Rudolph always plays her and my Rudolph is cool and funny. You know, and I think it's like they're just trying to be like, remember that. Remember those five shows we did. Talking about that president. The comedian. Yeah, the comedian. She is funny. She is, she's cool. Yeah. But and she makes Kamala, even though like she does a goofy impression, like Maya Rudolph is a likable character. Yeah. It's like hide the real Kamala because we've had how many shows about female presidents, how many times has Maya Rudolph been on SNL? It's like with Tulsi, she's a cool lady, but they made Tulsi seem like a villain. And I think they compared her to like the Dalmatians villain like Karella or the villa. Because we're here. No, because of her foreign policy and the fact that she's like better than most Democrats. But it's like they're Tulsi. Tulsi is. People is badass, bro. Right. But SNL is like, we're going to make the bad people look awesome. The awesome people look evil and then we'll hide the actual people. So they can't see them because the people saw actual Kamala. Like, oh, that's not Maya Rudolph. I think they're going with that Zelensky approach of like we've had 10. I've seen even when I go to like LA like billboards where it's like the female president, female time. And like then they put the female in and there and a lot of people are, I don't know if I would say that, dumber that brainwash, but they're like, Oh, this is the time because they're. It's a story. It's a story. It's iconic. It's kind of strafficking. Yeah. Fuck what it is. Yeah. That's what it is. Guys, jump in this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down. I mean, I think you have to be a pretty dumb mother fucker to vote for anybody based upon what they look like or what gender they are. No, like we should be voting on effectiveness. Did you see Jesse Ventura? He went on the news and he was like, you know, it's time for a woman president. What makes it time? It's like, does it matter which women it? What if it was like Betsy DeVos or whatever? You know, it's like, is it time for a woman? Like, I thought he was smarter than that. You have to just say like, do like anything about her. Well, that's, that's my point is what makes it time. Right. Right. What makes it time? What makes it time? We should, if a woman comes along and she has a better candidate than all of the other people. And, and she gets the votes, then it's time. Right. It's not time just because this is a woman and just because we've never had a woman. Like in business in the United States of America is the biggest business in the world. You don't just pick the CEO because I'm like, well, guess what? It's been white news running shit for, you know, the last 25 years of my company. So I guess it's time to pick that. Let's go find someone to isn't white. And let's just put him in like, if you make decisions that way in any area of life, you're going to fucking lose. And I feel like half the population understands that. But the other half is so brainwashed or delusional or enamored by the historic iconic propaganda that comes around these things that they can't think it through. And it's like, bro, if we're playing in the Super Bowl, we're not throwing a woman out and fucking quarterback just because she's a woman. Like that doesn't make any sense. And if you said that to people, if you said, hey, you know, sorry, my homes, you guys sit on the bench, we're going to put this cheerleader in there to play quarterback because we never had a cheerleader play quarterback. Everybody in the fuck. No, dude, for real everybody in the fucking stadium and everybody watched on TV would be like, what the fuck is going on? But when it comes to the country, they don't think anything like that. Like this is not a social experiment. This is not an art club. This is a, this is a fucking business that has life or death consequences for millions and millions and millions of Americans and people around the world. So if we're making decisions based upon anything, but who's going to be the most effective operator, we're, we're going to get what we deserve, which is to lose at your company. You've built like, it's like so much dream stuff. Like let me put a basketball court. Let me do this. Everybody's having a good time. 99% of businesses are a disaster because people are, they're not thinking anything like what's cool, what's fun, what's real, what's great. Like every, like this country, I'm, I'm a very optimistic person, but customer service everywhere. Just everything. It's like, just anybody like, yeah, you're the only person I know that runs a cool business, dude. Everything else is going to shit so fast because they're thinking like, let's just put someone unqualified because of who they, and it's like, okay, now everything's going to suck. It's more expensive. They treat you like shit. Like what are people thinking? Yeah. Well, they, you know, I think they think that it's the right thing to do. I think they have empathy and I think a lot of these people care about people and it sounds good, right? It sounds good. Give everybody a chance. Like let people have, but the problem is, is not everybody deserves a chance. And we have to get back to meritocracy and the realm of what is true and real. And while it sounds good to say, you know what? It would be cool if we could take a cheerleader and put her in Patrick Mahomes position. It sounds like nice first cheerleader ever. You know, we could fuck it through a party about it. We can make T-shirts so much, but she's going to get her ass beat on the fucking field. You know what I'm saying? And we're going to lose the game. So like what's more important, us winning the game or us feeling good about making a decision. Right. That isn't going to allow us to do that. And that's where we have to come to our senses as Americans. You know, we got to stop this division of, and this is one of the things I love about you, bros, because you're so impartial. Like if you believe this over here, you'll say I believe this. And if it's something over here, you'll say I believe that. And we need more of that. We need more people that are critically going to call balls and strikes instead of being culturally enamored with their chosen party or candidate. Right. Like if Donald Trump does some stupid shit, I'm the first one and you're the first one on the internet saying, that was fucking stupid. Right. If Kamala does something good or Joe Biden does something good, I don't have a problem saying, hey, that was pretty good. Like, hey, he told the truth there. You know what I'm saying? It just doesn't happen that I don't know. Yeah, that's right. It doesn't. But I mean, I think objective and true opinions and removing ourselves from the identity of belonging to their party and planting ourselves into the identity that we belong to the American culture is the move that we all have to kind of find ourselves to make, if that makes sense. My mom used to tell me when I was a kid, and I was like, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not going to jump off a bridge, but she's like, if all your friends jump off a bridge, don't do it. And she drilled it into my head. Like, don't, like kids are stupid. Like you're like 10 years old. Like, don't do what they're all doing if it's not right. Right. And as an adult, that's kind of what it is. Because like, say you have like five popular podcasters in New Soats and they say something, they're likable. They're usually right. Most people kind of just follow. But the thing is like, if you're following a good leader, that's awesome. But if you're leader sucks or they're compromised or whatever, then it's not so. And you never know how they're compromised. Right. Like, we can't tell which one of these media outlets or podcasters are saying, we don't know who the influencers are, who the proxies are, these candidates, right? They don't disclose that. So we have to, you and I talk about this all the time, because I think you and I are two of the people that can't be bought, right? Right. Well, I do know some way. I mean, I'm not going to get into all of them, but being in the space, it's like, it's a whole spot. We talked about this a lot. You don't have sponsors because you run your own business, but like, say you had sponsors that were giving you millions of dollars and you knew saying, faggot, or you know, like we'll lose that. Then it's like, but that's a small thing where it's not that big of a deal. Like, say it was like foreign policy. It's like people, they'll justify it because they're like, I don't have to talk about that or like it's a, and then it's like, you slowly just get bought. They wear like the real powers and saying like, you can't buy me. You can't, that you can't lo me in with like a social event. Like, you know, we can't have a cool shit. Like, I would love to go there, but I'm not, it's not like the only cool thing I could do in my life. So that's right. I get it, bro. We talked about this all the time. I'm not, I'm not going to trade my integrity for a field trip to Marlago. Sorry, guys. Although I would enjoy meeting everybody in shaking hands. But if you say or do some fucking stupid shit, I'm definitely going to be the person and be like, why do you guys do that? I shouldn't be the way it's done. And honestly, that's the people that need to be surrounding Trump. We need voices of, of different viewpoints and perspectives surrounding leaders. Like, bro, I don't surround myself with yes people. I surround myself with very smart people who will tell me when we're not doing the right thing or we have a bad idea or something not landing the right way. You know, I think Trump needs a little bit more of that. Well, I did see he apparently just brought back in. He was firing his campaign people. He just brought back in his campaign manager from 26. Yeah, well, he should have fucking hired. Who was it? Which one? Which one is it? I mean, it just came out this morning. Yeah. I think he's firing, he's firing two of his people and hiring somebody back. Yeah. He's firing on Twitter. That makes no sense to me. Does he have like a deal? Because it's like Twitter. Oh, did he just come back? He just posted today for the first time, but it's like Trump. He was the best on Twitter. He was the go of Twitter. Like, even in like 2013, he was just saying so much funny. He's like, leave that girlfriend. She doesn't really love you. Like, just talking shit to celebrities. Yeah. Guys, awesome. Yeah. How are, that's your biggest platform in the election? Yeah. So it's like, I don't know who's telling him to not go on, but I don't know. I think I was his issue, right? Like, that's what he was saying. He's like, I want to be me again. You know what I'm saying? Because like, he has been being him as the source of his success. Like he's a dude, listen, I don't care what you say about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a fucking boss. Okay. He has been a stud, his entire fucking life. And I'm not saying that because I fucking, the mega cult or whatever the fuck you want to say, I'm saying that because it's a facts. The guy was a superstar in his 20s, a superstar in his 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s. And he's a superstar now. And before he ran for office, all hip-hop culture, all fucking TV, all media love this dude. Because they knew when he went on, people were going to watch. This guy was a stud. And dude, now we're pretending like he's, he's some tyrant. The guy's been pro-America his whole life. Now does he have faults? Yeah, he does. Like everybody does. But did you see his video with my boy Bryson DeChambo? He did the golfing thing? Dude, Trump is sick. He hit a birdie. Dude, which was crazy and he didn't even care. That was a cool as far as I would be like, oh my gosh, I did it. He was like, yeah, whatever. I do this shit all the time. Bro, I'm really good. He goes, I fucking saw that. And I tell it's the one, he hits it with his iron and he goes, that's going in the hole. And he turns around and walks off and the fucking ball hits the pin and lands like three inches off the hole. And everybody's just like, everyone's going nuts except for him. Yeah, he didn't say shit every day. He's like, it's no big deal. He's like, I'm, and then he's like, tell him, Bryson. Like, yeah, I've won a lot of club tournaments here. Like, you know, it's like, it's just what I do. Did you see how he went to hit the ball, too? Like he didn't fucking go up there and set up. He just walked up and hit the ball. Happy Gilmore. Like, listen, dude, the guys are stuck. He's a fucking winner. He's good at everything he fucking does. And he just, he's a little help around him. That's all. That's it, man. Guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know down in the comments. What do you guys think? Would that be, let's get to our third and final headline? That clip, maybe, laughed like ass off, dude. I just loved how he didn't celebrate. Yeah, I was like, I just just said, I've been here before. That's what I'm saying. Real fucking winners expect to win. When he goes up to hit that ball, he expects the ball to be an inch away from the cup. Right. You know what I'm saying? Like, when you expect, that's the perfect example when I talk about on Q&A is all the time. It's expecting to win. It's not hoping to win. It's not thinking I might win. It's winners, true winners, people who win all the time. That's their default. So they don't celebrate. Like, I don't fucking celebrate when shit goes right. I get real pissed when shit goes wrong. You know what I'm saying? But when shit goes right, that's what I expected the result to be. And so, you know, this is a little off topic for the show. But if you're a young entrepreneur, a young person, trying to be successful, try to work your mindset into that mind frame of, I expect to win, not, I hope, or I wish I could. When you start to expect the universal lines with you and you win more. Yeah. Guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, let's get to our third and final headline, headline number three. Did listen, I have buddies. I know you have buddies in the United States Secret Service. But I don't know what the hell is happening over there. But shit keeps falling apart. headline number three reads, report, secret service agent, abandoned post at North Carolina Trump event to nurse baby. That's crazy. Do it. It's fucking wild. Let's dive into it. A report from real clear politics, Suzan Crabtree, who, small, what do you guys call it? Plug. She's awesome. She puts out a lot of really, really good, just truthful information. Here it is. Suzan Crabtree reveals that during President Donald Trump's visit to North Carolina on August 14th, a secret service agent abandoned her post to breastfeed her baby. The shocking details come just weeks after a fell assassination attempt against President Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, which has raised serious concerns about the secret service. According to the report, five minutes before President Trump's motorcade was scheduled to arrive, the site agent in charge of security for the entire event found the agent from the Atlanta Field Office breastfeeding her child in a room that was supposed to be set aside for secret service official work. What they mean by that is if something happened to Trump, a medical emergency, we call them ready rooms, same thing I do for you at Harvard. It's a ready room. And she was in their breastfeeding her baby. According to Crabtree, the agent had no permission to leave her post, and she did not warn the site event agent. Crabtree reported on X, quote, shortly before Trump's motorcade arrival, I'm told five minutes beforehand, the site agent was getting ready for the arrival. The site agent is the person in charge of the entire event's security. Site agent went to do one final sweep of the walking route and found the agent breastfeeding her child in a room that is supposed to be set aside for important secret service official work, i.e. potential emergencies related to the president. And the article continues saying that not only can a working agent not bring a child during a protective assignment, but Crabtree notes that two other family members were in the room with the agent in the group bypassed the uniform division checkpoint. I really, I really don't know what the fuck's happening over there. Take your take your family to work day, I guess that day. I mean, there's supposed to be the dream team of security. Not an opportunity for fucking everybody to get a shot, which is what this sounds like. I mean, I think I know what you think, but I want to just ask because it's like obviously incompetence could be a thing because people are incompetent, but it's like with like the ladder that is that, like it just seems like they were trying to set them up. So like, was this lady in other words, or is she just reckless and whoever the leader is is like, whatever, I'll just let my team do whatever because we kind of like want them to do whatever. I have a hard time believing that this is just like some random active incompetence, which hopefully not because especially after what's already happened and the timing. I mean, think about like after he got assass, or almost assassinated and like everything was like, Trump's gonna win, Trump's gonna win. It's like, we need a vibe shift. Com, like Joe Biden's out. They didn't even wait like a week. It was like, oh, he's alive. Oh, he's alive. I took the air out of that with introducing Kamala for sure. Right. So yeah, bro, I mean, here's the bottom line. The best, it goes back to the argument I was just making. The best of the best of the best candidates should be on that detail. And the best of the best of the best candidates are probably not women because men are physically superior in most ways, average to average than women, okay? That's not saying the woman couldn't do a job of organizing or laying out the event or whatever, but it's next. Huh? It's next. Yeah, whatever dude. Look, look man, not everybody belongs in every position. I'm sorry, that's just not what the fuck it is. Like in this whole attitude that everybody deserves a chance to be a part of the thing is fucking insane. It goes back to what I was just saying. Let's put the cheerleader in for fucking Patrick Mahomes and see what happens. You know what's gonna happen. We're gonna get killed. And I don't know if this was on purpose or if it wasn't, but it could be especially after what's going on. And I personally believe that they're gonna try to get rid of them again. You know, there's no coincidence in my mind that yesterday, you know, the end of August, we're at the middle of the end of August. We have the who coming out and saying, oh, there's a fucking world pandemic of monkeypox coming off. And then we got these guys saying, we gotta attack her on right now. Like dude, they're trying everything that they fucking can. And to think that they're going to not try and assassinate this dude again, that's delusion. They're going to again. And anyone who does anything like this, like that woman should be fired for that. Immediately. Yeah, she should be fired for that. And immediately. Yeah, dude, it's just, it's insane. And by the way, why the fuck do you have your baby at a fucking event? You're working. Yeah. You can't do this to the best of the best of the best of the best and in the highest level of security. That's a dream job for a security. You're the Michael Jordan of security agents. It's so serious that like serious doesn't even cover. Like, yeah, and you're just breastfeeding a fucking baby. Like that's, it's insane. This lady needs to have like an hour interview just to go through the psychology of like, what the fuck were you doing? And who allowed you to do that? And why? Because like that to me is fascinating. Well, also remember, these people play by the DEI rules. So like if they walked in and said, you're fucking fired, this chick's gonna sue him for whatever some, and people don't understand. Companies have been held hostage by these stupid fucking rules for years and years and years, including my companies. Okay, if we don't promote so many of these people, we get in trouble, or if you don't have this kind of, you get called out on the internet. Well, you know what, motherfucker, I play the best players. That's how, that's kind of coach I am. And if you don't like it, then don't fucking use our business. That's it. I don't give a shit. If you were hiring me to be the coach of the fucking University of Alabama, I ain't playing people because of, you think that they deserve a shot and will play people that can do the job. And I don't understand where we've gotten so far off meritocracy that we're just giving opportunities to people that quite honestly are completely unqualified to do them. At my boys' apartment, they have this old, like, really Chubby Mexican guy that's probably like 70, and like not only is he old and Chubby Hill fall asleep watching telemovelle is on his phone. And it's like cars are getting stolen there. And it's like, yeah, because people are like, there's an old fat guy sleeping watching television shows in Spanish, and that's not real security. You might as well just have like a stick there. So it's like, what are people thinking? Like you said, it's like, look at the physical, and everything, like look at all what it takes to be a great security guard. Like it's probably gonna be mostly men. So just get the best people. Like I've seen that a lot of shows I've done recently, just people that are like huge, like very obese, and then like some emergency happens, and it takes them forever because they're like, oh, they can't get there. And it's like, why aren't the best people not working anywhere? It's kind of creepy, but you would think. We're at the standards gone too. Well, that's the thing, and that's what makes me, like that's what, like, you know, I've been looking at this, and that's what leads me to believe that this is more along the lines of intentionality because, you know, Trump, there's a couple of different classifications when it comes to secret service protection, right? You have like the first tier, which are acting president, acting vice president, family members of those, right? And then you have this category of a former president, right? They don't get as many resources. They're former presidents, they're not a threat to national security, or anything like that, right? So they don't really get that many resources, but Trump's no longer in that category. He's in the middle tier, which is above that former president's status because he received the official nomination as the candidate for president, right? Like that moves you up the list, which means you should be getting more resources. And we know that he already didn't have enough resources at Butler, and now from the looks of it, they're pulling in more of these adjunct agents to come help in and help out, and it's like, have they learned nothing? Well, why is Trump, if that's the case, okay? Then why isn't he spending his own money on his own detail? I mean, the guy's got enough money, bro. Like you don't fly around on a 737, I mean, bro, for him to fly, people understand this. For Trump to fly, look how much he flies. A lot, okay? For him to fly that jet from Florida to fucking St. Louis, is probably three, four hundred fucking thousand dollars, okay? He flies multiple flights like that every day. If you fly multiple flights like that every day, and you got that kind of money, bro, you could hire a fuck your own fucking army. And if I'm being real, he should. He could crowdfund it too, if he didn't want to use his own money, dude, Patriots would throw their mud, dude, they'd give them a $10,000. They'd buy one to show off. Say, hey, do this, and this is going to get my security. He'd have a hundred million dollars within two weeks. That's how much people like him. Did you see JD Vance? There was a video of him with the lady, that the lady that was like, folks are saying, this is the weird part about Trump. I'm voting for Trump. Obviously, it's just like this election's obvious, but it's like, even with the Iran thing, like they said, I ran hack Trump, and he's like, I ran hacked me. And you're like, now you're pushing their narrative. Did they maybe, I don't know. But same with that, you're like, maybe he has to do it because he still has them around him, but he hasn't even really criticized the sewers service. He's like, they did a good job. They actually didn't do a good job, and you're alive, so he's happy, but someone got killed in that. I'll say this though. I'll say this though. I mean, that's a fine line you got to walk. Because like, well, if you look back in history, and you look at how most of the emperors and the seasors were all killed, they were all killed by their own guard. They're closest people, right? And so like, you gotta be, like, dude, like in Trump's case, like, you do gotta walk that line. I'm not gonna agree. If I feel like one of these motherfuckers, I'm about to trash talk them. Like, it may not be good. You know what I'm saying? Like, you gotta be careful on that. And if you do, you better come back later and be like, I'm sorry. Right? I'm not sure. We good, right? We good. Yeah. Well, what about RFK after Trump almost got killed? RFK is like, oh, guys, I finally got Seeker's service. Like, you want them after that? And after your family, like, this is the stuff that almost makes me feel like it's a show. I like RFK seems like a nice guy. I like Trump. He almost just got killed. You have multiple family members that got assassinated that you go on podcasts and say that the government killed your family. And then you want the government to protect you. I don't want the government to protect you. That just almost got Trump killed. And he's like celebrating. It's like, after Trump got shot, after them denying it for a year, like, oh, Trump got shot. Oh, yeah, you can have them too. I would think they're trying to get set me up. Well, I'm gonna tell you this. If it was ever me for real running, we're having our own shit. Oh, yeah. And you, you Secret Service guys, you're welcome to join, but you're gonna be helping. You're not gonna be doing. Yeah. Well, here's the other thing with all of this stuff going on. Right? There's a lot of possibilities. I don't think that another assassination attempt is off the table. But here is one thing that is starting to come back around that just made headlines today that apparently there are preparations being made for Trump to be sentenced to prison on September 18th. So I guarantee you win. Garen to you win, but there would also be a way for, to put them up and, you know, we know what happened with Epstein. You know what I'm saying? It's something like it. Right. Yeah, it's not like the Secret Service and there's gonna protect them. Or they'll be breastfeeding their babies. Third option, he wins and they're like, but you know, and then use that as like a coup attempt of like we can't let the criminal in and like, that's super possible. Super possible, man. All of it. The bottom line, dude, is that we have to recognize that these people believe, they fully believe, this is where it's dangerous. Okay. These people fully believe with their entire hearts, souls and minds. I'm not talking about the politicians. I'm not talking people that are in with the world economic form or in the quote unquote, cabal. I'm talking about the people, talking about our neighbors. These people who don't like Trump, they are fanatical to the point where they, and they truly believe in their soul that that dude is Hitler. And so if you truly believed in your soul that you thought, you know, and there's a lot of Hitler discussions that could be had, I'm not gonna fucking do that today. But if you truly believed this man was the second coming of what you've been told, the most evil person that ever existed was, what would you be willing to do to stop it? And you'd be willing to do anything to stop it. And then with you combine that with the criminal element of the corrupt politicians and how much shit they've done over the last four years, especially with COVID. That was crimes against humanity. When you think about the accountability that they're facing, what are they willing to do to make sure that he doesn't get in office? And the answer again is anything. So we're dealing with two groups of people whose motivation is aligned, even if the reason for that motivation is not entirely aligned. And that's very dangerous because, you know, like we saw this after Trump got shot at, right? After he got shot, how many of these people were like, fuck, I can't believe he didn't die. No, this next time. Bro, they're happy about that. And remember, these are the same fucking people that during COVID wanted you in a fucking camp, okay? America cannot allow these people to continue to be in any sort of power position. And the only reason they're in a power position is because all of the good leaders, all of the smart, intelligent, best and brightest Americans for the last 20 years have gone into business or they've done other things. And we've taken our eye off the ball off of our duty as an American citizen to watch out and participate in our government system, right? So, you know, this is how I see this is like a bunch, a bunch of fucking communist nerds got in. And now they're losing power, they're losing public trust, they're grasping its straws to hang in when the rest of the world is now woken up and they're like, oh, we see you, dude. We see what you're doing. And so these people are nervous, they're scared. And I don't think anything is off the table of what they're capable of. And I think thinking so could be a very dangerous mistake. 100% man. Now, speaking of security and justice and keeping things in check, we got something very, very important that's coming up in two days, one day from when you guys are listening. And that's the DNC convention. Let's check in on and see what's happening there. This headline reads, Chicago braces for chaos. Quilt rooms prepared for mass arrest as Chicago police expect as many as 100,000 pro-Palestinian protesters during the DNC. So they're gonna call this the Chicago insurrection? What do you think they're gonna call it? Let's check it on this. So quickly here, the 2024 DNC, the schedule took place from August 19th, 2024 to August 22nd. Now I'm the event again being held in Chicago. Now the convention is expected to celebrate Kamala Harris as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president and Tim Walls as the nominee for vice president. However, the city is bracing for what could be a perfect storm of chaos, with the possibility of up to 100,000 pro-Hamas protesters flooding the streets of the Chicago police department is preparing for the worst. Now they've done a lot of different things in preparation for this. And they're saying, but the intelligence they have on the ground is saying that there's like 150 different organizations that from around the country that have formed this collective mass, excuse me, protest and that are booking rooms and rental vehicles are up and all of these things are up. And that's how they're putting out their expectations. And so they have prepared 30 courtrooms. They have put in place transportation lines and systems to put these people together in saying that the defunct courtrooms and the stations, they can once they're done there, they can hold about 100 people per courtroom to kind of process them and move them out in a statement they said, quote, for anyone who is charged with an act of violence, they may not be released as quickly. So there are consequences for a rearrest in violating the conditions of release. Marubio, who's a spokesperson for the city of Chicago said, but here's the thing. Here's the thing. Do you guys remember a couple of months ago where we covered the laws of Illinois and how they were changing? It's interesting because that's now back firing on them. Which part? Well, so they passed the state of Illinois, has passed the Safe T Act, right? And they also had another act that they passed called the Pre-Trial Fairness Act that was put in place to help criminals stay out of jail, right? And it's very likely that it's gonna violate those acts that were put in place by the governor. The same act that also, you know, remove the cash bail system for things like second degree murder, aggravated battery, arson, drug induced homicide, kidnapping, burglary, robbery, intimidation, aggravated fleeing and alluding act, like all of the things that, you know, drug induced homicide, no bail or no, they don't have to postpone, second degree murder, no bond. So you're gonna fight and you fucking, you're in a fucking fit of rage and you fucking stab a dude in the throat, you don't even go jail. No bond. Oh, that's so much crime in the cities, you know? That's the greatest thing. That's really enticed in Illinois. So when that motherfucker's fucking stab me in the fucking face, they would have just let him go on the spot. That's fucking insane, you know? Let him to get a lawyer. And so come back. Yeah, come back. And so by them, you know, by them putting out these, these plans, you know, saying how they're gonna be holding people in, you know, 30 court, it's completely in violation with the same things that those very same people set up. Well, it's different when they have to experience it. It's rules for the, that's right. Rules for the, and it's so funny, man, because you know, it's like, these are the same exact prosecutors, you know, that set the shit up that, you know, was paid for by George Soros, who's now also officially for all of those out there. Andy, obviously, a little anti-domus action. It's now official. We can say that George Soros officially has funded all of these same prosecutors. That's now being announced. Guys, what have we got on this? I'll say like this watching, because a lot of like mainstream conservative media, I think they have a bias on the topic of Israel. So they, they're, they reported differently because they're pushing in the direction, which is fine. But I feel like they're missing, and a lot of people are missing like what's really going on. And I've been watching it where I think there's two sex of Democrats. I'll call some, the Bolsheviks just straight up socialists. They're Bernie, pro-Palestine. And then you have the Zionists. A lot of the big Wigs are pro-Israel. They don't mind when the Bolsheviks are doing communist stuff, as long as they don't cross the line of Israel. Donors like the Bill Ackman types. They were funding these universities. No, they've been for so long. Yeah. But then when they realize the cause are pro-Israel, they encourage out. Absolutely. They encourage it everywhere else, but Israel, because they know it weakens everybody else except them. Right. But now that they realize the monster that they've created, it's like this thing where they're passing all these laws that are terrible for America, terrible for cities, terrible for everybody. But they would use them for that, but are they going to be able to? Because it's this topic we would use it on. It's like, well, why'd you pass it then? So it's the most fascinating thing, because Kamala, the right-wing media, will say Kamala's pro-Palestine. She's a Hamas or whatever pro-Hamas. But it's like she's trying to balance the book. She needs the votes from the people who are sympathetic to Palestine. But all the big waves in the Democratic Party, a lot of them support Israel. Biden's still giving weapons to Israel, but he's just trying to pretend like he's not, because half his voting base hates him. So it's just like, it's a great, it's bad, but it's a great position for the right to sit back and watch, like how are they going to handle these monsters that they've created? They fed him so much bullshit, and now they're like, wait, they don't like the country. You thought they were going to like that, couldn't? They don't like anything. They don't even like themselves. They don't like their parents. They don't like you. And they're going to love Israel, but they just hate everything else. They're just creating an army of people that don't contribute, don't build, don't care about anything, but making themselves relevant by throwing temper tantrums. These kids got 57th place trophies growing up. They never had to work for shit. They never got told no. They got told you're a special little delicate flower by every single fucking person that ever knew them in their entire life. They got told they could be a man when they're a woman and a woman when they're a man. These people think they can do fucking anything. And then the people who made them are surprised when those people turn on them. Like mother fucker, it's gonna be super interesting because dude, this could be very dangerous for them. I mean, that's a lot of people, 100,000 people. And these people have shown to be violent. They have shown themselves to be destructive. And they're going to be violent and destructive. That's what they do because they've never been taught repercussions of anything in their life. None of these people, not a single one, ever has been punched in the fucking mouth for saying or doing anything. Okay? And when we look at what's about to happen, what I think, first of all, I think it's, I mean, it's perfect karma, right? It's beautiful to see. It is. I like seeing it because it's fun to see them scramble against the people they made, right? These people were their friends during BLM. These people were their friends during all these other COVID, but now the people- The end of the fandom is getting bit, right? But dude, like think about this though. There's a lot of people way more than 100,000 that are fucking pissed at Israel and are just as humanitarian are like, bro, this is wrong. Okay? Those people are not going to vote for fucking Kamala. And that's a huge part of their fucking base. So they're in the shit here. For sure. It's a confusing topic too because I've dove into it for years and I mean, I've got falsely called anti-Semitic so many times because I figured this out early on just not falling the crowd. I'll give you like one example. Alan Dershowitz, he's on Fox News and a lot of, you know, he's a lawyer, but he's actually a Democrat. And I only know this because I saw him make a video like last year, this year and he said, I've been a Democrat my whole life. I'm considering being a Republican because they're pro-Hamas and it's like, okay, that's fine. You're an American, but the border didn't make you want to be a Republican. Nothing else. You know, none of the other stuff in the last day are only the Israel part. So that kind of shows me that that's the most important topic, Sam. For sure. Okay. But then here's the thing is he also was in the picture when Trump signed the anti-Semitism laws and they all do where you can't say a Jewish American has loyalty to Israel. So it's like you're telling people that that's more important even a lot of these big donors. It's more important than any other topic. You'll fund liberalism until they cross that line. You have the right to do that, but you can't say it's hate speech when someone realizes that that's your main priority. Like everyone has a priority, but that's a lot of the backlash too where it's like the war has created a lot of enemies worldwide and a lot of people even on the right that are upset with it. But these speech laws that only like Charlie Kirk and people started talking about this year, but they've actually been being passed for a while all over the world. It's not that like you can't stop hate by stopping speech and also it says you can't say any person of that ethnicity or religion has loyalty to the country. Not everyone does. I would never say that. It's not true. It's not true. That's right. Just like with George Soros or this, they all have a different thing, but you can't write this blanket thing to say, like don't say this. So I think like all of these policies, you know, God nature, the truth, like it always wins over time. So it's like now you have the Democratic party, they fucked up all the kids, the kids hate them. They're passing laws in both sides that don't, Trump even says if you're a Jewish American and you vote Democrats, you're crazy. He has the right to say that, but he passed a law that says that that's anti-Semitic because you can't tell people, you know? So it's just like funny watching this all melt down. I mean, it's really messed up because it's a war and it's sad, but it's like the, like I don't feel bad for the Democrats. They're lying about everything. So now they got 100,000 pissed off people that don't know what they're doing and they hate them, but they're trying to act like they're not. And then the rights like, oh, they're this. And it's like, I almost think like, yeah, of course, report it, but let them handle it and just shine a spotlight on it. Yeah. Like this is the monster you've created. Yeah, like what are the, I mean, this is, that's gonna be fascinating. But 100,000 people show up. That's prime time TV. That's a, you know, that's January 6th vibes. I'm not rooting for it, but it's like, what are they gonna do? Those kids are gonna go nuts. That's what I'm saying. Do we call that an insurrection? And then how are they gonna arrest them if they pass laws? Isn't that wild? They pass laws that they can't do that. But then they're like, we want to do it for this. We got to do it for this, cool. You shouldn't have passed that stupid shit. I think the key thing that you said in there, and I'm glad you said it, is that you can't make blanket statements about certain ethnicities, right? Like you can't, like, like dude, this is the reason that the anti-Semitic thing gets thrown around so much, and the reason that you can't effectively criticize the Jewish people who happen to be in power making these decisions, because people keep saying, like on Twitter and everywhere, they say the same shit. It's the Jews. It's not the fucking Jews, man. It's very evil criminal people who happen to be Jewish, who hide behind unsuspecting Jewish people, and say, if you criticize me, you're criticizing all of us, and that makes no sense. But then you look at their policies, like you were talking about the Bolshevik communist shit that they encourage everywhere else, but that shit steps one fucking inch on Israel soil. Oh, it's a fucking problem, right? You bring one boatload of migrants in the Israel, fuck, that's a fucking problem. Bro, so you have to ask yourself, and this has nothing to do with the Jewish population. This has to do with the leaders of that fucking country, and what they're about, and the people here in this country who put the interest of that country above the interests of America. And so we have to use our language in a better way than just saying, oh, it's this, because then that's an easy argument to diffuse. Bro, listen to this anti-Semitic dumbass, right? Like, no, dude, there's bad fucking white people. There's bad black people, there's bad Jewish people, and there's far more good of all three of those than there are bad. And then what you're saying too, like Fox, and a lot of these conservative papers will have people just like you have to just like worship them whatever and don't think about it. And I notice, because like my audience sometimes will be like, don't say anything, and it's like, listen, I'm not anti-any country. Like I'm pro-America, but Israel, Palestine, China, like I don't hate China, like Chinese people are awesome. There's great people everywhere. But I read a Wall Street Journal article where a conservative member of Netanyahu's cabinet wrote in Wall Street Journal, and he said, American Europe should take the refugees. They've already taken so many, why don't they take them? And it's like, it's not a liberal. That's a conservative. And he's pro-Israel, he's Israel first, because he lives in Israel, and he's just like, you take him, I don't want him. I don't like that as an American. It's like, I understand why you're doing it, but like, what if we said that to them? They wouldn't be there. They wouldn't want to do that either. So I think like, when you have an ally, it's always great to have allies, but you got to ask yourself, like, what's the relationship like? Because if I wrote an article and I said, you take him, I'd get called in, I said, I'm going to get a thousand times, but he's getting a Wall Street Journal feature, telling us to take migrants and Europe to take migrants. And it's like, bro, and these are the same people telling them all these Palestinians, they're all terrorists, they're all pro-Hamas, even the kids. So then you want them, all those terrorists to come to America and Europe? So it's... Well, of course they do. Because they want to create a two-tier fucking system. They don't want America to be a powerhouse. They don't want Western Europe to be a powerhouse. They want to reduce everybody to third world nature and keep Israel the fucking shining mountain of an example on the hill. That's the fucking point. So like this isn't, it is what it is. I mean, like, you guys fucking call me whatever the fuck you want, but that's what's going on. And I'll say this, too, to add on to what you're talking about, is it's all self-accountability because they're doing what they think is best for their country. It's not their fault, even it's our fault. Our politicians were American. That's right. That's right. So it's like, why are our politicians doing that and why can't people figure that out? I mean, American and Europe, too, but like American politicians are just disgraceful. Like everyone should shame them and make them feel terrible. Where it's like, you're supposed to serve us. They're doing what they think is best for them. I don't have to like that they wrote in the Wall Street Journal. It's kind of a scummy move, but it's like, they're serving their people. We're not serving ours. Yeah, why is that? So that's not, it's not, it's not, it's a matter of them. It's to get annoyed at our politicians. Like they should be more like Thomas Massey or anybody that says, like, wait a second, like that's not it. Yeah, I'm with you, bro. I think that's a great point. It's not their fault. It's fucking our people's fault for allowing it. And it's like America falling apart. It's like is someone doing this or that or the propaganda, whoever you want to blame? It's like why are people doing it? Why are people allowing their families to turn into that? And you know, it's like, everyone needs to take accountability. It's easy to blame and it's like, that's where it's coming from. Okay, I get the new, I have a television. Why don't I do that? You know, because it's like, I control my life. And once you say no, you can do anything in this country. It's still a great country. But so many people play along to it. And then they play the victim. This is not, you know, a victim, like all they're doing this or that. It's just like, yeah, no one in our party is really talking about it. But I know it's, you know, it's hard to do certain things in politics. Even the richest people in politics, they have to take money. They have to play a different game. It's nice to be on a podcast and just not give a fuck. Yeah. Like, you know, take it like, playing politics. They're all like, uh, but that's why people need to realize too that they're playing a certain role, like a middleman almost, like you don't have to just follow what they're doing. And that doesn't mean you hate them or are going to vote the other way. But once you start figuring it out, then the politicians go, oh, okay, they get it. Yeah, that's right. We got to dial back. That's right. Or like, even Kamala's like, we need policing. It's like we do. You don't. Now you like the police because it's election time. Gavin Newsom's cleaning up trash in California. Like, when people demand it, things start moving. Guys, jumping on this conversation down in the comments, let us know what you guys think. Oh, that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up or dumb's fuck. That's when we went to the moon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we bring a headline in, we talk about it, it'll get one of those two options. And so I was like, DJ's facing that picture. It says, well, you mean that's not the moon. It's DJ Kubrick right there. That's right. What you're talking about, that's not the moon. I was there. Yeah. Andy Armstrong. That's right. Yeah. Well, that being said, our thumbs up or dumbest fuckhead, Longreads, student fell asleep on field trip to courtroom and the judge put her in handcuffs. Look culture topic here. Now it's not as harsh. I thought this is going to be like super fucking harsh in my career. Who's this? Let's check it out. All right. Let's see what we got here and then make our decision. Here's a clip. Of course, it's generating some buzz on social media to give it a little context. Judge King saying that he was trying to send a message, a very strong message to a 16 year old girl and about a dozen kids that were with her on this field trip. His point in all of this was deterred these kids from ever showing up in his courtroom for real, charged with the crime. He follows me through my courtroom one more time and putting you in the back and instead, you don't care. As soon as we bring the Christmas sheet and stuff back there. A field trip to 36 district court downtown Detroit this week turned into a scared, straight simulation. A judge ordering a 16 year old girl into jail clothes and handcuffs. You're not faced by this at all, learn. Judge Kenneth King directing his questions to a 16 year old girl who fell asleep twice in his courtroom and once you woke, it was allegedly with an attitude laughing and mocking. So why are you men disrespecting to this court? Yes, man. You sleep at home in your bed. I'm court. And I'm probably frankly, I don't like your attitude. You can see at this point, she's in jail clothes and handcuffs the rest of the teens on the field trip behind her. They came with the nonprofit, the greening of Detroit. Problem are you. You owe them nothing. Nobody. What is your problem? Sources close to the situation. Well, as at this point, the back and forth turn into a simulation to send a message. King reportedly said he never had intentions to send her anywhere, but went on to describe to the kids what it is like if the Detroit detention facility. Then he asked the team. And that's where you want to know. An actual attorney in the courtroom then steps in as if they were representing the team. It ended shortly after that with everyone in the group going home. The greening of Detroit says this in part, although the judge was trying to teach a lesson of respect. His methods were unacceptable. The group of students should have been simply asked to leave the courtroom if he thought they were disrespectful. Adding the team is traumatized. Oh my gosh, they're going to sue. Now there is an update in this case before we even get to our thoughts on this that judge Kenneth King has been temporarily removed from the big shut the fuck up and will not be hearing any cases at the moment that's according to New York Times. And he actually did an interview saying how he was never going to send the he could have sent the team. Never he never thought or was going to follow through on it. He was trying to teach a lesson, but he is at the time of this recording has been temporarily removed from his bench guys. Andy A.J. What do we got on this man? I mean, you wonder why people are fucked up and why they have no fear of accountability and why people think they can do and say and behave and burn shit down and disrupt and do all of this shit. The minute someone tries to teach this child a lesson, the other fucking soft people around the community are like, oh my god, that's abusive. Oh my god, that's wrong. Oh, she's traumatized. No motherfucker, she's going to be traumatized when she's an actual prison because she doesn't respect the system or the laws or understand accountability. To fucking remove this guy, this man from the bench for trying to make a difference in a young woman's life is absurd and reflective of where we are as a society. And it's why our communities look like shit. It's why you have 12 year old kids walking up to grown adults and saying, fuck you motherfucker. Like bro, I'm sorry. Sometimes kids got to learn lessons. You know, if I would have went up to an adult when I was a kid, like we see on Instagram and shit and said something to a grown man, I'd fully expect to be smacked to the fucking ground. Didn't matter if it was my uncle or somebody I didn't know, like there was an understood respect that you had and we don't have that anymore, right? That used to be that when young men had a difference, if it was that big of a difference, they had a fist fight. And you know what usually happened after the fist fight, they actually became friends because there's an amount of respect that happens in physical altercations. But most people don't know that because they never been in one. And when we prevent these people, these young people from learning lessons and having accountability, you're just kicking the can down the road to where this woman is going to end up, she's going to think when she does some real serious shit that she can flip it around on the cops who are the courts in three or four more years. And where she going to end up then and where all you do good is going to be then you should have let this man teach her the lesson. It was harmless. She's not traumatized. You fell asleep in class. So what? He made a great point to all the students. Hey, I bet he picked something. I bet he was going to do that. That was probably part of the thing that he was going to do. It's absurd, dude. And it's the reason our shit's fucked up. And this day and age, it's bold that he was doing that knowing the consequences, but you know, that guy is a good neighbor, a good person, like he's a father figure and he's a, he's not in Detroit. He's not one of the bad ones. You could tell that like he's doing, he's teaching him a lesson. And it's, it's sad. In LA County, they let people out of jail. There was a murder in Orange County recently at Fashion Island, Outdoor Mall. They ran up on some lady, I think, like, tried to steal something, ran or over, killed her. And out after that LA County, these, I don't know if they were 17 or 18 or 19, a few of them, they had stolen a Rolex LA County zero days in jail. Lessons, you have, even if it's six months or a year or two years, whatever it is, a month, zero days. Oh, I could do that. I could go do that again. Correct. That murder would have never happened if they did that. So with this, especially in Detroit, especially knowing that I'm not going to, you know, judge, but it's like you don't, if you have a class of 20, 30 people like they, they're not all good kids, some of them are, but like, maybe their parents aren't doing it. I'm going to teach them a lesson. I'm going to be their father figure. I'm going to help them out in life. And then he gets canned and they're going to replace them with some idiot who's going to let them do whatever. It's, it's just sad when good people like that get, get got. And that is the, in Detroit, it's like that guy's not the problem. There's a lot of problems. It's a solution. That's right. That's right. They stopped the solution and fuel and fund the problem and then stop anyone from fixing the problem. Like like that situation could have literally saved their little girl's life. That's how I look at it. You know, I'm saying, of course, like it could have saved her life or someone else's or somebody else's. You know, I'm saying like, dude, this is sad shit. I thought, honestly, because like we just, okay, well here, look dude, I'm going to say something and some people are going to get pissed about it. But let's be real. The black community is the first people to come out and be like, that's bullshit. That's abuse. That's this. That's that. So what do you say about that? Right. Well, my thing is, we give them saying, right? Like, like if this was on fucking, if this was here in St. Louis, the black community would be out, not all of them, but a sizable portion saying, this is bullshit. So if the community thinks this is bullshit, but then they get upset when their communities are fucking filled with criminals and crime and shit, I mean, you can't have it both ways, guys. I have this conversation with my buddy all the time. It's like if an Asian parent or an Italian parent or my parents, if I did some sort of crime or whatever, whatever it was, even of a small, my mom would be like, what the fuck are you doing? Yeah. You're grounded. You're like, they don't, they're more mad than the police. Yeah. In other communities where they literally not only don't get mad, but then like gate, like gatekeep what happened and then get stopped. Like this guy where he's like, I'm trying to be a good person in this. That's the problem. That's one of the biggest issues is like there are other people like Asians. You don't see them committing very many crimes in America, but their parents are like, you know, brown and whatever, but to not only not get the kids from doing it, but then basically stopping anyone else from saying or thinking anything about it is just such a bad strategy. And like being honest about it is the nicest thing. And this guy, you know he could be on this podcast and he'd just be cooking. Yeah. Yeah. Bro, my point is is that we have this segment of the black community who does this to teachers, they do this to cops, they do this to the court. And then they wonder why their kids are so fucked up. Like bro, you got to let your kids face accountability. It's not always a race issue. It is do you want your kids to grow up and be well adjusted human beings or do you want them to grow up thinking that they can do, say, behave any way that they want without repercussions, which isn't reality. So if you train a kid, because that's what we're doing when we raise a kid, we're training them. When you train a kid to grow up with no accountability whatsoever. And then they go out in the real world, they might not even realize that what they're doing is that big of a deal. Right. Because they've been doing it all the right. Correct. And like dude, this is, this is, it's fucked up man. And like dude, just speak like an Italian family. Yeah. They're fucking, everybody takes term beating your ass. You know what I'm saying? Like, that's what it is. Right. Probably that way in Bosnia too, huh? Yeah. When the riots happened, I mean, and it was a lot of people because it was mostly liberals. And in general, like, you know, I would say like the races were mixed in the riots. It wasn't just all black Americans. But like, I'm thinking like, that's the tie store that I know the family that has like $10 fired like specials. Like that's my coffee shop. Like what the fuck are you people doing? Like you're so stupid. Like this is our neighborhood. Yeah. You guys are just throwing a fit. And the crazy part about that was they just opened yesterday from all the lockdowns. Like, I'm conspiratorial about that. It's like the day they opened. It's like, oh, there's a riot. Like bro, are you guys, it's just crazy. That people would do. I'm just like watching things burn. And I'm like, yo, that guy's fucked. That, that a great guy probably works so hard for 50 years in these. And then he works so hard the last three years to get it back. Bro, we need, we need men in these communities to stand up and lead. That's the problem. They're not standing up to lead because they're afraid they're going to fucking get backlash from their own community. And while you might, eventually those people are going to understand why you're right. And we need more men across all races, across all fucking identities. American men, whether they're black, white, whatever, it doesn't matter. Asian, Latina, I don't fucking give a shit. American men need to stand the fuck up and start speaking the truth about what's right. And not being afraid of the backlash, not being afraid of what names you might be called, not being afraid of, you know, somebody on the internet might say fuck, fuck all that shit. Bro, we're going to lose our country because we're losing our fucking kids because we're not holding them in teaching them the realities of how to operate in society. And dude, it's, it bothers me. It doesn't, like I don't look at this and say, oh, that's, you know, black people. I look at that and say that's fucking American culture, man. Yeah. I mean, that guy, like he's, yeah, because they're, of course in every neighborhood, it's like you have thousands, tens of thousands of great people. And when people are like, oh, that's normal. It's like, I know the kid that's like going to school. Like, that's not good for him. It's not good for his mom. Like that guy's like, let's, let's get it right. And they're like, fuck off. Yeah. I wanted to say real quick, I was thinking before I just wanted to see what you think about it. Where like COVID, it lasted from 2020, really almost like 2022, 2023. And I know it's a TikTok generation where people are just like onto the next thing. Oh, Trump got session. Oh, Commala, whatever. But I'm like, no one's even talking about it when they're running. And it's like they lock down. They printed all the money that caused the inflation. That's the number one topic. And you rarely hear Trump talk about it. You never hear Commala talk about it because he has nothing to say. I'm like, how crazy is our generation that they, like they don't even give a shit. That they're locked down for three years. Well, in this election cycle. And that's like, and when I say that even like, a server is like, bro, it's not important. I'm like, kind of is. I think it's like, I actually think it's the most important thing that's happened in our entire lives. It's the craziest. And all the inflation that JD Vance talks about and Commala talks about and they're all stems from that. For sure. And like, no, and the fact that like when I'm like, but that's not going to win them in the election. So they have to say what people want. But I just can't fathom that it was literally two years. Like I remember two years ago, they still had stuff locked down. And they're basically acting like it's not even a top 20 issue. Well, I think, I think the reason it's being avoided is because there's culpability on all parts of that. For sure. That's definitely it. Yeah. So I mean, you know, I think Trump could really boost his ratings by saying, yeah, I got a fool. And, and you know, these guys fucking did this and this and this is what really happened. But you know, he's not doing that. He's, I haven't heard him say anything about the vaccine in a while. Even if he doesn't apologize, what if he just said like they locked you down longer. They did more like they locked you in your house. Yeah. Like, I would say like say you live in a inner city. It's like these are the people suffering. Not people with farms and Arnold Schwarzenegger and a hot tub. Like I've been to, you know, Brooklyn Manhattan. And like there's nowhere to go. Like in these neighborhoods and you're locking these people in for two years. Is that not a message that resonates with people? I don't know, but it's, it's a lot of talks about that. She where I'm like, no one even thinks about it. Like they like, like New York lockdown for two years. Like DeSantis open, like she opened, we are party open. They lock down. They don't even think of that. I don't know. I don't know if people wouldn't respond to it or they just don't want to talk about it for a bit. Yeah. I think it does them no benefit to talk about it because they were responsible for different parts of it. I think it was crimes against humanity. And if it ends up being crimes against humanity, it could be severe accountability for these people. And I also think that the reason they don't talk about it is because it leaves open the option to be totalitarian with our control measures. So like if Trump, this is a concern I have about Trump, like just being honest. One of the concerns I have is like, bro, you haven't addressed what the fuck you were a part of in some way, shape or form. I don't like that. Right. And that doesn't make me feel good about Trump. Like I'm voting for Trump too. Not only because when I vote, the things that matter to me are economy, crime, the things that affect us on a daily basis. And when we think about like what happened with COVID, that was crimes against humanity dude. It's all we covered for the whole fucking time. I mean, I had every expert on the fucking show. We talked about all of it. We were right about everything. And you know, I don't. I think that it's being avoided in case it's in case it's to be used again. Right. Right. Yeah. That makes me nervous dude. It's just crap. I'm like, I couldn't think of like an alternate reality where I'm like, no, we're not going to mention that. Yeah. I know. But yeah, I think it's the accountability thing. And even with inflation, I'm voting for Trump. I think he's better for all these things. I think he's better on crime, even economy. But it's like they can't say that. Like if JD Vance is going off and he's like, you know, we printed trillions of dollars during COVID and we fucked ourselves for seven years. Democrats did worse, but we also had like a part of it to some extent. Like that's not a good, that's not like, common is the reason your guess. And they did that to Trump in 2020 where Trump's killing people with COVID and Joe Biden. Like what the fuck is Joe Biden going to do for your health? Like he's going to get and it's just going to disappear. Like, but people believe that because they're like, this is bad. Trump's here. So it's bad. So they're doing that with Kamala. Yeah. Like they're here. Inflations through the roof. Yeah. You know, but also kind of you guys fucked us with COVID. 100% they did, dude. And like another thing to think about too, bro, that no one talks about is, you know, today there was an article online about all these restaurants closing all their locations. Like iconic places that have been around for a long time. I think like I have closed hundreds of locations. All country buffet closed all. Fudruckers closed all. Like there's a bunch of restaurants changed. It was this big thing I saw. And, you know, I'm speaking for myself, but I think, you know, COVID had behavioral implications on how people actually behaved in real life that we're seeing now. You know, they're not going out as much. They're not going to dinner as much. Right. They're not leaving the house as much. And when you think about how that how so like when you're thinking and breaking down, like why why would they do that? I always try to think, okay, what purpose does that serve? Right. Well, it does serve a purpose of all the big tech companies. And all the companies who want you to sit at home and they want you to be fat and they want you to be sick and they want you to consume their data and they want you to eat their shitty food. Like we have to understand that there are this play was run not just for the election, but for long term behavior, behavior, uh, acclimation amongst the population. And it worked. Bro, I don't go to fucking dinner anymore. I don't go out and I, I, I keep to myself. And like dude, it really taught me and I, I, I hate that I'm saying this, but like it really made me not like people because like do when you go out in public and people fucking like, yeah, that's you. Yeah, like who the fuck do you think you're talking to bro? I'll knock your mother fucking teeth out. Right. You know what I'm saying? Like we had all these fucking weak sick people who've never had any power in their entire life screaming at people. Right. And public like it was insane. Everybody talks about the vaccine because it's like the obvious thing they put out, but like let's talk about mental, psychological, financial. Like these are the things that people don't talk about, but psych psychologically, of course it like it ushered in like you're already, you know, don't go to work, stay at home, weakening people to like not like. And once you spend a year or two not going out, you naturally just like become more anti social for multiple reasons. One, people treating like shit, but also it's like if I stayed in for six months, I'd be in shitty shape and my mental health would be bad. Two years, it's everyone's mental health is bad. It's impossible. Yeah. Yeah, it's that that's the crazy part about them not talking about it to. I feel like politicians that that's part of the issue. Like when I talk about Trump, people say like, Oh, you're just hating on this or that. He's a culture leader. So when he says stuff, you go with it. And he's right about a lot of stuff, which is important, but that's part of the thing. They make this too little fight. And it's like they're leaving out the biggest thing that they fucked over humanity with over the last three years. And it almost seems perversal. So it's not not telling people not to vote, but talk about these things because that's part of even like a RFK. I'm not going to vote for him, but he talks about glyphosate and it's like, you know, they're spraying our stuff with shit and no one gives a fuck. Yeah. Like at least he cares, but you know, it's like that injecting it into the conversation is important and not just like being like, look at she laughs funny. It's like for sure. And Biden's old as fuck and he's probably shooting his pants, but also this other stuff. So that's like it. It's hard for people that they've been trained to be like, if you say this, you're this and it's like, no, that's right. I totally agree, bro. Well, guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think, man, what that being said. I think we all agree. Yes, thumbs down. Thumbs down. First share. That's disgraceful. It's Detroit. Yeah. Senator Guantanamo Bay. No, and all of that. All of that shares and liberals that are behind you now. What you in for sleeping. That guy needs a, I hope he gets like some, some love. You know, like some friends, right now, right now, get him a show. Yeah. He come down here and be on the show. Yeah. What's his name, Judge? What? Kind of King. Judge King. Oh, that's my awful name. Yeah. God, I was like, I got you, bro. Yeah, dingling. Yeah, shit. Man, you're dope. Guys, Andy, AJ, that's all I got, man. AJ, thanks so much for coming out, bro. It's always a pleasure to see you and I should. Let's do a live or something, man. Whenever. Yeah, DJ and I are going to start a live stream. So we'll do yours and vice versa anytime. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Thank you so much for, for contributing to the show. Guys, we appreciate you. We love you. Don't forget to share the show and don't be a hoe. Share the show. Don't be a hoe or the F word that I can't say. Don't be a fat guy. Never sleep on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck a boat. Fuck a stove. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch. Booty swole. Got a own bank road. Cankful. Doesn't know. Hit shot. Case closed.
