I absolutely love it. So let's dive into this a little bit A mother in Pittsburgh is furious after her 17 year old daughter was pulled out of class and Told to register to vote without her consent to make matters worse The school's staff allegedly pushed a blatant political agenda Suggesting that quote if Donald Trump was elected black people would be doomed and a now viral Tick-tock video K Montana shared the distressing experience her daughter Nilo went through claiming quote Pittsburgh public schools Not only registered her to vote without a permission But was also subjected to political indoctrination quote my 17 year old daughter was pulled out of class and told she needed to register to vote Not only was she told how to register She was told who she should vote for K said in her Viral video another clips is like six almost seven minutes long, so we won't watch the whole thing. So let's check this clip out Cuz I'm pissed right now, okay, so yesterday you pulled my daughter out of class and you told her that it was mandatory for her to vote No, I didn't say it was mandatory. So that's what she told me these are her words that she said it was mandatory that she votes No, man, but go ahead finish it on Okay, and that you projected her fears and insecurities on her Telling her if Donald Trump was elected black people would be doomed. Oh, no, man. No, man. So let me say this. I am a Minority Inspector, okay for 1016 and you know as a minority inspector You never ever ever discuss politics or your beliefs or anything So can we call my daughter down here because at this point you're making it like she's a complete liar my daughter have never Told me someone said anything such to her like no, man So this is what happened we were I did call her down to raise her to vote because we're registering all the 18 year olds to vote She's not 18. She's 17. Yeah, but she turns 18 before their life Yeah, but I could have took my daughter to register her to vote I did not ask for y'all to register my daughter to vote I have not even spoke to her about the election yet and I am not a Harris supporter. I am a Trump supporter Yes, so for you to tell her anything and it's like now they're saying she's lying So now I want her to come down here Listen, I'm not saying your daughter's lying what I'm saying is is that I did call her into my office I did raise to her to vote. We did have a conversation about it. She did ask me about Trump She did ask me about Harris So we started a conversation about you know what's going on? I wasn't projecting two seconds ago. I was just she said As a minority inspector we're not allowed to ever ever ever ever talk about our beliefs and politics But then am I the only one that heard that I heard that okay, yeah continue She also don't want to call their daughter down down. No, because she's she's not totally lying She's lying bro. She's caught And projecting anything on her I was just talking about things that are going on in the world Yeah, did you tell her about the border being unsecured? So did you tell her about all the illegal criminals that's in this country right now? So we did have a conversation about the border and we did talk about the border policies and all of that We did have a conversation about everything So let me just say this I apologize to you for offending you because that was not my intentions I was not trying to project any of my political beliefs on your daughter or anything like that That's why I don't know why the conversation was head with consent forms that I said Said I was okay with my daughter being registered to vote in school She's still 17 years old. So what could set forms were signed for that none Because there really isn't any you know, we we just raised her students to vote here at every high school They're raised in students but she's still not 18 She haven't told the 21st of October I believe So register and her birthday is on the 5th right? So we are permitted to raise their all students whose birthday is but that happens by the 5th because that's the date of the election Completely fucking line and mom even submitted Some screenshots of the text messages going back and forth with her daughter Nila Where her daughter sent her saying quote the made me register to vote today I didn't want it but they forced me I said I'll do it another time But then she told me I had no choice which I think is a lie. I'm not even 18 yet To which the mom replied who made you and what party did you choose? It was a she and Democrat Quote did they tell you to pick that and who was the lady? I forgot her name. I found out tomorrow and yeah, basically she kept saying how it'll be bad if I picked Trump because of what he was doing to the Mexicans and stuff I wasn't really paying her no mind. Where was this lady at your school where yes my school She pulled me out of class to register I asked to do it another time and she said I really couldn't um Yeah, and they go on and says Uh the mom says quote I'm pissed she had no right to fill your head up with lies and choose what party you are registering for I am your mother and I will talk to you about what you won't even be 18 until the 5th She yeah, she was definitely telling me all this bad stuff about Trump saying us blacks are doomed And gonna be done if they let Trump back in and I'm like man, please and I know that That's what I said she said I ain't had no choice but to do it at the time Um to which the mom finally replied I'm calling up there tomorrow This is total disrespect if we vote comelo we are doomed. She really tried to fill your head with lies I fucking love this yeah It's weird that any School administrator would do that right like I mean they've only been indoctrinating kids since they were Three Telling white kids that they're evil for being white telling black kids they have no chance because they're black And these systematic racism and then you have a white principal or whatever this lady is telling a minority inspector Who's a white is that white minority inspector who's telling a black family that if you don't vote for For Kamala you're doomed What does that sound like to you? It sounds kind of racist just a little bit you can't think for yourself So you better listen to me because I know dude and it's crazy because like I mean, you know, I remember in middle school You know, they had this thing every year during the elections and shit It was like kids vote or whatever like they did like mock elections You know, they showed you how to vote and like set up you know fake ballots and shit like that like I remember that But like even I remember like even then you know, it's just like the regular election with fake ballots and shit exactly But like even then like I teach you like yeah, man, you got your vote Democrat. It was always indoctrinating Yeah, of course, you know, I'm saying but like you're making this 17 year old go through some legal shit that like you have no right to do You know at the end of there like that's the parents choice man, and I plot this mother That thing she's fucking oh yeah, dude she's gonna you way more that and I feel like this is actually like happening a lot more than people are Aware of if you watch the whole clip at the end she's like I'm calling the news. Yeah, she's like okay Like dude, there's fucked up man. Man, this has happened in every day. This is happening in every school This has been happening in every school since these kids were old enough to comprehend and understand and communicate They've been told and not just black kids white kids too. They've been told you vote Democrat if you vote anything but Democrat You're a racist, okay, and that's what they tell these kids they tell the white kids that they tell the black kids If you don't vote Democrat you're trading your own race in right and you know they we we have grown adults Literally social pressuring little kids to feel a certain way about life That is based on the adults perspective and not based on the children's own thoughts or critical thinking or perspective Or the family's perspective and this is what's been going on for years So I mean, it's not just surprising to me. It's I'm glad she got this on camera But guys this happens every day and you know that it's happened in your kids school too It happened to you guys if you look back and remember You know how they do this the schools today are not about education They're not about teaching how to think are there good teachers? Sure But those good teachers are few and far between compared to the people who think that being a teacher makes you an activist for a certain political cause or party and we're supposed to teach our kids How to do math how to operate in life how to be able to run finances which we don't teach very very much at all read right basically yeah how to function as a high performing Person in society and we don't do that we teach them how to be robots We teach them how to be dependent we teach them not how to think but what to think and you know This is why when Trump says the Department of Education needs to be reworked and and disbanded and rebuilt I agree with him. Yeah, Brahman. I'm gonna see if I can sign up for uh to be a a majority Inspector. Yeah, and I'm gonna go to these schools until a little white kids and they got to vote for Trump or they're doing Look her Billy. Yeah Dude, it's just it's insane dude. It's insane that these people Think that they have more say over people's children than the people have themselves We see this happening with the gender ideology. We see this happening with politics We see this happening with all sorts of social initiatives And it's not okay. All right. It's not okay. It's not okay for grown adults to manipulate little children into being what they want them to be This is why people get so pissed off about all this shit that's going on with the gender ideology and the books that are being removed You know, I see a lot of leftist complaining or saying the right wing is just like Hitler. They're removing books Do you know what books they're removing? Which ones are they doing it? Yeah, they're removing the books that are legitimately Way out of line for any small child to be reading or have read to them These are books about sexual situations and Look, man kids aren't supposed to be groomed in that manner They're not supposed to be taught these things when they're little kids and these people are forcing these adult issues on these little kids and essentially um You know, not just indoctrinating them, but but stealing their childhood You know like like the innocence of being a child man like when I was a kid Where I ride my bike. I'm outside playing GI Joe and fucking baseball and shit. I'm not worried about sexuality and gender shit and now we have these grown teachers who are clearly mentally ill pushing their own Ideology their social ideology their their gender ideology on the little bitty children little bitty kids That's not appropriate. What's the difference is like and I'm sure you know Andy when you were a little kid you running around you may have found and stumbled upon a playboy magazine or something That's at home though and like you were able to you know, I'm saying your dad caught you why I'm caught you Like you were able to handle that there that they what you want family issue He wasn't being given fucking these fucking magazines and shit in school. Yeah, by a fucking teacher Yeah, that's a difference or little animated playboys, which is what the fuck these books off what they are Yeah, and they are animated because they have illustrations of this yeah You know bro listen 10 years ago these people would be putting jail for child pornography You know and you know, it's it's insane. I don't see the difference. I don't either I don't see you know, and I think people are getting pissed and it's not just a certain group of people that are getting pissed These teachers are way out over their skis. They're out of fucking control Like I said are there great teachers? Sure, but there is a big group of teachers who are way out of control with what they believe About the children and their responsibility of what they're teaching to the children and When we look at these teachers, we have to realize that these teachers are Communists. They are communist teachers communist ideology has infiltrated our schools to the point where a whole bunch of Programs are now Considered normal in our schools, which are highly abnormal. All right Um, yeah, this is crazy. Yeah, it's fucking nuts. Do you know how to this mom and they need to change that fucking position Minority inspector. You're inspecting minorities. That sounds racist as fuck bro. Come on She takes it as a listen bad to mom. I'm the minority inspector the term Minority slash majority is just a divisive term anyway, right? We should be referring to each other As Americans we are Americans. It doesn't matter if there's This many white people or this many black people or this many Asian people who gives a fuck You're fucking American dude. That's the whole point You know, it's crazy guys jump out of this conversation Let's know what you guys think down in the comments Oh, that being said, man, let's get to our headlines. Got a lot of shit out here today, man. Really like I got a lot Let's dive into it headline number one guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to Andy for seller calm you can find them link there headline number one Top secret service agent in Pittsburgh says he was kept in dark on credible threat ahead of Butler rally There is still a lot of fucking updates coming out of this and I think it's important to cover it because I mean it just kind of solidifies our thoughts and theories that are out there. Yeah, it's being memory hole by most of the news Most of the news. Yeah, most of the news So the the secret service special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office was not informed of credible threats The former president trump ahead of his July 13th outdoor rally in Butler Pennsylvania and detailed in handwritten notes They didn't learn about the threats until after the assassination attempt when they saw it on television In a preliminary report on the July 13th assassination attempt on Trump released on Wednesday by the homeland security and governmental Affairs committee top senators listed several key failures of the secret service quote Why am I hearing that there were threats to the site on TV uh the special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office wrote in a handwritten note after the attempt Quote how can the special agent in charge of our field office not know about any threats And why did they feel that only one part of special operations divisions was sufficient to cover it instead of the entire package The note continued now. What is he talking about? We're talking about this the fact that this hell I'm reads lead secret service agent and trump's Butler rally knew of credible intelligence of threat, but didn't raise alarm The lead agent at the rally knew there was a credible threat on trump's life that day And said nothing about it Said nothing about it Not only did he not inform the special agent in charge. He didn't inform the other key position decision-makers in the details and they're not releasing this person's name This guy who knew the credible information they're not releasing his name. I saying anything about it And to my knowledge at the time of this recording has not been fired or any disciplinary action Right and in fact, they're all just jumbling around responsibility Um, it's pretty interesting Interesting Despite the damning findings the lead agent and 11 other members of the secret service Interviewed by investigators refused to accept responsibility for any of the numerous security failures identified in the report Um, now on to the second attempt assassination. Um, there's new updates in that Judge ilean cannon to preside over trial of Ryan Roth and attempted assassination of trump case Um, so the same judge you threw out the bullshit case with the classified docs and all of that stuff from florida. Yeah, she's overseeing this trial florida judge ilean cannon a trump appointee who presided over the Biden Harris DOJ's prosecution of Donald trump in the classified documents case Will preside over the trial of Ryan Roth who is now charged with attempted assassination So previously there was just two charges. They've now added on the attempted assassination charge Which is great to hear So that's another update um another news going on with our leaders of the world. Um, do you see Biden go on the view No, but before we get into this i got to say something about this so The special agent in charge was not informed by the lead agent on site right that there was a credible threat Right, all right now. We've been talking about this since obviously it happened over and over and over again Now we've both agreed and a lot of other people agree with us that someone Had to have allowed this to happen both times both at butler and at trump international So it's interesting to me that this person has not been named has not been disciplined and to our knowledge has not been removed for many sort of duties Why if we were connecting the dots and speculating on why that would be what would the only logical conclusion be that they didn't remove this person haven't named this person And haven't taken any disciplinary action on this person because they want third time to be the charge They are allowing it to happen. This is the gatekeeper and this is speculation but By all accounts and the evidence is shown For what i see this is their person who's allowing this to happen multiple times And they don't want to get the person out there the name out there the the whatever So that's just my take on what it looks like what's it look like to you? I mean that's exactly what it looks like to me I mean we have events all the time right everyone your security This would be the exact equivalent to one of our guys on our team Knowing something's about to happen either seeing a guy on a roof or knowing that you know There's a potential for some type of action Knowing that and keeping this fucking mouth. I say shit to you not to say anything to me And I have the power to either change shit let you know a we're canceling we're gonna move we're gonna do something And not telling me fucking anything. Yeah, I'm gonna beat that guy's ass. Yeah, well first at least yeah right and but like There's no way he's staying on there's no fucking way. Yeah, you're a threat. Mm-hmm. You are a threat See something you say something that's our fucking rule well right like I have a hard time. You think that's not their rule too. Well, I have a hard time believing that that this isn't like At this point We know it's intentional and I say that like and listen we get we know great guys in the secret service I know great fucking agents great guys This is nothing against them right because they're great guys But there is a fucking problem. There's a mole or a leak. There's a traitor there There's a problem and and those good guys Those that I know or don't know you guys need to be speaking up man and pushing this shit out Because until it like bro, it's gonna it's going to cause so much more damage And I think people are even aware of yeah, and and and god forbid you know like A third time is the fucking charm It won't be good for this country bro. It won't be good. Nothing good's gonna come out of it Nothing's gonna come out And so that's interesting but like even with that though We talk all the time like how these people on the left they push this shit right like they it's like they want this to happen Of course they do of course they do and they have no problem going on TV on Twitter I'm going and in these interviews and continuing to push this shit Continuing to push it and that's exactly what happened today um By the alleged sitting president um by the one on the view man I mean went on the view with Wolpy and you know all of those other brunchers and um He was asked a couple of softball questions, you know, they tried to cover the you know him being forced out of the uh of the election The question was asked by Alyssa Faris. She said quote Did you feel that your hand was forced and what is your relationship with speaker Pelosi now? Um because they were talking about how speaker Pelosi allegedly had some involvement in Biden step on the side Um, he said quote my relationship is fine. Look. I I'd never fully believe the assertions that somehow there was this overwhelming reluctance to my running again I didn't sense that Biden finally said quote and although the polling they said Biden polling was different The fact of the matter is my polling was about where you know about Always within range of beating this guy the president at it There were some folks who would like to see me step aside so they had Uh chance to move on I get that that's just human nature But that wasn't the reason that I stepped down I stepped down because I started thinking about you know, it's hard to think of I know you're only 30 but it's hard to think of it's hard for me to even say how old I am It's like holy god that can't be right Um, so he's blaming it on you know, it's just his age and he had to step around for somebody younger But we all know that's not true. He showed us off He couldn't fucking put a sentence together during the presidential debate with Donald Trump That's really what it was Uh, but then it got to this threat part Watch this clip Then he just wouldn't go he was like a bug He just kept being there. He was like a like a bug right there So you felt Oh Will be go bird is calling Donald Trump a bug and saying he's like a little fly buzzing around the Donald Trump I mean Joe Biden slapped his hand on the fucking table as if he's like squashing the bug They have no problem doing this show But if you do it you go on a list be a problem. That's right be a fucking problem That wasn't just Biden even his own comments secretary calls on Democrats supporters to deal with Trump quote Let's extinguish him for good You know, I remember that bloodbath comment that Trump made about the economy Yeah, and how they you know took that and fucking ran with yeah, but you literally have people saying Oh, it's gonna get worse. Let's extinguish him for good. It's gonna work. It's gonna get worse These people are desperate. They know there's no accountability for them They don't get punished. They don't get drugged through the media Nothing happens to them when they say anything Anybody who's on the other side says two fucking things and you're on some sort of watch list and you're all over to fucking news And blah blah blah, but these people get total immunity to hate With impunity at whatever they decide they want to hate You know and dude that's wrong and the people should stand up against that and the next time you guys see someone who is on the Middle to the right side getting destroyed. You should all stand up and speak up for them Let's check this out. He says is the opposite. It's just another lie like how did we get here? Let's extinguish him for good We haven't answered we have a remarkably talented candidate who is sincere who's pragmatic who's open Let's just get it done and next Who what candidate is she watching these people are total liars dude their complete liars You have Kamala Harris who was just endorsed by Dick Cheney the biggest warmonger that's ever existed in the United States She was also endorsed by every Hollywood actor with the exact same line of endorsement She was endorsed by The IRS, you know, and I don't know about you, but you know When the IRS came out and endorsed right that's that pretty much got me dude like I'm definitely switching my vote You know, I'm saying I'm a vote for her like do we got all these people we got we got this ditty shit and people keep saying Oh, this ditty shit's a distraction no dude. It's all intertwined. It's all intertwined to their their sphere of influence Okay, we got all these things happening at once and they're all related. They're not unrelated and um You know, fuck dude, you know people They're delusional bro if you need any more reason, you know, this also comes out today Walls blasted for huddling with George Soros's son at New York City luxury apartment billionaire nepo baby Yeah, so Tim Walls Vice presidential candidate was blasted on social media this week for visiting the upscale men had an apartment of Alex Soros The son of billionaire liberal mega donor George Soros even posted it on Twitter Alex Soros dig saying quote on it to host governor at Tim Walls at my home in New York City With a few various pictures of them Being there to which he was destroyed in the comments both of them I'm saying that like this one person said if this doesn't convince you to vote for Trump I don't know what else will Another person wrote with respect probably not helpful for you to to put yourself in the story like this um How many tampons did Tim Walls offer you Alex Soros and more importantly? How many did you use? I think it's also to the step of approval you guys own him now and You guys can go find out who you guys are on your own.

We'll save you save you some embarrassment This is a great story to talk about. This is a great headline great topic right here headline number two Stay with me guys. I headline number two reads Biden Harris DOJ sues visa over alleged debit card monopoly Okay, interesting right? Stiving to this a little bit um little uh Financial news for you guys uh the Department of Justice Announce Tuesday that it has filed a lawsuit against visa alleging that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the US debit card market Fox business reported the DOJ alleged that more than 60% of debit card transactions are processed by visa which charges over seven billion dollars and fees for processing transactions the DOJ also claimed visa was able to monopolize these transactions by illegally tamping down the competition The DOJ pointed to how visa insists upon exclusive arrangements with merchants and banks While it quote Insulates itself from competition and smothers smaller lower priced competitors quote We alleged that visa has unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market attorney general Merrick garland said in a statement quote merchants and banks pass along these costs to consumers either by raising prices Or reducing quality or service as a result VISA's unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing But the price of nearly everything The DOJ's lawsuit alleged that visa quote induces would be competitors to become partners instead of entering the market as competitors By offering generous monetary incentives and threatening putative additional fees And set the company engages in a quote deliberate and reinforcing course of conduct to cut off competition and prevent rivals from gaining the scale share And data necessary to compete for customers Um now you have that okay Cool now do social media companies Cool yeah, all right, but like DJ like how is this news what's the news here? All right, what's juicy? Read this habit. Oh, go ahead. I was gonna guess. I bet it has something to do with them not getting the cut Of some sort Okay, maybe I'm wrong probably not though read this headline I Nancy Pelosi's husband dumps over 500 K and VISA stock weeks Before DOJ's antitrust lawsuit Hmm That sounds like a little bit of insider trading to me. It's almost like he knew it was coming almost She's the best stock picker in the world So she steals you're still fucked up from the hammer stuff dude. They steal your money Then they invest their money Then they know the details of when the things are gonna happen so they never lose with your money But you're you don't you don't privy to any of that information nope We know how to invest your money better than you clearly. Well, these people man. Ignis here. So Nancy's Pelosi Uh, Nancy Pelosi's husband paul Pelosi Uh dumped over five hundred thousand dollars worth of VISA stock just weeks before The Department of Justice slapped the financial giant with an antitrust lawsuit according to the New York Post The timing couldn't be more suspect VISA one of the most dominant players in the debit card market is now facing charges of monopolizing the industry Um, we just covered that Um, but if you go to Twitter Um, did you know Nancy Pelosi has a stock tracker like there is the group of guys that put that to get it Fucking amazing. Yeah, it's amazing Um, and they they they posted this today It says the DOJ plans to open up a lawsuit against VISA saying they illegally monopolize the US debit card market Paul Pelosi Sold one million dollars not even just five. It was one million dollars of VISA Um, just two months ago. It's wild now they reached out to Nancy Pelosi's office. What do you think she said Something stupid Nancy Pelosi's office of course was quick to deny any wrongdoing her spokesperson claim that Pelosi has no involvement in any stock transactions Quote speaker Pelosi does not own any stocks and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions Congresswoman spokesperson told the post, but that's not the only time like I mean this It's not this can I mean maybe this was a command. We know this no we know this is BS. We know this is insider trading They won't they have Look if it doesn't matter if they lie why wouldn't they lie If it doesn't matter if they lie why don't like you we all say oh man It's crazy. They're lying Well, if there's no repercussions and no accountability what differences and make if they lie or not no shit They're lying. We all know they're lying everybody in the world knows they're lying But nobody's doing anything about it right so they continue to do it if you could steal To hundreds of millions of dollars and just say ah I didn't do it and you knew you were gonna get away with it Yeah, you know it then she said you do it. She should do it I'd not have sexual relations with that woman. How does anybody think any different bro? How does anybody think any different Like what do we what do we do use your logic minds? Bro, there's just a simple fact that they're returned and their dividends and shit like they're they're fucking the the Their their return on investment when you look at the numbers They are almost quadruple that are they normal stock portfolio you can't achieve that without knowing what the fuck is happening Yeah, and nobody's doing anything like you did it just in fucking December Would you stop if nobody did anything to stop you? All right, why why you're making all this money? Don't don't don't fix if it ain't broken. Yeah, what do they say? But yet they over-regulate and over-tax every legitimate business in the country $600 if you spend you know send somebody on Vemmo a cash. That's right. They're tracking your transfers on PayPal over $600 but these people can lose trillions of dollars off the balance sheet for the Pentagon they can You know trade any stocks they want make as much money as they want every single time they get called out All they do is say this shit. Oh speaker Pelosi denies any wrongdoing and that's that So until there's accountability and until there's enough people that are pissed off Nothing's gonna happen. Bro. Bro. He just did this shit in December too. I didn't even do it for 30 40 years dude 20,000 shares of Google a month before the DOJ filed their anti-trust lawsuit against Google In 2022 he exercised one million there was somewhere around one to five million dollars Again with Google the alphabet on call options um in that same year he also sold all of his Nvidia stock one day before Congress was set to vote on the bill That would boost domestic production and cancel those kind like there's plenty of evidence There's no I didn't know that Nvidia was canceling their fucking you know, I'm saying like I didn't know that we didn't know that But these people sit on these fucking committees. They know this stuff My my here's my suggestion to fix this I say we get all of these fucking people anybody that has any stocks I said how many of these committees and they have those stocks in those committees it overseas that shit Take all of that fucking money. Let's what do they say? Divide the wealth. What do they say? Right? Yeah, let's do that there Because these motherfuckers are redistribution of wealth. Let's restart with them. Let's do it. And then on top of it You know when we look at these things and we consider what's actually happening Did you see the video that I posted on my Instagram? Of that family in Ohio who was very poor And they were talking about how the migrants had $30,000 on their ebt cards so that yeah It's wild everybody should be paying attention. What's happening here? Wild bro It's wild but yeah, no, no and then you know on top of that. Yeah, that's that let's aim a Trump You know, I'm saying you know, he's going back to court right now for that uh Civil fraud case they have where he's almost at half a billion dollars Let's let's let's definitely beat up on him, but you know nothing would paint a Pelosi or anything. That's fine Yeah, guys, Japanese people should man Everybody knows what's going on. I've been talking about it for four years this these people need to be held accountable Legitimately they laugh at our fucking faces dude. They laugh in our fucking faces About how much money they steal from us what they do with it. We're just dumb little plebs They got all these working class people barely being able to survive while they're building yachts and disassembling bridges To move the yachts through like all of these people It's wrong. It's just wrong dude It's criminal and it's wrong. What's happening? Each and they think it's okay, dude And then they tell these people the working class people that people like me who create the jobs and employ people and sponsor You know all the literally games and the teams and do all the shit in the community that were the devil were the bad guy We're the reason that the working class can't get ahead and these people are fucking legit just stealing the money Just stealing the money and then investing it going into office word nothing coming out worth hundreds of millions of dollars And people are still they believe anything these people say it's absurd. It's absurd Yeah, guys jumping on this conversation.

I mean there is a Costco right down the street. I think americans buy in bulk as we know Oh I begin my money back bro We continue saying quote and you know these are consensual adults doing what consensual adults do you know We can't get so puritanical in this country to think that somehow sex is a bad thing because if it was there would be no more people In other news this is the best bro his gazillion dollar an hour attorney can come up with listen, so I'm gonna you want to do you have about you're gonna jail for About ever not a thousand years.

Yeah, did you notice like uh? You know how The the the it's always that way you know the people who the people uh There's a lot here anyway. Yeah continue and other news Um, did you see uh Sean diddy combs was moved into the same jail housing unit as sandbankman freed You Think they're gonna do business together little Shaw shank redemption. Yeah Yeah, uh, Sean diddy combs who was arrested last week on allegations of sex trafficking and racketeering is being housed in the same living space Of a federal attention center in Brooklyn as disgraced former crypto exec Sam bankman freed uh three sources familiar with the matter till them Be seen New York combs and sbf as fried uh as free is currently commonly known Are both being held at the met metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn Now the sources described the unit as a barrack style area Currently housing about 18 to 20 inmates. These inmates range from high profile defendants like combs Uh to cooperators inmates who may require special protection the area is separate from the overall general population unit But it's commonly shared living space um sources tell NBC New York now While they're getting their Shaw shank redemption on um, there was a very interesting interview that came out um Uh, yesterday actually um chug night Starts it's all have you seen this no this shit is wild okay, so chug night Calls out jazzy dr.

Let's just watch the clip check this out Okay, look at it like this I look at real plan of something They know they know lucid blue Back to them But right now I don't care if it's The eye I don't care this with rolls. I don't care if it's j i don't care if it's snoop. I don't care if it's game I don't care if it's drake Nobody stepping up On the fact that Do no what's going on nobody's defending him you're right guy the inoscope you're right Nobody is defending him, but that's why I was interested in hearing your perspective. Okay Okay, you have a guy named tubby. He used to work for inoscope His guy job was to bring Thunder a's girls and girls and have six But then poise in rather honest To the point where kids playing That caught up with the same thing. Why they ready Puppy house and six chapters Hey, Rayton. He's brainhouse the six you have 60 seconds remaining He never was orange Sure, can you say something can you say on the phone? It's your whole situation Cuz you only got me. You know, okay, it's fine. There I have a corporate back. All right, sure you call back Do you think do you think that did he do so? Do you think did he knows enough That it's a very delicate balance that maybe investigators will want to know these other names and greatly reduce his exposure to criminality to time Versus what people would do to keep him quiet Number one, I've been known him a long time and we were friends. We're not enemies, but we were friends You know, tell me So he's smart enough to work his magic on top of that this man right here Even involved with the FBI Uh, close his career Said he got powerful people One his brothers and started company with drug money president Obama gave him out of prison So it's not like she don't have no moves But I don't I don't think nobody's just chatting out. I don't think he got laid out and let's call the court Die he probably going through a lot of shit right now because you probably go through a lot of withdrawals For the drugs, but the industry Got him on drugs My heart is one of the worst mistakes I could have made or if the detective artist is doing a deal in the scope Well, my heart is to pull up in ballet the road I'm building That get out. They smell like we But they they close know like we But they when they made it to any office people smell like we Those guys for my artists They didn't do cocaine tomorrow Hmm. So once they got on cocaine. What they got on drugs. What they got on alcohol in that's when the weird stuff happened Not think that's what took perfect down that way They were together remember pride david Russell Simmons find her real diamond come on. They're believing alcohol drugs He's come up my just manhood because he was taught that You got us now with that there's also been a bunch of pictures that have been getting released If you guys are watching on YouTube if you guys are audio come check it out I'm a bunch of pictures have been released since all of this is coming out now pictures with him with a very notable figures I mean bro. I don't really put too much Stock into pictures that people like look dude This dude was one of the most mega famous people on the planet So like he takes picture with everybody. So like let's let's at least be Real for sure, okay? Just like Donald Trump's got pictures with Epstein when he was at the fucking club before Trump told on him and got him kicked out of the club Right, all right like we got to be You know unless the pictures are showing Criminal activity, which a lot of them probably do because we haven't seen a lot of them You know, we got to be real about it. That's on it. Yeah, I mean Yeah, I mean, but still that looks like a fucking party. No, it does the only problem is like I mean who are how are these girls? Yeah, you know, because in like allegedly They've recovered thousands of videos. Yeah, no. Hey, I'm not standing up for them. No, I'm just saying like I don't like show me the pudding That's all I'm saying. I'm I'm with you. I don't like that. I don't like that shit, bro I've had that shit happen to me before I don't like that shit. We got to look at the real shit Okay, and I don't care if I fucking hate someone or love someone Like let's see the real shit, bro. Let's know what's really going on. I'm really tired in America of all this Hush-hush top secret You public can't know what's going on type of shit and then we're just supposed to trust these people like in the last story who steal hundreds of millions of dollars from the America people and the media who you clearly weaponizes against people They don't like and we're supposed to just take their word for it now. Do I believe that sandbank for freed is who the fuck they said He is yeah, I do. I also believe that sandbank for free was a young man who was manipulated And to running a money-lawnery scheme for these very same people who are not prosecuting him So do I think puffy is a bad dude. Yeah, I think puffy's probably a pretty bad dude I think when you really dig into it It makes a lot of sense to me that he had both two pop and biggie killed That's my opinion because it made his career when you look at Biggie's first album after he died What was it called it was called life after death? It was one of his biggest albums I think his biggest album is a two-disc set. I know young people don't know about discs Yeah, but it was it am I right or wrong? It had more money more problems on it which was the hottest song for three years in a fucking row every single like Why and by the way, there's a whole bunch of songs on there with Diddy so What benefits did he more does it benefit did he more for notorious b.i.g To continue being a legend or does it benefit did he more to remove him from the equation and make a martyr out of him And then build his own career So when I look at all these things this dude has motive to do all of these things and uh, I think at some point in time This is my opinion I think at some point in time he got caught doing some badass shit some bat maybe those two things And they said hey, that's okay. You're gonna work for us now And this is how we're gonna do this and we're gonna invite these people to these parties and we're gonna get them on tape Or on video and we're going to You know tell them to say these things and do these things when we need them to otherwise They continue to be rich and famous and powerful But when we need you to make a statement about covid or we need you to make a statement about politics So we need you to make statement about Ukraine or black lives matter You're gonna fucking say it or else we're gonna do this and that's what I think is going on here and when you think about like I was talking to one of my uh, really good friends um I know actually I was talking to my dad my dad was like how do they get all these people to say all the same thing And I was explaining him like these little operations and he's like you really think that's what's going on Yeah, that's what's going on. That's why they won't tell you who the Epstein guest list is That's why they're not telling you who's implicated in this you know Why because the people that are busting these people are the people that are on these videos and lists And they need the operation to keep going. Yeah. That's right You know like that's always my question. It's like you know like did it get broke any of these people bro Any of these people who died mysteriously, okay Isaac Kappy Aaron Carter All these celebrities Cory Hayme like all these guys who have been kicked out of Hollywood Mel Gibson They're all saying the same shit and they're all blackball from Hollywood. Why is that if it was total BS Then why are the people talking about this all the sudden being killed in mysterious circumstances? Why why are the people who bring this to the light all the sudden being blackballed out of ever being in a movie or ever being in Hollywood or ever getting a record deal ever again Why? Okay, like that's real things that are happening and You know, I think at this point in time there's a big I don't know if it's the majority But there's a lot of people that understand that we do live in a matrix that is controlled by very powerful people all of the information that we get from the mainstream media and a national level all of the information that we get from major mainstream celebrities all of that shit is propaganda All of it and people are figuring that out and it got so bad that it was built into our movies and it's built into You know every television show and all this ideology and that's when people started rejecting Hollywood and they the the movies You know started to be empty and you know people don't watch these things and like all these flops where they remake these Movies into these you know woke Representations that that you know are supposed to be inclusive people are rejecting it And so what that tells me is that people are getting very wise to all the pieces coming together and you know I think there's plenty more people like this. We just don't know who they are yet And that's my thing like I've always wondered you know like this shit comes out and like This shit has been going on for decades. Mm-hmm. All right. That's a fact This did he empire the allegations against them. These are things that have been happening for decades. Yeah, okay almost 30 years With him so why now that's always been my question and like I feel like there's two there's only two reasons of why This shit gets popped now why he's you know getting these charges now I think the first option is that you know, hey, they just felt like he's ran his course They've done you know, they're kind of just done with them. They don't really they can't really squeeze like all the juices out They they squuzz the orange if that's a word right I think there's a second option to you know, and this was They squuzz they squuzz the orange they squeezed all the juice out the orange there you go Um, but I feel like they squuzzed it. They squuzzed it man They did it um, but I feel like there is a second option to the one and this might be like just the more you know moral High ground I'll try to take but like I mean You know, what if like? It came for the next push that they needed to do and he just wasn't with it like you know He finally met his final straw. He had a glimpse of moral You know enlightenment and it's like I'm not doing it and then now you know, I'm saying like it's like when they when they could be something else Bro, it could be it could be the victims are starting to come out of the woodwork And they're not able to be ignored because there's too many of them. It could be a lot of different things We don't know because we don't get told the truth. Yeah You know, and I understand due process. I understand but like you know, where's that due process like for the American people with the upsteen shit Right, you know what I mean, right? Where's that Yeah, it's it's gonna be the same here Um, well, I know this these guys about to go have a fucking ditty party. Yeah Well, I mean like there's probably worst places he could be that he would be less happy I mean, yeah, he's a brown a bunch of dudes and apparently that's what he's into Uh Even our Kelly's having concerts in prison right now really yeah Like you say what you want about our Kelly his music is all right. He's got some good music Yeah, Shawshank redemption man guys jumping on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down and I do want to know what people think like do you what do you guys think? I mean to me I see it very clear, but maybe I'm not see it right. Yeah, let us know man Let us know guys with that being said. Let's get to our final segment of the show as always We have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where we're bringing a headline and we talk about it It'll get one of those two options This one's a doozy our thumbs up or dumb as fuck hell on reach Inside disastrous Bridgerton ball where guests were met with sad salads and dollar store decorations After forking out two thousand dollars for regal night out So there's a TV show it's an Netflix series called Bridgerton I'm not sure if you're familiar with it. It's not bad actually. I'm gonna watch it all time. It sounds bad Oh, it's not bad. That's a great storyline. They fucked up on season two, but like first season was pretty decent Oh, what It's a good show Let us know down in the comments. Yeah, I fuck with Bridgerton or not. You know, I'm saying it's a good show my far you eat onions. Yeah It's a taste as questionable. It's a show that that anybody who eats onions there tastes in anything else is highly questionable Okay, I don't smell like fuck good fuck out of Bridgerton in that like What's that about? So it's it's like It's set like action commando movie action commando. No, it's like a it's like a crime thriller. No, it's like a horror movie There's I mean, there's some okay, so it's not for you. It's like thriller in there. There's some expense in there really Yep, okay What are they wearing this movie is this like it's it's like, you know like a superior piece. It's a period piece Where like you know big ballgowns and shit. That's what I thought. Yeah, yeah Listen, so do you do your little twinkle toes dances and shit when you're watching this You dance around like when they dance do you dance? I actually Though at my wedding the violinist yeah, the song she played we're off from the Bridgerton. That's how really It's a good show. It's a good show anyways besides a point Love it or hate it go to Detroit These party produce producer producers They pitched this Bridgerton themed party and Let's just dive into this so it was built as a chance to step into the enchanting world of the regency era But Detroit's disastrous Bridgerton theme ball is going down in history for all the wrong reasons Fans who shout out up to $2,000 for the evening of sophistication were left stunned when they were greeted by dollar store decorations disposable plates And a lone violinist instead of a grand orchestra you know what they walked in saying Where's the onions Goable people man, hey, I'd be pissed honestly. Oh The only other entertainment was a scantily clad pole dancer Who revealed she was hired just three hours before the event The The ball. I got some things I could say, but I better not say them I got some things I could say but it gives away words. Okay, it gives away words The ball was such a failure that at least one reveler has reported to the organizers to police And has plans for a class action lawsuit While the venue told Daily Mail.com they would never work with them again Ashlyn Cook claims she has more than 50 fellow angry guests including two with injuries We're looking to sue organizers uncle and me Quote nothing in your ticket you actually got cook explain Because of how poorly executed it was it seems like a scam I feel ripped off and cheated they need to be held accountable She added that previous events run by organizers uncle and me had allegedly gone wrong Leading hurt to believe it was not just an innocent mistake quote it sad It needs to not happen again. This was supposed to be my birthday gift I'm a mom of two I care for my disabled veteran husband.

Let's talk about pricing First and foremost a hundred and fifty dollar bare minimum per person In his spectrum people pay more than 150 for their VIP tickets for their experiences for their carriage rides for their photo Ives but at bare minimum a hundred fifty dollars per person So when we walk in the least that y'all could do is check a ticket to make sure that everyone paid For people who did pay We would like we would like to know that it's an experience that we paid for I could not pay it and walked right in That's number one number two pre-event You all post-pone the event For September 22nd the original dude the original date for the event was August 25th Y'all let us know about the post-pone meant August 22nd But in the same day since it emailed that said can't wait to see you all Upcoming event details August 25th began time at 6 p.m So we were kind of confused to receive that email and then a post-pone in the same day So yeah, that's the same now.
