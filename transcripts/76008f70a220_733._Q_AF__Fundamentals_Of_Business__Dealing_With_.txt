that way I need you to help me get the show out so uh don't be a hell show the show all right I have no idea why they keep fucking with us huh like why do they keep fucking with us it's we're just trying to make people better you know hey they don't want people to be bad that's what it is bro I'm being dead serious they don't want people to be better they want people to be you know little brain motherfuckers what I don't get it that's what they want what let's do the show what's so funny I don't get it all right what's going on man why are you always laughing at your own jokes dude we're trying to do a serious show here what's going on man how you doing you good I don't know I feel extra smart today show's been doing good man yeah big hit it you know but show's been doing pretty good yeah yeah all right well let's make some people better you're like you lost some weight I'm fucking tell us that you bro all right let's get better let's get better let's get better let's just no fucking right yeah so I wanted to ask your question man because we have this this question come in and you know I think at first I was like now I'm gonna ask any question but then I'm like now that there could be some some actual benefit to this question right yeah we talk about society talk about culture on this show so let's address something man the very very simple question is can only fans should only fans be considered legit entrepreneurship which which would take on that there's and I got three good ones for you this is just a little intro talk sounds like you have four good ones that might be four good ones yeah yeah for 399 a month yeah that's it see my butthole all right is it look was that a real question real question like I mean is that considered like I mean because I mean obviously I mean dude look there's a product you got a product there's the man there's limited supply you charge money for it the market tells you what entrepreneurship is or isn't okay you know what I'm saying you know you're solving a problem you know there's a lot of lonely people out there and whether you agree with it or disagree with it or how you think about it morally is not the case I mean I think it's definitely entrepreneurship I mean fucking drug dealings entrepreneurship right you know so I mean the level at which entrepreneurship it is is debatable because you're not really you're not really innovating anything you know people have had buttholes for every and every and you know I think you've just taken something that people search for in reality and putting it in a digital format and you're selling it yeah now you know it doesn't matter what you think of it but yeah if you're taking morality aside from it right but but so the you're saying the fundamentals are there but I think that does lend to like this this this thing that I mean you always try to know practice right like this ethical entrepreneurship of actually solving real fucking problems with with real solutions what what's the is that is it not really really meeting that line where I mean does it really matter in this in this I mean in today's culture you know I mean there's a lot of people that don't have social skills who don't know how to date who don't know how to meet people who are you know addicted to their phone and and whether or not we agree I think you guys all know that like I don't think that's a good thing sure but we can't argue if it is or isn't I mean it is yeah you know so what would you like to see like I mean I feel like this whole only fans thing it is going to be a trend it's a fad right now I don't see it being like this long term thing so what do you have any recommend dates well why do you see it not being a long term thing I don't I don't think culture will Tyler I think there's going to be a swing in culture to where like we will there will be a morality shift in culture I believe I think that's already happening right and so I think like what as far as as like what the demand for that product though is infinite potentially for sure but I think I mean we're already seeing in you know there's the states that have already you know change the requirements for like porn just even just simple porn sites right like you have to have age checks and verification I think there's going to be an elevation in morality in society and culture that's going to raise some standards and expectations and so with that I think I hope that well dude let me ask you this yeah all right say there's a married couple and sexually they're into voyeurism or somebody you know like watching them have sex and they do only fans together is that immoral I mean personally I think it's still is it yeah why because you're just sharing what you would naturally do publicly you're not marketing the kids you're not marketing you're I'm just asking questions I mean I think there's always going to be a demand for it here's what I think you're saying yeah what I think you're saying is there's going to be social rejection of the people who have done it for sure we're already seeing that we're seeing a lot of men say there's no way I would date a girl and only fans right there's no way I would marry a girl from only fans and you know like bro I think that's a legitimate you know concern of most men right and women seem to you know have bought into this feminism shit where they're like I don't give a shit what people think but you do because then when no men want to date you or marry you you get a very upset about it so there this is a non-emotional issue it's just what is and what isn't and for most men having their their counterpart on only fans for everybody to see is not what they want they don't want that they don't want to walk into a party with a especially ambitious man and successful men they don't want to walk into a party with a woman that everybody else can see naked on the internet or see fucking see him masturbating on the internet they don't want to they don't want to see they don't like that's embarrassing to other men and uh it is what it is now men might have sex with those women and do I think that's fair I'm not a fair judge I'm just telling you the way it is but there's a lot of confusion around what's happening in society and I don't think it's good bro I don't think men were ever meant to see unlimited naked females at their disposal at any time of the day 24 hours a day I think it's very destructive and I think what it does is it actually destroys men's motivation to try and become an achieve and conquer and build and become the best version of themselves because that's really one of the biggest motivations for men one of the biggest motivations for men to go out and build a life is so that they can have more choices when it comes to women and women probably don't understand that because women have a lot of choices most of their life right so you know when you remove the motivation for men to a big part of the motivation for men to go out and become something you get men that produce less and become less and I think we're seeing that in society you know so is it actual entrepreneurship or is it you know I mean yeah bro there's girls that make millions of dollars a month doing taxes yeah yeah well that's a whole nother thing a lot of them just got in trouble for that but but yeah I said that's supposed to pay taxes yeah well they don't yeah that's a whole nother topic but yeah man I think I think it's very damaging to men in particular I think it removes their motivation I think it I take away you know you not wanting people to see your girl naked or doing shit take that away and throw that out the window when men have unlimited selection of you know sexual gratification through porn or through only fans or even through men that can get any women they want because there's men that can do that like that are at the highest level and they don't exercise discipline it actually removes motivation for them to become what they're supposed to become and you know when you meet someone that you love and that you connect with in a real way that person should help drive you to become the best version of yourself and so you know that partnership is very very crucial to the success of a culture because we have roles and we have a partnership that is pushing people to be better and when we remove that because men can just get whatever they want whenever they want and they haven't earned it you get a bunch of pacified weak men that live in their basement and jerk off 20 times a week you know what I mean and that's what we end up with and they don't build anything they don't conquer anything they don't contribute anything they don't become anything and you know we society loses out so I mean I think there's a big discussion that could be had there and it could be hours and hours long but you know I don't think that you can't say it's not a business you know what I mean no I love it man I love it with guys Andy I got three good ones for you three more good ones for you three more three more three more three more open the door all right guys any question more you didn't get that one open the door baby roof you know the guy that's like back in on the door bill did okay the bill collector the guy won his bike back oh man guys any question number one what's up Andy thanks for the show you and DJ are funniest fuck and I love following the advice you give I'm 26 years old and I've had trouble running my clothing business I've completely transformed my mind and body and I've been told that once you become an all-around better person it makes it so much easier to succeed in business as well the only problem is my business isn't getting any better so my question is what can I do to get more customers in the door and how can I create a culture or feeling that makes my brand stand out thanks Andy okay well first of all yet you can get ripped bro and you can get your mindset right and you can get you know healthy mentally and you can become the best version of yourself but unless you know the fundamentals of business and execute those you're not going to be successful so we have to understand when I talk about you building the best you to become successful that's with an understanding that you're executing the basics from a tactical standpoint and if you understand the tactical techniques that it takes to build a business to market to brand to fulfill the customer to scale all of these things when you understand those and you execute those and then you become the best version of yourself you become way more effective and then you will make a lot more money but this idea that you can just do all of these things and money's just going to come flowing in the door that's that's not true so you might be a little misunderstood there bro um so that's the first part of the question the second part of the question is how can I get more customers and my business is not getting better well that could be a lot of things man like I don't know exactly what your problem is your product could not be good your message could not be resonating you couldn't you could be telling a poor or a weak brand story you could have your product doesn't fit right or it's inconsistent um maybe your ads aren't resonating maybe you're taking too long to deliver the product uh maybe when people are getting the product it's fucked up who knows like there's not enough data here for me to tell you what's wrong but what I will tell you is that if you think that you're just going to do some coal plunges and lift weights and get ripped and then you're going to become a multi-millionaire that's not the case if you learn the basics of business and what I would encourage you to do is to go back and listen to every single MFCO project and then consider joining Aritae Syndicate where we go through these exact topics over the course of a year and help guys just like you figure out what to do and then you meet hundreds of other people inside that group who are on the same mission as you who honestly become your go-to network so that's what I would tell you you know uh how do you get more customers I can answer that in a general sense not knowing exactly what you have going on you know I can tell you where most people fuck this up most people fuck this up and they think they're going to launch something they they think they're gonna make a product they think they're gonna have a big launch and they're gonna get a thousand customers today and dude that's not how this works you guys have to think of the game differently and it's always one customer at a time when we think about how word of mouth spreads now versus how word of mouth spread 25 years ago it's a completely different game when you consider how it spread a hundred years ago it's a completely different game but the principles still exist the same if you service a customer you have one customer you make a product that they're happy with you fulfill their needs in a way that are remarkable meaning that they will actually share and speak about and tell people about that person will tell people the story of your brand about you about your product and then you will have two customers okay now we are fortunate to live in an environment where we have technology through this little phone that we all carry in our pockets to spread messages more quickly so in the old days where you would have no internet no social media no cell phone you know those stories took years and years and years and years and years and years to spread and you had to do what you do at a high level for a much longer time for people to accept how good your shit was now we live in an era where people can push a button on their phone and talk to everybody they've ever known in their whole entire life and tell a great story about your product your brand your service and you instantly all right and you need to leverage that as much as you can and the way you leverage that is by taking the one or two customers or five customers or 100 customers that exist and treating them in such a way that they tell an incredible story about you and your company and your clothing brand how do you scale culture around your brand well your brand's got to mean something it can't just be a shirt with a saying on it now it could be and you could sell that and like let's just say you're you're somebody who makes shirts on the trend right like you make a shirt based on something that's happening inside called like hop hop to it right like that's what's hot right now and you sell a bunch of those shirts okay you're getting sales but you're not going to build culture around that unless you do that so consistently that people know you're the go to person for the funny shirts all right but in reality what you have to do is you have to decide what your brand looks like what it feels like what it stands for and then you have to effectively tell that story and live that story through the way that you do business this is a long conversation I mean this is a workshop I could go over this for two or three days in a row maybe a week in a row and not teach you everything there is to know and this is why art a syndicate exists but you know just that little direction I think will help you a lot stop thinking you can get a hundred customers at a time and start focusing on that one customer at time and servicing them in such a way which by the way is the right way to do business it's the ethical way to do business it's serving them in such a way that they tell the story about you your brand and what it means to them and that will get you more customers I love it I love it guys Andy question number two uh hi Andy I'm a mechanical engineer with seven years experience I recently moved from a worldwide company with thousands of employees to a small company with 30 employees and I am one of two engineers it is me and my supervisor on the engineering side and my new company the owner or CEO is passionate about the design of our products and tends to micro manage the engineering side for example sometimes he will force me to design something his way even though I can prove to him that his ideas present several issues basically since he is the boss it's his way that's one issue but the other one that bothers me is he will make comments like quote I'm holding you responsible if this product fails so basically I'm being told that I'll be accountable even though I'm being forced to design things a certain way that I don't agree with if shit really hits the fan I'm nervous about what could happen any advice on how to navigate this uh yeah on the first point well that's the way business goes um if you want to design products your way and you want to do things your way you should go build your own 30 company or 30 employee company and do that okay right now you're a fucking employee which means if a cuss if your owner your CEO or whoever once things done a certain way he's paying you to do those things a certain way now your job as a value employee is to raise the objections and to show hey I don't know that this will work or I don't know this is the best idea and what it sounds like is that you have a hard time bringing that to your supervisor without you feeling like you're gonna get in trouble to do so so what I would recommend is having a little bit more of a backbone understand that he want first of all I think it's great that he's passionate enough to micromanage okay instead of you being upset that this person wants to have their hands on it maybe you should be thankful that this person cares so much about the company and about the direction of the brand and where it's going to go and how that's going to affect you and your family maybe you should be grateful for that instead of complaining about it because there's most places the CEO is offsite all the time they're at home they're on the lake they're on the boat they're fucking off they're in Italy they're not helping you that person whether you agree with them or not is helping you so while they might be quote unquote micromanaging and it might be annoying try to be thankful for it because I'm sure he's not micromanaging because he wants to fucking lose okay so that's the first thing I would say the second thing I would say is what I said you know already which is you're an employee and you get paid to do things a certain way but if you want to be a super valuable employee you should point out the objections that you have based upon your expertise and potentially your supervisor who's been doing something that you do for much longer than you have has probably already thought those through and maybe knows exactly why he wants to do them that way versus why you want to do them your way there's so many times we're a young person who is a skilled person like a designer or someone with technical skill like an engineer who believes that they know because they went to school exactly what needs to be done and this person who's been doing something for their entire fucking life doesn't understand because they didn't go to school here's the reality there's probably a very good reason that that person is telling you know we don't want to do it that way and I will bet that the reason is is because they did it that way before and it produced a negative outcome and what's happening in my opinion in this scenario is there's bad communication on both parts the CEO or the owner of the supervisor is not telling you why we shouldn't do things that way so it's leaving you confused and you make it feels like you're being micromanaged instead of working together on a project the difference between micromanaging and working together on a project this communication hey this is why we can't do this because last time we did this 10 years ago when you were 12 it fucking did this and this and this and we fucked it up okay that's a teaching moment that a lot of CEOs don't do because they just want to get the shit done right so there's communication issues on both sides here but the second part of it is you should understand that your value as a paid employee is increased by bringing things to the supervisor that will improve the brand and you have to have the nuance and the ability to understand the difference between you wanting to do things your way or you wanting to do things that are good for the brand because your ego which you have is the same as that person's ego and naturally as human beings we want our decisions to be chosen because there are decisions but in reality on a team which a business is a team it doesn't matter whose decision we go with as long as it's the right one and everybody benefits from it so your job is to communicate the objections you have and then find out why they have objections to it in a positive way that is that is non-threatening non-disrespectful and constructive and so instead of you sitting here saying I don't know what to do I would open up dialogue with your supervisor and say hey look I know I don't know everything okay but here's what I'm seeing here why do you see it differently because maybe he maybe he just doesn't see it the way you see it or maybe there's a good reason that they're saying no but either way there's communication here and any technical skilled person I'm going to give you some free advice whether you're a graphic designer a videographer you design a peril you fucking you know you're an engineer you're you're a technical person you have to understand that the person who has running the company or supervising you even though they may not have that skill to sit down at a computer and do the thing they probably understand the result that's needed much more than you do just because you understand how to sit at a computer and design a graphic doesn't mean that you understand what the right graphic is to attach itself to the brand or the customer does that make sense they have the vision yes so you have to respect that a lot of people with technical skill because they think they're they have technical skill will look at their supervisor and be like that guys are fucking it he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing well how the fuck did he get where he is then you think you just got lucky right you see what I'm saying so have communication open it up be respectful be open minded be willing to learn and most importantly realize that we're on the same team and you should be very grateful for that CEO that wants to walk by your desk and say hey this needs to be this way that needs to be this way while it might be annoying to you that person wants to fucking win more than most CEOs and you'll find that out if you go work at other places like you already have why'd you leave that first place right right you see what I'm saying so you're the way I'm hearing this is you're not really happy either way you're not happy when no one pays attention to you and you're not happy when someone does so what the fuck maybe it's a you problem dude I thought about two things here when I was thinking about this and like you know the the first thing that that came to mind you touch on a little bit this ego thing here right but like so I don't want to get a big hat you don't want you you not me oh what no but what maybe you think of one of the one maybe like it's the maybe think of two things and the first thing is like you know sometimes you're not able to see your full potential and the other your boss does yeah you know so like you may think that what you just delivered was the you know the best shit since sliced bread it might be your best and it might be yeah but because you lacked the perspective in the experience right you don't know the result that's kind of produced right right or like because I and I can like just from personal experience working with you right I've been with you for a while I've seen this at play right I've seen people deliver something and it's like no fix it right and it's like well what the fuck man what's wrong with it exactly and then there's this this this this this and then they'll say well I don't know well yeah you wouldn't know because you had been doing this 25 years right but I don't expect you to know that that's why I'm telling you to change it right and they take that in they come back and the the next product that delivered to you it's 10 times better yeah right so it's or they quit trying hard because they think that you're gonna reject all their ideas and they remove all value from their from their existence in your role right okay so don't be that person right when someone gives you criticism and someone gives you framework or someone gives you some advice who's older than you is but doing it longer than you you should give them the benefit of the doubt that that's a pretty smart motherfucker like my dad who's fucking 80 years old sometimes he says shit and it sounds crazy but you know how many times he's been wrong zero the motherfucker's always right and you know why he's always right because he's lived on this motherfucker north twice as long as me he's just seen it yeah he's seen I can't replace that no and that leads into my second point too because he says he's he's pretty new to this company there is a thing there's an aspect of trust here too right like you have like you maybe you just haven't been there long enough to truly trust that your CEO or your leader knows what the fuck they're doing like it bro have you told me to maybe you shouldn't take the job if you don't trust them well I'm saying like I mean but like that takes time to build right I think a body of work should speak for itself yeah you know if you walk into a company and it's built from the ground up such as maybe I don't know the companies I've built and you automatically think you know more than me you're probably making a pretty ignorant mistake yeah you know what I'm saying now there's probably a whole lot of I can learn from that person as well but I could promise you this if someone puts something in front of my face at this point in time there's a 98 percent chance I'm gonna tell you if it's gonna work or not because I've been doing this since I was 19 years old you see what I'm saying right so and and that's where like the technical knowledge people and the experienced people disconnect it's all about communication did I love it I love it well guys Andy our third and final question question number three hey Andy and DJ love what you guys do love the Lou I went to Logan University in Chesterfield long before it was called Logan University we loved every minute of our time there except for that goddamn Provelle cheese you watch your goddamn mouth how about that Provelle cheese he's hate on Provelle cheese that's just the shit um anyway uh he says anyways I'm nearing my 50th birthday and I've worked my ass off uh to provide for my family for the past 23 years I got a great wife a great family for absolute beast for kids uh ones pro soccer player and two full rock college athletes damn big house great practice two grand babies life is good damn you be killing it bro fucking killing is a 50 man uh my question is as a high performer like yourself how do you prevent the quote on quote it's good enough uh how do you prevent that thought from creeping into your mind because most nights I just want to come home floating the pool have a cocktail and enjoy the fruits of my labor so how do you prevent this this this idea from creeping in that it's good enough well sometimes it is good enough sometimes it is good enough and let me tell you when that time is because it's a lot different than what most people think when when you have enough money in your bank account that you can live at the lifestyle you want for the rest of your life and then have that exact amount of money left over okay for emergencies not talking about an extra 100 grand I'm talking about double what you think it's gonna cost then it's good enough okay because there's gonna be things that come up there's gonna be things you want to do there's gonna be things you want to buy just gonna be lifestyle improvements and when you're at that level at 50 years old you might I just had a friend of mine I had a friend of mine who's 53 years old who's made hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars sitting on stacks of cash going through a hard time in his life and business he's got so much money you can't fucking spend it all right and I looked at him and I'm like why are you doing this to yourself you don't have to do this you see what I'm saying but most people think it's good enough when they're fucking 25 okay and most people think it's good enough when they're 30 and then when they're 35 and then they buy into this idealistic culture of I'm just gonna float through life I'll figure it out you know I whatever happens happens and then they run out of money and they get in a panic and they don't know what to do and I'm gonna tell you as someone who's you know gone through a large part of my life with no money there's nothing worse than the financial pressure of having no money having no money okay money is extremely important so sometimes it is good enough and and dude if you're a high achiever you're gonna need to redirect that focus into something else maybe it's a charity maybe it's a sport maybe it's a hobby like I have another very good friend of mine who who was very successful in business and retired pretty early and went for four or five years with nothing to do and was going crazy and then started a gun company a custom gun company where they make the nicest firearms in the world and now he's happy doing that you see what I'm saying when you're built to fucking go to battle you have to have a project to work on and as entrepreneurs high achieving people we have to have a project bro we have to have a purpose we have to have a mission we have to have an intermediate defeat and if we don't have those three things we're fucking miserable that's what high achieving people are built for so if you're gonna replace you know whatever it is you've been doing which you sound like you might be a little bored with you got to find something else to replace it with all right that's gonna that's gonna satisfy those things or you're gonna be miserable um this idea of like going to the beach and just retire bro that bro have you have you ever gone on a beach vacation yeah once okay after like three days it's fucking stupid it gets a little yeah like bro and you think you're gonna go like if that's what you feel like you're missing in life just go to fucking cancun for three days just go do it real quick come back yeah um but dude you know the the thing is that people here here's the fundamental reality is that people greatly misjudge what it's actually going to take and they also misjudge how much money they need to make and how hard it is going to be to make that money that the the idea of what it takes versus what it actually takes is almost polar opposites in culture right now we have all these people on the internet telling all these people who are just desperate to make some extra money that it's easy quick pain free and you're gonna be rich and I'm gonna make you rich and all of that shit is a lie that is all a fucking lie all of it okay becoming successful is way harder than you think it takes way longer than you think it takes everything you got and if you don't give it everything you got you're not gonna make it and even if you do give it everything you got if your skills aren't good enough such as the first guy in the first question you won't make it so you got to have the recipe of all of these things to make it we got we got to remember dude winning is rare it's not this thing that everybody gets to do the internet makes people believe that winning is some so common and so it's they make it seem like it's the default no losing is the default bro being broke is the default you have to work your fucking ass off to not be one of those people and most people are broken they don't know it they don't they don't they don't realize that you're in the broke category you know I'm saying like when you're barely making it and you're living in an apartment and you're stretching and you have 200 bucks left after you pay all your bills guess what mother fucker you're broke okay so what do you have to do to move from this situation okay you have to get more skills you have to provide more value whether that be inside of your own company or a company that you work within and you have to be undeniably great so how do you do that well that takes an investment on your own time you can't go out and party with your friends you all these people that you see driving Mercedes and BMWs and Bentley's and all this shit these motherfuckers didn't go out every fucking day of their life they didn't do all this shit that poor people do and I'm I hate to say it like that but like bro go into the bar every weekend that's poor people shit it just is and I'm not trying to be an asshole I'm just being real like wealthy people do not fucking do that okay so you if you want to talk about like fake it till you make it it's not fake it till you make it like one of these dumbasses on the internet where they go out and spend every dollar they have to present themselves as some sort of successful person that's not what that means fake it till you make it means fake the behavior of wealthy people until the wealthy until the behavior starts producing a result and so what do wealthy people do wealthy people associate with other wealthy people wealthy people make sure that their shit gets done wealthy people don't abuse substances they might drink they might smoke a little but it's not an regular thing okay what else do they do they work harder than most people you know the funny thing is is that the people I know that don't have to work another day in their life happen to also be the hardest working fucking people I know what do you admit what do you think that means that doesn't mean they got successful and decided to work harder and everybody it means they started working harder and everybody 20 years ago when they were nobody and they've kept that habit and now they materialized all this success and people think it's like it's like a coincidence it's not a coincidence okay the reason that the people who have the most money wake up every single day and work harder than everybody else is because they develop that habit when they were broke all right and these are just the realities of becoming successful and I'm not saying that everybody has to become a mega million and I do that's not what everybody wants some people just want to have a little more money and some people just want to you know have a little more freedom and that's okay too I'm not sitting here on my pulpit saying all you people that don't have money your pieces of shit but if you want more money that's what the fuck it takes and if you want to be wealthy it takes a lot more than that and it really takes in the entire focus of your life if you think of it as like a professional sport right to be a wealthy person that would be the equivalent of being on the all-star team all right well what's it take to become an all-star player in baseball it takes 20 years of fucking work as a kid it takes you making the team then it takes you starting over to become great at that level and then eventually you become an all-star and you make a whole bunch of money okay that's the same thing in life and business you got to work for a long time doing shit you don't want to do when you when you don't want to do it then you get a shot and when you get the shot you have to keep getting better and it has to be undeniable like and that's why baseball is such a great sport or professional sports is such a great example because it's driven by actual statistics you know this motherfucker rush for two thousand yards the last three years you know this guy hit 340 for the last seven years you know this guy hit 50 home runs like it's undeniable and when you think of your career and your business in life like that it becomes more real on what it actually takes like dude this idea that you can just somehow like and this comes from broke parents or I broke parents teach their kids this which makes them broke this idea that you're going to just work somewhere and show up every day and I show up on time I do my job no shit that's the fuck you get paid for okay that's what you're supposed to do like that's the bare minimum bro and just because you show up every day for 40 years doesn't guarantee you anything other than what you already are getting you have to get better you have to provide more and I didn't make the fucking rules bro I'm just telling you what they are okay and it has to be undeniable you have to be able to walk into your superior's office and fucking hold up a piece of paper and say look what I did I did this I did this I did this I did this I did this I did this fucking pay me man or I'm gonna go over here where they're gonna pay me you see what I'm saying and that's do they not do that baseball that's exactly what they don't do that football that's exactly okay if you want to know how life really works in business just pay attention to how it sportses it's the same thing we could talk about all this society stuff about what's fair what's not fair and who's got privilege and who's got this and who's got that who was born here who was born there you know what fucking matters what stats are you putting up what's your scoreboard say that's all the fucking matters bro and whether that takes you a year or five years or ten years that's all that matters and when you could hold up the results of that and say this is where it is you get paid okay and there is no situation in life where a high skilled person gets fucked over like this is a this is a fucking lie your parents told you oh work for the man for 30 years and fucking you know walk away with the cheap gold watch they don't give a fuck about you so why are you putting in any work gee I can't wonder why you never achieved anything okay just because your parents are bitter fucking losers doesn't mean you have to be all right they're telling you that you're believing that's the way it is and then you're not even trying and you're showing up at work talking about I showed up on time that's your win I showed up on time in fact I don't give a fuck what time you showed up I care about those results that's what everything's driven by bro so if you can't fucking put numbers on the scoreboard you're worth less if you put big numbers on the scoreboard you're worth more I don't know how to explain this anymore clearer than that and people have such a hard time fucking getting it you know like that like just because you work somewhere for five years doesn't entitle you to anything dude you fucking nothing man what huh nothing it's how did you do absolutely I know bro but like you know it you got to be good and you got to be undeniable and it's the only way to win I love it man I love it like do you think that these guys play pro sports bro like you ever ever have you ever seen a pro sports contest baseball hockey football basketball soccer a contest of competition have you ever seen the losing team of MMA fight have you ever seen the losing fighter walk up after the fight and be like bro I should have won I tried harder I should have won I'm I'm black I should have won I'm a woman they get laughed out of the fucking game bro it's not even a thought I know but in business and people's career these are actual thoughts that people think I try hard so I should get paid well you can try hard all you want if your skills are low and you suck that doesn't matter you have to try hard and have skills and you know how you get skills by reps and putting in time on your own and taking time on the weekend and learning your craft and reading at night and doing all these things that the other wealthy people are doing okay so let's clear this up you have the wrong perception of what it takes what it takes is way more than what you think it is and as long as you do you're willing to do that which people who become wealthy you're willing to do whatever the fuck it takes that's the bottom line if you're willing to do that you'll get that if you're willing to do half of that you'll get half of that if you're willing to do a quarter of that you'll get a little more than what you got now and that's the way it fucking works man I love it man I love it with guys 80 I was three yeah go pay the fee got a own bank row can't fold just a note here shot case closed closed
