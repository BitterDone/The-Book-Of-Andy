What is up guys it's Andy for Sella and this is the show for the real estate about the life of the fitness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality. Guys today we are doing something different. We are going to actually have a full length episode today which we haven't had in a long time but I could promise you this is one you are going to want to listen to all the way through. So with the amount of negativity and stuff going on in the world and crazy shit we thought we'd take an opportunity to give us a little breath from that and do a full length and so that's what we are going to do. Before we get to that I'm liking your new hat there bro. Oh thanks man I had a friend gave this to me. Yeah it looks like you got extra brains. Is that what you are doing? You are trying to look smarter? Expans in there. Yeah. I feel up to hat. It's all up in there. Yeah it looks good. What's the sticker for there? Who gave you the hat? Yeah a special friend gave me this hat and he's actually our guest today on the show. We got Ryan Harwick. Yeah what's up dude? Thanks man. Yeah it's going good. Ryan what's going on man? Man a lot. Yeah a little bit to talk about. Yeah so yeah man dude we've been talking about this for years. For those of you that don't know Ryan is one of my best friends in the world. He's also a business partner in mine. We're partners in the race team. Fuck dude we've been friends for a long time now. Yeah how long have you guys been knowing each other? Ten plus years. Yeah I want to say it was around 2015. Yeah. Yeah we had met really through cars. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah mutual friends like hey man you know my friend Andy and I just I had found you on like you know I was following you. These were Facebook days I guess. Yeah but yeah I'm like I know of them you know it's like oh why is a friend you guys should meet you guys are both into cars and yeah yeah so yeah going on 10 years I guess yeah. Yeah and then I came down. Yeah you had a come down. Yeah you guys had me come down. Yeah and I met you and Dustin and Justin. And then yeah had you speak to all ourselves people. Yeah man. That was probably 20 what 16 17 maybe. Yeah it was fun. I think it was just down there for the day. Yeah yeah he's came down quick. Yeah we we asked you where I'm in the motorcycle business. Yeah it's my you know. So for those of you that don't know just real quick. Yeah Ryan is going to be humble but Ryan and Justin and the guy they own what is I think it's fair to say one of the largest if not the largest motor sports dealerships in the whole country. One of the biggest in the world. Yeah yeah we're in the top three in the world. Yeah so how many locations you guys have? I have 12 12 and these are not like little you know they got a few motorcycles these are like motorcycle ATV four wheeler superstores. And you guys have every brand it don't you? Yeah for the most part I mean there's a couple small brands but you know all the you know Japanese motorcycle brands on in Yama the American brands like Polaris, Ducati, European brands so yeah they're yeah it's a business that we Justin and I grew up. Now you guys started to say exact the cool thing about Ryan and Justin is they started like exactly when Chris and I started. Yeah yeah with 99. Yeah we were about the same age. Yeah yeah about the same age we don't have to say what that is but yeah that's right. You just keep it general. Yeah yeah no yeah we that's where we kind of hit it off you and I had a lot of similarities you know and you know business and probably I think we both started you know probably to I know me for one I had no idea what I was doing. Yeah I just you know we're you know going after it as fast as we could and learning a lot but making a lot of mistakes but yeah we started in the same years and then as a business has grew you know kind of our businesses were you know close in size. Yeah. Yeah. We had a lot of common ground and stuff to you know we could share and learn from each other. It's nice knowing that there's someone else out there having a lot of the same struggles. Yeah dude. That you're having. That's get their ass kicked the exact same way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Beautiful. A lot of times it's like they come in waves. It's like the same day. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. You too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. How are you there? That's still right there. Oh jeez man. I went to the closet. I went to the closet. I went to the closet. I'm in the closet. I'm like damn right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was business Ryan. Yeah. Yeah. I like that. LinkedIn picture. Yeah. So dude what was it like you know before we get into the I mean obviously most of the listeners here are success entrepreneurial minded. I mean dude just talk about that you know they've all heard my story but I mean dude you guys have an incredible story. Yeah. I mean we like say we just and I grew up together we were riding dirt bikes all our lives. My father taught us to ride and so it was our passion and we kind of stumbled into the ability to submit an application to one of the manufacturers to open a dealership and we were gosh we're 19 years old when we sent this application in and you know it's spent a lot of time working on it to about how passionate we were about the sport and it was with American Honda and Honda you know sent us back responded said hey man we really like your applications got a lot of passion behind it you got a lot of really cool ideas but you have no funding and you have no experience you know two important things to start a business and so you know again we knew no other way than to go and try to solve those two things we were told no you know from so we went out and tried to you know borrow money you know from others and and then we went to go find a partner that had experience in in running a motorcycle dealership and we were we worked for gosh a couple years to find both of those things so yeah man back in the late 90s early 2000s you could you could borrow a lot more with a lot less than what you can now so I will say the environment was was ripe at that time kind of dot com you know kind of turn of area to to really for a bank to loan a lot of money to two kids yeah that had we had one other partner that he had a Yamaha Kawasaki dealership you know near our town and we talked him into partnering with us and that was probably my first you know really good sales job is it trying to you know talk this this really smart you know entrepreneur into partnering with two young kids and and that's how we got us our start with a single line Honda store and we opened in 2000 and fast forward you know now it's 25 years you know we're the third largest retailer of motorcycles in the world and you know we sell thousands of vehicles a year and we have you know gosh now over 300 getting close to 350 employees and so it's been a wild wild fun ride and we there was there was plenty of times in there when man you know very similar to your soul we talked about you know wanting to quit when like man you know are we really cut out for this do we really know we're doing and you know competitors that were much bigger but yeah that and that's why I kind of I was drawn to racing at a at a young age and racing's got a lot of similarities with business and that you know you're constantly surrounded by chaos and racing and businesses much the same way you know there's there's things happening to you and around you that you can't control and you're constantly adapting and evolving and changing and so that I think I think that's why I've really enjoyed you know racing throughout my whole life as well as business I mean obviously we're all competitors you know you're not competitive you have no you have no business being in business yeah it's something else yeah do something else if you're not competitive so yeah entrepreneur ship and racing just kind of you know went hand in hand you know man I've been fortunate to be able to kind of do both you know that I feel like at a you know decently high level that you know kind of the same time decently high level fucking how fucking wins Lamar one wins Lamar wins day 24 hour the Rolex 24 hour Daytona zebra zebra yeah like stop it yeah I'll suit the fucking home for you yeah I want to ask you this all right I'm here I've actually want to ask him or he want to ask I'm gonna ask that's it I don't know what you said I can't hear you X yes I go there you go all right I've asked Andy this a few times but I mean 25 years and I'm not trying to date you at all right but 25 years that's a long time does it feel like 25 years to you like when you look back first store in 2000 everything you I mean did it go quick I would say now it it feels like it went quick there there were times I can really say about 10 years in that felt I remember looking back at 10 years in thinking man I've been at this a while with at that time not as much growth as what you know my partner Justin and I wanted you know and that was coming out of the big financial crisis disaster 0 809 I remember around 2010 thinking man we've been doing a lot of work for what at that time was a long time to us with without you know that level of success and growth that you know you we kind of thought we would be at 10 years in and now 25 years looking back it seemed to all go by pretty pretty quick I remember those first days like it was yesterday right but there were times along the way that yeah man it felt it felt just grinding yeah grinding yeah I think it just depends on when you ask yeah you know for real dude like I I think it's the same for us you know when when we were 10 years in dude I was looking we almost quit at 10 years in Chris and I a lot of you guys know that story um it was you I think the point about this is that entrepreneurship really like recalibrate your sense of what a lot of time is compared to what you thought it was before you started down the journey you know a lot of people here 10 years and they think oh man that's forever but then when you're when you're you know 25 26 years in you look at 10 years and you're like man I've known you for 10 years yeah like that does that feels like it was yesterday yeah and um I don't know if it's the reward that comes with it but I will I do echo that like when I was 10 years in I was like fuck what are we doing like we're wasting our lives yeah and then now I look around and I'm like well this was fucking worth it yeah like like it it it's just I don't know I think people misjudge the the amount of time that it actually takes yeah I think it's easy I mean I know I know you've said it for you know forever in that you know it's a problem with a lot of our you know it's younger people you know but guys coming up through the ranks right now whether it's your starting your own business or you're working within an organization it's I mean 10 years is I mean it's it's not a short amount of time but it's super easy to get frustrated around that time thinking like man I've done the work I put I'm listening to Andy I've doing you know I'm doing the things but it's still it takes more time yeah right and you know it the analogy of driving a race car I mean yeah that's like like I get a lot of questions like man Ryan you know one of these big races 24 hours a mile like that the amount of time I just tell you and racing the amount of cars I've crashed okay like properly yeah to get not not skill not bent like like like throw it away crashed right you know a little on fire it it you have to crash the car I mean you there's no way if you want to develop the skill we'll use a racing car for an example to drive a race car like on the limit we've said that's a tough fine if you're gonna drive on the limit you got to first find where that limit is in an order to find it you have to go over it yeah this is part of in business is no different man you gotta it takes a long period of time of crashing of making mistakes right you know and having that ability to get back up and say like I'm gonna keep going I'm gonna take I'm gonna learn why did I crash what happened there was a reason whether it's physics stupidity someone else's fault in another car whatever whatever yeah yeah what you know thinking you could do something the car couldn't do whatever it is you got to learn from that and then you got to be able to apply it you know really quickly you know again and again and again you know and so does that there's so many there's so many I think it's why you were first right like when I you know when I was starting out in it you know first couple years I brought it to you I'm like hey Andy were maybe this would make sense the first form was involved and I'm doing this racing at this level and you know obviously you're a car guy yeah car got we like cars but there's there's just something about racing and I don't care if it's racing uh you know a motorcycle a foot race a car race I mean what the of this competition you you versus the next person you know right next to you thinking you know I'm better than you I'm gonna get there quicker than you better than you I don't know there's there's just some it's like the purest essence of competition to me right you know and then there's so much you know connection to business and you know I think I guess I know it's what drove me into it yeah I mean I think it's a hundred percent parallel I mean I think we just talked about it on yesterday's show but it's confusing how people could be competitive in other areas but then not understand it in the business aspect you know I just think a lot of people don't really understand the rules of business because they're so parallel to any sort of competition you know team sports or individual sports but yeah dude you know one of the things that people I don't know people know but I mean you were you were very very high level water sports racer yeah okay not swimming but like yeah yeah no so like the boat stand up jet skis right yeah jet ski yeah jet ski yeah my all my like teenage years I was racing jet skis and all around the world and that was an awesome sport and they still I have a lot of friends in that sport it's kind of what help really get me you know cemented into the motor sport business and met a lot of the you know manufacturers and the marketing people and stuff but that's that's a fun sport I got to travel lot around the country in the world doing that and yeah that's I'm for sure I do think I've definitely the only person that's one the 24 hours of a law and also a jet ski world championship so I think I think I have that one that's pretty cool yeah I think I'm only one on that one you know but yeah that was a fun sport I mean that's where I kind of learned you know the cut my teeth but I'll tell you one big difference like coming from motorcycles and jet skis I would say those are much more individual you know racing type things it's kind it's really about the the rider and the bike or the jet ski or car racing I think is even much more similar to like a business and an organization it is for to me car racing is like the quintessential team sport the only thing even close to me is like football yeah football like if you know the center isn't doing his job or the guard I don't care how good your quarterback and running back all right like it's it is it has to be a team yeah one person has the ability to fuck the entire thing car racing like drivers get talked about all the time whether it's the NASCAR driver the Indy car driver or the Formula 1 driver it all of those forms of car racing is a massive team sport I mean our team the team that you know we won Lamaw with this year Mantae you know Porsche we we have 62 people within the team that are that are at the races all performing different roles you know from engineering to mechanics to you know car you know that this is total over to the whole team yeah so we we my car has a touch more 34 people of the 62 that's those running to cars up 34 people on my car you know and man at one person I mean one person doesn't pull their weight whether it's the preparation of the car before it gets there the pit stop I mean like in the 24 hours of Lamaw we're we're doing a pit stop roughly every hour where we're changing tires filling it up with fuel fixing anything that maybe is a wild thing to see I had the opportunity to come down and watching you at the 24 hour Daytona yeah and like just the level of like how zoned in everybody was like everybody on the crew was like I remember I got a one of your one of the one the crew he was taking tires to go I guess like you guys recycle them right now take them to the tire station right yeah change yeah to change out right let's try remember right like I just like hey you want to roll I'm like yeah I want to go like this would be cool I'm like what we're doing just dropping them off and we got we got there and then we waited and then they loaded us back up and we just set them like what are you doing he's like I got like 10 more seconds before I got to go because I have to time it up with the neck like even being early puts the other guy but like it was like it was a really good wild orchestra of just like everybody's in sync man I'm just like dude that's crazy to even think about like you can't even you don't even want to show up 10 seconds early because that's going to throw somebody else off yeah you're in the way it's crazy yeah these guys like the our pit crews like these I don't think a lot of people don't understand like how much of an athlete you have to be like these guys that are you know doing the tire changes or you know the fuelers a lot of they're all most of them are athletes you know from some other sport growing up whether it's football you know soccer baseball basketball man there they train like unbelievably you know in every like movement is synchronized right you know from where they place their knee their hands you know the tire placement all this and like at the 24 hour races these guys are doing this at you know three in the morning and four in the morning at five in the morning and like the drivers sometimes when you know like there's three drivers on our team you know for the 24 hour race so yeah I drive like two-ish to three two to three hours at a time and then I'm out of the car and I get to rest for you know four to six hours right while my teammates are going these guys on the pickery they don't get to rest I mean they don't they don't have backup guys you know they're they're non-stop you know 24 hours so it's just like a well-ran organization that every single person within the organization knows their role their experts at their role they they you know we have authority as well within the race team you know you have your superior that you're listening to and you report to and right and and the best race teams have an unbelievable you know organizational culture they have an unbelievable you know framework of who does what and you don't question in that person next to your you're you're trying to get to that next level because you play that key role within the team and maybe the next season you can apply for another position you know within the organization and train for that but when we're at a race everyone knows they're a exact job they're exact role they're exact duty and you know things run very smoothly you know with that there's other race teams where I've been a part of that aren't ran so well just like businesses that aren't ran well and you can see it man you can feel the culture when you walk in the garage you know of man is everyone not really wanting to be here they don't like who they work for this is just a job they're taking because they they got turned down from that other team and they're they you know they're really just trying to get to the next thing versus like this team that I won with this year with Porsche I mean this is they're they're highly regarded as one of the best teams in the paddock and the reason why is every single person they love what they do they love who they work for you guys driver you know you you want to as a driver you want to earn their respect show all the pit crew that you respect what they do and it goes vice versa right I've seen so many teams where no one respected each other you know the drivers didn't respect the crew members the crew members didn't respect the driver and the whole thing and the results tend to match right you know that effort so it's it's another great example of how culture you know in winning organizations versus culture and losing organizations it's it's extremely it's extremely parallel yeah I think a lot of people also miss judge how fit you have to be to be on one of these teams you know like these guys who do the pit crew these guys train for that every I mean yeah every day yeah yeah every day and by the way driving the car is not easy it is very very physically intensive I think a lot of people think when they see a race on television they think it's like driving their car on the road sort of fast yeah you know what I mean I went I won a lot I'm this judge that before I got into it you know you know I did remember I remember my first ten laps of race car dude I went 10 laps in the in this uh fucking the Ferrari yeah and the for for our challenge car I think it was yeah and uh first ten laps I'd ever been in a race car and dude I got out of the car I'd lay on the fucking ground like I was it was legit first of all you don't know how to breathe so you're like hold your breath hence the whole time because you it's I mean dude you're driving it's it it's just so different to so you have to like do it to understand how different it is even if you're a great driver on the road yeah it's just a different thing like for example the breaking the breaking you know like when you when you go on the road and you see a light you know coming up and it turns yellow you'll start to ease on the brakes right and then eventually you'll come to a full stop racing is the complete opposite you're trying to basically shorten the amount of time that you're on the brakes to save time which means you're gonna go as close to that light as possible stand on the brakes as hard as possible hoping that you will slow down enough to stop and and dude it's just a completely different thing than driving than driving on the road it's completely different it's it's it's it's a dicting I mean yeah you saw it when I you know what Andy's talking about we took him to this like racing school in Vegas this what gosh when you were 2017 2017 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's just you can like you say I mean you can take like we all drive cars right on the street right so you think you know how hard could it be you know you go left you go right you know slow down to the brakes and one thing a racing car like you drove the Ferrari challenge car a racing car compared to a street car I mean the nicest the greatest street car you can make I mean you've driven some of the best cars in the world right they're unbelievable they perform well they usually go really well with speed right but with a racing car the ability to stop at a tremendous fast tremendous rate in a very short distance is unbelievable and it's not just the brakes it's the tires it's like the the downforce right if you the force that you have to hit to stop a race car you know at speed at pace is so unbelievably hard I mean when you're like I told Andy Andy you got to hit the brake hard you know he was okay you know you look at anything like this guy can hit the brake right you know he'll be fine you know and he goes out there as first few laps and we because there's a there's a sensor on the brake pedal it mounds measures the pressure per square inch and we come back when I K Andy the brake pressure you know we need you know you you can hit it man you hit it hard he's like dude I am hitting it hard yeah yeah well dude you don't like you don't don't understand you don't understand what they're saying yeah like you think they're saying like break it hard on the road yeah it's like dude it's like step harder as you fucking can yeah try to break the pedal yeah it feels it feels counterintuitive yeah when you first start everything feels wrong because honestly if you were in a street car and you hit the brake as hard as what you have to on the racing car you would probably crash the street car it doesn't have the suspension and the downforce to just suck to the road it would you know you could lose the car yeah in a race car it's designed to at the last possible moment you go from you know zero brake pressure to it it's undeniably it's not like you're posting when that happens you're at full throttle full throttle okay and then you're off the throttle and on the brake full brake yeah and it's dude it's it's aggressive it's a thing dude like you get out of the car and your first time and you're like it's disorienting well the most one of the most things and you'll see a Formula One Indy car driver's one of the toughest things in training that we're all working on is our next yeah and obviously there's there's G4 side to side but then also when you're racing you have a helmet on right in this helmet you know ways that decent amount when you're sitting still well when you're when you're traveling fast it weighs a lot more and the biggest is the the G-Force you have under braking yeah right let me and your head is yeah you're strapped in with your body with the with the five point harnesses but your head is loose right yeah so the amount of force that you've got to be able to withhold with your neck from your face wanting to slam into the steering wheel it takes some it takes some time get him used to dude it was awesome it's awesome dude like and once you like it's like golf it's like you go out and you play golf and for 17 holes you fucking hit the ball all over the golf course and you're like this sucks yeah and then like there's like one shot that you hit and it goes straight down the fairway and it's like I'm going pro you're like yeah you're like this is the coolest thing ever and that's how it is with racing like it's it's you know I'm very inexperienced in a race car okay but I have enough experience driving you know like you said the best cars in the world to have a good you got you got a great foundation you weren't that bad no you were turned out good girl we got some funny stories so so I'm ultra competitive yeah right like everybody probably guesses so the other thing I struggle with was the fucking spinning of the car all right like I think I spun the car over the weekend but it had to be some sort of record had to be something had to have been remember we're talking about finding the limit yeah you go past it yeah and uh it what's his name uh in Rico and Rico and Rico was like hey man you know at least you're aggressive most people are not aggressive they drive the whole time yeah I've ever spun yeah so so dude we're like at like there were at this race and like all these other dudes that are there are like guys who have been through the school already and it's like their year end race I had not been through the school so like we just went out there and like I just was with all these dudes so I was the least experience person there yeah and uh we started doing these we start you know running these practice laps and I got this coach uh three of his name was J.R. I think his name was and bro he's screaming in my ear first of all like and like dude when people scream at me I'm like you know and he's like yes yes yes break break break look like just screaming in your ear from this far away to telling you what to do and from the first second you pull on the track I'm like bro can I like go around once like I didn't know what the fuck we're looking at so we go around the track a whole bunch of times for like three days and dude I'm spinning the car and we get like the third day dude and I don't remember what happened dude so so there's this guy who was my race partner so they parry up with a with a another guy all right and they they're gonna run the first half the race and they run like this they pair me up with this dude Craig who was you know he was a little bit older and us fucking awesome duties from Australia still we're still friends on on the internet in fact he runs a dream racing in in the in Australia yeah yeah yeah yeah um but he his son was there his son's like 12 okay so like do you do you remember we have a what happened what well there was like a qualifying right it's a proper race yeah the proper race at the end of this like week long deal that you only came for the last few days of but you know you had to do a qualifying so each driver could go out to try to set their one fastest lap time just like we do a real race and that would determine how you would start and line up right well you had a spin in like the last practice and got like completely down on yourself yeah that you were like so you're you were you were ready to go do something else dude so like so and you were the one that was supposed to qualify for you and Craig yeah like if you didn't qualify then Craig would have to start like dead last yeah you know so then the his son comes over so dude I come out of the car and I'm like this is fucking fuck I'm fucking pissed bro like you guys see me like when I'm top level pissed that's how pissed I was and I'm I'm like and fucking uh fucking Ryan's like yeah just leave him alone like let him leave leave him alone so dude I go sit by by by myself like way over there yeah and fucking this this Craig's son who's 12 at the time comes over and like sits next to me and I'm like I'm fucking mad dude and like in that choker kid no but like how can you be mad at 12 year old kid yeah you know and he's like he's like hey man you're doing good he's like he's like no listen he's typing he gives him no he gives me like a pet dog yeah he's like and he he meant it dude he's like hey he's like you're doing good this is your first time on the track he's like you're doing really good my dad said you're doing good too yeah and like his is pep talk and I like five minutes later I'm like I yeah I'm good let's go yeah so like out of all the pep talks I've given it in my life yeah I get the best one from this from a 12 year old kid yeah you went if I remember I don't remember but I were we won qualifying yeah you you you qualified you went out you won qualifying yeah so you beat all the other cars one of those like eight cars or something and then yeah you got you started the race no I finished you finished it yeah you qualified then yeah started yeah from your position then you finished but yeah and I remember you tell me like man dude I said the kid came over and was like mr. Andy you know you're doing good like that I realized like man I can't let this get like I can't get mad and leave that all you know dude and and so in the actual race bro like I don't remember how many laps we run or whatever I don't I think it was it was it timed was that hour yeah probably I remember what it was started in the day but finished into the night yeah so but dude I hadn't gone that long the entire weekend without fucking spending the car like so somehow I went through the whole race it's been the car and we won yeah which was cool yeah but uh dude the best laps I ran that race were when we went I don't know I should say this or not but we were at the bar drinking like having a couple drinks the car and then we had to take a helicopter from the hotel to the racetrack yeah for like a night event there and then they let you like drive a take a couple yeah whatever car you want for a couple laps and I had a GT3 RS at the time so I was familiar with the car fuck dude I did find in that car I was had a couple whiskey's in me but you know there was nobody else and loose nice yeah I was I was nice to relax don't recommend this yeah don't you know I should say that is a professional this is true but but uh yeah man I'll never forget that weekend uh uh I didn't know when you were so upset after the qualifying you know we were just starting out like we were racing together that year is your first year sponsor we were doing Lamborghini super trophy yeah yeah so it's the first time we had first form on the race car and I was sitting there thinking like man this probably be the first and last time I have a first form sponsorship and he's gonna be he's gonna hate cars so much no it was awesome dude yeah you did great man that was uh that was a good time yeah it's a great great business out there uh we're at Las Vegas Motor Speedway yeah dude and remember I don't know I should tell these stories dude Enrico running those two jettas oh yeah so dude learning car control yes so Enrico's like former f1 yeah he drove up okay so this dude I don't know what do you think he is 60s yeah probably probably yeah early 60s now yeah yeah he's late 50s early 60s awesome guy awesome guy super awesome guy super cool like exactly like every other race car driver that's like just fucking he on the racing school yeah he on the whole thing and he's like you know hey it'll be due like like just not don't give a fuck the only thing you gave a fuck the entire time was where we were right he goes and he rents these jettas bro and he's like all right uh we're gonna go do uh what do they call it cha uh where you follow him yeah lead follows lead follows lead follows so him and I went on the track together and like race each other you're trying to learn how close you can be to another car in front of you or beside you like we all drive on the road and you think oh I'm close to the car in front of me when you really learn how what close is you know like close means they touch you they touch you well don't hit you know yeah rubbers race that's right you know with the movie that's from yeah days of thunder yeah the greatest movie ever movie yeah right uh but yeah so you are learning um you know car control and car proximity yeah with lead and follow with two rental cars I'm just trying to pitch your a-nd in a fucking jettas no bro this is awesome the most fun so we're racing these fucking jettas around the racetrack and the coaches like you can get closer get closer get closer we're like like bumping each other shit and like we get done and I'm like the only thing that I'm at about is we were going down the we're going on the straight and I like like like fucking fake car and he's like can't do that that's against the code like he got super fucking pissed but dude so we got done it up like so so dude uh I'm like so how could you don't use your own cars for that and he's like well because we beat him up and I'm like so like the rental place does it carry like no just get the insurance he was dead serious dude he's dead serious I'm like so they have a car on he's like no I don't care yeah no big deal yeah learning to drive a race car but yeah man he's good times that's what uh we should obviously do that again dude what we should do is get like some of our guys here that you know make them like we'll do a contest or something and take them and get them in a race car because like dude you cannot appreciate racing because here's the best thing that came out of that it wasn't what I learned about driving which I did learn a lot I mean you want to learn how to drive you learn a lot in a very short amount of time in a race school but it's when you it's like playing a musical instrument like when you start to play a musical instrument and you realize how hard it is and then you see like somebody who's really good at it and you can appreciate it's the same with racing the best thing that came out of that race school for me was how much of a fan it made me of racing you know because now I'm like dude these guys are really good like where you you know we watch if you'd ever been through that and you watch racing you're like I could probably do that you know it's like dude it's a different it's a totally different thing different yeah I mean if anyone's in the car so I mean going out on a racetrack even just completely by yourself it's awesome to learn you're you know you think you have limits right and then if you ever get a chance to be around a professional driver and as soon as you start thinking like man you know like I'm I'm doing good here you know I'm I'm really killing it if you ever get a chance to ride like passenger seat with a with a top level driver your eyes will really get open about what's possible right yeah in terms of breaking yeah and where the limit really is on a car like dude I mean you know so far past it's what people think it is where you're when everything's right like when your tires are right and like what that car will do is like almost double or triple what you think it'll do yeah like what you feel when you're in the car oh it's yeah it's what takes people so so much longer like I remember telling you the one of the wildest corners and all racing anywhere is turn one at sea bring in Florida the race of the car here that we won this corner is like you enter the corner in fifth gear on a car we do have one more gear but we enter it at around 150 miles an hour from a really long straightaway before it and there's bumps all the way through this thing and this there's a concrete wall that is you know marks the apex of the corner on the inside and it's a it's a virtually a 90 degree corner so you're going straight and it's a hard left that's a 90 degree and this corner our minimum speed in a GT3R is about a hundred and thirty two miles an hour that's the slowest that you get in the middle of the corner and I remember walking you through that one until I'm doing like no way 134 is like the slowest and like believe me when you first go at it and you're there's also a concrete wall that you're staring at the whole straightaway on the on the outside and kind of like try to cross the straight almost across you do yeah you start you see any any high speed corner you want to start as far to the outside of you know the corner and you know make bay pecs and then you utilize all the track on the exit you try to open the corner up as much as possible and that one's just wild because it's basically a hard right there's a concrete wall on the inside a concrete wall on the outside so if you mess up there isn't like a sand pit or some gravel or you know everything of a k if you mess up like you mess up really bad yeah and like you say the slowest the slowest you get down to is roughly a hundred and thirty miles an hour and like that one when you can wrap your mind around like when you actually do it once you have a whole new understanding you know of what's possible and then like that's probably one or not of this one's here but I'm sure you guys like I know you and Formula One big fan of spa in Belgium yeah this is the greatest racetrack in the world there's no question and there's a corner there called O Rouge it's actually a series of corners that are all tied together and it's that that is without a doubt like the craziest thing I have ever done that's the downer one right no you go uphill so you you enter this this section of corners at top top gear so six six gears fastest the car will go and it's a series of corners that you first go left that in right there go yeah like all of these corners are at this is all it so there's it's it's a combination of like through four corners tied together and it's if you mess up here again there's no like runoff there's no say this is it's also like this is like the deadliest corner and racing a more it's a more more drivers have died at this one corner than like anywhere else in the world because it it can be done like in a GT3 it can be done flat without lifting but this is like perfect weather conditions you know perfect grip from the tires perfect weight balance with the car and then if you where most people make a mistake if you lift you know it's your heart and soul and everything in your body says I am and we should we should back off here a little bit if you lift you actually take down force off the car and make the car squarely squarely a move and if you lift it the wrong moment in this series of court there's no saving it I mean there's no there's no catching it you're you know and it's a it's a really bad crash now I say all these bad things when you do it the first time wide open without lifting it is the most exhilarating feeling on planet earth I don't know anything any better and maybe it's like all you cheated you know this you've seen all the massive crashes and stuff but there's nothing that I can't even like closely describe to it and like when you first arrive there you can watch it on TV as much as you want but when you first arrive one it's it's going up hill this hill is like your climbing like three stories and it is I mean it's a hard left a hard right and a hard left back again and and you're like wait a second this is flat like we don't my first thought approaching it was we need to not only lift we need to probably break and maybe consider a downshift yeah yeah we should we should consider all of the above but this place like I've been telling you like you've got to go to like watch a race there one and then they have like driving events like you can go and like like Porsche Porsche and Manta they do like track days where you can turn up and drive like a GT3 RS or whatnot like you got to go drive at this track and it you don't have to do a Rouge flat but just to go up it it's an experience in person like as a car you know person I regularly like anyone if you're ever into it like go to Belgium go to spa watch the F1 race they have a 24 hour race there as well I've won that race I've probably want to probably might some of my best driving ever done I was on pole position there for the European Le Mans series championship one year and that was that was probably the best lap I've ever done in my life but that place is cool so dude let's let's kind of shift a little bit and let's talk about moving you know through the big races um you know we started it with Lamborghini's series race yeah yeah super Trefaz a single-make series where all the cars were exactly the same and that's a great place to start as a driver because as a driver you're the only difference I mean everyone's car is exactly the same with the rules and teams can make small adjustments like the rear wing angle and the ride heights but not not really a lot so it's truly a competition of the driver where now and just like Formula One or what we race now in GT3 you're racing against other manufacturers so you know there's always differences between a Porsche and a Ferrari and a Lamborghini so there's more of aerables but single-make series like the super Trefago for Lamborghini that was that was awesome because you know there's no excuses man if you're slow and every major man for those of you who are you know not familiar with this so Porsche has one of these single-makes Ferrari has one of these single-makes there's basically one for every major manufacturer and that's where most like what we call genital genital racers that end up doing what you've done come from yeah that's where you go I mean it's it's one of the least expensive you know forms of racing a lot of a lot of guys that do it for fun they like that part of it that hey you know the driver's only difference but yeah it's where you go to kind of get your get your start I would say you know and in racing if you do well I think they have a championship with Lamborghini is here in North America in our second year of racing that we won the North American championship and then you go to a world championship where they have a series in Europe and they have a series in Asia and America and all those drivers come together at one race they change the location you know and this is the same with Ferrari this is the same with Porsche and for Lamborghini in this our second year we won the world championship so once you do that they kind of kick you out yeah like because they want it they want it to be like a place for you know you know drivers that are coming up can it go to so yeah that was a plus you gotta realize these are their best customers yeah yeah yeah there's you got to want to keep yes yeah you can't have one guy they're winning all the time and they're they kind of politely ask you hey yeah time to move on yeah yeah so then we moved in 2018 right 2018 yeah and then we moved into Imza yeah yeah the Imza WeatherTech Sports Car Championship we moved there in 2019 which here in North America that's kind of like our top level of sports car and endurance racing it's owned by NASCAR so the France family and all and that's a home of our biggest races like the 24 hours of Daytona and the 12 hours of sea bring and and that's where all the manufacturers come to compete against each other so you know the Lamborghini races against the Porsche and the against the Corvette and against the Ferrari and so yeah that's our first year racing there was in 2019 and then the we won that was about 2021 the 2020 yeah we won the 12 hours of sea bring you know and that was our first like big uh it was I mean that was our first big you know kind of marquee you know race that the 12 hours of sea bring is one of the triple crown of sports car racing which is you know sea bring Daytona and then obviously the 24 hours of them all be in the biggest but yeah we won that race in 2020 it was the last race of the year that year and uh man that was that was an awesome time with Andy and he was gonna come to that racing it's something come at the last minute he couldn't come and I had a feeling we were pretty competitive in the championship that year we had been on the podium a couple times but we hadn't won a race you know at this at this high level and um we were it's a 12 hour race and we qualified well I think we're in the top three or so in qualifying so I kind of knew we had a decent car and all uh started the race off we were always kind of around the top five we got up to the lead for a little bit and you know then you kind of fall back you know it's you know obviously there's lots of chaos but I remember about halfway through we were somewhere in the top five and I'm out of the car at this point my teammates are in and I'm texting with Andy he's back here watching it and you know he's what he watches like every minute he knows everything going like you last like why are we pitting right now like is everything okay you know like yeah I'm definitely that guy you know and I do when they're racing it's on TV I'm I don't sleep yeah he gets that he wants to know like the inside like well we pit now because we're saving some fuel or so I have to explain to him the strategy what's going on and um I remember like with six hours to go he's like dude we're gonna win and I'm like uh you know this is a long way to go there's a lot they can happen he's like no man I feel it we're gonna win this one and I just dismissed it I'm like I okay I'll keep you posted you know and I went in for like another stint or so I come back out and I was like two hours to go or so and we're in the lead you know we're going it's getting it's dark now see we're always in tonight and I'm done with my drive time my teammates are gonna end um Patrick Long was our teammate that year um who's in the new F1 movie you get a chance see it's uh he's got some plays himself in the museum is it quarry on the team now you're no quarry wasn't on that was the um yeah the next year yeah um but yeah no we were we were leading and we were in this battle with the Ferrari uh I remember in that the Ferrari was faster than us that year they just had pace on us and we were you know we were scrappy you know and uh Andy's texting with me we get down to the the the hour that's left and he's like dude I'm telling you we're gonna win and I'm like don't say it just don't like like don't jinx this man like you know you never know and um man there was uh there was a yellow flag because there was a crash with like 15 minutes to go and so that bunch is the whole field back up so now it was just kind of us in the Ferrari at front but then now there's like the whole field is now bunched up and they cleaned the wreck up and then you it's green flag again there's like 30 minutes left in the race and man we had a we had an awesome battle but uh we won the race cross the line finished it was super close race and man I just I can't you know it is like I'm not a guy I mean you're texted something like I'm not gonna say I told you so but I did tell you so what was that race that we won that oh fuck there was like a was that the one was that the race where there was like a wreck right at the end like right at the end that was the man yeah that's what that's the AMG car fucking wrecked I think so yeah yeah I think so man it's Mercedes I can't remember I just remember this Ferrari yeah yeah yeah yeah you guys recycled that engine because that car is sending the lot then that that engine the same engine went to next year and won the 21 day no it's like we know that no different engine the engine is in his house is in my house yeah yeah Porsche did a cool gift andy we got to keep the car you know from Porsche it's here at first form headquarters uh but they had told us at the time like hey we have to take the engine out to do some maintenance before it like goes into you know storage or you know display but uh yeah Porsche made up really awesome gift for me they they took the engine out that we won and they made the engine the whole block and everything into a coffee table and they gifted it to me and they took the six uh pistons out and they gave like the two other drivers they made the piston with like a frame and everything and like our lead engineer and the lead mechanic so everybody's got a piece yeah like a piston you know in the rod and then they gave me the uh still my basement my man cave you know today but um yeah that that was that was I had one other time that Andy had a you know I told you so when we won Daytona uh two years later in 2022 when the 24 hours Daytona um he was again like during the race like bro I fit we're winning this and I'm like oh god not again like we got the text to prove it yeah yeah the text so we got like dude we're we're gonna like I'm telling you we're gonna win and you know every time I'm out of the car I'm no we were talking about that before the fucking race we were cuz I you remember we put believe on the back of the car but on the back of the car yeah I had this whole yeah that was a facetime call to in the locker room before that yeah yeah with the team yeah we had Andy called to the we always have a team meeting you know before the race you know and Andy called in on facetime he'd spoke to all our mechanics all our you know guys and get around and he said guys you gotta you gotta believe like you said already believe I said already believe we are going to win we we're prepared we're ready and we're gonna win and it got everybody pumped you know and yeah we had out of that the team made a little sticker right on the back of the bumper we just put believe yeah and that was kind of our inner mantra that before you can do anything great you gotta believe and that all came from Andy and you know the race went up and down again you know we had to try to win that race a number of times before this oh yeah and it was yeah but yeah four times before it yeah and uh you know my candy this is one of the hardest races in the world you know I'm just yeah some dudes will race their whole lives and never win that race yeah yeah yeah yeah in fact most people yeah yeah it's I mean the guy who owned the team that we were racing with that year John Wright he's spent his entire career awesome awesome guy owns right motor sports uh he started as a mechanic for a team for Porsche worked his way up got to own his own team and I mean he's been racing professionally as a mechanic and team owner for 30 some odd years of his life and done Daytona every one of those years he never won and yeah I'm telling anyway hey man most people spend their career trying to win this race and uh he's like well we're we're gonna win and uh and dude and I'll never forget we still have it to this day we cross the finish line we won and I was right you know obviously it's very hectic and all of this and um we're going up to the podium I checked my phone and did tags he goes hey man yeah I love you brother and I want you to not always believe in you and one other thing we're gonna win the 24 hours of the mall it like immediately we we hadn't even gone to accept the trophy show from Daytona and Andy's already telling me we're gonna win the 24 hours of the mall and again I'm like oh yeah which started a whole new journey yeah so next year off we went to Europe trying to start to qualify for a Le Mans and uh and it took a couple years the first yeah the first two Le Mans did not go very well did not go very well what happened right I mean yeah that a lot a lot of shit can happen in 24 hours let me tell you or the first hour yeah or the first yeah gosh we the first year we crashed out I mean I think I made it into like hour two or something but I was in the car we crashed and actually another guy crashed yeah I arrived at another crash going on and I joined that crash it looked like a good time thought we thought we would all you know you know things happen like that's why these 24 hour races are so difficult to grow in I can't explain to you when you put there's this year at Le Mans there were 62 cars in the field we're in a couple different classes but there's 62 cars out there running around and you put 62 cars with type A personality drivers who all think they're the best in the world and are all you know trying to win the biggest race in the world and man shit happens yeah and and you're you're constantly in this environment of chaos that is uncontrollable and you know it's so easy for you to do everything right like our first year at Le Mans I like I was at the right spot on the track I was looking I did the right thing and just this other guy he crashed literally right in front of me I mean there was everyone's like oh Ryan don't take it so hard on yourself like no one could have done anything Max were stepping getting a avoid that crash you know you always think that there's something better you could do but a lot of times you know you can be prepared and and something happens out of your control and and that's it man you know I think people you guys got to understand like you you can literally like to finish a 20 even a 12 hour race or a six hour race much less a 24 hour race without a car without the car breaking without without you slipping on something on the track without flat tire flat tire without you know I mean dude there's so much shit that has to go right it's you know like you said somebody could crash in front of you no somebody could make a stupid move oh by the way you're in GT3 or GTD class which is the slowest class out there but also the hardest class to win in biggest class yes because the these you've got all these other cars like the prototype cars that are 10 million dollars a piece no flying by you and like it's to you dude you had there there is an element and I hate using this word but there is an element of pure luck there get to it without a doubt I mean without it out you have to say all the time like these big races you have to be prepared yeah right I mean and because you're going into this uncontrollable situation you have to execute on every single thing you can control like for the driver like my fitness I can control that I can I have to execute I can't be fatigued I can't be overweight I can't be you know I have to be perfect I can control that we can control our pit stops right we can control if we make sure that the wheel guns are working properly we can control that if we practice that in choreograph that we can control that the tire pressures are set correctly in the tires there's there's lots of things we can control and we have to execute on all those things because you're going to go out on track with these 61 other you know idiots all that you can't control right you can't control the weather you can't control track conditions you can't control you know safety cars when they come out so there's all these things that you just have to focus on the things that you can control and so you can be perfect on all those things and have a run of bad luck people don't understand dude like there's guys out there like there's a that you can basically buy your way into these things so in every race and this is no knock but I mean this is just the way racing is like you're going to be on the track with guys who are super professional f1 champions the best drivers in history and you're also going to be all the track with the dude next door that has a medical device company that fucking has enough money to run the race who doesn't know shit about racing so it's like dude it really is chaos there's there's there's always you know a handful of those guys yeah you know you know that you know that's what a lot of it takes the win I get a lot of those questions you know what what is it take and like how do you pull it off and honestly you got to have the thing that I think is rare is one there are definitely better teams than others so you've got to get to a position as a driver that you're on the radar of some of the best teams if you're shit slow or you don't have fun there's a fun there's a financial element like for for for me you know the rare combination that I've been able to spend the time to develop the skill set in order to drive the car fast that's one thing that is rare and then also I've been able to my business life through my relationship with you a sponsorship beat I you know some driver has to bring financial element to the deal whether that comes from your own money whether that comes from outside sponsorship you can find either of those two you can find super talented fast drivers that don't have a penny to their name or no sponsorship or no connections right they're not that valuable because the car someone has to pay for the car to go around or you can find guys that have tons of money catch rides money you know bit of liability a bit of you know bit night with this skill set so I've been able to devote a lot of my life you know on the business side the things to be able to bring some own financial you know means to a team been able to make great relationships with the guys like Indian have bring sponsorship to our team first forms the title sponsor and still you can have all that you can bring all that stuff but someone has to drive the car right at an extremely high level for you know hours and hours on end without a mistake so like the first year when we arrived I had all this we had the fun everything was here we had a good team I felt like I had done the work the car crashed with me in it so I yeah you know I can it wasn't my teammates fault I got you know and yeah you can say wrong place wrong time I was in the car man what's that like dude like how does that feel like for real it's because I mean when you do it when you crash for a second like when your team I've been where my teammate crashed and you're like should I didn't even get to drive like you know so like I'm gonna crash yeah I'm with the crash you know there's easy that then that feels bad yeah but dude when you're when you're at the wheel dude and like you crash it not like oh we gotta come in and fix it like you're out like I've been I've been because that's the first radio call is we're out yeah you're because they engineer they don't know they have sensors and stuff on the car they can tell the car stop to right you know they don't know what happened they're like oh maybe he can get it back yeah like when you properly crash it yeah it's not like how you see on f1 tv on the on the show where they the guys have so much data they know they they know yeah they I mean our guys have a tremendous amount of data but they they know if you stop it's not good can you get the car back as you you know right can you get it back to the pit lane but when you're sitting there and like the whole front is smashed off whatever and you got a tone like we're out you know and that all this work all this money all this time all this preparation it's all you know dude and the preparation is for a year like that's like you start prepping to run the Daytona that the minute after the Daytona finishes or the Lamar finishes like we obviously have other races throughout the year but like they're all too tough that's I mean everyone wants to win Lamar for sure is the biggest race in the world I mean like or like you can ask like any drive any formula what I mean look right now the talking formula one is like McLaren is making a new car to come to race at Lamar like Lando Norris and australian pastery for stappin's talking about he wants to come to Lamar like every every driver I don't care who you are you want to win the 24 hours of Lamar the Indianapolis 500 is up there you know the biggest race the Monaco Grand Prix and F1 but it is Lamar is one of I would say the top three races in the world that everyone wants to win it's the most viewed yeah the most viewed with motor race ever so that amount of pressure you have like everyone from F1 to NASCAR to Indycar like everyone wants to be at this race so the the preparation that goes in if you have and one you can't just sign up to come to Lamar you have to be invited so even as a driver or a team there's only so many slots that you know cars can physically fit into the in the pit lane so you have to earn an invitation and so even then to earn the invitation the amount of preparation that goes into being ready you know for the race both from a person else standpoint in the car like I can tell you our car at Porsche they work on that car I mean every single part of that car has been gone over time and time and time again and like we have like a splitter like the front splitter that's in the front I can't talk to you about a lot of the secret things but I can tell you like they're the front splitter we have the rear wing that we have there are certain parts of the car that are limonly and I mean they are they are designed exactly for this one race right to make the limon is kind of interesting because we have these super long straightaways like the Mulsana straight where we're going top speed for a really really long time and then there's also super high speed corners and then some very very tight first year corners so the track when you first look at it looks kind of simplistic when you're there it's like the combination of everything you have to have a car it's fast on the straights because if you're not you're just going to get passed and it's easiest place to pass you have to have a car that has enough down force to be stable in the really high speed corners like these ones down here at the end corners like 20 and stuff they're here those are called the Porsche curves do you enter those cars like those corners in fifth gear and you're going through there at 140 to 130 miles an hour and then you have corners like the final chicane so those are called the Ford chicane's you're in first gear in first gear you're barely crawling there's these huge curves that you got to climb and go under so the car has to perform at low speed medium speed high speed and it also has to be fast right so it's from an engineering standpoint it's super hard to have a car that's good at all of those things and you'll never have one that's perfect at all of them you'll always have some you know inadequacy but yeah that's what's so kind of special and unique about you know developing the car that you know can be good around that track but if you can be faster you can be fast anywhere let me actually this how how hard was it for you to learn that skill of just trusting you're other teammates right like whether it's pit crew whether it's like your your engineers like having to have that faith trust in somebody else to control something you can't control I mean that I um I think I mean I mean I beat the business analogy horse but I mean I've been a part of large organizations for so much of my life that you have to trust if anyone that if Andy for a seller can run all of first form completely by himself there'd be no need for these hundreds of employees here right you know so no one can do anything this complex and great you know on their own in the racing car there is something that is just I don't say it's balls or blind faith like when the engineer is telling you hey um the Porsche curves you can enter that you know at 140 and you're like okay that sounds good and then you arrive there in the real car and you're or I'd say even first on the simulator we do try things first on the simulator and like okay engineer says 140 miles an hour at this corner and you arrive there and you're like 160 170 flat and you think oh my it let me tell you it's a hard corner in your break and you downshift twice and you turn you look down you're like 110 and you're and you're thinking oh gosh I'm on the limit here and you go back to your notes and goes wait 140 he said um okay let's try again you know and you and you crash and you crash and you crash and you're like called engineer back like hey man um question and I know you said you know so the simulator helps with these types of things then you arrive to Le Mans and you get there for the first test egg is this this track is mostly country roads it's there's there's only a small bit of it that's like a proper racing track and then you're using the rest of the country roads in France and this again the race is a hundred years old right um but a hundred years ago they only raced on on the country roads so you can't just go here and practice anytime you want they they only close the roads for this you know one race a year and so you're flying on the road the first time like the first practice day and the in the tracks always dirty at the first time because it's a it's a it's a normal highway there's trash on the sides and stuff right and you go flying towards that corner and man let me tell you you know yes you do have to have a lot of faith in your engineers and what they tell you is capable of the car and and uh that takes some time I mean that that takes you gotta you gotta make like is he lying to me is he sure like how sure is it dude I take a little bit of time from an amateur very amateur perspective I found it very helpful to have someone telling me what to do when I was when I was yeah because like dude for me at a very am very very very amateur level now I you almost have to have someone telling you what to do because you have no idea what the fucking car will do and if you trust him yeah you'll be fast we we have a ton of data you know these cars like like you when you and I drove you can I'm I'm just like you I'm much more comfortable if I can see that okay another driver on the same day on the same car he broke at this point I'm breaking earlier the guy didn't crash he made it you know I'm I'm I've been able to just get myself wrapped around really quickly what one man can do another man can do right so but I'm usually not the first person to go do it in some of these situations I let you know my teammate does and now the good thing is there's a lot of like amateur drivers that you can show them the data over and over and they'll spend a week that like go in there and they'll never make it to the breaking point right I've been really quick I like I'm welcome if you show me hey Ryan your teammate breaks here at the 50 it doesn't take me four laps or three like like I go the next lap I will the learning curve is short is very short yeah I inherently know what one man can do another man can do so that's whether that's stupidity bravery you know I don't know but I've just I've arrived when you say though like that's one of the most important elements to I mean to to be coming a great driver quickly it's it's easy to say it you're ready to say it let me tell you when you like on like in this world of simulators right they're awesome by the way I mean these simulators are actually really really good but there's always that element on the simulator you can always just hit that magic reset button after you crash and yeah it costs no money yeah you're you don't have to go to the hospital you know you know you can reset when you arrive at the real car there's real consequences you know you're this real speed and that's a real concrete wall right there you know that's the difference everyone can say oh yeah break it the 50 meter mark no problem yeah easier that some people can do it and some some people can't I mean dude it's a parallel to business too I mean how fast can you learn how fast can you can you watch someone else do something and then know that you can do it too or do you say oh but he's an anomaly or that's a special circumstance or we're not them you know because none of that shit is true dude it just isn't you've got to be able to learn quick yeah another thing in business that relates is a lot of people don't realize a race car if you drive it for one hour on one set of tires and you see a racing driver who can run virtually the same lap time for over the one hour or very very close to it that is such an unbelievable skill set because the tires are consistently wearing out every lap that you go the tire is less grip and when you go for one hour let me tell you those last five laps at the end is so incredibly hard because it's like driving on ice there's literally like no grip left in the tire and for you to achieve anywhere close to the lap time that you did at the first of the few laps is really really hard it is possible because when you start at the first lap you have a full tank of fuel fuel weighs a lot when you know you have it all right the fuel is burning off over the hour so the car is actually getting lighter as the time goes on but the grip is going away so you start with a lot of grip super security but you're just slow because it's kind of heavy and sluggish then the car gets super light and nimble but you have no grip towards in the best drivers can achieve a similar lap time all the way across there's a big parallel and business right when the conditions are perfect and everything's fine and everything's and you can achieve one result in you're in sales in the month of May and you can achieve a good result being able to achieve that same result maybe in the month of January with you know or when it's a different trend is a different this is more difficult right the skill set so there's the the only constant is change right and that's for sure in racing and for sure in business you know it's just another reason why I love it so much in life right you what what you can do now doesn't mean you can do it later and if you really pray if you really develop the skill set it is possible yeah man it takes in the really the really really great championship people actually perform much better when the circumstances are much more difficult so they're the best drivers yeah when it rains they're great they're everyone talks about air in center yeah man in the right I don't care what driver you ask driving a racecar in the rain with like slick tires you we do have rain tires you can put on but a lot of times it's dry and then the rain comes but you have to dry tires on let me tell you dry tires on a wet track I can't explain to you how slick it I mean you you can think to touch the gas pedal you don't actually do it just your brain thinks I wonder if I should hit the gas now bam your spoon out backwards in the wall I mean it's so difficult and air in center was like he was the man you know in the rain and the the the feel that it takes I don't he was unwirly okay but man that's a this is also like a you know another analogy like sometimes I mean out of the blue it can it can rain yeah you know and chaos here it goes from fucking perfect conditions everything's good yeah and then it's chaos in a lot in the driving world a lot of drivers are so the right oh god it's raining and we have to pit we have to pit now and you know the pickers like dude you can pit we're gonna go to last place like survive you know can you survive in Lamay it's super specific Lamay the race track is like over eight miles long so almost nine miles all the time when it rains in Lamay it very rarely rains the whole track the track is so big it can usually rain only in one section and the pit crew they all know that they have radar and everything comments you arrive and you're like I've done it I have arrived like oh my god we have to pit now it's like monsoon they're like you got a survive and if you can make it past tetra Rouge or what the next sector it's actually dry and you're like you know and I remember this was last year it came huge rain it towards the end of the lap and I mean I was surviving I was surviving and a lot of the guys I was racing with they all peeled into the pit lane and and our guys told me to stay out like it's gonna dry up and I mean I didn't question them but I did ask like are you sure like everyone's going in and they're like no trust me and sure enough we cycled to the lead everyone came in for wet tires I made it you know several corners later and there and then it was the sun so we kept going and man we made a big lead right then because all the guys that came for wet tires guess what they had to do when the rain stopped they had to come back into the pits again to get dry and so it's such a good parallel for business because like yeah dude because the people who truly get ahead in business and who win are people that when the chaos comes they don't freak the fuck out stay the course yeah they keep moving and actually you know if if they're I think you know there is an element of being wired for that but the best operators that I've seen and probably the best drivers that you've seen are very similar and that they will make a map like it's kind of it's kind of a paradox people who are truly great at what they do when things are perfect will you usually be hyper almost insane about how much better it should be yeah but then when shit gets fucking crazy those people calm down dude they're like I'm super calm chaos is happening tragedy happened the storm came out of nowhere on the racetrack the storm came out of nowhere in your business but it's here and those people they they go from being like almost hyper aggressive and like annoying and intolerable in terms of like their aggressiveness and their you know like yeah fuck we gotta look out for this or that or this to like hey everything's good yep we're good we've got just got to do this and this and this and I think that's a trait I don't know if that's something that I don't know if that's something that people can learn but I do believe you can get better at it yeah because it takes an actual effort yeah everything in your body is what I mean is yeah like you I don't know if it's something you can become great great at without having it be wired into you but I do think it's something that people can get better at hey yeah I would agree I mean I would agree there's like like you know we all it erot and santa yeah sure this guy was born with some things that other humans just haven't been born with I tell you it like and I'm this way in business on the racetrack when it starts raining I immediately get excited yeah deep in I know this yeah it's about now I can make a difference yeah dude and the business is the same like fucking everybody's get like dude in a bad economy or a you know like like like COVID like COVID comes yeah everybody freaks the fuck out what do I do my my main thought when COVID happened and I know it was yours too because we talked through it was like all right dude everybody else is gonna fuck up yep we can jump miles ahead yep we can pass a lot of by the way both of us did yeah in our businesses right yep it's it's uh man it's it's there's we always talk about there's two types of drivers I think there's also two types of entrepreneurs yeah when the rain comes it's either oh shit yeah we have to pick we like oh god what are we gonna do and then there's those that smell the blood in the water yeah yeah let's be fair we we both have tremendously talented and skilled people around us too that are also that way yep yeah they're sir so you got Justin I got Sal and Jason and Chris and yeah and then each other a common trade amongst all those people yeah they're all great operators that I think they also if they were on the racetrack and it started raining yeah they'd be like this is it yeah yeah you know I heard Chris is a terrible driver though uh Chris is I don't know I can't tell if Chris is a great driver or a terrible driver but I know this I hate riding with him I fucking hate it yeah yeah yeah there's something about his his casual nature of driving very fast that almost I'm like yeah you don't know what you're doing here do you like yeah I'm not a good passenger almost a bro no no you drive like okay like how how how hard is it for you to leave the track at the track when you're you're driving down I'm I'm I'm always pretty good I know I'm always pretty good I tell you there's there's two people around me they're usually with me at the racetrack all the time the ones my father he's comes the other races and he's the worst at this the other's Justin he's there they'll be at a long race you know whatever eight hour race 24 hour race and no matter what the situation is usually I'm a bit tired afterwards and so I'm not driving the rental car back to the airport or wherever going my dad my dad is like when he gets in the rental truck it's like it's his stint man he's in like he is fired up dude I mean we are like breaking every traffic rule he slams on the brakes like that bro like no that's it's fine I've just you know I've been and he says it doesn't know watching racing less 24 hours like I'm ready to go you know like he's like this oh dude that's hilarious you know I'm like dad bro like the race is over man yeah that's funny that's hilarious looking car though oh yeah oh well there that's a whole another thing we could talk about we we developed that that was art that's been our strategy I mean the blue you know obviously this is the first form blue in our pantobat I mean I mean I'm sure everybody it drives any kind of race car says all minds the best looking car but I mean we in we get so many compliments from fans that this is the bad ass ass looking race car and we get something comments on like how bright it is and the sun it shows up so bright you can see our car like on TV it just it picks up the lights so well and you could definitely see even when it's just panning across yeah yeah you always see the first car you know that this year my wife and son got the opportunity at La Monde to ride in the good year blimp they got to go up during the race is going on and they have these videos from the blimp of you know the cars coming by and dude you can see our coming our car coming like all the way down the mosaI like coming out of you it's so bright you know but it's become iconic now I think you know we're building something that'll be look back on you know especially now we're going to have three different porches that of one the three largest races in the world you know and the fact they were all blue they're all slightly different in design we change the design a little bit but they're all the blue first form Porsche you know well dude it's like we talked you know when we first started the first few years we switched the livery every year yeah we were kind of trying to find our way about you know where we wanted to be and then I can remember you and I talking extensively because we're both hyper detailed about this that like we wanted specifically to develop a look and feel to the car that would be lasting and iconic so for it's about Richard Petty's car yeah yeah so like if you don't ask car everybody knows the number 43 STP car from all the way from the 60s till now and that was kind of our goal is to create a livery that yeah it might change a little bit yeah but you know 20 years from now they're going to have hot wheels and models and you know right everybody knows that car yeah no matter what driver ever drives that car and livery that's the that's a Richard Petty that's right STP yeah but I think we're doing a good job I mean I can tell you now we're racing we race in Asia this year we race in the Asian LaMas series race in Abu Dhabi you know in the Middle East and in the world endurance championship which is what LaMas a part of which that's the next goal by the way you know ask when that's going after LaMas to win the world championship but in this championship that we're in you know we're racing in Europe we race once here in America we race in Japan we race in the Middle East and this car even when we arrive even if people aren't as familiar with first form or they know they like oh this that's the blue first form Porsche they know about it that's the first form Porsche that's what you know fans Japanese it's so cool to be in Japan or to be in the Middle East and people associate it you know that's why I knew that man we've created you know we're not done no but we are doing a good job along the way yeah creating a brand in a association Porsche is a big part of it you know but we're creating this association of the bright blue well dude and what a better I mean there's not a better brand to be attached to I mean Porsche is the most the world's most valuable luxury brand people a lot of people don't know that yeah you know to me they're I mean I also have a biased opinion but yeah yeah and what you and I are both fans of lots of cars yeah I mean you know but I don't think we would I don't think either one of us would debate over who makes the best car I mean for me to line a line if you were going to only have one car yeah there could only be one I truly think of Porsche 911 we can all we would you and I would disagree on which one which one yeah there's a lot I agree versions but yeah you had to you know go to the grocery store and you know maybe you know and also turn up at the racetrack and do a good lap time and drive a backcountry road and that it's somewhat be comfortable drive across country what I would I would choose a there's no question the design hasn't changed since since the early 70s late 60s people are racing car I mean it's yeah it's gotten longer wider there's some different things but yeah it's the same formula based now just while we're on the topic because you've owned all the 9-11s I've owned most of the 9-11s which ones are favorite that's a tough one but if I had to pick one I do really like the 997 model which was my favorite is the last year is made 2011 2011 I like both the GT3 RS 4.0 that year and also the GT2 RS is a turbo but those two cars the physical size of the car yeah was much smaller than what we have now and to me it was just the most balanced you know the 2 RS with the turbo is the fastest it has most power the 3 RS it's naturally aspirated I just either one that I would say that's my favorite I think they're I mean those are both justifiable as yeah yeah yeah they got more comfortable bigger but to me that was the best I've also owned both those cars and I yes so what yours dude awesome you know I I think the 991 2 RS my you know my acid green car yeah yeah that that to me even though you know the purers will say oh it's PDK it's not manual yeah the amount of power that the car makes and the nimbleness of the car yeah for me feels right um you know the other cars they can be under power that's what I'm saying they feel slow to me and and you know that's not that's just because of the other shit that we get to drive yeah right like we both have the fastest cars in the world you've got a super sports you're on I've got the pure sport yeah you know everything feels like once you once you've driven a P1 and once you've driven a super sport or a pure sport everything feels slow like slow slow and then like but that but that 9-11 still feels quick and and that's what I think I like about it because even with the 2 RS manual the 997 it still felt you know people like oh the widow maker yeah to who you know like yeah that's how it felt to me at the time maybe yeah right yeah yeah I still like them I think they're great cars um but yeah that's what that's what I would pick it's it's in pause I get that question all the time like what's your favorite or can you only pick one I mean that's what's so great about cars they're all they're all so different and hopefully no one has to pick just one you know what not but it's a great question you know yeah man they're just they're they're so different they're they're so many I think we both agree on what the greatest portion is though yeah I mean yeah probably the greatest car yeah a career GT I mean which is cool because I actually own his old career GT that's where I got mine from and then he got a different one I had to get a different one yeah I made you know we all make mistakes right now I made I had a lapse in judgment what takes you back and yeah yeah no takes you back these yeah but I was fortunate to be able to you know you're just later get another one I realized you know how great a car but yeah you call me like man I'm wanting to buy a career GT yeah like I said you know shit man I was thinking about so much I'm like done yeah yeah shortest call yeah cuz it was dude it was the color I wanted everything black yeah black I'm black yeah that cars that car special so dude you know switching from you know really what we what we came here to talk about um let's talk about the mod dude you know this yeah we two weeks ago yeah yeah yeah so this was our third year you know attempting it and I say I came in to this race I don't think you ever expect to to win a race like this I mean you know we surrounded ourselves with what I think is the best team they're the defending champions from Le Mans the year before the grillo car win last year no it was it was it was just it wasn't the grillo they said the grillo car only they run with only top factory drivers like at the Nürburgring okay no it wasn't the grillo but it was it was their team yeah I was with a different you know bronze driver who was who was the best they they last year they won the championship you know man tie Porsche and they also won Le Mans and so my teammate Richard Leads who was also my teammate in Daytona when we won the 24 hours of Daytona he won Le Mans last year with man tie and when I came you know back had the opportunity to come back with man time bring you know first form Richie was available to come be my teammate so he's one two in a row yeah so he's won Le Mans two years in a row and Richie's the guy in the middle there he's now one of the winningest drivers ever at Le Mans he is one Le Mans six times holy shit one at six times he's been on the podium several other times but I think the winningest drivers won it seven times so he's won away from tying that record the A's one two years in a row so anyway I knew like how does he Richie is just about our age yeah he probably won't like me don't he's like he had a great response in the press conference like Richie what do you have to be you know win Le Mans six times in a row and he said well the first thing you have to be is very old they're doing it so many times but uh now man Richie uh you know having him it's special you know where I one day tonal with him and then I was able to have him as my teammate you know coming here man I knew I had the co-drivers um also the third driver we have on our team uh his name is Ricardo Pere he's a silver rated driver um wait I mean do we we went after this guy trying to get Ricardo as our third driver you know uh pretty ambitiously he he's been uh the last couple years he's been one of the fastest drivers at Le Mans specifically so like he's a bit of a specialist I mean he's a great driver he's Italian it's won many races and championships around the world but at Le Mans he's like he's like the man on cheer speed so uh we put this team together uh with with this race like specifically in mind you're Richie's one at the most Ricardo's one of the quickest and and then me coming in I've as as bronze drivers go I've been one of the top in the world last few years so um any team I don't know if you know the rules in Le Mans uh all drivers are rated by category and it's based on experience right uh you know we're all professionals but it's based on experience you gotta have one uh uh gold or platinum rated driver you can be either one platinum is reserved for like formula one you know drivers or if you work directly for a manufacturer um Richard leads this platinum uh you have to have one silver rated driver and you have to have one bronze rated driver and there exactly what you make I'm the bronze rated driver I would have the least experience of these guys on the team Ricardo's a silver and the the trick in racing is you we're all trying to be the absolute best in our category right if I get a little too like for me if I were to ever become silver one day I would not be very valuable as a driver because there's lots of really really great silver same with Ricardo like when you go kind of you step to that next level you can kind of could be on the bottom tier of the next level so every team is trying to get the absolute best bronze and absolute best silver and the absolute best platinum you know at that specific time and um I think we achieved that I think I've I think my performance I've been right up there in the top three or so bronzes in the world last uh you know few years and Ricardo I think is definitely on that verge of probably becoming a gold real soon and so we got a good combination here but yeah the week started like we we were decent uh there in our class is the largest category there's uh 24 cars in the in the class all different manufacturers and we were kind of in the practice sessions hovering around the back half of the top 10 really we were each time between like fifth to 10th um better than the average but dude we were like everyone knew it from the start uh the Ferrari and the Lexus which actually Toyota but the Lexus were just like so fast I mean they had they had more top speed than everybody else their lap times were the best like everyone was talking about it through the the practice sessions and I mean they were a lot faster than us and we were push I mean we were all out you know you kind of can never tell in practice or or everyone just people holding back they don't want to show their whole cards just yet you know and so you don't really know we were kind of lean we were we were kind of showing it and we the talks just went into hey this might not be our year you know Porsche on one last year this year let's get good points for the championship even though these guys are fast you know like we said in 24 hours a lot of shit can happen a lot of fast cars can have issues and break but our goal for sure was the podium we thought if we executed perfectly and we made no mistakes we would have a shot at the podium but that was realistically the goal I definitely was at calling you were calling homes like I mean this is a year but we're gonna smoke these guys so that I mean that was our mindset you know going in and we got a qualifying we had a good qualifying I you each driver has to qualify the the bronze has to qualify then the silver then the gold you kind of it's an elimination style kind of like Formula One I qualified P3 and was really close to the top you know bit surprising you know Ricardo did the same he qualified P3 out of the silvers and then Richard went with all the platinum's and goals and he was P5 but they were all like like super super close so it was actually like the closest we had been you know to the to the front so that's where we started the race was from fifth you start where the final where the platinum's you know qualify so yeah we started from fifth so yeah that was our goal I mean we just we thought the podium would be kind of the the goal but I would say we spent the first six hours of the race well how how how close just so people understand it's eight mile track yep okay how close are the times from qualifying first to third to fifth oh I mean we can pull it but just off the top of my head a really fast qualifying lifetime if you're going under four minutes is is is really fast I want to say our pull laps were in the close to three fifty five yeah okay and the I mean the top I know my qualifying that I was P3 the top 11 or 12 were all within the same second okay so we're within 10 sometimes hundreds okay of a second so that's what I'm trying to from the perspective I'm trying to let everybody understand yes you're talking about an eight-mile course there's 32 corners so 32 opportunities to break and accelerate you know or not right and the top 11 cars are in the 355 mark within the same second yeah yeah yeah so we're we are got it right here we're constantly pushing for yeah tenths of a second yeah so that's that's just so you guys that don't know racing yeah that's how close it is well and we get a lot of questions a lot of guys like hey what's the difference in a bronze like Ryan versus you know a platinum like richi and Lamas bigger track obviously three minute most of our tracks are much shorter right um but you know the difference from me to richi was probably one ish second or is this ish so much man tie I did a three fifty seven two and richi did a three fifty five one air riches the last yeah yeah so yeah within two seconds that's crazy yeah it's because most tracks I'm within one second a richi but that's also about a two minute lap time so this is a four minute lap yeah so here I was under two seconds I was 1.9 seconds from the guys brought one of the greatest drivers in the world you know so that's what it takes to you know be a be the least experienced guy you got to still be within like one second right of the top you know yeah um oh bro and got but here's the thing how long has richi been racing oh his whole life okay yeah so you've got a guy yeah just so we understand just I think this is important to point out you've got a guy that's probably been racing since go carts okay his whole life and you have a guy who's been racing for less than 10 years nine years so there's one within you know right there next to him so like that most guys will spend this is the point that needs to be made most guys will spend their entire life trying to make that time up that gap between richi and ryan they will spend their entire life to get to make up that less than a second or one second or two say this most most you know never will that's how close that's how that's how precise and close racing really is what what I've found what's so crazy what I've found is you know through like you know nine years yeah you can get I mean I mean I so I can get within a second okay over to me and and dude we're talking one second spread out over 20 corners yeah I mean bro is a it's less than it at like hundreds of a difference in the breaking and the acceleration right in each corner right less obviously less than a belikan if you were watching a video of their feet right next to each other it would look virtually identical look identical yeah look identical um and then what I've found is you can get within that second but let me tell you the last half a second the last five tenths this is what takes a lifetime yeah the the guys that that do this at that that that that have dedicated their life they the dedicated their entire life to a half a second half a second more than what someone who could come in much later in life you do it and but let me tell you that last half second yeah it's hard yeah yeah it's very hard it's very very hard I just think I just think it's important to point that out that because like as an average you know I flip on the television and then there's a race car is going around the truck you don't think about it like that yeah yeah we're we're going a lot of times you know you watch the video back and you look at the data and you're like calling them you know one second or nine tenths like where could it be it's never in one spot or two slots it's fractionally around you know you know each corner and then to be able to do that and execute it like we said over an entire hour with tires changing fuel changing weather changing temperature changing that's one hour yeah then times 24 yeah but in the middle of the night yeah it's it's that's where the skill set comes in so we start the race I say I'm breaking down pretty so this was honestly a pretty straightforward race you know when it's kind of going your way you kind of it's kind of going your way we spent we spent the first six hours I would say in the top five and kind of kind of I don't want to say you ran four hour spent yeah I start the race four four hours which I did the only quadruple stint in the entire race no one else did a quadruple stint I'll say it wasn't planned yeah the plan was for me to run a triple which that's about it's pretty hard that's pretty hard yeah a lot of a lot of guys most guys will run double since so like two hours at a time this plan for me to do a triple my physical fitness has been strong you know I'd say compared to most other drivers so you know it's been a strength of ours and they knew the the more I could drive towards the start saves our fastest drivers for the end and saves them more fresh right so they called me at hour three and I was we were hanging around that top five you know and they're like hey Ryan you know how how are you feeling in the car I'm like man I'd be honestly like I'm feeling pretty good like we're and I you know it's fun when you see the you know you see the leaders and we're doing well and and I'm like man I feel great you know if you guys have it helps like I'm good to do another one and they they so let us come back to you and they rummaged around I guess for a little while they came back like hey man if you're okay like it would be a big advantage if you could do you know four and so the man of it's an advantage let's go and I did it it was it was awesome we gained a lot of space there and what that did that set off I think what it eventually helped us win the race yeah a lot of the other teams as we got towards the night they had to put in their bronze drivers in because they were running their faster drivers early where we it saved we put in our you know platinum you know and silver drivers against a lot of their bronzes so that enabled us to jump up quite a bit and then the next thing that did a big difference was the night time I mean the night at Le Mans it's some of the most difficult you can ask any driver I mean it's not like Daytona the 24 hours of Daytona I'm not gonna sit here and tell you it's easy it's not easy okay but as far as driving in the night it's extremely well lit it's damn near the daytime I mean all the big you know from the speedway you've got all the lights from NASCAR and it's basically like driving in the day let me tell you something the backcountry roads in the mid west of France are not well lit like my first year when I went up for the first night practice I came out of the pit lane the pit lane it's all lit ups it's like the racing track there so it's like Daytona it's all lit and you go the first three corners it's all lit and then you you merge out onto the moulson straight and this is where you leave the the racing track and go on the go on the country roads and I was you know radio silence for a little while and I'm driving down the moulson straight I went to the first chicane and I'm on my way to the second chicane and I called on the radio and I'm like guys it is dark I can't explain to you guys is this supposed to be this way you can watch all the video like we have video you can go on YouTube and watch my videos are on YouTube right now you can watch you know my laps and seven night and you have a like oh yeah it kind of looks dark but it'll probably be okay like bro what what got me is that you know we have headlights but the headlights obviously they shine in front of you right well when you're on a racetrack and you're about to come to a corner the front of you's fine you can see out there but all the time like you're in the day you you need to see where you break but then your eyes are going to the corner so let's say it's a right hand corner your eyes are going over to the right looking for the apex well bro it is it's pitch black you know so you're you're breaking and you look and you're like I think we turn now and then the headlights move and they're like nope too early you know further so you have to it's nothing but time you have to develop time and you have to look at things on the road that you can see like right in front of you to give you visual clues of where the turn-in spot is you can see the break points like there's you recognize signs and different things on the road where you know where you have to break but the turn-in point this has to come from just muscle memory and and feeling and stuff so anyway back to my original story driving at the night is very difficult most bronze drivers don't drive at night most teams they drive their bronze drivers a little bit in the day it's start and then they put in their silvers and their platinum's to go back and forth back and forth all night long and then when their sun comes up the next day the bronzes go in you know when it's the sun is back out I drove those four hours to start that helped get us ahead and then I drove it gets dark kind of late there around 10 o'clock at night actually it's pretty it's the summer solstice so longest day of the year I drove going into the night so as the sun was going down I drove from 10 to about midnight where no other bronze driver was out there then and I came out for just a couple hours and I went back in at 3.30 a.m. and I drove from 3.30 into the sun coming up some kind of early around 5.30 so I did like a it was a triple stint that went into the sun and again no other bronze drivers out there we were in the top three both those times we were in third second first and like the team was on the radio like Ryan your pace is is doing great like the Ferrari had caught me we were in second the Ferrari caught me it had their platinum driver in it and they're right Ryan this is the platinum don't don't like no don't risk anything if he's faster just don't fight let him go because they still have to do like four hours of their bronze driving catch him and you're done in the next hour like you're you know so I did the most driving at night which ended up being like a major step forward because then when the sun came up I was done like I had completed all my I have to drive seven and a half or eight hours of the 24 I was done and every other team still had their bronzes had to come in and bro we went straight to the front we passed with a lead when the sun was coming up and then we led the entire rest of the race which is a huge advantage because it keeps you out of the shit oh yeah oh leading is always better yeah in the back but yes pretty much other race went so dude what was it like you know when we won I mean I know what it was like because for me but like I mean what was the light dude man that dude the I mean I had a similar feeling in Daytona you know but when you know we were leading that big lead but you're constantly counting down every minute every hour and the the the factory Ferrari was in second and they were the only car towards into the race it really had the speed they were again they were the fastest since we had turned up and man I'm like golly if anything happens to the car and this Ferrari is super fast and but we had this kind of manageable about one minute lead you know and that we just kind of managed all the way through so you're obviously worried about something just like by chance happening to the car a flat tire or mechanical issue but our car was perfect you know the whole time again back to that preparation work but you know I would say the last stint for Richie which was right at an hour like probably 50 minutes to go we did our final pit stop and our engineer was super good on the team he's talking to the pit crew before you know Richie was coming in for the final pit stops like guys this is the last one you know for the whole 24 hours make sure every wheelgun is perfect fuel man make sure test the fuel the fuel flow make sure as perfect take your time we're normally trying to do it as fast as we can right he's like we have a one minute lead we gave up it like what 20 30 seconds we gave up almost 25 seconds because we read he said take your time make sure the wheels are taught we even added a bit of oil to the engine just we didn't have to just just a precaution you know took our time with the fuel flow looked over the car just and then set him out you know so we we lost some of that minute lead but on purpose right just keeping everyone calm but yeah I was there with my my son was sitting right next to me my old a son in my wife you know Whitney was there my dad was in the garage Justin and man dude I was like I was there I mean you know it couldn't stop shaking my feet I'd stand up sit down walk around back up drinking energy during coming up I don't think he's sick because I don't always helps yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but dude it was it was it was awesome I mean I you know should yeah I'd I'd never thought you know we could win this race I mean just just to come and compete in it you know it's one thing but yeah when he when he crossed the line I mean dude it just the garage erupted you know I lost it was I get my son my wife you know it's just it's you know for me it's like you know you dedicate your life to you know perfection we all want to be perfect right you know we're all trying to leave a legacy and you know and for me having my son there that I it's my hope like seeing his dad do something at that level it I mean dude as a that you know it's you know hit me and I like no one no one can ever take that away from us right we're in the history now bro you're etched in your etched your name is etched in history yeah all those posters like you have in your garage yeah we'll have that we're there's gonna be a poster of our right you know now so yeah man it's hard hard to put in the words but yeah it's fucking awesome dude yeah and you sent me the screenshot you're like oh out of way yeah from back in however me three years we were gonna win the ma you know yeah you're right again yeah dude well I mean look uh winners fucking win bro and you know it's it's I think people I think people think there's a there's a magical element to it and I don't think that's what it is at all I think it's being meticulous and relentless towards whatever it is you choose that you want to go towards and I don't think that success in business or success in racing or or obviously there's limitations you know a five foot one person is highly unlikely to be the MVP of the NBA right um but outside of that I really think it comes down to like just an obsessive commitment to achieving whatever it is that you've decided you're going to achieve and and it's not it's not a oh I'd kind of like to do this it's it's an obsession yep and for you guys listening you know I can't I can't articulate the amount of hours that Ryan and I have spent on the phone talking about winning this race I mean over the years it's I wouldn't even know where to start yeah yes and uh to see to see you do it bro it's just it's one of the cool it's one of the coolest moments of my life I can't imagine what it's like to actually have done it you know and and to stand out there on that podium with fuck what 100,000 people I'll never forget that I mean I hope I haven't rewatched the the TV yeah yeah I hope they showed it no but did it justice when we walked out on the podium it's it's an F1 style podium that's elevated you know and when we walked out they opened the track up after the race for all the fans can come down like on the the front stretch and there was no end to them bro it was as far as I could see yeah wall-to-wall people I mean the race is one of the most highest attended sporting events in the world right up there with Indy 500 and um I think it's like 370,000 people or something and I and it looked like they were all right there we're there you know and I you know you don't have it for me I mean you know for you know like you and in this company you guys you know believed to me like at a super early stage when I was just starting out and racing into I can't tell you the amount of pride to stand up there um we had some screaming freedom you know energy there with us and we didn't know if like the officials were gonna try to take them from us or whatever so we we kind of snuck them within our suits like as we went up but to stand there like with the can you know wearing our hat you know with our logo on top of the podium at without that when the world's largest takeout racing yeah it's one of the world's largest sporting events yeah it's it for me it was that super bowl type of moment right you know and to be able to do that when I walk back in this building you know too yeah and see all these employees and all these team members same with mountain motor sports our motorcycle dealerships the amount of pride you know that we were able to you know help create for all of these employees yeah customers how many customers that they have reached out like dude we've all loved first former we love mountain ocean but like now we know someone who's one you know I mean it's just it's a tremendous amount of pride well dude and I you know we haven't ever talked about this publicly but in 2022 2022 it was a 2022 or 23 what that you know there was an opportunity for you to invest in the company and Ryan's actually people don't know this but like you know you own a small purse a small portion of the brand at this point yeah so you know to get up there and be a part of the brand after all these years of being a fan of the brand yeah it had to be fucking I mean dude yeah I mean it means I mean it means a lot I mean to be able to like say you gave me that opportunity a couple years ago even you know I'm a small part you know yeah big massive thing that you well actually a really big part because you know having you as a partner for the for the the knowledge and the experience and the strategy and all of those things is invaluable so you know it's it's uh for us to go from you know where we are now to where we're going it's oh yeah it's fuck the skills needed yeah well we're uh yeah this there's there's there's gonna be a long story you know written about form one day yeah we're we still have many more chapters in that for sure right but uh yeah no I'm I'm I'm super gracious of mostly the friendship right yeah absolutely our friends you know before anything else and Sal and and Jason and Chris I mean all you guys give me the opportunity to be more involved with the business it's uh there isn't a business you know um that I believe in more outside of the one that you know I started with Justin um but uh you know if I could have you know if you ask me a question Ryan you have the opportunity to invest in any company in the world any company man there's not one that I would want to and see more promise and upside it then first form I mean I well dude it wouldn't feel right it wouldn't feel right doing it without you at this point I mean that's what it comes down to you know we've been I mean fuck how many conversations have we had over the years about the the company strategy not just the race strategy you know I think I think people you know like you've been one of my biggest you know uh I don't know you know sounding boards advisors you know partners without officially being part of the company for a decade you know and people people um you know people don't know that but you know I I wouldn't feel right I don't think anybody here would feel right doing it without you well you know it means a lot I I'd say we're I get one question all the time about uh you know we have so many fans and people look up the first form and I get a question like Ryan how how on earth did you get first form as a sponsor and I have the same you know answer back to them and I think this is a great thing for a lot of young people to hear if you're ever looking to get investment or a sponsorship from a company the number one way you can do that is to give more than you're asking to receive and you said this a lot I've always tried from the first time that you and I became friends and this is in any friendship that I have I I try to give and share more than I asked in return and I do it in a way that I'm not even hoping or expecting or yeah I do it just selflessly and I think if you can truly master that ability to in any relationship you have whether it's you know uh you know friendship whether it's business related or whether you're trying to build some of a attract a sponsor right you have to find ways that you can give on people so I don't have money or I don't have you know giving is is a lot of ways like you said I I was there as a soundboard yeah a lot of times yeah it's needed somebody talk to or somebody bounce somebody off of and that was valuable yeah the time and yes and eventually you decided to invest in racing yeah with me but hopefully it was always and I think that's what oh dude yeah there was yes I received yeah but I always felt that I was I was giving dude come on that made it made it so I know that I know that but I don't think you know it's never been talked about in public yeah you know I'm saying yeah I mean it's lip-ro pretty awesome to see it's fucking awesome it's the coolest thing ever I thought this was six you I just found this online uh the video game grand teresimo yeah somebody has that livery in the game yeah oh it'll be it's already everywhere yeah yeah yeah like that people are making it grand teresimo and all the uh certain fours uh and then I get all you know because these are individual designers that that you know make it a graphic designer in the game they sell those skins like you buy the skins and some some guys make them the game some people just open source it yeah most people it's free they build them and yeah it for uh you know it'll be a very widely used uh yeah yeah yeah skin that's when you know it's freaking sick man um but I want to ask you this Ryan because you know you you put them all together you get seabring Daytona Lamon like that's the pinnacle like what so what what's next like how do you how do you reset a standard how do you not celebrate too long what's the next what what's next like I mean how do you how do you top that that's a great question I mean uh without a doubt um any competitive person you know I think no matter how big the mountain is that you climb you know there's there's always another mountain right you know you start thinking about you know what what else is there to achieve for me I got a short term and a long term answer you know the the short term is simple um we're currently leading after the win in the ma we're leading the world endurance championship uh which is ran by the FIA and that's the highest form of sports car racing in the world there's Formula 1 FIA runs two series they run Formula 1 and they run the world endurance championship every manufacturer is involved with the world endurance championship so we are racing with the factory effort from Porsche we're racing against the factory efforts from Ferrari from Corvette from BMW said is it is the top level you know sports car racing and uh it's a series it goes all around the world all year and the best you know the team that you know has the most points at the end of the year is world champion so outside of the Formula 1 world championship this would be the next highest level of of a season long championship in the world so that's the goal we're currently leading the championship after Lamala Mausworth a lot of points we won one other race we won in Italy we're the only team to win two races so far this year um we're in a pretty close battle with the factory Ferrari as it was probably the dicks I'd say strongest team they're strong I mean without it out there the next well bro they I mean that's their whole thing the two of us yeah I mean it's it's we're I would I would want to say head and shoulders there's great competition amongst Corvette has a strong you know racing team uh you know Toyota like BMW there's a lot of great teams but Ferrari and us are you know the leaders and uh we have the lead and so that's that's the short term goal I want to be world champion um and have that as a title you know here that's the short term goal long term I just start now I was at my whole goal was to win Lamala you know to try to win that race and win the traffic or believe me my wife is asking like hey so you know you won Lamala like it's time to retire yeah well dude it's a big commitment from the family like people yeah I mean look it's sacrifice yeah a lot you know and I'm super fortunate you know decide you know with with her my kids you know it's a lot of time away from home and uh but my dancer question my long term goal is legacy right I'm starting to think about legacy and and like I look at you know is there you know how many times could I win this or how many you know championships you know could there be and um so I would like to live leave a lasting legacy both in the racing world and as well as the business you know community world and I think obviously associate with their parallel yeah I think because we have to continue to grow the brand if we're gonna continue to have the legacy and racing yeah yeah so I it's uh I think about legacy both for the brand personally and you know so it's it's actually pretty cool because like when we talk about when Ryan and I talk about the business like it's it's funny because a lot of it correlates to and if we could do that we could do this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's possible yeah yeah yeah I mean you know my long-term goal like we're gonna be enough one I was I was about to ask I didn't want to like but yeah I mean that's that's where you're gonna ultimately see our car or livery everything that we're doing you will 100% eventually see that in F1 yeah we're we're making we're making all the right headways we we know the noise connection yeah let me tell you we are first form and like that blue livery we are we are on the world map and split it takes I mean no you can't just turn up and form even the team you know they you know obviously these teams want to be associated with great brands and um yeah we're we're we're on the way yeah we we will be owners maybe I don't know Ryan will be driving yeah for one time I think we may need to yeah maybe yeah we might be a guy who's 20 you know uh I may be like the Brad Pitt character in the new yeah I mean we might sneak in a couple laps you know saying we can go do some tip what that'll be an expensive uh that's that's our lesson if we yeah don't cross that don't cross that line yeah but yeah man uh we'll do to look um fuck it's been awesome it's dude I yeah I there's no other way to say it man uh you know the whole the whole thing dude like our friendship seeing you know you guys grow your company our our company now our company um you know the partnership with the with AB and Dana and the guys like yeah the rate it takes all the time like man it's pretty good life it's weird it's fucking surreal bro it's like it's like you know and we were it circles back to the thing that we were talking about you know what you know the time right like 10 years in you're like fuck like it would have been so easy for you or me to both been like yeah let's I'm gonna do something else yeah you know and now here we are no fucking doing it like for real doing it and it's just uh I know for me dude like as much as I expect to win you know because people ask me a lot personally they're like dude did you ever imagine and I'm always like yeah dude I fucking wanted to be here 10 years ago but like now that it's like real real it is kind of surreal like to it's like to stop you know just for a second and be like yeah the the brands summer smash at at Azerbaijan the distiller yeah you know we've we've transformed more lives than any other company ever yeah you know what I'm saying like yeah it's just it's surreal dude it's a surreal thing to sit to sit and think about and look at and the time invested you know it's not like we're 70 years old bro you know we're we're you know early side of 40s not not backside and um it's just it's a you know I think you guys should all remember that I think you guys who have the dreams and have the goals and I think you guys got to you know not don't get caught up in the short money you know think about the big picture what you can do you know the one thing that these guys have turning it back to entrepreneurship for just a second that we didn't have is they had the ability to generate capital doing side hustles that were not available to us and what I see from a lot of the young guys is they get addicted to this side hustle shit and never actually build it into a real fucking brand and dude I hope you guys remember like it's not just about the money it's not just about you know making a few dollars and and make us cool Instagram post like the journey the time the friendships the the stories the that's that's your life dude like it's not a balanced statement it's not a it's not a number it's it's it's the story created through that journey and you know when I stop and think about it dude I wouldn't trade that for anything yeah it's it I mean it's very well said it's all it's all in the journey that's where the magic happens yeah it's not at the finish line no well bro um fuck man I'm proud I'm I couldn't be more proud of you dude and I couldn't be more proud to see you do that the whole thing you know everything that we've done everything we're doing and and just fuck it's it's one of the coolest things in my whole life man yeah proud to do it with you but yeah so great yeah I love you man for real that's real shit yeah so absolutely all right guys I know that was a little different for a for a Tuesday show but I thought you guys might enjoy it and uh couple car guys yeah yeah and a story and there's so many parallels for any of you guys trying to achieve anything you know the endurance the the persistence the the perseverance through the hard shit you know the time that doesn't go fast enough and then when it does go fast enough it goes too fast like it's just such a it's it's just it's it's it's fucking crazy way to live your life but I wouldn't trade it man yeah so all right guys we're Ryan thank you bro thanks for coming on the show in a long time yeah yeah yeah then awesome all right guys we will see you later on this week and don't be a hoe try the show
