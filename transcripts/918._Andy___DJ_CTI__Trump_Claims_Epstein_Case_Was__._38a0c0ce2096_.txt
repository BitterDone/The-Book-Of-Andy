It means that Elton Castell and myself are the owners of the physical Ed and Lorraine Warren's home and a cult museum We are the legal guardians and caretakers of all 750 haunted artifacts and items in the Warren museum including the Annabelle doll I must go on record and say we do not legally own the items But we are the legal guardians and caretakers of the items for at least the next five years And what this means for you guys is you are going to soon be able to book a night or a weekend and Stay at the Warren's house and investigate the house and the the history of the house as well as the museum and all the artifacts inside of it This is the most random hobby ever, but it's so fucking cool, man I should probably collect stamps or something might be a little safer, but yeah, we own the house and We are very excited for you guys to see it.

This will be me right here. All right, so let's hear what this guy did Yeah, so this guy Brian doctor fucking weener Doc where I put my pants right over the next mine. Oh, man. Yeah, so this guy he's out He's being forced out of the bureau sources familiar with the matter told Fox News along with Walter your Dina Special agent at the bureau who played a role in the investigation of Trump traded vibes repeat in Navarro and Stephen Jensen the acting director in charge of the Washington field office And so yeah, these guys are out Apparently there's more coming We'll see see what happens with that But one individual they're saying that the they're trying to call this like retribution Is what they're calling it. That's the The name the the word going around the circles. That's called consequences. Yeah That's right But yeah, so I mean that you know that's going that's cool Well, we got to cover something man. I think this is important. It's been a couple of episodes to Let's dive into some of the Epstein updates in case anything has changed because dude Trump keeps Doubling down man, and I don't get it. There's some weird things happening. So you have this video come out This video check the scope out guys Hosting a gathering this evening to talk about how to respond to the Epstein situation Is he working on what the hosting some kind of gathering of talk advisors this evening to talk about how to respond to the Epstein situation I don't know I could ask you there I don't know of it, but I think I here's the man ready. I saw report today and it's completely fake news We're not meeting to talk about the Epstein situation and I think the reporter who reported it needs to get better sources The whole thing is a hoax is put out by the Democrats because we've had the most successful six months in the history of our country And that's just a way of trying to divert attention to something that's total bullshit Okay Okay, so so that happens okay um, and then and then these reports start coming out that Galee Maxwell told the DOJ that she never saw Trump do anything concerning all right now I have an interesting theory on this. I really would like your input But could this all be to get to this point where you know because we talked about the options on the table Israel potentially leveraging the American people on this right or The other option of being Trump was actually involved and so is it is she saying this just to you know now he's cleared now Does everything roll out like I mean do I don't know what to make of this stuff man? You said you had a theory That was my theory is you don't know the theory is is that I don't know like was this guy involved? I don't believe so I don't want to believe that right and there's no evidence to just suggest that he is right But now all of a sudden it's coming out that these reports of you know The interrogations that she had that now she saying Trump was never involved with anything concerning There was no no concerning behaviors or criminal activity on Trump's part So now you know for everybody out there calling you know Don the the pito guy and all of that stuff I mean, okay, that argument's no one void now was that part of the agreement of This whole situation You know Look here's the problem that Trump's facing you've got him his son everybody around him for years Talking about Epstein talking about releasing quote unquote the list Which I don't even think is the important part we all know the fucking list We have the flight logs everybody knows who's been there who has it. That's all been public data for a long time The problem that Trump is facing with the public right now is that They went from Making this a huge deal to straight up saying it's a hoax. It's bullshit, which is Clearly not true because why would they be talking about it? For all these years all right, and then on top of it if they have this shit on Trump Why didn't they release that part of it? You know during the time where they could have really heard they had the power right okay, but You know The more I look into this and the more I hear The more it starts to confirm my original thought which was he's trying to get people fucking pissed about it because When he looks at people and says oh, it's bullshit after talking about it for years That's gonna infuriate people it gets people to the point where they're demanding the list and now we have the liberal media who ignored the list for eight years Now talking about it non-stop, okay, and Trump's a master of the media bro He knows how to manipulate the media better than the media knows how to manipulate him so You know and by the way this isn't about There's very little evidence that is public now it could be that you know these people are Satanic baby eating fucking Aliens or lizard people wherever the fuck people say but the Evidence that is available suggests that it is way more likely that this is just a Black male operation Between the agencies To control the narrative in society and it has more to do with people just doing weird shit Then it has to do with like little bitty kids and shit And I think people are getting hung up on the list on the list on the list on the list Okay, they released the list. What's that mean to you? What's that mean? We already have all the names you know what I mean? So My personal take on all of this is that I believe that We still don't know what's going on I Believe there's a good possibility that there is a real threat against the American people from Somebody I personally think it's Netanyahu To do some sort of false flag or something that prevents this from getting out and like I said Last show or two shows ago When these people start to you know, let's say Trump says okay, here's the operation This is what happened. This is how they were doing it and he keeps saying innocent people get hurt innocent people get hurt I actually think he's talking about the Jewish people that are not part of This problem, okay the innocent Jewish people and I think he understands that we're in such a social We're in a cultural place where so many people are upset with Israel and they're collectively Generalizing all Jews into that that it would be a dangerous thing to expose Israel's guilt because of what it would happen to the innocent Jewish people I The more this goes on the more that's how I'm starting to see what's what I think is actually going on Yeah, I think he's trying to be responsible But I don't think he's making the right moves. I think the right move like I've said is to fully disclose everything And let it let it let the chips fall where they may so that we can get the trust back the problem that And this is why I think that by the way because it would be easy for him to follow that statement up Like like right now. What's he saying? It's a hoax. It's a hoax. It's bullshit. Right. It's the liberal media Okay, it would be very easy for him to squash the temperature down by just explaining that with another three or four sentences What's the actual evidence? Well, dude nobody can come up. Okay, explain to me how it's a Democrat op Yeah, explain that to me. Right. Okay, explain to me why you were talking about it for eight fucking years Explain to me why junior talks about it all the time explain to me why all the people that supported you talked about it the entire time cash betel damn bans you know dance All explain it and and dude because he's not explaining it and because that's such a simple way to Bring the temperature down my only conclusion is that he wants the temperature to go up So because if it was really a hoax if it was really that would have been shown already Yeah, he could have said he could show it be a look. Here's what they did They did this and this and this and then they altered it like this and they did these things And this is why you shouldn't worry about it But he's not providing that level of transparency which makes him Look like he's either part of it and he's certainly hiding something and if he's not part of it then why is he doing it? Right You know what I'm saying? And then Is it possible that he's planning on holding the people for treason accountable and then moving on to them? you know like Or is it possible that he's just fucking part of their shit? I don't think we know enough yet and I'm not somebody who just like I know everybody likes to jump to conclusions pick a side but and pick a side but like bro I'm a you know, I try to evaluate and call balls and strikes and that comes from years and years and years of being in business I can't tell you how many times in business Where things appear to be one way and then I assume that they were that way and I'm losing You know what I mean? It's just not the way I think yeah, well that's be an emotional man like that That's the that's the piece you do. I see people all the time online Or way too emotionally invested and I would say like there should be like there There's a necessary you know those real people that will I mean now that's a fair point But like there are a pility of people out there that is like super emotionally like involved in this man It's just like dude you got to remove the emotions from here look at the actual facts let the fact I mean look dude we get in a dangerous position when we start Putting leadership on a pedestal to the point where they can never do wrong There's nothing wrong with being quote unquote loyal But you should still be able to acknowledge that was not the best move. Yeah, that was not the right move This should have been done that way That's how you improve and you could still be loyal to someone and critique Things that they did and you know unfortunately The the media and culture and this communist destabilization and demoralization has been going on for the last 20 while it's been going on for a hundred years heavily the last 20 years roughly Um Has created a scenario where people are this or that right and they they think it's left right Gay straight Democrat Republican Black white and it's none of those things bro. It's always been and I've been saying this for fucking ever. It's us the peasants versus them the elite and People have to understand you know another thing is I don't think enough people I don't think most people have never been around people like this Like I've spent time around people like this What do you mean is for like the lead it's mentality? Yeah, like you like people have a hard time comprehending how Because I think most people have good hearts. I think most people look around they say you know what It is right to take care of my neighbor. It is right to do the right thing. It is right to be a good American It is right. It is right These people don't do not hold that same moral standard that the general population holds And until you hear them first hand talk about regular people, but they really think yes like You you can't understand they don't care they they look at us like we are A way to profit You know what I'm saying? There's a servitude slavery whatever you want to call it like Yeah, we might not have someone standing over us saying You know like back in the You know in the slavery days saying you better get out there and do this or this and this or I'm gonna whoop your ass But now they say it like this if you don't do this we'll put you in fucking jail It's no different bro. It's no different And if you think it's different Don't pay your taxes for two years and see what the fuck happens. Right. That's right dude Yeah, it is crazy man like I said so I mean He's not involved and this again is per Galein Maxwell was she's told to say that was she forced to say that I don't know we don't even know if that's true if it was actually said it all yes We don't know we that could be total bullshit Well here's something else we don't know if it was actually said or not but apparently she's She started talking about the Bill Clinton and he's way heavier and heavily involved Then I guess people thought or realized But apparently like that also came out of Out of the interview that she had with The assistant attorney from the DOJ Who you know Bill Clinton he's always maintained that you know He was no more than an occasional acquaintance of the millionaire sex offender But top blanche the deputy attorney general when he interviewed Maxwell It allegedly came out that they were way more involved How Bill Clinton likes to make it out to be I mean and we've seen the pictures right You know him getting the the massage by a seemingly young looking woman and what appears to be an airport The all the airplane rides not just on the lowly lowly to express but Epstein and Galein on his personal plane I mean they were at Chelsea Clinton's wedding. That's probably the more recent thing we have But even more than that dude The the freaking picture of Bill Clinton that Epstein had in on the island bro of him in a blue dress with red heels You know him saying like that's you that's a little bit more than just a personal Occasional acquaintance. I mean like do that's some weird shit. It doesn't prove anything. Yeah Those are all speculations. There's nothing we don't we we know so little about what's actually going on All we can do is speculate which is the actual problem With our country right now with the lack of we do not have transparency and so we have to spend all this time Filtering through every single narrative to find out what is likely true and that's a intentional thing Because just like when we talk about If you can't define a woman or you can't define a man if you don't know what the truth is ever What do you know? You see what I'm saying? So we are intentionally confused by the propaganda of the media For control purposes. So we don't know any of this man. This is all this is all speculation We haven't seen any real proof of any of it And if Trump really wants to settle people's minds then he needs to explain why it's bullshit Okay, like it's not enough for me to say you know like someone comes up and accuses me of something to me by all this fucking bullshit That's a hoax that's bullshit and then come and then like okay, then a hundred people come they say well no, that's not a hoax Love a black now that's bullshit. It's a hoax. Yeah, right after I was talking about it for eight years You know that I remember as a my cabinet listen to my for eight years and yeah listen dude Do you think he doesn't know that Like do you there's only two options one He He's intentionally getting people pissed off Or two and this is a very real option His ego is so big That he's used to be able he's used to being able to control a room By saying no, this is how the fuck it is Okay, and he's been doing that in his whole life forever So he could be making a strategic mistake thinking that he can kind of bully the room only the rooms everybody now Tens of millions that's what I'm saying, but like dude. There's a lot of times where people in power We're walking a room when everybody's Asked depends on that person and they'll say the sky is green and everybody says yeah, you know what it is kind of great It's great. It's great. Yeah, right green green green. So you know, it could be that too. There's just a lot that it could be There's a lot man. I don't know man guys. Let us know down in the comments what you what you guys think with that me so let's check out the chat see what they would they think in the chat here real quick Green dildo. All right, that's cool. We'll go ahead a little bit on the topic though, because I did see some good comments in there about this About this let me find out who see who it was Yeah, the only uh Jordan gun go three. Sorry The only thing I could think of is someone either the United States population or his families being arthritis Mr sensitive Yahoo who is mostly like most likely Trying to fuck the world with me except the moment. I don't think It's his family. Yeah, when you go to sign up for presidency, you know that it's your family's on part of the risk. Yeah, yeah, you accept that I think if there's a threat I think it is of a false flag or a terrestrial activation or some kind of some kind of shit Like that. I don't think it's like hey, we're gonna do something to your immediate family. I mean He's been under threat of that since the 80s, you know what I mean like when you're that rich bro You got to have securities to make sure people don't kidnap your kids, you know, you know, so which he's had for a long time That's right long time, so I agree it has to be bigger than just family for sure Yeah, man, but guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think well It has to be big because think about how he handles these people okay What do you do to the dude from Iran when the wrong guy was mouthing off? Sorry, he's in the picture of fucking gross. Yeah, you know what I'm saying like trump don't fuck around bro So like but he can't drone net nahu right and If net and Yahoo is threatening him and he keeps saying it's bullshit. It's bullshit You gotta look at it like this you got two guys there that are that are they have it they have a disagreement Okay, and let's say one of the guys has real leverage. Let's say net and Yahoo has real leverage which it appears that he does some way shape or form And you have trump Has to lead and has to keep people safe And then you have a situation where net nahu says if you if this happens then this will happen and this being a whole bunch of people will die Americans Americans Trump says cool. I'll I'll do this. I'll do this for you. I got you all right, and he says hey guys it's bullshit Okay, and then he looks at net nahu and he says I'm telling him it's bullshit brother not buying it. Yeah, what do you want me to do right? It could be that too But that's all this and somebody just said in the comments too, but Could this possibly be tied into the iron dome thing the like wide trumps pushing so hard to get an iron dome here Maybe I mean I mean the samson option shit man. I maybe yeah, maybe I don't know man I mean look dude. That's a real thing the samson options a real thing. It's a it's a official Israeli policy That if Israel were to fall they were too nuke A bunch of other countries It's what it's they say that yeah, so uh If Net nahu saying or if Trump says well if I release this And everybody knows and it goes as deep as people think or maybe even deeper Because dude you hear what bongino said bongino came out and said bro. I looked at this shit's way worse than I thought Yeah, okay. Yeah, that was like a three four days ago. Yeah, so If That's the case then Who knows what they're threatening with Right and how bad the backlash would really be like if they are really like sacrificing children and that's in the shit Bro Israel will get wiped off face of the fucking earth And then a bunch of people will die because they'll launch all their shit So I mean most of the world right now hates Israel. Yeah, it's just what it is for sure And Trump could be playing the responsibility card of saying Well, I don't want to start this other main huge thing you know what I mean. Yeah, I don't know Yeah, man guys, let's go down in the comments what you guys what I don't like though. Here's what I don't like I don't like How people who are loyal to Trump quote unquote Are just now switching their tune and being like it's bullshit. Mm-hmm. Do come on man I saw you talk about it for fucking five six years. Yeah, what what what happened to that? So just because Trump says this bullshit now now you back it up like that's that's fucking Well, it could be there all they they have to like because they all have to be on the same page or a lot of these pro-Trump influencers Bro around the payroll. Yeah, that's what I'm saying like they're being they're saying what they're being told to say. Yeah You know, yeah, I don't know man Yeah guys jumping on the conversation down to the comments. Let us know what you guys think Uh, with that being said. Let's go cruise some of our actual comments. Not just the live chat. We got uh We got some good ones here. We're actually pulling a bunch of these actually from Spotify Got to show Spotify some love. We got a read we started doing a lot of people say they're They're loving it. Yeah, they're loving it Um, yeah, so we got some Spotify comments in here as well. Let's check them out first one is from swapaholics Says uh, I've been listening to this podcast for over five years and never been offended till Andy said natural deodorant stinks This was uncalled for well.

Yeah, bless your heart. Yeah, that's right All right, man last one um, this is from uh, 2g stone This is probably my favorite comment of all time. Okay, 2g stone says To answer the question on why there are no uncircumcised deal those you have to look at israel's elite No, the sex industry the sex toy industry is a billion dollar industry And what faith is known to have started circumcising Jewish faith everyone wants to talk about big farm or a big tobacco But no one wants to talk about the big deal though coincidence. I think not we just did a whole segment about big Dildos Pretty sure we're the first world ahead of the curve, bro No pun intended no pun intended. Yep. There ain't no curve ahead of the hook. Yeah, all I'm saying is That's actually a pretty fair argument It is Yeah, man. I love it. They never seen none of them any to deal those. No, why not Why not that's my question. I think 2g stones all of something Yeah, man, guys, that's actually true. Yeah, so much that he's done his research Yeah Guys, we do appreciate you though, man. We appreciate you guys for being real as fans We dig into the real topics here on real a f was a why dildos are not circumcised on circumcised yeah Hey, I think it's uh It's an important conversation to have Solving the world's problems Yeah, man, let's keep the cruise cruising headline too Um Let's get into some deportation stuff some ice stuff. I think we might have a new job opportunity. Okay on top of podcasting and youtube All right Patriots wanted dhs drops age cap 80,000 americans rush to join ice and help clean up biden's mess So the department oh, yeah, they're just hiring regular people bro We have a shot. What do you mean we have a shot? We should go straight to the top. Let's just do it Yeah, Andy and DJ go to home depot okay That's what they do that's what they did I didn't do that they did do that they did do deals on it. I got it all right Hell yeah, man, um, but yeah, they're recruiting man. They're on a all-out recruiting uh message Peace right now Um, they're running a full court press with recruitment um and they're dropping the age requirement for immigration agents Opening the door for more americans to help tackle the illegal immigration crisis And less than one week since dhs launched its recruitment program or campaign More than 80,000 americans applied to join ice Wednesday statement from the department's website red Now christy no one announced that immigration and customs enforcement is now waiving age limits for new applicants So even more patriots will qualify to join ice and its mission to arrest murderers pedophiles gang members rapists and other criminal illegal aliens from america streets Now they will still have to go through medical screening and drug screening um in a complete physical fitness test um But america need you this is the actual website from ice right now. Well signing bonus 50 grand 50 grand student loan repayment 60 grand Yep, and you get a 25 percent pay raise premium pay That's a fucking I mean that's actually a pretty good deal, you know Pretty good. Yeah, I think you have have some I would rather than put the money towards this than sending it to you crane That's real or is real or anywhere else. Yeah fucking anywhere make down like 200 grand and we'd solve the immigration problem in about a fucking week bro Now I wonder I do have I wonder if this is like a part time or like a temporary You know how like uh Like some of the the box doors are higher additional workers during the hot season. Yeah, you know Like FedEx and UPS and this is like black Friday. Yeah Doorbuster deals Border busters Border busters man Nice fucking great Yeah, guys tell us are you guys are you guys trying to sign up for ice man? Yeah, bro. Let's go We got border buster deals Do I sell my company and go to work for ice? I mean listen again if it's temporary bro. I'm down I'm down Border busters turn border busters into a show that would be sick. It would be every time we go to fucking home Well, so speaking of that they're actually getting some heat right now Because they actually did go to a home depot And they used a pinsky truck. I think that's how you pronounce it right pinsky. Yeah, yeah, they used a pinsky pinsky truck now The pinsky rebukes dhs after agents pop out of trucks During immigration raid and they actually use that same truck to take them back The the illegals that they caught. I think it was somewhere. I saw numbers very like up to almost 60 people But yeah transportation services company pinsky is calling the use of its rental trucks during a department of Homeland Security operation And Los Angeles improper Following a raid at an LA area home depot pinsky address the situation after federal agents We're seen in their vehicles during the Wednesday incident that resulted in more than a dozen arrests. Here's the clip terrible marketing Yeah, well, I got something on that too But this is the clip that's going viral everybody's seeing it check this out Hopping now I love the guy's just got a cowboy hat on for insult. Yeah, it's awesome Yeah, that's just like insulting them Now this was there. This was their official statement from pinsky. They say quote Pinsky strictly prohibits the transportation of people in the cargo area of its vehicles under any circumstances The company was not made aware that its trucks would be used in today's operation and did not authorize this pinsky Nobody asked you We got to we got to ask you how we're going to use your truck every mother fucker out here uses the shit out of those trucks It's funny you brought that up any because you got to go back a little bit again by the way That's terrible marketing. Yeah, like you're missing an opportunity Pinsky could like put American flags on the side of the truck and put like one of those dukes of hazard horns And make a skit where they like drive up and all the dudes jump out and then everybody runs away And it would be like the most viral fucking marketing ever that pinsky moves anything every Yes Every American person that wanted to buy to rent a truck would rent a fucking pensky truck They're going to they're going to they got some politically correct dumb fucking there in their HR department He's like oh my god. How are we gonna handle this situation? We're gonna say something now No, no, no, no, no, no, and now it's like dude. You're gonna you're gonna people are gonna say I don't want pensky Yeah, I want this. Yeah, well here's the funny thing man because you know, you guys know how the end of that is If I was writer if I was writer truck I'd make a commercial like that right now That's what I would do you all they have an opportunity right they're on the clock. Yeah, you know But the funny thing about the internet though, bro is like nothing's deleted People remember everything and it's funny. We got to go back a couple of years to 2021 When one of their trucks was actually used to bring in and smuggle Illegal immigrants into the country so did they authorize that was that authorized yeah, right? I mean, this is the actual like post that you know, you see the figures going through the x-ray machine. I mean they're in there and Yeah, was was that was that authorized pensky? You know, was that authorized? I mean did they make a statement saying it wasn't authorized? No statement right exactly no issue all this is is dude. It's it's fear of being canceled It's fear of being American which is Really fucking dumb it's interesting to see a lot of these companies not understand where we are in culture You know what I mean? Or even people yeah like well to be fair. They never saw it Well, bro. I mean, I talked about this years ago on the show like culture's gonna swing back It's gonna become cool to be American. We're there Like the more American you could be the more business you're gonna do and Penske missed a tremendous opportunity here because they probably got some Far left dumbasses in their company making calls like this Yeah, no, it's stupid dude. It's absolutely stupid. Yeah, this is this is the picture when they they put them all in there to take them back to the Penske. Yeah, we take out the trash Fuck dude. Well, let me I do want to ask you this though, right because this immigration thing it is it's For a lot of people can be a difficult conversation, right? And I think why? Because because like I mean like do we really see a difficult conversation to When someone uh car jack somebody? What do we say? I mean do we say like oh well, you know, they didn't have a car so yeah, right It's a law. Yeah, and the law exists for a reason See that thing and we also talked about this dude We said this that it would get to a point Where the process or what's required to get these people out would be unpalatable is not gonna be palatable for a lot of people Right, and so seeing Penske trucks pull up to fucking home depots and hopping out with ice agents and loading them up Like that's not a palatable image to a lot of people. I actually think that's pretty good. Is it necessary? Is it what's required Because I mean here's the thing like we tried the self-replication thing. They're not going on their own listen dude There's There's 20 plus million people If they if they Deported 20 plus million people at the rate that they're doing now it would take like 70 years to get rid of the people so The argument isn't You know are they doing what it needs to be way harsher and it needs to be way bigger and needs to be way more in your face There should be fucking camps of mother fuckers waiting to be deported out of this country To make a point that you don't come here or you end up there Very simple. No, I agree. Did you see this thing too that like Trump just ordered the the census bureau to do another census But he's intentionally leaving out the illegal migrants and did I saw that I'm like what would be the point of that Is it redistricting? Well not only that But like does he not want people to see the true numbers of how many illegals are in the country? No Because they're using it to to redraw the voter districts The census so that's about that's about Seats in the in the house. So why not still count them, but just not count them. You know them saying They will they're gonna know how many but they got to remove them off the list if you have 10 rocks over here And you take out too you know the two over here right right Okay, all right. I just saw him like do that. Just didn't it didn't make sense to me man. I just I didn't understand that piece Um Yeah, let's see what chat saying yeah, yeah Yeah, 20 that's correct 20 million illegals equals an actual invasion It's actually one of the biggest invasions of human history Okay, and if it were any other time in history that's what it would be called It would be called a fucking invasion People have come here without their families without their kids without their wives They come here and leach our resources. They fucking commit crimes and bro There is a lot of good immigrants here like I know some very good immigrants from Mexico Who come here and work very fucking hard, but unfortunately Now they have this situation where so many of these people have come that now it's ruined it For the people who have come here and contributed and I hate that I fucking hate it bro But it's reality we cannot just say okay, well because there's 10% that are very productive in society we can let a hundred percent in that's not what can happen In fact, what we should have is some sort of sponsorship program where like Let's say a company or myself personally had people that worked for them that happened to be Illegal yeah technically without you know I could say no, I would like to sponsor this man and his family 10 people to stay here because they do this And I sign an affidavit and say these are good people and vouch for them And some sort of system like that Could be helpful, but you know apparently these people in Washington DC they can't critically think so There's ways to get around this, but the truth of the matter is dude is You know there's there's laws And the laws have to be obey and that's that yeah Yeah, no, I do I agree dude. I like Jordan you got some good shit to say bro. Let's let's bring you in Let's bring you up on the show Let's see Oh Jordan, what's up dude? Hey, what's up DJ? What's going on man? You get mad if you want or you don't have to it's up to you Um, yeah, sure hold up one sec brother Uh, I'm on I don't know if I'm on the sure Where I go to do that Or shit my bad yeah, I'm not seeing an option for video here Let's just do call yeah, man you get you get talk to us man. What you got Man honest. Oh my first off This is fucking surreal. Sorry for my language, but this is surreal man. Thank y'all so freaking much for everything y'all do Y'all literally changed my life. I got I gained 40 pounds of muscle mass because of 75 hard Started getting my shit together in my life and actually been trying to improve and I owe it all to y'all like I really cannot Thank y'all enough for everything you have done for the community and for building this message of personal excellence You can't sleep right now, but I'm rocking my um American freedom hat right now currently But always got to have it with me. Keep that thing on. I mean y'all are just absolutely killing it and I just cannot Thank y'all and off and I'm lowkey like is this surreal or my dream in right now? Well, you're about to be not dreaming if you don't tell us something cool Well depends on what you're looking for brother No, you just make us a few comments man. What's your thought on this immigration stuff man So Home Depot's or no Well, I was thinking throw a taco stand up at a home Depot and just like let her rip and just see how that goes But yeah, no honestly the whole thing with the immigration I don't think a lot of folks have a problem with immigration as a whole when people do it right and they fall The law and I actually do it effectively and efficiently But when you have all these folks that we have no idea who they are Where they're coming from what their history is about and the fact that they're coming then in harm in the American populist That's a whole different story And it's quite literally like I was saying it's an invasion. It really is an invasion and it just It's sickening to me y'all like we have Americans that are struggling They are so willing to give at first before you know all this this stuff's changed They were so willing to give all these folks money and give them reimbursements for loans and mortgages and cell phones and food stamps Yet you got folks in like Ashville or other places like that that are genuinely suffering And it's just like make it make sense. How can you not take care of your population Yet be pandering to these other mole foes Who could give two craps about who have whoever's in office they just care about the fact that they're in the country and they can get our resources I mean dude, I think you're making some great points there bro um You know you said make it make sense Well, it does make sense if you recognize what's actually going on and that we're dealing with an intentional demoralization and destabilization of our country and the intentional breeding of American culture out of our country and so when we think about like What's actually going on? You know you can tie all this together right like we the biggest problem that we keep doing Jordan is that we keep pretending like These people are stupid or these people are ignorant though. They're neither of those. They're fucking intentional and they're evil and they are removing American culture intentionally they are removing uh Any sort of national pride that we have they are removing national identity the part of funneling resources to them versus American citizens is about demoralization because most people don't know how to deal with that and The play they're running has worked pretty well But if we want to stop it we have to understand And this is us this is the people that listen to this show and maybe a few other shows we have to push And I have a feeling that Jordan push is pretty hard But we have to push collectively for accountability and for Retribution that's what the country has to have it has to have transparency It has to have accountability and it has to have punishment For the crimes that have been committed against us for us to ever believe that they have our interests in mind and so You know, I think Jordan makes some awesome points. I agree with them 100% and you know The culture of America is one of If not the most unique culture ever because yes, it does involve Many other cultures to come together to create a culture at the American culture But when that culture is no longer useful It makes sense that they would try to destroy it and the only time that it Becomes unuseful to them is when they realize that they can conduct wars and conduct operations Through technology versus boots on the ground. They don't need a bunch of badass 20-year-old Americans that are ripped and fucking high-test Ostrone whooping people's asses anymore for the love of their country That's right what they need as they need those people to get fat lazy stupid and poor So that they're dependent and we can say you know what we're going to join up with everybody else and become one big globalist society and It's unfortunate that people are not recognizing that that's the play that's going on uh, you know and The the counterbalance to that is personal excellence it is Being fit. It is working to be wealthy. It is working to be accepting. It is working to uh Look above the artificial division that we're we're costly entangled into and um And i agree i don't think people have a problem with immigrants here, dude like there isn't this big Race problem here in this country like the race shit is manufactured bro like yeah There's we could go online every single day and find a video of a black guy doing something to a white guy We can go online every day and find a video of a white guy doing something to a black guy Maybe not quite as free but but the truth of the matter is is that we could find all these Things and build them into the narrative that we want and yes And the reality is is most people are fucking cool and we got a fucking quit falling for their bullshit We whether it serves what we may think like bro like just real talk okay, and we're gonna keep it real here It as a white dude. I've never I've never really like thought About race like i just haven't like i have not really thought about it Now That it's become such a an attack on white people I'm starting to realize that if white people don't stand up for themselves They will eventually get wiped the fuck out. Mm-hmm. So now i'm being forced to say well Hey, you guys are fucking with the white people And when white people say that shit, it's racist But everybody else can say the same shit And it's unfortunate that we have to get to that point Because i do believe That people should be judged on the content of their character man And i don't believe that standing up for yourself equals racism towards other races. Yeah, so not true That's right. Yeah bro. I look we got a big fucking problem here and to cure the problem it's gonna be ugly People got to be rounded up. They got to be set the fuck out of here And if they want to come back they come back the right way Mm-hmm. It's very very simple man. They want to separate it because we are weaker that way 100% that's real man That's real the day the day that we all Figure it out the fucking day that black people and white people mainly figure out that they are Americans And we're being artificial dude those people up at the top are fucking done They're done and only requires those two groups of people to get together If the black people and the white people get together The people who are tyrants are fucking done. They're done That's real man. That was micah's quote by the way. I just got yelled at there you go micah Guys we do appreciate you man. Let us know is that our micah No, I don't think my car you are you here? Micah? No, that's not the same micah. All right. No Yeah Yeah guys let's go down to the comments what you guys think with that being said we got keep the cruise cruising we got uh Hell on number three. Let's get into it um Kind of we kind of hinted at this a little bit, but comedy making its way back. Yeah south park Yeah, it's making some noise right now. Uh-huh fucking got everybody. What did you they got everybody south park to pick Trump is Satan J.D. Vance Monage H.W.I. and ice rating heaven christie know I'm shooting dogs Uh, so south parks we want pretty viral right now Um, are you a south park fan? I've always been a south park for you. Oh One time I was with Halsey. Oh So dude, I have this little apartment and back in college and You know, I didn't smoke much weed back then. I didn't really start smoke a weed like on a regular basis till I was probably like I don't know like late 30s. Yeah, you know and uh We my buddy my buddy uh Aaron Schubert Who did smoke a lot of weed back then um Came over to hang out with us and he brought this weed And it was like orange it was called mango. It was mango some it's fucking orange and uh and So I forgot like he like the night before he we were all partying and shit and he let he went home The next day me and Scott were like at the house and bro we fucking hung over dude. Mm-hmm And we're like, let's let's neither one of us smoke much weed. No, we're like let's smoke this shit super left So you do it's out. Yeah, huh? Listen, so this all comes together. Okay, so we end up smoking like We put we put we put a bowl in and we smoke like half the bowl each bro And like I was so fucking high bro like I didn't know what planet I was fucking on and then I couldn't leave the house because I was so fucked up So I went in we so Halsey disappears for like Five minutes. Oh, that's a worries. No, and he comes back and he's like look what I found I found a movie in your closet and it was South Park. Uh-huh the South Park movie the first one Yeah, and it was still all wrapped up and I never watched it before and he's like Let's watch this and I'm like all right, so he throws it in the fucking DVD player you know I'm saying and uh Pro I laughed so fucking hard. I almost died Well, cuz I couldn't cuz I couldn't breathe. I couldn't breathe. It's a hardest I've ever laughed in my fucking life Yeah, man, and I like I could tell you I've never laughed at heart like I remember it very specific specifically and So ever since then I've tried to stay away from South Park really yeah, but I smoke more weed Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm bouncing out because it's dangerous to watch South Park if you've been smoking my die Yeah, my die. Yeah, no, no, I've always been a South Park fan personally And I feel like they've always done a decent job at getting everybody equally. Yeah, you know like they're I get there a little liberal for sure. I think you know No, I think they listen broke comedy is the universal language of unity Okay, like if you want society to get along Especially in America where everybody's fucking different everybody comes from a different culture Everybody has their unique things about culture part of appreciating culture is making fun of the culture Right like it is yeah, and You know people with no sense of humor that are fat ugly and stupid and have no friends They're gonna get offended by shit like that. Yeah, but real people think it's fucking funny Well, I think too like bro. It's like, you know, it's a very it's it's a really great way of bringing light to sometimes some really dark Fog and shit or stuff that's not as palatable. Yeah, like bringing comedy to it helps Dave Sheppell was the greatest Person in the history of race relations and he'll never get credit for it But and I'm not talking about his newest shit his newest shit Is different, but when he was doing a shippell show and he was doing this shit back then Dude, it was so it was so funny Because he went in on everyone and nobody says yeah, and like That's what we need that is what we need that is what we need and it's been it's been a minute since South Florida Yeah, that's a good job of it.
