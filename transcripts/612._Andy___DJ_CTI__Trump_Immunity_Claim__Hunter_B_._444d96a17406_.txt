Oh, this? Yes. Yeah. Oh, this is the new first four energy can comes out this Thursday. Definitely not mad. Yeah, not at all. Now, they can't this week though. Yeah, that's what's up, man. Yeah, we got these releasing on Thursday limited edition, limited edition. You know what that means? Means it's limited. That edition's limited. Yeah, they're collectible. Now, they're fucking awesome though. Alright, so what's up, man? Do listen, I, you know, I always try to have like a nice little intro topic. And I, and we have one, I just couldn't set it alone one. So we're going to do like a little, like a little, you know, little quick barrage of the top three things that happened in the day. Let's see what your thoughts are. Alright. So the first thing that came up is that on this day in history, okay, December 11th, when the show was recorded, Apollo 17 astronauts last humans walked the moon. This bullshit, yes, is bullshit. Yeah, right. That's a lie. Like most people, like, I who took the fucking picture of the dude walking on the moon, here's the first steps of the moon. It was the modern day influencer, bro, like how they set the camera up before they fucking do it. Fuck out here. Bro, the shadows go different ways. Yeah. Like there's so much science that shows that this is highly unlikely. Yeah. It's hard for me to take someone seriously, the believes that yes, like it really, it really is. Like, like the fact that because like if you believe this, what it means is you're blindly accepting the information and just saying this is what happened. Yeah. And so it's really hard for me to, to take anyone serious who believes that this is true. It's a great point, man. Alright, second thing. Alex Jones back on Twitter. Cool. That was a big deal. Yeah, he should have never been off Twitter. Should have never been off. But I like how Elon did it. Like, I mean, so there's a lot of people saying he's not, he's not a free speech hero. He's a hate speech monster is what they're calling him. Oh, really? Yeah. You know, but he, so he put this, this pole out on Twitter, reinstate Alex Jones on this platform, 70% to 29 said yes. And so he followed that up saying the people have spoken. And so it shall be. Yeah. So Alex Jones is back on Twitter. And again, like, I mean, I feel like do you feel like moving forward? We're going to have to redefine what free speech means? Yeah. Because there's a whole lot of people that don't understand it. Yeah. Dude, I was just, uh, I, you know, how like on Instagram now it like forces you to like see people's threads. Like, first of all, I don't give a fuck about your threads. Okay. But let's be real. Like the shit comes through your feed now and you see shit, right? Make sure see it. So I saw one today and it was like this woman who looked exactly like you would picture one of these people to look complaining about how she had to give up her massive community on Twitter to come over here to threads because all this leftover there is extremist and bigots and anti semites and all this shit. And there was like five cop like she had like five likes on it. Sure. You know, is that what they call them over there? So likes? I don't fucking know. And it was like, yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't fucking know. All I know is that she had like zero engagement on the post. I don't even know why it's showing it to me. I just make me angry. I've been seeing more left stuff to yes, it's left. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. So it's not just me. No. And so like, and then she's talking about how, you know, all these people had to give up their massive like look, here's what's actually happened. What's actually happened is the leftist have had a monopoly on social media for 15 years. Okay. They've been free to abuse and use and call names and gang up and cancel everybody for fucking over a decade. And now because Elon has made the platform actually fair and actually even these people don't like the game. And they can't play the game when they're outnumbered. Okay. And they don't realize because they're too brainwashed that social media has been fake for the last 15 years. The interior people that run these companies have used bots and algorithms and programs to suppress everybody else. All the people who are not along for the far left political correct, cancel culture bullshit. Get hammered. Get hammered. Okay. And they've used their all the resources to create this perception that the, and this is what I've been talking about for years. The perception that these leftists are the majority and everybody else is the minority. And these people are figuring out that that is now not the case. And they're scared because they're outnumbered like a thousand to one. Okay. So the veil of where the pendulum actually is in society and culture has now been lifted on Twitter and people see it and people who were on the winning side before having trouble accepting that as reality. And they say, Oh, well, it's just not, yeah, it's not the same because all the people disagreed with you aren't getting kicked off the fucking platform. Exactly. And all these fake bots are in your, in your, you know, community. Dude, listen, this was the best part about it. They were all crying about how they can't get any traction in, in fucking threats. And it's funny because what they don't realize is that Twitter by its own emission through the Twitter files was actually pumping up people like them, their content with fake fucking engagement. So like they're, these people were often like some alternate reality. And they think that everybody else isn't some alternate reality. And that's, that's my question. Okay. So you have this big community on X. Why didn't they come with you? If they're, the genuinely with you, you should have, oh, we only got five likes. Got it. Bro, look, people will start believing their own fucking hype is what it is. Well, it's not just that brother. It's, it's that they, they have been propped up. It would be very difficult if you were on the other side. Okay. If you were one of them, it would be very difficult to accept that for the last 15 years, you've been playing a handicap game that made you feel like you were correct. And everybody else was wrong. And you've been walking around for 15 years with your morally superior attitude, shitting on everybody around you. When nobody around you's actually ever agree with you. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? That like think about that self reflection. Yeah. Like think of all the times those people have to deal with like the way they were talked to people or spoke to people in their family. Like think of all these people right now who for during COVID told their fucking family to couldn't come over for Christmas or disowned people are fucking cheered when people got arrested or got their businesses closed or whatever right. And now they're realizing holy shit or somebody even worse who's got who's got four booster shots and is like now coming to terms with holy fuck what did I do? Like this is a they're having to deal with the repercussions of the brainwashing that has occurred. And it's not comfortable. And they're in denial. So, you know what Elon's doing over a Twitter is a huge deal, bro. Because what it's doing is it's showing people what the free speech is in reality. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like it's showing the real social temperature with the real rules. Yes. And people don't like it. Well, guess what? We didn't like it either when we couldn't say a mother fucking thing on any platform. Yeah. Yeah. And then you guys got to gang up on every every a pit. You know, like you guys got to bully everybody and the bullying is over. So fuck you. That's that's the reality. Fuck you. Yeah. You guys bullied everybody for 15 mother fucking years on the internet. And now you still want to bully him and you're pissed off because Elon stopped that. Yeah. Fuck you. That's my take. I say let it go, man. I think I think let the public decide what they want to see and don't don't want to see my entire take on Alex Jones. Don't fucking follow him. Don't listen to him like this show. Don't listen. That's right. It's very like it's yeah. If you don't market. Don't buy their shit. Don't support them. Don't don't. Who fucking bro? Fuck you. Yeah. Here's the here's my stance. Fuck you. Like it. That's an ad. That's it. That's my stance. Oh, that's real shit. I find a little topic I want to bring up. And we actually kind of covered this a little bit last week. Right. Feels good too. Yeah. It's always feels good. But you know, we come in like a whole big old. This tastes different than the can. Yes. It tastes like a can of fuck you. It's very it's beautiful. If you want to know what fuck you taste like, get yourself a can of first form energy and one of these collectible camo cans. First form not calm. Fuck you. That has to be the link. You got to tell Chris Chasieling right now. Yeah. First form dot com slash fuck you goes right to that can't. Yeah. I love it. No, but real quick. So you remember us covering this last week, right? Talked about billionaire Bill Lackerman. How he talked to the the Harvard president was hired. How he's mad that the people that he groomed and created are now turning against them. Right. Right. Yeah. Well, and so that's what leaves this third and final intro topic. And it's like when they are done with you, they are done with you. Right. And I say that because this headline comes out. Christopher Rufo, Harvard president, Claude Engaes, PhD dissertation, violate school plagiarism scants. So now they're trying to fucking get this. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's bro. So last week. Yep. Last dude saying that the only way that this woman was the president of Harvard was because of DEI say it basically saying because she's black. Black. 100%. The only reason you're the president is because you're fucking black is what he's saying. And now now they're exposing the fact that her dissertation was plagiarized. Hmm. Dude. Now, now listen. Okay. Allegedly. Allegedly. I mean, allegedly, I mean, he does roll out some some pretty convincing some pretty convincing evidence of it. Right. Like, I mean, it was a clear copy and fucking paste. Right. Here's my problem with it. That does her. It wasn't like she wrote that yesterday. Right. No, they knew they've known like she wrote that in 1996. This is how I problem. Listen, bro. This is how those people control people. Yeah. This is how they get them to do their thing. They get something against them. Somehow, some way shape or form. In fact, I am willing to bet that those people, act men type people probably put her in and and helped her with this. Yeah. Yeah. Knowing that it like, Hey, come here. I'm going to do you a favor knowing that that was a chip in the pocket. I see, I see, I see potential in you. Yes. Yeah. Let me help you with this. One day you're going to be the president of Harvard. Correct. See, we made about a line. Yeah. So here's what happened. The conversation went like this. Ackman calls that woman and says, we made you. What do you do? And why are you allowing this? And she's like, well, I'm the president of Harvard. I'm making my own decision. And then they got there. And then they pulled that chip out and they throw it on the table and they say, Oh, yeah. That's how these people work, bro. Hey, ball. Yes. Yes. That's bullshit. But that's the thing. It's like, it's fucked up. It's a fucked up practice. And it's not like, this is not just, you know, yeah, it's fucked up to you, bro, because you're an honest person. Like you look at things and you think things look, bro. These people are mainly atheists. Yeah. Okay. They don't, they think that there are no moral repercussions for anything that they do. If they, if you truly believed, if all of us, anybody listening truly believed that there was no consequences to our actions as a human being, we would behave a whole lot differently to get where we want to go. Yeah. The only thing that actually stops people from doing extremely dirty, unethical stuff is a belief that there is accountability for the actions that we take now. Yeah. Okay. So these people are admittedly atheist or they will say they belong to this part of religion, but don't practice. Okay. Like Fauci came out this weekend and said, I'm a Catholic, but I don't need to practice because I let my life speak for itself. Okay. Fine. The reality is he's not Catholic and he don't give a fuck. Okay. They don't have any moral compass or any moral standard because they have no belief in anything that's bigger than themselves. And because they have no belief in anything that's bigger than themselves, this sort of operating doesn't feel wrong to them. That's amazing. It does not feel unethical. It feels like this is just how we get our what we need to do. And that's what you have to understand. It's a fundamental difference in reality. This is why I could say whatever to fuck I want to say on here and my companies continue to grow because my companies are in a sect of the world where you have to work to get results. It's called fitness. All right. You have to invest your energy to get a result. Fundamentally, the people who disagree with the things that I say on the show do not believe in that at all. They believe that everything should be given to them. So when they call and they say, I'm never shopping with you again and I type their fucking name in the computer. Guess what? They've never been here. Okay. It's all fear based bullshit that these people try to do. And you all of us together, we would all operate very differently if we didn't think that there were repercussions for our actions. And it's important for us to recognize that the enemy, the people doing these evil things in the world, they all think on a different operating system than what we think on. And so for us to sit here and think like, oh, I can't believe these people are doing it. That's what keeps us like in the position of victimhood and gives them the power because they have no problem doing it. They have no problem doing it. Like when we think like, holy shit, dude, how could these people inject billions of people with something that they don't even know works or that they know actually cause these side effects in an effort to potentially depopulate the planet, which is people talk about all the time. How could you actually do that? And most people have a hard time reconciling that so they automatically believe that it's got to be bullshit. But the reality is is those people don't think like you. And if you can't identify that they don't think like you, you're in a weak position of strategy because you're operating on a different set of rules than they are. These people don't have any rules. They don't have any ethics. They don't have any beliefs. So this kind of operation is completely acceptable to them. And like bro, you can't convince me this is like fucking coincidence. Like all the stuff's coming out and now this comes out like that's not coincidence. These mother like, there's no other way to like who days later they know that this was a thing. Yes, this happens. They knew it in 1990. Fuck and seven. It's just complete bullshit, man. Complete bullshit. Well guys, that was our three rundowns man. Quick little intros and tell us what you guys think on any of these topics. Moon landing, Alex Jones back on Twitter and Dr. Gay might not be a doctor. She might just be gay. I mean, is it true? I mean, you guys tell us. Let's get it to the show, man. We got some good headlines out there, man. Why are you gay? You're gay. Who said that? You are gay. But no, let's get into these, man. Guys, remember if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to AndyFestell.com to find them there. If you're watching on YouTube, check down in the description below. Make sure you subscribe. But that being said, hell on number one. Now, this is the biggest story out there today. And this is breaking news. And most people's more at the time of the recording, I should say. Hell on number one reads, Special Counsel Jack Smith calls on Supreme Court to rule on Trump immunity claim. So this is a big deal. This is weird that he's that he's taking this move. It's kind of thrown everybody off by surprise. So let's dive into this a little bit. So Special Counsel Jack Smith acts the Supreme Court to rule on whether former president Donald Trump can be prosecuted on charges relating to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Smith's Monday filing seeks to go around an appeals court that initially been expected to handle the case. Federal judge had earlier ruled that the prosecution could move forward, though Trump's legal team vowed to appeal the ruling. So quote, this case presents a fundamental question at the heart of our democracy, whether a former president is absolutely immune from federal prosecution from crimes committed while in office or is constitutionally protected from federal prosecution when he has been impeached, but not convicted before the criminal proceedings begin. Prosecutors wrote in Monday's filing, now Trump's trial and the election and the interference case is set to begin in March. So they're basically just trying to fast track this entire process. And whether or not the Supreme Court sides, I mean, they're what six to three on conservative judges. So I mean, it's likely that they turn this down very likely, but I mean, we also, I mean, who knows? But it's very, very interesting CNN's jumped in on the bandwagon here as well. They're saying that, you know, the way they see it is that they say this, the extraordinary request is an attempt by Smith to keep the election subversion trial currently scheduled for early March on track. Smith is asking the Supreme Court to take the rare step of skipping a federal appeals court and quickly decide a fundamental issue of the case against Trump. And I think Trump's definitely listening to the show right now too, by the way, because you guys remember we were talking about these cases and I'm like, dude, why doesn't Trump just say like, fuck you? No, he did. He finally did. I will not be testifying on Monday, mega. He did. Yeah, he absolutely did. So he put out a two post on truth, basically laying out this whole court case, right? Because I mean, they brought in, and this is specific to one in New York when it comes to the fraud and overestimating or overstating his value and net worth and all that good stuff, which we, which we clearly debunked debunked when we had Tim Parlatory on just a few episodes ago. And by the way, it's no coincidence. If you go, go look at the view counts on Tim Parlatory's episode where we debunked what they've actually trying to do to Donald Trump versus the view counts on all the other CTIs that we put it put out and then ask yourself what's actually going on? Take a look. Yeah. That's what I mean. I mean, he posted the truth and concluded that, you know, basically he says, quote, he said, I have nothing more to say other than that this is a complete and total election interference Biden campaign, which hunt that will do nothing but keep businesses out of New York. I will not be testifying on Monday, Maga. Good. I love that. The speaking of elections, did you see who Joe Biden hired? No. Oh, man, Joe Biden, the list election to Nyer Hillary Clinton in 2024 campaign. He hired her. Yeah, he's bringing her in now. So she's just going to kill him and try to run herself. She would put some side eye that do's oatmeal or something. Either that or a lot why would you bring someone like that in like you're you're about to kick it anyway, bro. Like you're you got to watch your every step, man. You might fall down the stairs and might be over and you bring like the world's most prolific alleged serial killer in to your fucking house. I mean, come on, man. Yeah, listen. So, so President Joe Biden over the weekend enlisted election and I Hillary Clinton in his election. Watch this Biden's going to somehow mysteriously expire. Yeah, on a live. Yeah. Yeah, I see it. Watch, bro. I see it. I have no choice, but to continue the fight to save our democracy. There you go. There you go. Yeah. Yeah, but he's bringing her in to build infrastructure, raise money and mobilize voter. Lotus is what what they're so bring in the second most hated person behind yourself. God dang, man. These people are not very smart. Yeah. I mean, shit. Dude, when are they going to think like this is the thing. This is goes back to the to the topic we were talking about with threads and these people who are leaving Twitter and shit. These people believe their own shit too, bro. They've controlled the media. They've controlled social media. They've censored everybody, suppressed everybody. And when they go out in public, they can't figure out why everybody hates them. And they pretend like everybody loves them. Like, bro, nobody loves these people. No, no. No, no. Yeah. So I mean, twice she's twice failed presidential candidate for a reason for a reason. And she couldn't win with all of that stuff. We just said no. She still couldn't win with all of the shit. No, yeah. Quote, people close to Hillary Clinton, anticipate she'll be a tireless campaigner for the Biden campaign, rallying democratic voters by laying out the stakes and explaining why a Trump victory could subvert America's democratic norms. NBC News reported. You mean subvert America's complete corrupted government? Really? Bro, it's funny because more and more people are, dude, just keep going. Yeah, I mean, fuck, I think it's disastrous. It's good for us. Yeah, it's great, but like, okay, but what do we miss in here, though? What do we miss in is that they plan on cheating the same way that they cheated before? Yeah, they plan on doing the same shit, bro, Biden's already come out and said, I'm not really going to campaign and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They're going to make up. Oh, dude. I could go on and on, but you guys already know. They're saying, uh, so I like this quote here. So quote, she is also well positioned to caution voters that if they support a third party candidate, they may cut into Biden's margins, uh, and flip the election to Trump. Democratic strategy just said, um, Democratic strategist said, uh, the report continued. Clinton's role is only expected to grow in the new year, but for now, she is feeling a space that at a later point in the campaign season, former president Barack Obama will join. Yeah. Do you feel that, bro? You hear it? You smell it. I smell bullshit. It smells like fear. I smell, it smells like desperation. It smells like we have bringing the big guns. I'm starting to like feel the red, white and blue flowing through my fucking veins. Bro, I don't know if it's this special camo can of the first four menager here, but like I'm starting to really like feel like the America. Like I feel like it's getting ready to come out of my fingertips, bro. I feel like we're on the verge of some patriotic shit. Yes. I feel like this next year, they're going to try to fuck with everybody, but dude, unless it, I mean, real talk. I mean, I think they're going to do some really bad shit. But if we get through it, if we get through it, which I think we will, hopefully these people are done. Yeah. They're done. And by the way, by the way, if you think Donald Trump is going to like let these people go this time, you're insane. And if he does, fuck him too. That's a fact. Yeah. That's a fact. Dude, I just think like I think of the strategy meeting they have here. Like, all right, we're down with polls. We're down. Bring in the black guy. You know what I'm saying? Bro, I don't think anybody's with it anymore, man. Man, cuz dude, I think that's the beautiful thing too, bro. I think, I think I think that's what I'm saying to the fact that like Obama didn't do fucking shit. No, not only knew that, most people knew it. Listen, man, most listen, but they're saying it now. Dude, it's great because here's the reality. There's enough. There's enough of the black population that is like over 30, right? Who kind of remembers how this all went down. And they're looking back and they're saying, dude, it was better in 2005. It was better in 2006. We were all getting along. My life was better. Things were better. Relations were better. And now look at, like they're starting to understand. They're starting to understand. I think this migrant crisis has has opened a lot of the black community up to alternative thought processes because, bro, you don't want to believe that people who are claiming to rep, like, look, you're, you're you're a black dude. Yeah, I know. I know, man. Fuck. But like, look, bro, here's how I see it. Right? Like I try to put myself in that position. Like I'm in a minority position. Okay, everywhere I go pretty much, I'm the minority. Right? And I have this guy who comes out and who's very fucking charismatic and easy to like and easy to believe in. And he comes out and he says all this shit that he's going to do for our people. And he goes in and doesn't do any of it. In fact, he makes it worse. So now when I go places in society, things are actually worse for me. And these people who have been claiming to love us and care about us and tell us to hate these other people. These people are actually now importing other people into our communities. And not taking into account any like these things are becoming obvious to people. And people are starting to see it. And it's really a great thing. But we've got a problem with the migrants. Yeah. The migrants is a real problem. And that's the other thing too. Like I mean, the amount of them that there are like, it's going to be extremely difficult just logistically to take care of that issue. You know, I'm saying like, yeah, it's going to be very difficult. It's, listen, it's not that difficult. It's going to be unpalatable for the average citizen. Yeah. It's not difficult. It's going to be required to give them. Yeah. It's going to be, it's going to be, in the media is going to show like, you know, they're going to focus in on little kids crying and like, they're going to make it seem like that's not who we're going to. We want the military age males. Listen, that's that's the only people that's been coming. Listen, man, they got to go. Yeah. And it really doesn't matter how they got to go. That's it. Yeah. So, you know, that's not that's not that people when I say that, a lot of my friends who, you know, are Latino or from Mexico, they'll always hit me up in the DMs. They're like, what the fuck, man, my whole family, but no, we're not talking about that. We're talking about these military age migrants that have come across the border since the election 2020 at an unfiltered rate who are pouring into our country and don't belong here. We're not talking about legal immigration. We are not even talking about the illegal immigration that comes from Mexico. We love Mexicans, bro. We all get along. It's part of American culture. Okay. Latino culture, Mexican culture is a big part of the United States of American culture. Everybody recognizes that. I think it's important to, to narrow down what we're talking about. You know what I'm saying? I'm not talking about my buddy, whose grandma is over here. You're going to boil. Yes. Well, it's fine. Yes. That's now what we're talking about. And the, and the media and the, the leftists and the communists make you think they'll make you think that we're talking about that. And that's not what we're talking about. No, you could even make a case that if you've been here, let's say, let's just say if you to make this easier for everybody, there could be a case made to where they could say something like if you've been here since 2018. Okay. We'll naturalize you. We'll force you to take a couple of the classes and you're good. You don't have to be deported. But if you've come here since 2020, you're fucking out. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah, I'm down with it, man. Something. There's a way to do it. Trump, you need to hire me, bro. Like real talk. Like just call me up on the phone. I'll be there. Yeah. Real talk. I mean, listen to the show. Yeah. You guys all listen. Call me up. I'll be there. I come down. I help out. I'll tell you all these, all these fake fuckers that you got around you that don't know what the fuck they're doing. I'll tell them to fuck off. Real talk. Yeah. I'm with it, man. I'll play golf with, you know, when you're white pants. Bro, me and the big T, we'll fuck it, figure it out. Did you see his, you know, sad? Did you see his fucking golf cart set up? Is it something? Bro, is it awesome? I've had a nerve. Listen, man, Trump's always been a pent-dude. I remember I said you that guy's that picture of him when he was younger with his Lamborghini. Trump's always been awesome, dude. Everybody always thought so too, man. Everybody until the fucking media started with this bullshit. Everybody loved Donald Trump, dude. He's an American icon. I don't give a fuck what you say. Okay. Now I have critic criticisms about some of the things that they do, but I also got to remember. I don't know everything going on. You know why? So my criticisms could be inaccurate. Like one of the things I wish Donald Trump would do is come out and say, hey, motherfuckers, we're going to do 10% tax. You want to win the election, bro? Say that. Yeah. And then do it. Well, the most, well, the best country in the history of the earth. My fucker who look like Dubai. You know what I'm saying? No crime, no taxes. Everybody be cool. Everybody be rich. What kind of car are you buying? Uh, Bugatti. That's right. No Ferrari. All right. That too. You'd be able to do both. You're both. Yeah. That's it. Get them all. You know, I got that same problem. Fucking Bugatti's for everybody for cell. 28. Yeah. There we go. Yeah. All right. There we go. Well, guys, let's get it. Let's keep the show cruising. We got a. But seriously, Trump call me. Yeah. Call them. Call me. It's not bad. Call DJ too. Diversity. Yeah. I mean, if you want to. Yeah. Diversity. Yeah. I'm the DEI officer. Yeah. Well, we're going to wipe that out. So what are you going to do after that? Hood housing. Hood. Yeah. Section eight. You just want to kick people out. Guys, just keep this cruise moving, man. We got cruise comments. Man, you'd be great at evictions. Oh, man, you got to go. I wouldn't be able to stomach it, bro. You'd be good at it. No, you're out. Yeah. Yeah. No. All right. Cruise comments, man. This is a. We got. I got two of them here. There's two good ones. So this first one, I just feel like we got to address. Okay. All right. This comment is coming from Oak Valley, La live edge. They say DJ is full of shit. Raising canes is awesome. And taco local on Washington, Missouri destroys supportly. Also, KSO is a dip and a sauce, depending on how you use it. I can't say anything because I haven't had canes. I can't say anything. But listen, I don't even know why this argument is to what I'm going to say. It's okay. Listen, it's okay for why people have shit too, bro. That's fine. That's fine. It's okay. I mean, but like, but that's the thing. It's like, like perspective. You know, I'm saying like we talk about on the show. It's only the best shit. If that's the only shit you've ever taste it. What? Raising canes is amazing. It's really good. I remember seeing a black person saying, you guys see it? You guys think it's good, Joe? Is it okay? Thank you, Joe. Joe don't like it. Joe, but Joe, all right. So I don't know. And it's three to two. Joe was cultured. I think Joe's vote was like two votes. No, that's racist. Why is Joe get two votes? Huh? Why is Joe get two votes? No, because like, he understands the culture. So outweighs their little fucking inexperience. We still win though. You dumbass. This motherfucker knows no, no, that means I'm a tiebreaker if he gets to. Okay. So we got it. Order some canes. Yeah. And then you'll be the one saying it's good because I like the guy that runs the company. I think he's a smart fucking guy. That's a concert like three votes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you like chicken with no salt and pepper on it? That's just chicken. It's just taste like chicken. Not fried chicken. Well, does it have high sauce? Yes. Or any kind of sauce? Yeah, they have it. Because I think if you have dipping sauce, I think it negates any kind of spices. Canes sauces. You can't taste spices with sauce on it. Yeah, but like sometimes, bro, you just want the chicken. Now me, I want ketchup on all my shit, bro. I'm a ketchup, dude. I put ketchup on my fucking everything. I don't care what you think. I can be good. If I go to dinner with you at the nicest steakhouse in the fucking world, I'm ordering fucking ketchup and fuck you. That's real shit. That was so passionate. Like, is this real? Because everybody thinks it's white trash, but I am white trash. Yeah. I am who the fuck I am. I'm not like somebody asked me to like somebody asked me today. Like they, they're like, do you drink wine? I'm like, my fuck do I look like I drink wine? Do I sound like I drink wine? I don't know shit about wine. I drink M.D. 20. That's right. And I smoke weed. My fancy beer is a Stella, bro. You know what I'm saying? That is a fancy. Well, that's as fancy as I make it. That's good. Bro, I feel fancy too. That comes out in a nice glass. It's own glass. Like it's, yeah, see, those guys understand presentation. I'm not saying they got their own glass. No, no, Bush liked it. Bush like, he's got the fucking camo cam, bro. It comes with disc labor. It says, don't beat your wife. You know what I'm saying? Fuck. That's awesome. I love it. Yeah. But so, so, so, so since we've solved this, we haven't, I don't think we've done. We have, because I get two votes and you guys are tied. Wait, I don't even need two votes. Joe can have two votes. I still beat you. Because I'm saying that the guy who runs it is a smart guy and he makes some good chicken. I only have to taste the guarantee that they make more money off their sauce than they do the chicken. Well, that's why they maybe they don't want to fuck up their sauce by putting a bunch of shit on their chicken. No, no. I'll tell you what I do like. What's that? Culver's. Okay, Culver's is a Culver's is black people approved. Oh, for sure. Is it? Let's see, that's the thing like it's like, it's like rich black people approve poor black people don't know man, I didn't know about it till recently. That's real shit. Is it is it expensive to go there? No, it's not that existent. They're not in the hood though. Oh, they're not? Man, they're fucking burgers. They're really burgers. Yeah, they're good. They're pretty good. The shakes are good too. Yeah, maybe that's a good spot. It's a good spot. Yeah, no Culver's is good. So Taco Locoh in Washington, okay? We got to know what that is. Got to check that out. Yeah. Because we're not too far from Washington, Missouri. Yeah. We got a lot of friends out in Washington. Thanks for you guys. Every time we go to Washington, we get stopped every time. Yeah, we do. Yeah, I love it. I'm not by the police. No, that's why we don't get stopped. That little stretch, that little stretch from 44 and 100 into Washington. Yeah, if you guys ever see me driving on there, just look the other way. Yeah. No, but I saw this good comment. All right, whatever, raising canes is up for debate. But I saw this comment. The worst part about this show is that it isn't every day. Yeah, well, thanks, man. Yeah, thanks, Randall. That's a, that's a, that's the Hitzby deep. Hey, we got some good stuff coming for 2024. We do. Okay, we talk about the different formats of the show. What if we had a different show of all the formats every single week? I'm not saying that's exactly what's going to happen. But I'm saying that's probably exactly what's going to happen. All right. So you're going to be happy, Randall. Yeah, we'll make you happy, Randall. We'll try to make some good stuff coming. You guys been supporting us. We're going to give you, we're going to give you some more meat. You know what I'm saying? We're giving you just a tip. What? We're going to blow your walls out. Yeah, blow that TV box up. Yeah. Yeah. No, we appreciate you guys. Oh, thank you for real. Thanks for being real ass fans. I love it. All right. Let's get back into headline number two. That let them two reads Hunter Biden's universe of legal problems briefly explained. Okay. Now, this is seeing instincts. So it's great. This is great. It's a fucking six minute read, bro. It must not be that brief, but it's a universe of legal problems. Okay. Yeah. So I thought this was interesting. Let's dive into this. So CNN and every remarkable six month turn of events. Hunter Biden, the president's son has gone from the cusp of a no jail time plea deal to looming trials and Delaware on gun charges and in California on tax charges. The tax charges filed Thursday built on an uncomfortable narrative about the president's son that he was a drug addict who spent large amounts of money on a lavish lifestyle and that he did not pay all of his taxes on time that he traded on his father's name was already clear. While he was able to use his last name to make kind of writing his that. Go back. Yeah. Who the fuck wrote that? Uh, that he. Hold on. Zachary Wolf. Yeah. Zach, you're an idiot. Well, I mean, he works for see. Okay. That he traded on his father's name was already clear. That is not a complete thought or a sentence. No. Don't ask. Yeah. What the fuck is that? Zach? So, oh, but I want to continue while he was able to use his last name to make money. His lawyers now argue he is facing trials that any other American would not. Hunter Biden's legal battles now seems likely. What? So you don't have to pay taxes and not the habits to you forever. You could blow all kinds of money. You could take money from China. The Trump's guilty. Do all this shit and no other American will be prosecuted really? Really? Is that is that how it's working? Prove anybody else did this shit, bro. They be in jail forever. That'd be an joke already. No, forever. They'll never get out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it says, uh, Hunter Biden's legal battles. Uh, legal battle now seems likely to crescendo with a political campaign in which President Joe Biden is already struggling to convince Americans he should be reelected. So, um, they have a couple of little sub bulls. So how many cases is Hunter Biden facing? He's facing two. Uh, the most recent are the tax charges. He's include nine counts, three felonies and six minutes and meters of alleged tax crimes from the year, uh, tax years 2016 to 2019. They were filed Thursday and federal court in the Southern California, um, by a special counsel David Weiss, uh, with a scathing indictment handed down by a federal, uh, grand jury. Biden is accused of engaging in a scheme to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in taxes on income and instead funding a lavish lifestyle of drugs and escorts. Read the full report. It doesn't sound too lavish to me. That sounds like a dirt bag lifestyle. Yeah. Lackish. Nothing's lavish. Let's glorify drugs and escorts as you try and that's that's Zachary trying to, so to not paint this as truthful as it actually. That's the generate lifestyle. Yeah. Um, so, uh, so yeah, so two total charges there. And of course you got the gun charges he's still, uh, he's still dealing with. But what did we learn in the new charges? Zachary asked, um, We, Weiss argues that Biden continued to invade taxes into 2020 and in the indictment, he includes a chart of nearly five million dollars in spending between 2016 and 2019, including six hundred eighty three thousand two hundred and twelve dollars in payments to quote unquote various women, and one hundred eighty eight thousand nine hundred and sixty dollars on quote unquote adult entertainment. Um, a useful summer is summarizing quote from the indictment is this quote between 2016 and October 15th, 2020, the defendant spent this money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but taxes. Um, and if he's convicted of these, he's facing up to 17 years in prison, um, which, uh, which which Biden responds to you saying that they're trying to kill him to hurt the president. That's literally his quote, he says, uh, quote, what they're trying to do is they're trying to kill me knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle. And so therefore destroying a presidency in that way, he said adding that they want him to relapse the drug abuse quote, it's not about me. He continued adding that quote, these people are just sad, very, very sick people that have most likely just faced traumas in their lives, uh, that they've decided that they are going to turn into an evil that they decide if they're going to inflict on the rest of the world. You spent millions of dollars on hose, bro. So everybody else is a, so everybody else is is saying, Hey, you did this and then now they're, they're traumatized. You want me to go back to that? They just want me to go back to that and be out of the news. That's the truth. No shit. No shit. They're trying to kill me. Get the fuck out of here. Yeah. I mean, like dude, like they'd be forget about the cocaine that was just literally just found in the White House. They kind of got brushed over. Who's was that? Oh, sure. It wasn't his because I guarantee if there's a relapse that happened, happened a while ago. You know, there's just, there's just don't hold me accountable for the things I did because otherwise I'll do them again. It'll kill my father. Dude, this is what we're talking about here. Like, this is absurd victim culture, gaslighting, projection, deflection, manipulative dogs. Shit. Yeah. The fuck out of here, man. Yeah. Well, and so our good buddy, James Comer, he thinks that this is actually just a big cover up. Shocking is, you know, like somebody, I thought this was somebody that wanted this to happen, right? But he's saying this is just a lot of Balarkey and cover up. So James Comer Special Counsel's new Hunter by what? What I say, Malarkey. I think you said Balarkey. Balarkey is an obelisk. Is that baloney and Malarkey mixed? Is that what you did there? That's the dark side. Was that was that you? Was that was that you taking too fast and putting something together? Is that a new thing? It's Malarkey, not Balarkey, right? Maybe Balarkey is what it is. No, you might have just came up with something else. It's like not Malarkey and not baloney. It's Balarkey. It's no larkey. What's that? I'll get it. Yeah. Balarkey. Yeah. All right. I like it. It just sounded good. Balarkey sounds all right, man. Give you credit. It's not terrible. I was just going to, I was just a little confused on what you were doing there. Man, I know if you're pulling a key feel so funny. I mean, I just didn't know if you're like you're pulling an audible or what happens sometimes guys. I like it. It's the bonnocks. It wasn't the bonnocks. It's like you're like a wordsmith over there. It's coming up with your own shit. I like it. But yeah, so James Cobra, let's see. He can't be a coxman in a wordsmith though together. You know that, right? Who? He can only be one or the other. A coxman? Yeah. So which one are you? I'm not a coxman. I got shit to do with that, bro. The fuck is that? All right. You answered the question. We can move on. I don't know about that. What is that? Let's talk about it later. Joe, don't cut that out of the show. So yeah. So let's see what James Cobra had to say. So this article Republicans have long alleged that the Biden administration and Democrats have weaponized the Justice Department to target their political foes. But House Oversight Committee chair James Cobra took that logic a step further on Friday claiming that special counsel David Wises investigation into Hunter Biden, which has resulted in two indictments that could see the president's son facing decades in prison is actually meant to protect him. Quote, my concern is that Wises may have indicted Biden to protect him from having to be disposed in the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday. Comer said, uh, Cobra told Jake Tapper on CNN. Quote, this whole thing has been about a cover up. You indict him on the least little thing, the gun charge and not paying taxes that Kentucky Republican asked. Quote, look at what he's done. Anybody else in America would already be in prison. That's what he had to say about it. Any any any final thoughts on good old Hunter? I mean, he's the stress looks like it's getting to him, man. That's just withdrawal, bro. I don't know what it is, but he don't look great. But you know what? You fucked around. He's about to find out just like to rest these people. Yeah, so yeah, it really doesn't matter what they do for the next 12 months. I mean, they're going to try to fuck shit out. But I don't think people are with it, man. I don't think people are going to allow it. We better not. Yeah. Well, I think we just gotta keep keep calling for accountability. Yeah. Well, especially for COVID, you know, let's not forget about all that. That's an important thing for people to never forget about. You know, I was talking to my buddy who's dad, he had to watch his dad die over zoom. Legitimately, watch his dad die over zoom. And yesterday, he was crying to me on the phone about it three years later. So think about that. It was an adversity, right? He's just yeah. So so the trauma and the destruction created from these people should never ever be ever forgotten. Yeah, all of it. Yeah. Guys, tell us jumping on this conversation. What do you guys think? Think about this? Let us know down in the comments. Hashtag. Lose the hand. Save the arm. And tell us what you guys think. So that being said, our third and final headline headline number three. Had the number three reads average monthly mortgage payment explodes to $3,322 in Biden's America. Now, I got a two part to this. Okay, because there is some there, I guess there is a like a little sliver of light here. Okay. But let's dive into this. So the average monthly mortgage payment in Joe Biden's America has soared to $3,322 per analysis from the Wall Street Journal. That $3,322 is nearly double the average monthly mortgage payment when it's for for legitimacy, assumed office. When former president Trump left office, the average monthly mortgage payment was $1,700. Here's the graphic clearly shows and outlines exactly what's going on by dynamics by dynamics. And Wall Street titled their report, The Math for Buying a Home No Longer Works. These charts show you why you guys can check that out if you want quote, home ownership has become a pipe dream for more Americans writes the Wall Street Journal, even those who could afford to buy just a few years ago. Many would be buyers were already filling stretch thin by home prices that shop quickly higher in the pandemic, but at least mortgage rates were low. The report adds now that they are high, many people are just giving up. And the charts not showing it is actually cheaper now to just just lease and rent houses own nothing. You'll own nothing and be happy. That's what I got from that, not only that, they're trying to they're trying to break people financially completely so they have to depend on a universal basic income. This is this is the next step to pushing the middle class and the poverty, the first step being what they did with small businesses in 2020 where they closed everybody small businesses and allowed the big global corpse to stay open, saying that the small businesses were what was the term? What was the term they used? Essential non-essential businesses? So your livelihood they deemed non-essential and now they've created a situation for inflation to try and put you over the fucking edge in the poverty. And you know we could talk about this over and over again, but there was a certain someone me and this other guy DJ who told you they were trying to do this four years ago and you all called us crazy. So it's been very frustrating to watch this play out knowing what they have been planning to do and and what they've written about in public and the things they've talked about and you know they've written books about this they proclaim this openly. Yeah so yeah so you know that being said you know a lot of people are moving right now not just from you know houses to apartments but they're moving state to state you know trying to find cheaper places to live things like that and there is some some some silver lining here right because saw this headline that comes out thousands of blue state residents flocked to Idaho bringing conservative politics with them. So we know there's been mass exodus from all these different states, California being one and now a lot of that data is actually in as far as like what those people are voting right they're leaving those places typically these main blue states and what are they voting might. So data published by the Idaho Secretary of State's office shows that out of nearly 119,000 people who recently moved to the state 65% registered as Republicans compared to just 12% registering as Democrats. The data which was reviewed by Fox News Digital shows that out of the roughly 20,000 Americans who moved from Washington state to Idaho 62% registered as Republicans compared to 12% as Democrats 24% is unaffiliated and 2% as other now the percentage of registered Republicans originally from Washington who recently moved to Idaho is actually higher than the state's overall percentage of registered Republicans which sits at about 58% yeah so they're leaving those blue votes behind which is really really good to see quote we weren't surprised to find that Republicans are moving to Idaho however we were surprised to see just how overwhelming it was of those moving to Idaho the majority of voters from 48 out of the 49 other states are Republican Republican Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrain told Fox News the data comes as a handful of expensive and liberal states such as California and New York have since the pandemic seems an accident of residents who have moved to states like Florida and Texas there's some other data from California so out of the nearly 40,000 people who left California for Idaho are you whopping 75% registered as Republicans the data reviewed by Fox News Digital shows only 10% of the California pool registered as Democrats 14% as unfiliated and 2% as other. Check Californians become the post-achite state for resident migration with more than 340,000 people fleeing the state between 2021 and 2022 alone it says the golden state has seen a handful of celebrities and notable businesses also flee since the pandemic including Rout Stewart Hillary Swank and Elon Musk's Tesla before the pandemic California average less than 200,000 years who moved to other states. What do we got on this Andy? Well let's run the governor of California for president. Yeah that makes sense. That makes sense. You know let's let's take the guy who will go get him if they leave here we'll just go get him everywhere. Let's take the guy who's legitimately the poster child of the regime that they're trying to install in the culture they're trying to install in the United States which they have done successfully so far in California and let's let him do California to everybody. That makes sense. That's what I think. I think that'd be a great idea. I mean look Mr. Hire you. Well they're not worried about it because they have so much influence to fudge what actually happens. You know what I'm saying they have control of the media they still have control the most of the social platforms. They still have a lot of the control that they've had. They have the ability to apparently do some criminal activities around the elections in certain areas of the country. It appears that's so. Yeah. Okay so these people are less worried about actually running a quality candidate that cares about the country and cares about you and I and more way more in fact they're only interested in putting someone in power who is willing to push their agenda further down the line and that's what this is about. So you know Gavin Newsom goes on TV and debates around the Santas and I'm not really a dissentist guy either like the Santas should have followed my advice in the beginning which was to shut the fuck up play your role for another four years and you would have been an automatic guy in 2020. You would have been automatic automatic bro you would have been president. Yeah. But you got greedy you listening to the wrong people and now things are playing out differently and so we have a debate between these two guys where one guy is legitimately legitimately lying and making up facts. Every single time he lied he followed up with and that's a fact that's a fact if you go back and you want to know every lie that Newsom told during that debate he follows it up with and those are facts or some sort iteration of that statement that's his tell if we're playing poker that's how I would know that he was lying and cheating okay. I got a royal flush. Yes. Yes. Yes. He's not aware of it. Yeah. He's not aware of it but if you're good at like learning from people and watching people that's his tell and so if you go watch the debates and by the way you can verify all of that go verify all the things that he said were facts they are not facts he was making it up on national TV knowing that most people will not go look for themselves. Because he understands his voter base his voter base is not educated voter there are people who believe what's as told them on television and the media not realizing that these things are compromised right so he knows that the people who you know it's not about actual facts it's not about actual data it doesn't matter at all what matters is that he presents it in a confident way in a authoritative way that makes people say look at him destroying Ron DeSantis on the stage. Correct. And while DeSantis was actually arguing with real facts and he was not convincing or compelling and that's a problem for him dude you you need some help like you need some help and some practice on your debate skills man like you need some more authority you need some more swag and you need some more fuck you and your delivery if you want to be taken seriously and he doesn't have it and that's why the vape goes up there and dominates everybody every single time. So you know uh but the point is is that it's about appearances and it's about showing an appearing to be a authoritative and knowledgeable and smart as opposed to actually and so like you know when I when I look at this and I see people leaving California and you guys see it it should be absurd to you that this is somebody that's being talked about as some sort of possible leader for all of us it's insane it's insane shit insane and I don't think he's the guy anyway I think they're going to try to run Michelle Obama that's my that's my that's still better on that yeah I've always thought that because they these people can't help themselves about the race thing they have they're so identity politics driven yes a million percent well that's why Kamala's here yeah no doubt so you know these that's what I think their play is going to be the Democratic National Convention as in Chicago I've said this I don't know a year ago I probably two years ago now I've been saying this so uh that's that's what I think but if you move from California you continue to vote for the same shit in other states you're a special kind of dumb fuck that's that's the last thing I'll add to you know these people come into areas and you know with their fucking California license plates and you know they got co-exist sticker on their fucking cars like bro we're flattening your fucking tires out here brother like you're not welcome if you're gonna come in and be a reasonable American and be able to have a conversation say yeah all that shit's fucked up that's why I left now I'm gonna change the way that I actually operate welcome yeah but still think that fucking stick yeah get fuck out of here with that shit guys co-exist with who who who's not co-exist with me the whole they're not they haven't been oh they haven't been at all and and and all exists with you and by the way nobody had a problem with gay people nobody had a problem with bisexual people nobody had a problem with lesbians nobody even had a problem with trans people until the petafiles got involved and now you guys want you guys want inclusion and we got college professors at some of these universities talking about minor attracted people okay the regular normal common sense morally good human being is not gonna be co-exist with that it's a big problem dude the petafilio thing's big problem dude you know do you see that contract that uh Otani signed 700 million dollars ten years yeah ten yeah he's the best hater and the best pitcher major leagues yeah he signed a 10 year 700 million dollar contract with the Dodgers who the fuck is advising this guy why would you sign with the Dodgers his actual take home out of 70 million dollars a year will be 30 million dollars a year which is less than what half wait wait where the Dodgers at Los Angeles that's why yeah yeah you wouldn't you wouldn't sign them in a place with a favorable tax rate yeah like it's so dude he should fire as fucking agent like legitimately wait so he's getting seventy seven supposed to get seven it's ten years 700 divided by ten seven yeah okay that's per year his actual take home is around 30 million dollars it's less than half of the 70 that's insane yeah that doesn't account for the taxes he's gonna have to pay to own his vehicles and his and to own his house and to own his uh buy and sell shit do you understand this people think income taxes the barometer of how much we are taxed Jesus yes so he's for any but he signed for 700 he's getting 300 and then that all after everything seven none of really be like 150 he's signing for 700 which gives him 70 million per year after all of his taxes taken out it comes out to 33 million dollars is what it comes out to you at 33 million dollars then he's got to pay property tax then he's got to pay tax to buy and sell shit then he's got to pay all these other fucking extra taxes on top of that that's just his income tax we have to quit talking about tax and just our income tax that is one tax that's 15 more yes and when people do the math it's way worse than you think that's crazy and people revolted in this country for 3% tax bro okay we when we when I say we are slaves if you do the math and you break the math down and most areas of the country that is the case at every income level at every income level people do not understand this and then they take our money that they tax us and they send it overseas to these proxy wars and this foreign aid shit which then filters back into our country through political donations to their packs or they're they're big war-mongering companies you know the rathions the they get spend on cracker yes yeah and they don't pay the tax don't pay taxes on it like this he's about fuckers don't believe in tax for them they only believe in it for us geez man same thing happened with the Lakers they wanted to have a tournament they made 500 grand they're gonna take only like 210 yeah there you go each player got 500,000 dollar bonus and they're gonna take home less than half yeah and that's not gonna include what they spend the 2 10 on you spend it on a car tax sell a car tax own a house tax make more than x amount of money extra tax people do not understand it they do not teach you personal finance or tax code in school so they can get away with this and until you become literate to how much tax you're actually paying you're not going to understand how bad it actually is it's real bad and Trump like these that that should be the main calling point for the people on these candidates is like hey fix that we don't want to continue to be slaves we don't want to continue to be oppressed financially you want to fix the economy do what i said white the creditors fucking debt meaning our debt with them let us reduce our taxes go out and be prosperous and make them take the hit this next time no the big banks should take a hit this time every time there's a financial stimulus required it's them giving money to us an interest which makes them richer in us poor but they don't talk about that you know why because the big those people are paying all these people to save this shit and so like dude until a candidate like Ramaswami comes on the show and says 10% tax that's what all those candidates should actually be saying and if they're not saying it shows you that they're owned by somebody else that's a fact that is a fact and i don't care who it is so you know if Trump really if Trump really wanted if he really wanted to secure the election he would talk about this and say we're going to correct this on fucking day one and every single fucking person no matter what they think about his tweets or whatever they're going to vote for him yep they're going to vote for him because people are tired of getting smashed by our own government and enslaved by our own government you want you want to talk about making America great again making America free again that's the biggest part of it that's what's a massive it's the biggest part it's the biggest part what would your life look like if you didn't pay any tax you only pay 10% all of you what would your life look like you saw you know what you're saying we're God it would look like it would look better it'd be a lot easier you feel a lot less stress instantly you'd be able to have more opportunities open up okay and maybe maybe you don't want to invest in a better lifestyle well you would be able to live a better lifestyle with income you're at you know maybe we would get back to an America where the middle class working man could actually fucking own a home you know what I'm saying like it's bullshit bro and and and and I like a lot about Donald Trump I like a lot about what he is but like bro he ain't talking about that enough that needs to be something if he came out and said that if he legit came out and said hey on day one we're fucking going to 10% tax and that's that and we're cutting all this shit out bro every single fucking American with the exception of the the 3% on the far left communist shit they just switched to three who don't pay anything for anything anyway right who are the recipients of our tax dollars those people would be upset about it but the rest of us will vote for it yeah well that's the thing bro we actually would have more tax dollars because everybody would be fucking paying the first share that's right we have big companies tax wherever we would ever have exactly man yeah guys let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck that's where we bring I can tell you this bro if I got elected that's what I would do on the first fucking day yeah but first day if I ran for president 2028 the first day we're going to 10% tax that is my main thing that is my main platform that's what we're doing all right so many really so many people pissed off huh so many people pissed off the motherfuckers that benefit from it fuck them you know what I'm saying like hey to somebody feed you if you don't go to work and earn it no right so we should stop feeding all these motherfuckers and making fucking sink or swim if they don't want to they go somewhere else I'm waiting man I'm tired I'm tired of the freeloader and title bullshit presenting to me under the guise of some sort of mental illness or this if you're mentally ill put them in a fucking insane asylum will provide for you there three meals a day you can fucking watch video you can play video games and fucking watch Jerry Springer I don't give a shit now they got to watch the patreon whatever man whatever they can watch Trump speeches I don't give a shit but my point is mentally ill I'm not tired of this yeah if they're not capable of be addressed no and our welfare system instead of being eternity should be limited where you know you only qualify for x amount of time otherwise you and if you don't get a job you're fucked like that's what forces people to actually go earn a living knowing that they have no fallback it's zero options mentality and success and entrepreneurship personal development we talk about this all the time nobody produces their best work until they're forced to produce their best work the greatest time that you'll ever have as an entrepreneur is the time where you don't have any choice but to go because that's when you're gonna come up with your best shit and dude this is the same for human beings okay humans who think that they can just not do shit and collect a check while everybody else goes to work and pays these fucking taxes how is that okay how I'm not okay with that are you okay with that or any of you okay with that now I feel bad for people who are less fortunate but also I was one of those people and I had to work my fucking balls off for 25 fucking years man I didn't get to sit at home play fucking games I didn't have somebody bringing me shit you see what I'm saying like bro we we we have to stop this fucking victim shit there's if you're able bodied and you're your capable you should have a limited time on welfare and if you do drugs and you test fucking positive for drugs fuck fucking you lose your welfare like bro this this chair this charitable society that we live in like overly charitable I'm all about real causes I'm talking about the drain on society which is people who don't give a fuck about contributing and by the way those are the people that vote for these corrupt fucks so like dude we in my opinion that would be on day one too not only would I make the tax 10% I'd make it so you couldn't even fucking vote unless you actually paid your shit if you're not contributing why should you have a say makes sense to me and if you're 15 and you got a job and you pay taxes guess what you can vote that's the fair way to do it people who contribute should be able to vote people who do not contribute and it doesn't matter if they're man or a woman or black or white or gay or straight or anything if you contribute you should have a say if you do not contribute and you're just a recipient of the contributions you should have no say and if we change that like if we change that one thing this country would never look like it looks right now ever again anyway yeah well guys it is time we get into our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumbest fuckers we're bring a headline up talk about it get one of those two options so with that being said our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads photos libertarian Javier Miele inaugurated president of large antenna now this isn't the story but this is just the the start of it okay so libertarian economist Javier Miele was inaugurated president of Argentina on Sunday flanked by a host of heads of state including Spanish king Felipe VI and Ukrainian president Valadim Rizalinsky and surrounded by thousands of supporters in Buenos Aires so it's nice why the fucks he law on Zalinsky yeah if he's so he's in war right now hold on if he's so who he says he is why is he allowing Valinsky there yeah yeah that's a good question I think that might have been one of those things like bro you ever had like a you know like you know the weird cousin that shows up you didn't really invite him but like you can't like you know just send him away yes well you might yeah fuck out of your man I don't believe this guy is who he says yeah listen I don't believe this guy is who he says he is who he used to be no I don't there's some stuff I think he is part of of I think he is the personification and the creation of people who are very very intelligent and understand that they have pushed the narrative as far as they can with the woke agenda and now they're gonna figure out a way to push it with someone who appears to be the hero of the people so you think he's like the Trojan Horde I don't know it just doesn't feel right to me dude and like I see him you know doing weird shit being around those kind of people and like it doesn't make any sense well he was also around Brazil's Bolsonaro yeah I don't know there's just pins I just that's what I think this is a luski thing I don't know I think this is a luski thing was like I he just kind of showed up like I mean we can't really say like you know technically he wasn't even president yet when he was there so it's not like he had any power to send him away he's also the guy that shows up and you know it's gonna ask you for money that's what I'm saying like it's like it's like fuck man he's here again Jesus fuck do you want dude we don't even have money here right now bro bro cuz fuck yes bro bro yeah ain't got it um but like I said so so he gets inaugurated that's not the story though I think there was a really cool aspect behind his inauguration that I thought was freaking amazing um so this headline reads Argentina how the amela supporters clean streets after his inauguration now this I just thought this was fucking dope all right so supporters of president how the amela clean the streets of Buenos Aires Argentina on Sunday evening following his inauguration which attracted 25,000 people and included multiple international heads of states among its guests the celebrations in the Plaza de Mayo and other central locations in Buenos Aires attracted tens of thousands of people who Miele addressed on the steps of congress breaking with the tradition of speaking indoors Miele also serenaded the crowd with one of the most popular songs on the campaign trail drawing cheers once the public ceremonies concluded and Miele went on to swear in his cabinet officials and sign executive orders his supporters began distributing brooms garbage bags and cleaning supplies to undo the mess created by the event here's a quick video Radio but I know we we read it out for us as speaking to reporters on the Argentine Network TN, one person helping clean explained that the effort was, quote, uh, spontaneous and claimed that optimism and appreciation for their country had inspired it. Quote, it is truly out of a need to see everything clean, to see things well taken care of, one man said, it doesn't make sense to leave everything dirty. We aren't animals. We aren't whoever we are honorable people. A new Argentina is coming, a woman cleaning alongside the man at it. The Argentine newspaper, Clarine reported that similar groups convene in every block of brainless artists near the festivities, feeling garbage bags. Some observers describe the cleaning effort as a quote, Japanese style cleaning, referring to how Japanese soccer fans have developed a reputation for cleaning their stadium areas during FIFA World Cup matches. Hey, what we got on this? That's how it should be. Personal excellence, high standards. I guarantee you, dude, if we ever made it that far, our people would do that. 100% guarantee it. First form people do that. Arate people do that. You know what I'm saying? That's what happens when people are proud to be a part of something. They hold themselves to a high standard. And regardless of what I think he is or isn't, right now people believe in him, which is a cool thing. I hope he is who they're who he's who they're sending. Yeah, I hope that he is that person. But I think that speaks to, you know, you guys look at what what what what's going on in this country. And we see very little patriotism. We see very little pride. We see very little civic pride. Nobody gives a fuck. Everything is dirty. You walk down the street. There's shit everywhere. This is a problem that could be corrected through high standards as individuals. If you guys would start holding high standards, legitimate. This is my whole argument. This is my whole thing. If people would just hold a higher standard and understand personal excellence really is the ultimate rebellion. Okay, because if we're personally excellent and we don't give a shit what this guy does or that guy does and we take the time to do things right. Eventually other people join in and that goes for cleaning the streets, cleaning our cars, having you know, our shit together, being fit, being informed, you know, making good money, having a good career. It's all aspects when other people see that, they become that. And so we the the us. There's enough people to listen to the show to where we could set that standard. That's real shit. All right. So yes. Yes. There's enough people to listen to this fucking show that if everybody that listens to this show just did that and started legitimately holding themselves to a higher standard culture would bend itself the right way over time. It would just what? Because the ripple effect through the individuals that there's enough of them is massive. It's massive. So this is cool because I think this is real cool because this is this is what happens when people are proud. This is what happens when people are inspired. This is what happens when you, you know, give people hope. This is what happens when people decide, hey, we're not going to take this bullshit anymore. And we're all responsible for helping maintain society. See, the worst thing that's happened in America is that people have deferred their own personal responsibility to other people, quote unquote, other people, the government, other people will do it, other people will do it, other people will do it. And we've other people will do it ourselves into creating what, you know, in a lot of areas in this country is legitimately close to a third world situation. All right. That and other people aren't doing it. Yep. That's the thing. It's just like I mean, the shit in California. You got jeezing pink coming to town. They clean the whole place up and then not even 48 hours later. It looks just like it did before he got there. Like how did how like how did that not stay the same? Like how did that not stay clean? How did it not stay right? You know, it's like because people aren't proud to be a citizen of the state of California. Yeah. That's other people. It's low personal standards. It's people saying it's not my it's not my job. It's bystander effect. Right. Everybody thinks they're irrelevant. Everybody thinks that their words are irrelevant. This is why for three fucking four years now, you and I have gotten our fucking nuts kicked in while everybody else kind of just went on with their life. Okay. Because all of our listeners and by the way, a lot of them are speaking out and sharing now. Okay. I can fucking see it. And I'm thank you guys. But the reality is if everybody did shit would change fast. Okay. And everybody thinks, well, I'm just this one person. What difference can I make? Dude, a big one. Dude, the whole difference. The worst thing that anyone can think in this country right now is that their actions, their words, their standards do not matter. Do not make a difference that their their involvement doesn't make a difference. They're they're speaking out. It doesn't make a difference. They're living at a higher standard is irrelevant. Nobody cares. Bro, that's the weapon they're using. They're using the weapon of convincing everybody that they are fucking irrelevant. And to get the way to get the world they want. And we have to get smarter than that. Our individual actions do matter, especially when they're collectively unified. Like, that's what they're afraid of. Why do you think they divide everybody? Why do they why do you think they make people feel alone? Why do you think they close the bars during COVID? Why do you think they censor speech on the internet? Because they're afraid of your thoughts and words if you were to use them. Why do they create the silent majority and cancel culture and political correctness? Because they fear the truth, which comes from your fucking mouth. And if we all speak and we all take proper action together, there's nothing they can do. They can't do anything. It takes away all their power. So the worst thing you could ever fucking think ever is that you don't matter because you matter a lot. Every single individual out here in this country right now and really quite honestly across the globe, their actions and their words matter more than they ever have in society. And the great thing is, what are they going to do? BAN everybody off the internet. They won't have a product. They won't have a product. Okay. So fucking do your part, man. That's what we need. Anyway, I think this is amazing. These people are great. These are great people. The most people in every single country out here are great people. Like these countries that you guys say you hate. Oh, I hate Russia. I hate Iran. I hate Israel. I hate Ukraine. Whatever, bro. All the the vast majority of the fucking normal people are just like you. They're just like these people. They want to be, they want to live in an unoppressive environment. They want to not be bothered with crime. They want to have the opportunity to make money. They want to be left to fuck alone and not tyrannically oppressed in whatever which way the country's leader decided to do. Yes. Like bro, we need a global cultural revolution and say fuck you to these tyrants globally. Fuck them. We never had the ability to do this before. We never had the ability to connect their own creations for surveillance have now created their undoing if we were to come together. Yeah. It's a big deal, bro. That's just why you can't base your identity in this or that black or white, Republican, Democrat, conservative, whatever. Fuck it, bro. You're a human being. We have to make choices that are best for us collectively in reality. Now, and so if we don't bad shit's coming. You know, that's real, man. Well, thumbs up for that story. Yeah, for sure. Absolutely awesome. So guys, Andy, that's all I got. Yeah, don't be a hoe. Sure, the show. Bank road, can't fold. There's a note here. Shot case. Closed.
