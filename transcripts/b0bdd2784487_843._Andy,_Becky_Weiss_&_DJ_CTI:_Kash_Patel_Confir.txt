What is up guys it's Andy for telling us this is the show for the realest say about the lies, the fitness and delusions of modern society and welcome. Another fucking reality guys today we have Andy and DJ cruise the mother fucking Internet. That's what we're going to do. That's what CTI stands for stands for cruise the internet. This is the part of the week where we put topics on the screen. We make speculations and observations about what we think is going on and then we talk about how we got to solve these problems going on in the world. I'm just going to get right into it today. Don't forget to pay the fee. We don't run ads. I don't try to sell you a bunch of shit and ask very simply that if you consume the show you help us grow the show. Do us a favor and don't be a hoe. Show the show. All right. What's up? Where in those DS? This is dark energy going on. What's happening? What do you mean? It just seems darker over there. Over here. Yeah. What? You're typically like wearing lighter stuff. Anyway, what's up Becky? What's going on? Yeah. So that was the worst joke I've ever heard. Yeah. I'm not I'm not sure. Yeah. So what would you like to talk about today? We have someone that should be wearing a fucking helmet over there. We got a lot of good stuff going on. That's right. Lots of stuff to talk about here. But first I actually have a question for you that I've been meaning to ask you for some time. Look at that picture. That is fucking pimping, dude. Is that from the night of the banquet? Yeah. It's from banquet. Bro. That's the garlounges awesome. I do. Yeah. I do. Shit. We're at the burner couple. Absolutely. Yeah. That's bad ass pic. Thank you. All right. What's the question? Okay. So I was curious. Why ducks? I've been meaning to ask you about your ducks for a while because like I have chickens and I love having chickens. I feel like chickens are way more common. But like why ducks? Dude, listen. Emily showed up with some ducks. You were there. You were there. And then it was ducks. Yeah. It was very, there was no discussion. It was hard to say no to you. Yeah. And then what you saw them and they were like this big and like that was after I saw them for a minute, I was like, okay, ducks cool. Dude, your, your coop is incredible. Yeah. I was looking at it. I screen-chotted it because it's like, that's the kind of scoop that I want to build for my chickens. Yeah. Eventually I want tons of chickens. Yeah. But it's so cool. How many do you guys have? I only have six chickens, which is honestly. Do they lay a nag every day? Oh, yeah. Yeah. During the winter, it slows down. I get like two or three a day. Okay. Summer. I'll get six a day easily. Yeah. Well, sure. That's like a thousand. That's a real business right now. Yeah. Yeah. Capitalism. Yeah. The, but no, you know, the ducks are cool, man. A lot of people make fun of me because of the ducks. They don't understand like they have little personalities. Like do your chickens have little personalities? Oh, yeah. Every single one of them. Yeah. That's how the ducks are too. So like once you get to know them, it's, it's just like a having a dog or a cat. You know, they, I got this one, Dali, who I think she thinks I'm her dad because she always like comes and see like when I go in there, dude, she runs over right away and like wants to look me to pick her up and, you know, it's, it's cute. I like spending time with them. They, dude, I go up there almost every day and, and, and smoke a cigar. It's like watching. Yeah. It's like peaceful. I don't know. Do you have two days before? Yeah. They all, uh, we got three females and two males and they, all the females put out one egg every day. Okay. Yeah. I've never tried a duck. Yeah. I haven't either. I won't eat them because I'm like, like, it, I don't know. It's like, well, my phone. Yeah. It's kind of weird. Like, because they're like our pets. But then I've heard their, I don't know. Some people like duck eggs. Usually those people seem to be Asian. So I'm just saying it's the truth. Uh, that was a problem or something. I'll just say it. That's the truth. You go to Chinese. They got peaking duck. Yeah. And that's the kind of ducks we got. So I got to be careful, you know, I got to watch you out. So anyway, the dude ducks are fucking horn dogs. Yeah. They, they, they do, they have sex a lot. Yeah. They, they don't have sex bro. They just rape bro. It's bad. Yeah. It's bad. Like they're, they're, yeah, Sam and duck duck Norris and Sam duck Norris is the boss, bro. Like he runs around and tell everybody what to do. Yeah. That's a brown one. Yeah. With the green head. Yeah. Mallard. Yeah. He's not a mallard. It's a different kind of duck. It's not a mallard. It's a, it's a, it's basically it looks like a mallard, but it doesn't fly. So he can only fly like just a little bit. 10 feet. Gotcha. Yeah. Anyway, ducks are cool. So you got any more bad jokes? Oh, I got to get those out of the way. Gerjoloins. I got my fish for right. But yeah, man, let's, let's get into some cruising. Becky glad to have you in. Thank you. I guess the first thing, first things first Andy, you made a prediction the other day. And like normal, it came, came, came true. Yeah. Like the next day. Yeah. You got Canada facing off United States and the four nations. Oh, that wasn't the only prediction I made. I also said that we needed to be getting some money back for the shit. You got that. I got those predictions a little bit later. But yeah. All right. Here we go. Like, dude, you know, here's the thing about this rematch. That's tonight, right? Mm-hmm. It's a lot of time. This airs. It'll be over. Yeah. Who you bet? No. I mean, dude, come on. Yeah. Fuck a team USA. Yeah. I was looking into, I mean, Canada's like, they've won like, I think 12 out of the last like, that's because Canadians are good hockey, bro. Yeah, they're good. Yeah, they're good. I think they, I heard somewhere they use like maple syrup on their skates to like help with the friction stopping and stuff. So who do you think's going to win? I mean, it got to go USA. I don't know anything about hockey. But I did enjoy the highlights from that the game the other day. Yeah. Or they're just beating the crap out of the game. It was awesome. We love that. You know, I would, I would probably expect some of the same with that tonight. Yeah. You know, this is ex-bition games, bro. These guys are beating the shit out of each other. I mean, there's some, there's some geopolitical tensions happening. And, you know, a lot of people from the US talked a lot of shit. I'm going to refrain. I refrain my shit talking until we actually won. I've learned that lesson many of times. Yeah. So we're going to see what happens. Well, Trump hasn't learned his lesson. Well, he went on to shit talking today. He's talks of shit. Well, firstly, you call team USA, gave him like a prep talk and then went to truth social. He decided to put this out. This was at 721 this morning. He said, quote, I'll be calling our great American hockey team this morning to spur them on towards victory tonight against Canada, which, which with far lower taxes and much stronger security will someday maybe soon become our cherished and very important 50 first day. I will be speaking before the governor's tonight in DC and will sadly therefore be unable to attend. But we will all be watching. And if governor Trudeau would like to join us, he would be most welcome. Good luck to everybody. And have a great game tonight. So exciting. President Donald J Trump. You can't help it. You can't help it. How do you get mad at him at this point? Like, how can you even be mad? Yeah. Like, it's just funny. It is funny. It is funny. Well, I mean, we'll see if we see a little bit more of action. It'll be interesting. I think we're going to see an intense hockey game. Well, Canada's got something to prove now. Yeah. And they're good. These guys are not slackers, bro. They invented the game of hockey. Yeah. Okay. These dudes grow up playing hockey when they're before they walk their own skates. So just important to keep that in mind. Well, we'll see, man. Well, guys, let us know down in the comments. You guys got a way of winning when it when it when things need to be won. So back to going to the wall. I mean, it's the USA, bro. Yeah. Okay. Question. Do you think he's actually trying to acquire Canada? Or do you think he's just trolling? Because I cannot tell. I think I think that the reasons that he says for Canada becoming the 51st say make very good sense to everybody involved, including them. They don't have, bro, they don't have a real government. They've got a tyranny situation going on up there. The citizens are such good people. They're nice people. They're passive people. And they get taken advantage of and abused in a way that's even worse than I think it's like silent. I don't know what I want to call it. It's almost like quiet tyranny. Or silent tyranny. You know, like we're born into it. We don't realize that it's as oppressive as it is because we're told that that's just the way it is. And so we all accept it. And I think Canada accepts more of it than we do. But they don't have as many as guns either. Well, I just, I mean, bro, they made legislation the last couple of years to remove a lot of the guns and do all these things. And I just think that when dealing with Canada, we're dealing with people who are good people, who are passive people. And real talk, their government uses the fuck out of them. And they, you know, they don't protect them. Even though nothing's ever happened there, I just think it's a dysfunctional government. I think it would make more sense for us to all be one. So I don't know. I don't know if he's trolling or not. But the reasons of why he says we want Canada and Greenland make a lot of sense. Sure. Yeah. I think especially it's like the strategic, like, absolutely. Geography of just everything, right? Like these tensions we have with our common enemies, people like to call out China. I mean, China uses Canada like no tomorrow. You know what I'm saying? And so it's like, there is definitely a argument militarily to getting Canada for sure. There's a, there's also, I mean, dude, look, Canadian people are proud of being Canadians. So like, this is going to be, if that were to be a real thing, there's, I don't know how it could actually be a real thing. Like that's, that's what I think. You know, so we'll see what happens. What do you think? You just can't tell? I think he's trolling. I think he's just having fun. I think it'd be, I think it'd be cool. I don't see it actually ever happening, though. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't think so either. We would have to divide it into more than one state, though. Sure. It's too much territory. Yeah. It's true. This is true. Yeah. Well, we'll see, man. Good old Canada. I guess we'll know tomorrow what, uh, what the outcome of that was. Let us know down in the comments, guys. Um, but that being said, this cruise, the internet got a lot of stuff to cover today. There's a lot of heavy hot stuff going on today. So full-gurth episode coming to you. Let's go ahead and get started with headline number one. Remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to AndyFaceceller.com. We'll link all of those things there for you. What? Oh, I was going to say cash pretelges got confirmed right now. Yeah, I got it. Oh, you do? Okay. I didn't know if you were on it today or not. Oh, probably some jokes are not. My jokes may not be on it, but I am on it. I promise. All right. Yeah. Hell, I number one. Let's get into it before we even get to that, man. Um, you know, it's like, it's this funny like life and death thing that happens, right? Like when there's new life that comes in, there's somebody going out, um, Mitch McConnell, he's out. Um, he just announced his, uh, that he won't run for reelection. Um, he did that on the Senate floor, floor today. Um, he's 83 years old, and he's had some, some health issues, but uh, check this clip out. He just announced he's not, not going to be running for reelection. Today's his birthday, actually. I thought that was, you know, interesting. I've never liked calling too much attention to today's date February 20th. But I figured my birthday would be as good today as any to share with our colleagues a decision I made last year. During my time in the Senate, I've only really answered to two constituencies, the Republican conference, and the people of Kentucky. Yeah. And, uh, he's out there asking for some follow up questions. This is what we got. Did you hear the question, Senator, running for reelection in 2026? All right. I'm sorry. You all were in the minute. That was today. No. Oh, that was, that was when he throws up the wall. Yeah. I'd imagine it'd be about the same though. I mean, like, bro, he's having little mini strokes. I mean, look, this is fucking absurd. Okay. We don't need these people. These people should not be allowed to serve you wouldn't allow that guy to babysit your kids. You wouldn't allow him to, uh, you know, make decision. I wouldn't allow him to make decisions for our company. Like, this guy is the main guy. And we're allowing all of these, you know, elderly people that we wouldn't even treat. Like, like, like, if he was at our house on Christmas, and he was over there talking, we'd all be over in the corner being like, yes, just grandpa. He's talking to praise on something, keeping warm. Yeah. But these are the people that we have making decisions for the betterment of our country. I think his existence in Congress proves the motivation of these people who have been serving us. It's not about service. It's about what they can take. And the fact that this guy and all these people go there and make a lifelong career of being, quote, unquote, politicians for the people is bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Oh, he should have been out years ago. Years ago. What do you think about all these old people representing us? Because there's two arguments, right? People will say, oh, well, they're, these people have the most experience, you know, in the civilizations of history, they're the elders. Right. No, I don't think it's so much about age as it is about your cognitive ability to function. How are you thinking? How are you speaking? Are you able to? Are you sharp? Or are you on the decline? Because you could have a 60 year old who's looking like that, but you could also have someone like President Trump. He's getting up there and he's doing great. He's sharp. So I don't really think it's so much about age. And I think if we stuck in age limit on some of these people, that could get us into a sticky situation. I'd be more interested in term limits. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. But he should have been out years ago. He did vote yes on cash, though. I don't know if you saw that. Yeah. Well, I think he's figured out that all these people resisting are making themselves look guilty as fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Well, they're creating themselves like they're creating the enemy narrative that they're trying to avoid, which is ironic. But let's get into that. Yeah, cashmatellite just got confirmed. Now, there was some interesting things happen. I mean, it was a long process. They tried to fill a bus through this thing. There was somebody who strayed part of the lines. I was this GOP Senator Susan Collins from Maine. She actually voted against it. A lot of stuff going on. There was a filibuster, which is like, you know, the attempt to kind of delay stuff even further, basically. And we got to go to our buddy Adam Schiff to get old Schiffmeister. I feel like that would have been his nickname. Let's hear what he had to say. This was while the vote was going on just outside of the Senate Chamber. Check this out. This is someone we cannot trust. This is someone who lacks the character to do this job. Someone who lacks the integrity to do this job. We know that our Republican colleagues know that the only qualification cashmatellite has to be FBI director is that when everyone else in the first Trump administration said, no, I won't do that. That crosses moral ethical and legal lines. Cashmatellite said, sign me up. In the first Trump administration, as we are seeing in the second, you rise to the level of your sick offence. And known as a bigger or my dangerous sick offent than cashmatellite. This political hack does not deserve to be in this building. He can't do the job. He won't protect the public. He will misuse the resources of the bureau. He will weaponize it against the president's political opponents rather than the protecting the safety, the public safety of the American people. We will vote no. Our Republican colleagues intimidated by this president and threats of primary challenges from MAGA world may vote to confirm him. But as my colleagues have said, they will have to live with that vote, be accountable for that vote, and be accountable for all the destruction that Patel does to this premier law enforcement agency. We stand. We, us democratic members of this judicial committee, stand shoulder to shoulder with the professionals in the FBI, with law enforcement everywhere. And we wish our colleagues would do the same. And with that, let me yeah, I mean, they'll be standing shoulder to shoulder and fucking handcuffs. Did you see the picture of this? The actual picture of them? There's five of them standing there. Nobody listening. There's no crowd. It's a podium, a microphone, those five dumbasses, and nobody else. Was there a crowd out of frame? Because I saw that in a lot of times, you know, from both sides, like they just do photos like that. I mean, not unless they were standing fucking 30 feet away. You know, so yeah, I mean, look, here's what I heard. I heard. You know, this really sucks, man, because now we're going to lose our ability to persecute and weaponize our justice system, the way that we see fit, like we have since the beginning of time. And now it's probably going to come out that I've done some things that are going to hurt me in my reputation. Like, I don't know, allegedly, you know, I don't know, murdering certain people for certain things. Allegedly, there's a really dark story about Adam Schiff. And we don't know if it's true or not, but I think some things are going to come out about him. People like that's my thing. People who are freaking out at this, they're worried. And it wasn't a just so we're clear. It wasn't an adult. No shit, really? Yeah, it was a young boy. Yeah. And then a certain celebrity also may have witnessed this, maybe like a certain celebrity like Anthony Bourdain. And then all of a sudden, he commits suicide. There's a deep conspiracy theory about Adam Schiff. No shit. I've never heard this before. Oh, yeah. Yep. Damn. To me, dude, everybody that's freaking out over cash getting confirmed, they know it like to me, it's a great sign that accountability is going to come. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe not, maybe not. He said, cash said, I'm releasing the Epstein list the first day. Okay, well, that's today or tomorrow, the day that the show air. So we'll see. Yeah, we'll see. I mean, I'm excited, dude. Look, I'm way more excited about this than I was about anything to last for a year. It's a big year over, bro. It's a big hurdle to get them in there. But I don't know. And personally, we'll see. What do you think? I'm inclined to think that a lot of stuff is about to come out. Yeah. I'm more inclined based off of what we've seen in the first month of Trump's presidency so far. And how fast they're moving and how much they are actually holding themselves to what they said they were going to do. I am definitely more inclined to think that we are going to start seeing files get released, which I'm extremely excited about. Me too. But we better see some fucking arrest. That's the biggest thing. Yeah, that's the big, I mean, listen, for those of you guys who don't aren't aware of cash, so he's the guy that blew the whole Russia gate story open. Yeah, you know, I'm saying my crew, he's one that proved that it was made up and paid for by Hillary Clinton's team to sanction my Obama. Yeah, dude, for eight years, they destroyed the come the country over that narrative. Yeah. For eight years, for eight years, they called this dude a Russian asset. They said he was getting pissed on by Russian hookers. They made all this shit up about him. And it was in the news cycle 24 seven. And they convinced all of these left people, Democrats and leftists that this guy was a fucking spy. And dude, that caused us the last eight years of stability of, you know, the way I look at it is this, dude. We only have so many years on this planet. Okay. And they have sucked up almost a decade of our time creating civil disturbances, racial tensions, tensions among, you know, people, you know, who have different beliefs or come from different cultures. And dude, this is affected everybody. So what is the crime for making up shit that destroys the cultural fabric of our country, the ability to get along with our friends and our relatives and people we don't know like, dude, they've taken so much with that one story. And, yeah, he did blow it up. And yeah, but still at the same time, guys, like, where is the accountability for this? You know, like, I can appreciate the information coming out. But dude, like, what I really want to see is I want to see some motherfuckers hung for it. You know, because dude, this is, these people should not have immunity for the things that they've done, for the COVID or for fucking, you know, like what what Elon's discovering now where they took, you know, fucking billions of dollars, probably trillions of dollars from American taxpayers and pumped it into, you know, literal. What they call it the other day, social social engineering, propaganda. So they took regular people who had regular beliefs and regular, you know, they were regular Democrats and they fucking radicalized them with all this crazy shit with our money, which how many relatives do you have or do you have or do I have that like now it's like so much damage has been done. You're just like fuck them. You know, like it really brought out the worst in society and we're not getting that time back. Or that money, maybe dude, that's the other thing. Like, do you have that? Yeah, we're gonna talk about that later. Yeah, but I mean, it's crazy. It's crazy. But let's let's let's let's get into the conversation about, you know, the other spending because, you know, the doge work is, I mean, there's stuff coming out every single day about it. This new thing that's just got found is Department of Education spending soared 749 percent despite downsizing new doge inspired initiative reveals. So this is a breaking story that just came out a new initiative is tracking government agency spending in comparison to growth and a conservative fiscal watchdog group has discovered what it deems to be an alarming trend according to the open the books. Staff levels at the Department of Education have decreased since 2000, but the agency spending grew by 749 percent open the book says the calculation is quote, even more galling after recent statistics from the National Assessment of Education progress showed that student achievement has still not recovered since it saw big drops during the COVID-19 pandemic, which ironically is when they spent the most amount of money. This is the graph you put side by side. So they've lost roughly about 700 employees since the year 2000, but they've spent hundreds of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars. Most of that money, again, you know, you look on the graph was spent during the years time of COVID. That's really where it started to really accelerate. So that came out other things coming out. This is a juicy story. Doge reveals Biden EPA awarded $2 billion to a firm that's linked to election to Nyer Stacey Abrams in a gold bar heist, Lee Zeldin Response. Do you see this shit? So you guys know Stacey Abrams, right? The big big lady, right? Yeah, where he was talking about the gold bars being thrown. Yeah, don't have to tell you. Yeah, so Elon Musk's Doge discovered that Joe Biden's EPA awarded $2 billion to a firm linked to failed Democrat Georgia, Goober, Nitorial, candidate Stacey Abrams. Even worse, the firm only reported $100 in revenue in its first three months in business in 2023. How did a brand new firm that only reported $100 in revenue get awarded $2 billion? Earlier this month, Lee Zeldin, administrator of the EPA, provided an update to the money wasted on Biden's watch and response to an undercover video posted by Project Viratoss in December. EPA advisor Brent Efron admitted on undercover video to an insurance policy against the Trump administration and said that the agency was funneling billions to climate organizations in a last-minute heist. Quote, we're throwing gold bars off the Titanic. Efron told a project Viratoss undercover journalist last week, Lee Zeldin said his team at the EPA found the gold bars. Yeah, now she's in on it and that's why I can some interesting. Do you have that video of Zeldin saying that? You guys should all go try to find it because what he says is basically what we've been talking about on the show for many years and he confirms it. So the thing with Ukraine and people are starting to understand what was happening. When you guys saw and we kept seeing the billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars going to Ukraine and then the last six to eight months people were getting pissed about it but they kept doing it. Well, Lee Zeldin actually explains in that video pretty well what their mindset was and how he explains it was, they described it with their language of gold bars being thrown off the boat. And what he means is, and this is what I was telling you, they were intentionally printing and sending money out to Ukraine and right now another one through Abrams and all this stuff. Remember when I was telling you guys how they were taking the money, sent it to Ukraine because I knew that the currency was going to fail and then they're going to convert the currency into assets so it can bridge the gap to a digital currency. And they'd all be set up. They'd all be rich. Yeah, right. Right. That's what's happening right now. So these people are stealing the money. When they actually track the money down, they're going to find that this money has all been spent on different assets. It's not just sitting in an account. So he describes it pretty well. Lee Zeldin, you could probably Google the clip but basically, you know, they knew that their time was running out. So they wanted to rush all the money out the door and fuck the American people so that they could be wealthy. And that's dude, that's an unforgivable crime. It's an unforgivable crime. Well, and dude, like I'm happy, like I know you're optimistic, Becky, about these things happening. And I agree with you. The Trump is moving fast. But like, dude, I still have yet to see or hear of any accountability. What's so out of that? What we're doing with these people? Yeah. And that's that is a big problem for me personally. Like if they don't hold the Trump administration doesn't arrest some of these people and put some of these people in prison who have done these things, to me, they're just part of the fucking of the machine. Just another part. And we're going to find out. Yeah. Well, I think cash is like, you know, the final, because I mean, you got to think as the FBI highest legal police enforcement authority, that's who has to do that. And so I mean, I try to give grace and patience where it's due. You can't tip the hand too quickly. If Trump was to come out and say before cash was put in, I agree with that. It'd be hard to agree with that. So like, plus dude, there's a time of delay. Even when you run a business, you make changes in a very small business. It takes 90 days to see those results. That's just reality. So he hasn't had 90 days and he's got the biggest business in the fucking world. So I appreciate what's happening. And I don't want, I'm not being critical, but there's parts to this that need to happen too. And the American people deserve a reconciliation for the crimes that have been committed against them. And the reconciliation, unfortunately, especially with the tax situation, it's not going to be monetary at any significant level. You know, they say, oh, well, we'll give you $5,000. Well, fuck, bro, I've been paying taxes for the last 20 years and they've been getting stolen and squandered. You know, what that's not any, that doesn't, that's bullshit. It's a little more than five grand. Yeah. So, but then again, right? How do you make it right? Well, you would have to, you would have to trace all of the money into the assets, seize the assets, liquidate the assets, and redistribute the money back to the people that paid it. It's probably not going to happen. That's a big problem for me. Okay. The elimination of the IRS completely, the elimination of property tax completely, those things have to happen, dude. It's not okay that people who work their whole lives to own their house or to, you know, own, you know, they only got the car paid off. But yet, they still got to pay tax every year to own it. These are, these are squeezes on the American people that clearly serve no real outcome that benefits us. Okay. So then what is the other reason that we are taxed this way? Well, it has to be, it has to be so that they can intentionally handicap the American people so that they have to struggle so hard that they can't, a notice, a question what is actually being stolen for them. So the fact that these taxes actually exist at all is evidence of the intent to control and financially press our citizenship, which is wrong. And that needs to be fixed. Yeah. I think too, it's like, you know, it's always interesting to see, you know, people's reaction one, I think to your point, at the end of the day, the people have to have to call for that. The people have to demand that. That's right. You know, and it's like, but don't, dude, I'm not, I'm not so optimistic that's going to happen because, dude, first of all, everybody's culturally conditioned to pay in those taxes. They don't think about where they go or what's going on. There would have to be so much mass awareness brought to this issue. I mean, dude, this is coming out and I talk to people who own businesses who are CEOs who are, they still are not following the story. Okay. So the awareness of the problem has to be so big that people demand it. And real talk, like, I'm not confident that they're going to because it seems like people have completely forgotten about COVID and COVID was one of the worst crimes against humanity that ever happened. So they're not going to stand up and demand accountability for Fauci and Klaus Schwab and all these people who facilitate a COVID, they sure as fuck aren't going to do it now. So, you know, we're going to have to have some leadership, like some influential people really lean on these people to make these changes happen. And I hope that people do get loud. And I think they will, if they understood, they really understood about that. I think if people really understood how they were controlled through the tax system, how we are handicapped, and intentionally made a struggle, and then understood that these people literally steal their money so that they can have planes and houses and mansions and boats and all this shit. I think people will get pissed enough, but the problem with it is, dude, is a lot of people are still struggling so hard that they can't afford to, like imagine this, dude, imagine someone who's working and they're like literally every dollar is accounted for. In fact, every dollar is accounted for and they're still losing. And then they have a wife or husband and multiple kids that they have to run around and try to feed and try to take care of and try to, like, dude, you have fucking kids. How much attention can you, I mean, this is your job, but if it wasn't, it would be hard to follow. You see what I'm saying? So we have to get to a point of critical mass where the average citizen understands completely how bad their life has been fucked by these people. I think they were getting there, though, especially with how fast Doge is rolling out these reports. You know, the masses are starting to wake up, especially if you hop on X and you're following Elon, like it's just day after day after day and people are starting to realize what I think is difficult is people have a difficult time conceptualizing that amount of money. Like whenever you say $2 billion, most people have zero ability to conceptualize that amount of money, but also people are failing to understand that our taxation is literally extortion. And I don't know if you saw my video the other day, but like I'm talking about it in terms of extortion, because that's what it is. They are extorting you. If you do not give us this amount of your money, you're going to go to jail. It's not theft. People keep saying taxation is theft. It's not that. No, it's extortion. Yeah, that's right. In more tax slaves in this country. And I think people are starting to understand, you know, with raised awareness that we are all in over 50%. We are slaves to the government. Yeah. And we are being extorted through taxation. This is not freedom. No, no, it isn't freedom. It's just not. No, I think Becky, what you just, I was having this conversation with a buddy in my area today. I think that is probably the biggest hang up to that demand and that call is because people, people can barely conceptualize five grand. You know, I'm saying like in their fucking bank account. And the reason is is because of what these people are doing. That's what I'm saying. So it's like, you know, they say $2 billion. No, all right. You know, but like the fact that we even have $2 billion to just fuck off is a problem. That should tell you right there. Hey, I probably put too much in if we can afford to even fucking send 10 million to Mozambique for fucking mail. He goes, of course, there's some government in this spending, but you don't take a meat cleaver and just cut. Yes. Yes. You do. All of you wasteful fucking pieces of shit who have been taking all of our money for all these years. Dude, deep. Yep. Did you see that Fauci spent 241 million on transgender surgeries for animals? Yeah. Yep. Got that right here. Oh, okay. That's crazy. It's crazy. Like, why would you do that to black people? Bro, like that's like you're just using them as fucking what? What? Those are animals. Not black people. That was a monkey. What are you doing for real right now? That your third terrible joke. Huh? That was a joke. I saw monkeys. I fucked up. Oh my god. Not only is that a waste of taxpayer money, but it's so unethical. Like, if you're actually like reading the report, it is wildly unethical to be doing the stay animals. It's disgusting. Yeah. I agree. Bro, it's insane. It's it fought with it. Fauci. I think who's number one to get? Who's on the list? Yeah. Like a fucking big show list, the big show list. Fauci's up there. Clintons are up there. Fucking there's lots of people that are up there. I think everybody who's stolen a dollar from the America people for their own fucking game, whether it be a dollar or a hundred million dollars, the principle is the same. Okay. That's not your fucking money. That's our money that we have had to work and sweat and bleed and sacrifice for. Fuck you. I don't care if they took fucking a dollar out of the drawer and got a soda. Like, it should be zero. And with the amount of technology that we have today, it should be easy to track. You guys force us to track it and fucking worth missing $600 and paypal it to some person or family who couldn't eat because of you, fucks. We get in trouble. Like, the standards should be the same. Every law that's passed should apply to them and us. Whatever we can do, they can do. Whatever they can do, we can do. And if that were actually the case, they'd pass some better laws. Right. But that's not the case. The case is they get to do whatever they want and they pass laws for us because somewhere along the line, they have started to consider themselves royalty or superior or the ruling class or whatever you want to call it. It's been called many things throughout history. They believe that it's them and us and it is us in them. But we have the power and they don't. And if we were to ever flex that power, these motherfuckers would be on stakes because they have started to completely accept that. The culture in Washington, you see, outside of a few individuals is completely tyrannical and abusive towards the citizens of this country. Completely. They do not care. They do not, they do not relate. They don't know where the average person lives. They like, they can't fucking comprehend it, bro. They're out of touch. These guys go to dinners at the best stake houses, the best sushi restaurants, they fly on private planes, they jerk each other off for backdoor deals, they steal our money. And then they act like it's okay. You hear them talk. They say like the Democrats are out in the fucking, they're protesting and they're saying, keep your hands off the money, keep your hands off our money. That's not your money. And that's they're so used to thinking of it as their money that they have no problem saying it out and open. Like it's insane, dude. Like we are so past what should be accepted by the American people? Like it's almost like I can't believe that we're this far along and nobody's had to deal with any consequences. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, and it's interesting, right? Like dude, even from the individual, like either from an individual, you know, like Steve down the street who fucking lost his job because he couldn't get a he wouldn't get a vaccine. Like where? Like, you know, like, I don't know, I would have thought at this point in time that these people would not be safe walking out of street for what they've done. That's just my opinion. Yeah, I think, I think, you know, there has to be some type of like, I can tell you this, bro, if I got my life ruined because of Chuck Schumer, Chuck Schumer being a fucking hole. Yeah. Real talk. Well, I mean, here's the thing, like I mean, you talk about reconciliation, right? And the only thing that's been mentioned so far as Trump, Trump came out and floated this given 20% of savings from doge to American citizens, right? And I want to be clear here, like that, you know, the $5,000 amount that never, they didn't come from Trump, they didn't come from Milan. But, you know, he told you they've been floating this given 20% and then using the rest to kind of like help come down on our deficit and stuff, right? They're missing a very key part American tax paying citizens. Yeah. Yeah. People who haven't paid in don't get any of that shit back. Well, no, they've calculated that in the full doge thing there. But yeah, I mean, let's check this clip off from Trump. There's even under consideration a new concept where we give 20% of the doge savings to American citizens and 20% goes to paying down debt because the numbers are incredible, Elon. So many billions of does, billions, hundreds of billions. And we're thinking about giving 20% to the American citizens and 20% down to pay back debt and pay down debt. I don't think it's enough. Like, no, it's not enough. We need income tax gone, property tax gone. We need to reduce taxation across the board. Like even even going 10% all in, like, I think we're at a period of time where we need to go lower than that, especially with what we're seeing right now. Like I just, I like the idea as a starting point. Yeah. But I don't think it's enough. I totally agree. And I've said 10% for years and years and years. But also I, I was shocked. I've as much as I've judged these people and knew they were stealing, I am shocked at the level of which they have done so. And so that has like changed my, you know, you'll find many clips on the internet where I say 10%, 10%, 10% and now I'm like, fuck that. Zero. Yeah. Zero, man. Like, dude, you know, you haven't even seen, maybe look, dude, here's the reality. Maybe it should be 5%. Because there's going to be, we have to pay for the government to do certain things. But the government should be structured in a way, just like every other business. Like we can only do what we can afford to do. And this is our budget. And this is what these guys don't operate that way. They just do shit. So the, instead of saying, you know, here's the tax and, you know, do whatever you want with it, we should say, here's the amount of tax that you're going to get. And the, the government has to operate within that budget. Completely. That's it. Like a normal business. Now everybody else has to buy those rules. I mean, bro, if we changed, if we changed a few things, like term limits, like you said, passing laws that they were held accountable to, you know, eliminating lobbies. Like these, these very simple things create a scenario where they're not abusing us anymore because it doesn't benefit them to do so. You know, like, there's no reason for someone to go into Washington, DC worth nothing and come out worth $75 million. That's it. That that nobody questions it. Nobody. All people question it. I was just about to say, I bet if they, if they weren't allowed to do all of that insider trading and take money from lobbyist groups, it would reframe the way that they thought about taxation because they would have to start living like everyone else has to live because we don't get that money. And we are under these incredibly oppressive tax systems, these extortion systems. Yeah. And I just feel like if they had to live as a normal American, perhaps they would rethink the way that they're running the country maybe or it would attract ethical individuals who have actual knowledge of how to run a business and keep things in line. AKA our best and brightest contributors to this country and not a bunch of scumbag shitbums that can't like dude, like you worked there five years. Do you think any of these fuckers could work here? Oh no, they couldn't even work here. Couldn't even work here. Well, that's a thing. Like when you make the goal that woman, who's that woman, that's Susan Collins. We wrote it no one can't fucking work here. No. Show me any of these motherfuckers that could work here. Trump could work here. He'd be good. Cash could work here. Cash could work here. Yeah. Fucking Eric Schmidt could work here. Work here. Okay. But outside of like a handful of people can do it. Couldn't even do it. Well, that's the thing. And I think if the goal was truly back on like putting the interest in the American people, one, you wouldn't have to stay in for 40 fucking years. You get in, you make those fucking changes and then you would go live in the society of and deal with the the fucking consequences of the decisions you may while office or if you were good, you would go live in the society that you help create. That's amazing. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like go make the fucking votes. Do you get things? Get out of your mouth. People should be forced to sleep in the bed. They made that's it. And these people aren't. No, okay. That's that's why they're a bit too busy making their own beds. Yeah. Fucking hundreds of millions of dollars. Man, guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, let's go cruise some. Got a few. Bekai, you have got something for you. That's sweet. This first comment comes from at Texas Voyager. He says, telling DJ he is crazy for never seeing days of thunder is like calling Andy out for never seeing boys in the hood. Have you seen boys in a hood? Yeah. I've seen boys in the hood, bro. We talking about you seem. Don't be a minute. Yeah. All right. Joe, you think I haven't seen boys in a hood.

And I think one, I think it's funny. The video that has been going viral of you lately. The one you want, Jared? Yeah. So one, you know, and listen, I love my American brothers and sisters. There's some some really low IQ people on the right. Like really low. No shit. A lot of people didn't know you were like joking. Oh my god. Dude, the comments, it's hilarious. Like they, they don't realize that it's satirical content. Like, see, look at this blue head liberal. This is what I'm talking like, bro. Wait. Wait. Wait. She it them belongs in a stainless island. No, no, no, no, no. I got right here. Marty Shrable, he said, who exactly is this dumbass? And why should I be listening to it? Yeah. Marty. It's satire. Yep. Bro. Leslie Pinnel. She says, yep. There is a demon. What's this? What's that emoji there? What is that? Is that a new thing on Twitter? That's the bigot emoji. That what it is. She's a verified. Becky, because she's gay. It's true. Yeah. So you're a fucking you're a fucking bigot bitch. Leslie. You die. Your hair purple least 10 times. Yeah. Oh, is that what that is? It's a special verification. Yeah. Demon. You back you demon. Got a demon in her. Yeah. Man. Dude, people are so fucking stupid. Wow. Yeah. It was just like, it was so on par with like your ability. It was. Your ability to deliver sarcasm is top notch. Just getting character. Yeah. It's top notch. I can understand how I could understand how low IQ people with no sense of humor. It's people on the right making themselves look like idiots because they're quick reacting. Yeah. And like they watched the entire thing. And it's you should know that it's satire because in the beginning, I literally opened by saying I wish the government would extort us more. Like how do you think that that's real? Yeah. Dude, it's got internet stupid. No, that's what it is. The internet's stupid. We're smart. The internet's stupid. It is what it is. Fuck you. Yep. Full of Leslie's and Leslie. Calm down, Leslie. There were so many that that went so viral. And like it's just full of like these freaking pronoun people I stopped listening to. Maybe you have no idea who I am in one. Oh, shit. You've been slaying those people for fucking years. Man, man. Guys, we do appreciate you for being real. Leslie. You big it. Even you Leslie. We appreciate you. Let's keep the screws moving. Like I had a line number two for you guys. Let's go. I want to say this. Yeah. All right. Fucking right is annoying as fuck. They're pretty annoying. Oh, they're just as bad. I can't stand you motherfuckers who fucking try to. Now the new thing is like if you don't fucking post about Jesus every day, you're going to hell. It's like, dude, you know how many people I know that post about God that I know for fucking sure. Like using it as like their way to make money in business. Like I know a lot of people like that. I see it every day. And so do you guys? That's a pet peeve of mine, dude. No, understood. So I get that thing or where people use it to get business. Yes. I cannot fucking stand it. There's that. But also like this sect of, you know, I don't even want to say Christianity, but like your religious zealots who are in my comments and my DMs all the time. Like you need to pray to God. You need to repent. You need to like, you know, all this stuff. How do they know you don't? That drives people like me. Like that's why I stopped going to church a long time ago. Dude, you know, I get it. Like there's a lot of all kinds of assumptions made on the internet about everybody. And it's just like, dude, like you do you, I do me. This is what the fuck America's about. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, no, it's frustrating. And I shouldn't have to like, you know, I shouldn't have to get on there and talk about that kind of stuff. Like my relationship with God is mine. That's right. And like that, that is mine. That's right. And all these people coming in who are telling me all this kind of stuff. I'm like, you're the reason why people don't go to church. That's what that 100% dude. The Christian faith and church would have way more people in it. If the fucking totally that 2% that you're talking about would shut the fuck up. Yeah. Like dip row. Like imagine sitting next to that guy for an hour every week. I'm holier than you. Yeah. Me. Wow. You know, like they're the most judgmental people too. And they got the most most shit in the car. Yeah. That's that's the crazy thing. Yeah. That's the crazy thing. Well, dude, it's like anything. People like to create like a smoke screen. Yeah. For, you know, for who they actually are. 100% they're in church. They're being nice. They're doing all the prayers and then you walk out. By the way, if you go to church and you're a normal human and you're good great. Can I support that? I think it's awesome. I think it's awesome that young people are finding their faith and finding something. Yes. Yes. That provides some moral framework other than what we've experienced in this country for the last 20 years. I'm I think it's amazing. Okay. But you mother fuckers. Some of you motherfuckers ruin it for everybody. Like real talk. You know, they go to church and then they come out on the way out and like you, you know, they flip you off in the parking lot. Yeah. Right. Because you cut them off. Right. You know, on their way to the fucking, you know, casino or whatever. Yeah. It's whatever, man. But, let's go take a trip over to our foreign buddies. Let's go check out. I can't stick to my number one pet peeve though of all of these people are people that fucking use to make money and drive people to their bed. I cannot stand it. Yeah. It's gross. Yeah. Anyway, this judgmental shit. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, yeah, let's get into headline number two. Let's let's let's let's go over and check on good old Ukraine and Russia and the relationship and what's happening over that thing that's important. A lot of interesting stuff happening over there. So let's talk about it a little bit. Headline number two, let's let's get started. We got Zalinsky Cancel Saudi Arabia trip after exclusion from US Russia talks. So this was like the first, you know, first thing recently that's been happening, Ukrainian president of Vladimir Vladimir Zalinsky on Tuesday said he postponed a visit to Saudi Arabia to express his disapproval of the United States and Russia beginning bilateral negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. This is basically the little kid got pissed because they're making them go sit at the children's table during dinner while the grownups discuss the important stuff is how I take it. But, uh, yeah, he's got pissed. The quote, we're not invited to this Russian American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us. I don't want any coincidences. So I'm not going to Saudi Arabia. Zalinsky said after a meeting with Turkish president received to Yeap in and Kara by coincidences, Zalinsky evidently meant that he did not want his planned visits to Saudi Arabia to be mistaken as an endorsement of the meetings held between US and Russian diplomats in India this week. So yeah, that happened. It also came out that the Ukraine peacekeeping plan, um, Stomer will present to Trump. Did you see the UK offered to send like 30,000 troops to Ukraine, um, to which of course the Kremlin said that any plan to send European troops to Ukraine would be unacceptable for Russia and would escalate the situation that they're trying to calm down. So I mean, who told Stomer to even suggest that? Who, you know, why do we want this thing to keep going? What do you mean? I know the answer. But I think that's the question that people are like, what's the point of keeping this thing going? Why would they want the it's a growth? They're fucking, they've been stealing money the entire time. All these people have missteel of money, dude. Everybody, every fucking person that is involved in this that wants it to continue is getting paid is making money. Okay. And what's sad about this is how many Ukrainian men have died for this. Okay. There's not a person in the in the whole entire universe that believes that Ukraine could win a war with Russia. So let's, he doesn't believe that. Everybody else knows it. Okay. So this motherfucker got all these Ukrainian men killed. So he could have a fucking boat. So he could have a fucking house. So he could be on the payroll. Bro, it's insane. Did you see whenever it came out that he was talking about how he didn't know where most of the money went. How that money was sent over? And he's like, I don't know where it went. Yeah. The most recent shipment was like 175 million. No, no, what he said was they, they sent 175 billion. And he only got 70 to 80 billion. Okay. And he doesn't know where the rest went. Well, the rest went to the people who sent you. That was their cut, bro. Like holy shit. He knows exactly where to fuck it went. He knows where it went. Yeah. He knows where it went. And that's why I think, you know, you know, Zalinsky's got all kinds of shit people even know about. Dude, he, at one point, he had like three fucking 30 million dollar houses. One of them was in Miami. He had a, like a 300 million dollar fucking yacht. Like, dude, this guy, how did he get the money? How do you get the money? He was, he was given fucking blow jobs on national TV four or five years ago. Okay. Like dressed up in a fucking leather suit like the Gimp and pulp fiction. You've never saw that either. Okay. I've seen pulp. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. Samuel L. Jackson. Very good. John Jolta. Very good. Classic movie. Okay. Well, do you know the part in the Gimp? You don't know it. You see, you're lying. Motherfucker, you've seen pulp fiction. You got a lot of talk about movies, bro. Okay. Anyway, where to get the money? He's younger than me. Yeah. I've worked my whole ass off. I've built a number of successful companies. Okay. We're like, I don't have a 300 million dollar fucking yacht. Oh, that's right. Because the whole time I've been building the companies, they've been stealing half my money. Fuckers. It's fucked up. But I think, I think a lot of this. And then telling everybody else that I'm people like me are the fucking problem. Yeah. That's the that's the holy shit, man. Fucked up. But we've been seeing this like change with Trump to Zelensky. And, you know, to the point where Trump Trump calls Zelensky a dictator as the riff between two leaders deep in. They just called them a dictator. You know, again, Zelensky's pissed at all of this. But I wanted to dive into it a little bit because like what's Trump talking about? What makes them a dictator? Well, I don't know. He canceled elections. Oh, Andy did he cancel his elections? No, he didn't cancel his elections. Andy, he declared martial law, which canceled the election. So the Democrats think that's okay. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Well, let's do it here. Why not? Yeah. Why not? Yeah. I mean, declared martial law February 24th, 2022. I was after a racial launch just full-scale invasion. I've been just kidding. I don't want to do it here either. What martial law? Well, I mean, that's the thing. I mean, many countries have been in war. They've all still held their elections. You know, that's a democratic republic. I mean, that's what's supposed to happen in democracies, you know. Well, I mean, he also got all of his men killed. All of it. Yeah. All of it. To the point where they're conscribing people and kidnapping them off the street. We're not even that. Magic walking down the fucking street. And then being like, damn, dude, you look like you could fight into fucking car. I'm going to kill you. That's what this dude. That's what dictators do. Yep. Do you ever get on X? They're like legitimate videos of that. Yeah, I've seen them. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Where they run down the street and they just it looks like a kidnapping. It is a kidnapping. Yeah. Like, like, if you see, you've seen old school, right? Like when they pull up in the fucking van, you've seen, you've seen old school. Who's at the skate movie? How the fuck have none of you motherfuckers seen old school? That bad one. Have you seen it? I've seen the old school. Is that with bowling it? Will Ferrell, Snoop Dogg's in it. Nope. All right. I'm going to head out. Bro, you motherfuckers. How can you? Bro, let's have a movie night when give me caught up. I'm not watching movies with you. You don't even know what good movie is. You've been talking the whole time. Real loud. That's bullshit. Yeah. Bullshit. Yeah. We know. Let's fuck up. Is it true? No, it's not true. It's not true for me. It's a more fun telling that happened. That is a stereotype that is as true as a smoke alarm. Oh, no. Bunch you better run. That's exactly right. Look, I think it's funny. It doesn't really bother me, but it is fucking true. Yeah. So you can't watch movies at my house. I get it. Period. I get it. That's fine. But yeah. And a lot of stuff I've been going to. I'm going to add this clip here for you. This is the most recent collection of Trump on the Zolenska. Let's watch this. And it's a ridiculous war. And it has to end. We had a good talk with President Putin. I had a good talk with President Zelensky. I've lasted for a long time over and out this morning. I also had with President Zelensky, a very recall after that. And I think we're on the way to get a piece. Oh, well, we weren't invited. Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal. And I'm very disappointed. I hear that, you know, there's upset about not having a seat. Well, they've had a seat for three years. And a long time before that, this could have been settled very easily. Just a half a half baked negotiator could have settled this years ago, where the leader in Ukraine, I mean, I hate to say it, but he's down at 4% approval rating. And yeah, I would say that, you know, when they want to see it at the table, you could say that people have to, wouldn't the people of Ukraine have to say like, you know, it's been a long time since we've had an election. That's not a Russia thing. Think of it a modestly successful comedian. President Zelensky talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion to go into a war that basically couldn't be won. Zelensky is done a terrible job. His country is shattered. And millions and millions of people have unnecessarily died. And you can't bring a war to an end if you don't talk to both sides. You got to talk to haven't been talking. And Zelensky is pissed about that, but while his greed's going to get him killed, that's what's going to happen. Okay, like his little temper tantrums and shit, listen, very small man. You're fucking with Donald Trump now. Yeah, like, bro, I think he thinks he's going to continue this out and make more and more and more money and do more and more damage for his own benefit. Look, dude, this is the worst guy on the earth. Okay, he's the worst guy on the earth. They're trying to say that Putin's the guy or Trump's the guy. This is the worst guy on the planet right now. How many people have died? How many of Ukrainians have died in this conflict? Well, what they tell us is like 70,000. Well, there's a reason Trump saying millions. It's got to be higher than that. Well, you got to think, but who's selling us 70,000? Right? Well, it's the same media that, you know, our taxpayer dollars are going to to tell us that it's 70,000. Yeah, that's true. Because they got to be able to tell the American people that all the money we're sending over there is actually doing something. And like, yeah, Ukraine is doing great. Anyway, a whole lot of people. God, dude, imagine like intentionally, imagine, I just can't, I can't imagine that kind of evil, dude. I just can't like, I can't imagine someone sending all of their men to die, who knows that you can't win the war for money, for personal get, for material shit, for I like material shit, I love cars. I love cool shit. There's not a fucking, there is not a fucking place in this universe where I would say, I'm going to send my fucking people to die so I can get some more shit. Like, that's insane. Yeah. Well, I think too, I mean, here's a, dude, that's insane. That's insanely fucking evil. Like all of these families who lost their men, who lost their dads, their brothers, their fucking cousins, their, their sons, they, they wiped out an entire fucking generation or two of Ukrainian men. And do you think that they didn't know they were doing that? Do you think that they weren't aware? Do you think that wasn't the plan? Do you think any of these people don't know that that's intentionally going on? The question is why? Why are we removing all of the Ukrainian men from Ukraine? Well, I have a feeling that we will find out fairly soon. But I think it's interesting that nobody talks about this because we talk about all these little ethnic cleansings. You know what the ethnic cleansings have been happening the last three years, the biggest one in fucking Ukraine. Why it's own guy. I think that's going to be the interesting thing to see too. And then they got the Ukrainian people fucking here to cheer for it. Right. I think that's going to be the most interesting thing though is like, because here's the thing that I know for certain, right? Zelensky, he's a self-interest person. He cares about himself. So what's going to happen when that tick gets separated from him? One, it's happening. But when it's completely cut off, and then there might be some potential charges coming to him, he's going to start singing like a bird. Yeah. Which full circle direct goes back to the whole reason we are even involved in the situation. He will die before that. You think he'll have him killed. He will be dead. I bet Zelensky isn't even alive for another fucking 12 months. He knows too much shit. There's been a regime change here. There's new sheriffs in town here. I would bet I would even give him 12 months. I give him like three months. Back to the whole money thing. You know, like having all your people killed from monetary gain. I think that this is a really good example. But I think that we can look at a lot of different wars under the same light. Yeah. Like most wars. You know, you're looking at all of them in modern history. Where we are knowingly sending our sons and daughters to go overseas and get killed for money. Why else? Why else though? Why else would they do that? Why else would they remove the baddest ass, most capable men and women of your country? Why would you send those people to die? For population control. Let's have them to fight with them here. Less resistance, population control. There's all kinds of reasons. Yeah, I just I feel like Ukraine is a shining example of what's been happening in every other war. Maybe just to a lesser degree. It's just more obvious whenever we're looking at Ukraine. But this is how I feel about the the war, monitoring complex in general. It's all for money. I think people killed for it. I agree with you. I think this has been happening for fucking. I think it's been happening since 1913. I don't think any war that we fought since 1913 was a quote unquote real war and people get real mad about that when you say that. But it was all of these things were about controlling money. They were all about controlling money. Yeah, man, guys jumping on this conversation. Do you think it's a coincidence that we have a conflict every single generation that costs us our highest drive testosterone filled men. In every generation, do you think that's a coincidence? No, I don't think that's a coincidence at all. I think if I were trying to control the world, I would say how do we get the highest testosterone men of all these countries to fight each other so that we have less of those people so that we could control them? That would make sense. Like, fuck dude, I don't want to get bit by those two dogs. Let's make a fight each other. Whatever happens happens because at least they won't be fighting us. You make a shit ton of money doing it. Yeah. It's disgusting shit, dude. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Let me explain. Let's get to my third and final headline, guys. We got headline number three. Hell on number three reads. RFK Julius first move is health secretary sparks outrage from transgender advocates. So RFK's in and he's starting to do his work. I think he's coming after Coca-Cola also, which I like Diet Coke, be honest. Don't pump it. I'm gonna let that Diet Coke get. That's what I'm saying. I'm going to throw away. Listen, he's got a fucking button on his desk to bring Diet Coke. He does. I don't know this true, but I heard that. I mean, Diet Coke. There's a dude that walks around Donald Trump with fucking Diet Coke's ready to go. That's what I heard, dude. Like I asked my buddies that are around him and they're like, yeah, bro, like he gets Diet Coke's keep Diet Coke's on. Yeah. So leave my ass for table on, bro. I like Diet Coke. Diet Coke's good. But RFK is moving off to something different to start with. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken name at a transgender language in one of his first access health secretary. His new agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, released new guidance for the government and public that gives a narrower definition of sex. The February 19th memo states that the move will support the president's executive orders intended to, quote, restore the concept of biological truth and federal government and defend women. The new HHS document says only two sexes will be recognized male and female. It also provides new narrow definitions of words like sex, female, woman, girl, male, man, boy, mother, and father. RFK Jr. former Democrat said, quote, the prior administration's policy of trying to engineer gender ideology into every aspect of public life is over. The Department also launched a website promoting these definitions and created a video defending a ban on transgender women participating in women's sports. That was also prompted by Trump's January 20th executive order title defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government. Now, I think we all agree that's good. These are good things that are happening. Of course, the left is going to have a response. So let's go to Ohio first, real quick. I'm not sure if you guys have seen this video, but new Ohio lawmakers have proposed a new law that bans men from ejaculating without incentive conception would find men up to $10,000 per ejaculation. The bill was brought forward by Democratic state reps Anita Somani and Tristan Raid. Let's check this out. Bonsored by Democratic state representatives Anita Somani and OB-GYN from Dublin and Tristan Raider of Lakewood. The whole entire point of this bill is to call out the hypocrisy, particularly the state legislature when they bring forward bills to regulate women's bodies. Now, there are exceptions to the proposed law, which include sperm donation, contraception and members of the LGBTQ community. Men face a maximum $10,000 fine after the third offense if they have sex with a woman without the intention of conceiving a child. Men have the same rights no matter where they go in the country. Women have rights based on where they live. It just misses the most basic biological facts and leans in towards middle school humor. Austin Beigel with end abortion, Ohio calls the proposal disrespectful to the pro-life community and a waste of state resources. They have to review it when they file it. They're going to have to stick a legal team on it wasting time on that and delaying other bills that are trying to be reviewed as well. ABC six asking viewers about the proposal in an online poll. 26% said it's a good idea. 74% telling us it's a waste of time. Why was the LGBT people excused? Because they can't procreate. Also, they can just masturbate and ejaculate no problem. But I'm making a $100,000 a day. Yeah, so I did see this come through and it's literally just to make an example of what they think of as ridiculous anti-abortion laws. I'm not necessarily going to get into this, but it is a waste of time and taxpayer money. I think it's ridiculous that we're at a point right now where lawmakers are so unseurious that they're actually creating things like this. We live in radically unseurious times right now. In this, regardless. Totally agree. It's so stupid. It's just an example of how they take all of the resources and time and the money that they use to pay themselves off of our backs. It's entitlement, dude. Like, they think it's totally okay for them to just have unlimited resources and off of our backs. I just think it's all I can think about, honestly. That's the only thing I've been able to think about ever since the start to come out is I've worked my whole life to have half my money stolen for nothing. That's a hard thing for me to accept. I think the punishment for these people needs to be very severe. Back to what RFK is saying about the language regarding sex, male, female. That's another example of people are saying, oh, it's ridiculous. It is ridiculous. It's ridiculous. It's absurd that we have gotten to a point where this has to be legislated. You know what I'm saying? Well, yeah, it's ridiculous. It was ever allowed to happen in the first place. That's a big problem. That's a big problem I see with a lot of the things happening right now is that we're all happy that we're getting things to go our way. But all of those things we should have had anyway. So I don't look at it as, oh, we're getting all these gifts. I mean, look how we're behaving. We're behaving like happy little, you know, seals that are getting tossed a little bit of fish because and clapping our hands to get things that we should have already had. It never should have been a question to begin with. Never. So there's only male and female. Yeah, dude, or the border is getting closed. Awesome. Yeah, right. You know, taxes. We found out that they're wasting like recelerating the wrong. Yes. We're beat. We're forgetting what we, we're not getting anything we should have already had. And so we need to be careful not to like worship the people that are doing this because dude, all they're really doing is giving us the shit we should have already had. And if we're getting the shit that we should have already had and expected to be excited about it, you know what it makes me think? What are they taking that we're not noticing? Or what are they doing that they're giving us this? Because dude, I just, I just have this hard time believing that we're not in a shell game right now. Like and and and because somebody else is going to get something big, they're going to give us some things here. It's just a weird feeling I have. I kind of always have this feeling in life when I know I'm about to get screwed. You know, and like, dude, I feel like we're expected to cheer for things like dude. Look, man, I'm happy that Trump is moving the direction he's moving. I'm excited, but nothing's happened yet. I didn't get any more money in my fucking check. Did you? No. Yeah. Did you? I didn't see anybody go jail yet. Did you? Nope. Okay. I haven't seen shit. I've seen a bunch of shit on the news about these things they were going to do or that are trying to do. And I understand, like I said, it's going to take time. But until I see these things, I remain highly skeptical of the promises that are being made. And we should all be very aware that we are cheering and being excited for things that we should have already had. It's it's cheering to return to baseline. Yes. Which I think like, yes, am I happy that these things are happening? Absolutely. But we need to understand like, oh, we're just resetting back to a baseline of where we're supposed to be to begin with. Yeah. And we have so much ground to cover in front of us, like getting to baseline. Sure. That's great. But that's not the end of the road. Yeah. You're doing what's expected to be done. Like cool. Do do what's unexpected. I mean, shopping some steaks, bro. Like, that's unexpected. I'll be happy about that. Look, man, it's I'm not sure how I feel about everything. Like, I feel like you feel Becky. Like, I'm excited. I'm like, yes, okay. This is cool happening. But until I steep handcuffs, until I see accountability, until I see accountability for what happened during COVID, until I see our the financial oppression in this country, stop, meaning I don't have to write fucking massive amounts of money to the fucking IRS. Like, until that shit stops, it doesn't matter what they say. It doesn't fucking matter. It doesn't matter how many stories. Fox news puts out about what's going to happen. Or any of these talking heads, like any of these guys, the shit does not matter until it's done to me. And I don't see it happening yet. So I remain skeptical. I Trump as a character, the way he handles himself, all that shit. I like him a lot. I think he's funny. He reminds me. He actually reminds me of my dad and some other people that I've been around my whole life. I like to do. I like his family, but I am in no way, shape, or form going to say that, you know, like, dude, the shit hasn't happened yet. So we have to be, I think as American people, we need to be very cognizant of promises made that are not kept and agree not enough time has passed. But we should also be very, very, we should at least think about where we are in terms of how we celebrate because to call a man, a man, and a woman, a woman is fucking three year old shit. And we're over here clapping. Oh, yeah. The fuck are we talking about? How to get out of the wackin first place? You see what I'm saying? Like, oh, I mean, dude, how do you repair? How do you repair someone who has been financially ruined because of the great, like, dude, you know how many people lose their marriages over money or lose their lives over money? They kill themselves or they they get desperate or they turn to drugs or like, dude, lives have been ruined. And not just a few millions upon millions upon millions of lives have been ruined because of the things these people have been doing and the things specifically that have been done in the last four to five years to push it across the line in terms of like, bro, how many businesses got closed during COVID and aren't opening back up? How many dollars got shifted to the biggest companies in the world because they donated to a political campaign? Like, they're it's irreconcilable. Like, like how the fuck do you make that right? How do you make it right to the guy who's 50 years old, who's been working his ass off, who hasn't been able to afford very much in his life because he's overtaxed, he's overworked, he's underpaid because of the waste that's happened. How do you and his wife's left him, his kids hate him, he's done the best that he fucking can and it's still ain't good enough. How do you fucking fix that? How do you make that right? Because dude, that should have never been the case. It should never be the case that a man works his whole life at 50 years old and his fucking loses everything because he can't make ends me because half his money's being stolen by these corrupt fucking tyrants. That's you can't fix that. So there needs to be accountability at a minimum and there needs to be a resetting of the financial operation of this government at a minimum and it needs to be fucking drastic because dude, this country is the land of opportunity apparently. It's not. Okay, when these people deserve the harshest possible punishment, when I think back of like how hard it like I know a lot of you, nobody's gonna fucking feel sorry for me because of where the fuck I am currently. But if you knew what I had to do to fucking get here and the shit I had to eat and the fucking like how easy it would have been if I wasn't having to pay all like it just pisses me to fuck off and it's inexcusable to me. It just is and it should be to everybody. I don't think that there's any level of accountability that will ever be enough. I don't think there's any way to go back and fix any of this. You like you can't fix it. Like it is beyond a state of like, oh, we'll give you $5,000 or no taxes like you can't unwind time and fix things. But what I am hopeful for is that we can get to a place as a country where we can start setting up future generations for success. In healing the future, we cannot heal the past, but we have an opportunity to heal the future so that our kids can grow up to be prosperous and live meaningful lives and not be robbed blindly by the governments. We have that opportunity right now, but more meaningful change has to take place. Like, is it great that we have only two genders now? Sure. We need substantially more than that. Well, yeah, because we still got little boys identifying girls competing in girls' competitions. It's still going on. It's still happening. Does that say male leapfrogs competitors? Yeah, leapfrogs competitors that girls pole-launting meat in Maine. This just happened. There's a transgender identifying male competing under the name Katie from Cumberland's Greenley High, Greenley High School came out on top in the girls pole vault competition on Monday during the main indoor track meet at Bates College. The thing is, is that not long ago when he identified his male, he ranked in 10th place out of 11. I mean, two years ago, John tied for 5th place in the boy's pole vault. Tonight, Katie won first place in the girls' main state class B championship. Some of the shit still happened. Yeah, we're celebrating. Cool. But like, I think about these girls. Oh, fuck these people. I think about these girls. No, bro, fuck these people. That's wrong. Everybody knows it's wrong. Every single human being knows that's wrong. They know it. They know it. We have to stop catering to the fucking loud ultra minority with their insane policies and thought processes that make zero sense. We all know, we all know that's wrong. We fucking all know it. We all know that a man is a man and a woman is a woman. We all know that too. We all know most of this shit. But because people have lacked courage to stand up and say, hey, that's bullshit. Here we are. This is what happens when people lose their fucking backbone. Okay, COVID should have never happened. Y'all fucking knew it was wrong, bro. Everybody knew how many of you wore masks that you didn't want to wear to get along in society. Okay. A lot of you guys say, well, I fucking didn't do that shit. But the fuck you did, we got pictures of you and you're fucking mask on your social acting like you're a fucking good little puppet. You're doing the right thing. And now you're like, I didn't do that. There's fucking receipts, bro. Okay. How many people dirt, how many people during COVID, DJ would call us or mass adjust or write in and say, fuck, dude, I agree. Exactly. You guys are right on it. Keep going. Wish I could do that. I wish I could do that. Well, you didn't. And that's why it happened. And that's why this has happened. And that's why all this bullshit has happened. Because we have been made to be afraid to use our fucking voices. And until Americans get the courage to speak up when things are wrong at scale and say, no, I don't give a fuck that this guy has some sort of gender dysmorphia and wants to be a girl. I don't care, bro. Go over there and do it. Stay out of the fucking sports until we have enough balls as a society to just call things how they are. The fuckery will continue. So you want to know why this happens? It happens because of the people who know it's wrong that refuse to say a word because they don't want to hear about it on social media or be yelled at at HR or whatever. Bro, right is right and wrong is wrong. And we all know the difference between a man and a woman. This is absurd. Shit. It's absurd. We all know that we shouldn't be tax slaves. We all know that, you know, we all know we all know you cranes bullshit. We all know. But like, dude, how many people that know don't say shit. That's why the fuck it happens. And until that fucking stops, it's going to continue to happen over and over no matter who's president, because we'll always be manipulated in some sort of next cause. Next thing, you're not a good person if you don't do this. Bro, fuck that. Then I'm not a good person. I don't give a fuck what you think. I'm going to say what I fucking want to say. I'm going to call it the way. And I got the receipts that I've always done that and always been that way. And you know what? When I go to sleep at night and I look myself in the mirror and makes me proud. A lot of you don't have that fucking. You wonder why you're fucked up because you're not even proud of yourself, bro. You don't even have the courage to speak up for right and wrong. And you think you're going to fucking somehow have self-esteem or integrity or confidence in yourself. You're a fucking pussy. You know you're a pussy when you look in the mirror. That's why you feel like shit about yourself. So it can start with using your voice. Am I wrong? No, not wrong at all, man. Like how are you going to feel good about yourself if you know that you let all this shit slide, that you know is morally, inethically fucking wrong. You can't. You can't erase that. Dude, I can't stand it. Look, until people have backbone and start like Becky, this is absurd that we're even talking about this. Right. It's absurd. This is dude, how old I don't have any kids. How older kids when they know the difference between a man and a woman? Yeah, I mean, no, I'm asking. Yeah, maybe maybe two, three, two, yeah. Right. So now we have an entire generation of fucking adults arguing over it and fucking Washington, DC. That's absurd. It's two-year-old shit. Ah, bro. Dude, I've been talking about this for years. Yeah, I know. Years. Very well too. And it's still not done. And I don't know if we're going to see it ever really go away in its entirety. Like I feel like the damage has been done to the community and the brainwashing has been done. And I feel like some of these people are so set in their ways. Like the manipulation in the propaganda and the level of brainwashing done to these people through the funded social engineering. Yeah, it's done. How do you fix that? I don't know. Like I've been on it for years and I feel like it's starting to get better. But like fuck, we need more people talking. Well, dude, you can't just rely on like, oh, that one lesbian on Instagram, who's allowed to say it. I think it's because she's lesbian. I can't say it. You mean I won't with the demon in her here? Oh, fuck, dude. What are we going to do? It's crazy, man. How do you get someone to say damn, dude? I was brainwashed. It's hard. It's like a personal journey. It's a shock to the ego. So like, I don't hide this, but like I went through a liberal phase. You know, I went away to college. I grew up conservative. When I went to college, I became a liberal raging liberal. I voted for Joe Biden. I don't hide that fact in coming to terms with the level of deception that I bought into. It was difficult. How did that happen? How did I start? Yeah, like what? Like I want to hear that. So yeah. So I went away to college. I grew up in a conservative home, wonderful parents, strong relationship, great values in my household. And I'm blessed by that. When I went to college, started getting more and more liberal to the points where like it went, it went rapid. And I rapidly went from one end of the spectrum to the other end of the spectrum. And then I became a mom. And I had my son and COVID hit in during that time period. I was still kind of in my liberal phase. I was scared out of my mind about COVID. And I was seeing all the propaganda. But then ironically enough, as the propaganda started rolling out more heavily and like the death tolls are going on the screens, I had this moment. Because at that point, I was back home with my parents because you know, the situation with my son and the pregnancy and everything, I went back to them for some time. And so I'm there with my parents. And I'm surrounded by, you know, they're conservative. They're wonderful people. And I'm seeing these red death toll tickers. And I'm like, this doesn't feel right. And I started kind of easing myself out of it a little bit. And then I got here. And at the time, like I was still, I was still very left of center. And then just being surrounded by more conservative people, more level-headed people, I started gradually pulling out of it. And I had to have a very real conversation with myself and come to the terms, come to terms with the fact that I had been lied to and manipulated and brainwashed. And I had let my identity slide so far down this path without even realizing it. And that's a very difficult conversation to have with yourself to look back and say, you know what, I was wrong. I was lied to. My character was weak at that time. I had a weak mindset because I was so easily able to be manipulated into this pattern of thinking. And what's hard is a lot of people get so ideologically tied to these political ideas, ideas, one side or the other. And whenever you start to realize that this side has been lying to me, and I bought the lies, it feels like an attack on your identity. It feels like an attack on who you are as a person. And that's very difficult. And most people cannot look at themselves and have that conversation. Most people cannot sit with themselves and admit, I got duped. I had a weak mind. I had a weak character at the time. And I was taken advantage of. And most people have too much pride to sit down and have that conversation with themselves. And you know, thank God I was able to get there pretty quick. My liberal phase was very short-lived. It was short, but it was aggressive. You know, I went so far, so fast. And coming out of that, you know, really as we were reeling off of COVID, that's where things really started changing most specifically. And I'll never forget it. But whenever I saw the LGBTQ community rallying for force vaccinations, and they were fighting for mandatory vaccines. And I just sat there and I thought, how dare you? Like the group, they had to fight for decades for bodily autonomy, government, keep your hands off my body, government, don't tell me what to do, government, you don't control me. And now you're saying, here, no, no, no, government, you control me. And you should control everyone. And it just, like, it was a light bulb moment for me. And like, that was the moment where I completely split off. Well, I also think, you know, the mutilation of young children was very effective in pushing you away. Well, sure. Yeah. And like I said, it was really when I became a mom. Whenever I became a mom, that's where things really started to change for me because I was no longer living for myself. I was living for my son and everything I was doing was doing was centered around how do I create a good life for my son? How do I protect him? How do I raise him? Well, how do I get him in a good school? You know, things of that nature. How do I provide? And as it turns out, having that drive to provide and take care in nurture and care for someone other than yourself, it shifts you away from liberalism pretty quickly. Yeah. You know, and especially whenever the LGBTQ community started going completely sideways after the force vaccinations, we started getting the pronouns, drag queen story hour, these hormone blockers, these cross sex hormones, like 15 year old girls getting their breast chopped off. Yeah. It was an absolute snapping point for me. And that's when I really started speaking on social media because I couldn't, I couldn't stand by and watch the community do that any longer. I wonder how many people are starting to realize are going to start to take into consideration that they were propagated through their own tax dollars to believe these things were culturally acceptable and understand like where this actually comes from. You know, communist Bolshevik fucking ideas that they use to brainwash society so that they can literally be killed eventually. Right? Like how many people are going to come together to understand this? Well, that's what I'm saying. It's a shock on the ego. It's a shock on the identity. It's a very difficult conversation to have with yourself. So most people, why do a lot of people too are having this situation with, you know, I think there's a lot of brainwash people like legitimately that cannot think for themselves on both sides of the spectrum. I think independent critical thinking is where you want to be. You want to get to a point where you can say, well, yeah, I agree with that. That's good. But also, I don't agree with this over here. Like we should be able to, we shouldn't have to be, and I don't think it's healthy to be, to identify politically with one party or another. I think we have to identify with ourselves and what is right and what is wrong, what we think is right or wrong. And that's where we need to get people back to, right? It's not, it's not a fucking cult of either side. It's a, it's a independent thought process. And I'm going to put my vote and stand behind the things I think that are best, you know, and we just lack that in this country right now. Because, well, because, dude, I don't think people should feel ashamed that they were taken advantage of. That happens all the time. It should be seen as a lesson. You know, when, when you get a trillion, trillions of dollars of propaganda pumped into your brain 24, 7, 24, 7, I mean, that's not their fault that they fell for it. Yeah, but it should, it should ignite a fucking fire and you to do something, want to do something about it. Whether that means you use your platform that you have, create a platform, whatever that means, I mean, it should ignite some type of like, fuck like it. I'm not this fucking stupid. Yeah, you know, it's insulting. It should piss most people are much too prideful to admit that they were duped. Yeah. And that's just what it is. You know, and it's hard. You know, it took a lot, you know, I started my Instagram thing and it took me a long time before I could even admit the diet voted for Biden or I'd ever been a liberal in the first place because I was so embarrassed, you know, about, you know, that, that mindset that I had had for so long. And it just, it comes down to ego and pride. Can you have that conversation with yourself or can you not? And a lot of people would rather be wrong and maintain this sense of false pride than ever have a real conversation. Yeah. Yeah, man, it's crazy shit, man. Until we get to a point where that's, that's, uh, it's so undeniable that people have been manipulated. I mean, like, it has to be, it's going to have to be like, ridiculously undeniable for people to see it. But I think once we get to that point, maybe people will start calling for accountability. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think with that being said. We got a final second of the show. As always, we got thumbs up or dumb as fuck. Now this is a little different one for you. All right. Um, in the nature of having a wonderful guest on, I say we do a like a little healthy debate here. Um, and it involves one of your favorite things, Andy. French fries. We are going to be ranking fries. Um, fast-refrise. We're going to rank them. Okay. All right. So we got, uh, we got a couple of different options here. So here you go. Would you make a, would you make a program here? What's this? It's a tier maker. Yeah. Okay. All right. And so we just rank these fries. So I mean, first up, you got, you got S is like the best. Superior. Superior. Okay. Then there's a B C and D. What's A? It's like great. Oh, got it. Okay. But S is superior. Yeah. Far superior. And I think you could put multiple in like the categories. So we got RBC here first. You got Hardies, Burger King, five guys. Um, I'm not sure what that is. I think just basic fries. Maybe Chick-fil-A. What's that one? Smash burgers. Raising canes, Wendy's, Jack in the box. Curly, Jack in the box straight. And you got McDonald's. What we got? Yeah. Well, who's going first? Yeah. I mean, I'll go first. I would say, uh, Chick-fil-A is a superior fry in my personal opinion. You probably eat more french fries than most of us. Yeah. You're definitely the expert. All right. I'm about this kind of. Actually, actually, I would be the expert. Really work out because I have twice as much work out. I'm about, I've eaten the most french fries here. Okay. Out of anybody. Yeah. For sure. Because there's no way that you could have eaten the amount of fries I've eaten in 40. You've been on this earth a long time. That's right. Yeah. So I would say I've eaten the most fries. Okay. You hear the regardless of the or physique differences. Yeah. There won't be so different in a minute. I think Chick-fil-A has superior fries though. Are you sure that you're confident? I'm pretty confident in Chick-fil-A fries, bro. They're bro the waffle fries. Wait, are we ranking them individually or as a team here? I mean, everything's up for the money. Okay. I would say that this is good judgment. I would say that Chick-fil-A makes some awesome fries. All right. I'm shocked that you don't have covers up there. Covers does make some good fries. Covers smash. Yeah. Covers got some good fries. What do our bees go? We'll just go down the list this way. Where does our bees go? Here's what it is. Fucking jack-in-a-box curly fries. Arbis curly fries are right there up there in the A category. Okay. Okay. This is how we're going to do this. Okay. Arbis curly. They're all way to the left there. Which one? All way to left. Hardies? The left. Oh. Fucking left. All the way to the left. Okay. It's hard to see. I'm working on a different screen. Okay. That's all we need to know. That's all we need. Okay. Well, we got to pick who has the worst fries? I will go ahead and say that I think raising canes is like a D. Come on, man. Which one's in and out? I don't think they're up here. Oh, it's just in and out. Oh, yeah, it is because the little fucking thing there. Yeah. I've had their fries. It should stretch. Yeah, for sure. McDonald's. I mean, that's a solid like B. Like McDonald's people are going to say it's an A. Yeah, it's a B. That's be real. People are going to get pissed. McDonald's fruit. McDonald's fruit. That's because you're a peasant. It's like a B. I don't know what's good. Yeah. Like it's unfortunate. That's true. Yes. But I give it a B. If they bring back the beef talo, it'd be like a superior fry potentially. Wendy's is superior to McDonald's. I think that's a A. No. No. McDonald's got to go down to C. Okay. Because Wendy's are a step behind the curly fries. Okay. We're going to put those guys in the B. All right. Five guys is pretty good. I never have five guys. Five guys is pretty good. It's overridden. Okay. You guys have the side acts on her hat. See? I'll go see. Okay. Five guys at C. They're so greasy. I mean, but that's the good part. They're giving me. I've never had smash either. So I've never had smash burgers. So we got to give them a C just out of courtesy. Because we got to have them. Okay. Okay. I've never had raising canes, but I know lots of people that love raising canes. Yeah. I bet they're all white. No. The fucking shit's good. Dylan gave me some. But raising raising canes is disgusting. Okay. Well, you're going to pull me on chicken and Andy's. I'm a fucker. I am. I'm going to tell you why. Because you think I've got the 11 herbs and spices, may you represent 6% of the population. That's it. So you're say on the fries, that doesn't count. Okay. You can't say that you can't. It goes from nasty. Huh? They're friends of nasty. Who's raising canes? I refuse to believe that because I had their chicken and it was fucking great. I bet it was great to spicy at all. I thought it was great. I like all chicken bro. Don't even act like you don't like all chicken. I don't like raising canes. Fuck out of you. I don't like raising canes. I know it. They're nasty. The fries are the chicken. There's a reason being is that they put a package everything at styrofoam. So like the good soggy. Yes. Okay. Well, that's a dog. Oh, can't have soggy fries. All right. Merking has good fries. Merking has been lost. It's a had burger king. I'd say like a I give it like a B. Now it belongs in the C. Okay. Wendy's are definitely better. Okay. All right. I think all the rest belong in the C category. That's like your basic. That's a basic fries that are pretty good. They're not terrible. Wendy's is better than all of those. Jack and curly fries are better than straight fries. And waffle fries are better than fucking curly fries. We're really just ranking the shape of the french fries here as well. We're doing. Yeah. Well, I mean, it matters. It does matter. And waffle fries are the undisputed best french fries. I agree with that. Yeah. I agree with that. Then curly fries, I believe are the second best. Yeah. I've not had too many curly fries. I was like, man, it'll suck. Bro, rallies has some good curly fries. We say and dude. And then Wendy's out of the fast food. I think Wendy's has the best like regular fries fries. Yeah. Best regular fries. Bro, you know that's a good fries. Then we got the peasant fries across the board that everybody's going to look blue. Look at the top. See how he's a little bit naughty. These are seas. Yeah, bro. I think this is a fair standing. This is fair. I can't comment on raising canes or the one what's the other one that's I never had it. I never had it. I don't know. Trash. Is it? Trash. I know. They should they should close their business. Go bankrupt. Why does everybody always post it? Like it's a big deal. What? Raising canes and in and out? No, in and out. Is it in and out the place where like everybody posts the top and you can see all the food? Yeah. Like what's the big deal with it? I've never had it. It's how I feel about like water burger. People go crazy over it. Really? And I just it's mediocre at best. I tell you what? I think I think Culver's is pretty fucking good. Culver's has a good burger. They got good burger and fries. Why is choices just I think Midwest? Why is choices superior to any of this? Absolutely. Not. Yes. They are in the S category. Really? Fuck yeah. I think that's like a choice. They're real potatoes. Bro, they make them right there. Bro, you know, so does five guys. But you know, I told you I never had them. Yeah, I got you. Penn station has good fries too. That should have made the list. Penn station? No. I've never been there. You never had Penn station? Guys, that's the list. Motherfucker, eat the Penn station and see in days of thunder is not the same fucking thing. I feel like it's about the same. No, it's fucking. I feel like they're equivalent. I have fucking untrue. It's kind of equivalent. No. No. Same. Same. No. Chat chat. I'm not asking them. Shit. They fucking they think I don't know the fucking boys in the hood. Yeah, sure. That's true. I bet I bet I bet the Texas Voyager likes raising canes. Daring to get well, that's I mean, that's a pretty good list. I think that's decent. Bro, I think Chick-fil-A is so much better than I think it's like two notches better than everybody else. For fries. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Popeyes is number one on chicken. Yeah. Popeyes. Popeyes is good. Popeyes is good. But I think raising canes is good. I think Chick-fil-A is good. I've never had a chicken. I didn't like. Yeah. I have you? Where have you had a fried chicken strip or a chicken sandwich that was bad? Raising canes. No, that's raising canes. Zack's business is good. Raising canes has to be good because fucking there's so many of them. Oh, I mean, they were that bad. Oh, I mean, you guys have to like keep your ears. So you're saying that's because of the population. The white people. Yeah. So you're saying there's far less Popeyes because of the 6% that you represent. Yep. And there's far more raising canes because it's white people chicken. Correct. And there's more white people than there is black people. Yes. So that's what we're talking about. Yep. It's statistics. Okay. Yeah. I think that murder rate. You guys don't do everything better than us. That's all I got. Guys, Eddie Becky. That's all I got, man. Becky, thank you so much for coming on the show.
