What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realist say goodbye to the lies and thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome. Motherfucking reality. Guys today we have Andy and DJ. Crews the motherfucking and that's what we're going to do that's what CTI stands for cruise the internet. Let's get right into it today. Please share the show. Don't be a hoe show the show. All right. If it makes you laugh it makes you think do it's a solid we don't run ads you know the deal. Just help us grow the show man. That's it. Anyway what's up. Hi greetings greetings salutations yes expanding vocabulary here. Yeah. It's going on with you though man nothing yeah yeah got a lot to do there's some there is like I feel like there's always weird stuff and I know you guys think I say this all the time there's really some weird shit going on it's getting weirder it's getting fucking weird yeah but I think not exposed I think I think we're going to expose some stuff here today I got some really exclusive stuff going on here and we'll get to here a little bit later but I wanted to bring something up completely but before we get into our headlines man not sure if you saw this or I know you might think you know I think you saw some of this but I want to dive into let's talk about it on air um CIA confirmed arc of the Covenant's existence using remote viewing resurfaced that declassified box claimed you see this shit bro I saw the headline coming across but I didn't dig into it dude I know what remote viewing is I like and that's the thing like it's been around but I didn't this is my first time hearing of like the arc of covenant they like found it using this stuff and I do they found all kinds of missing people it's a real thing dude yeah look this this headline sort of defines what I've been saying about what they've been lying to us about okay in both instances I've been saying that they're lying to us about what humans are capable of and they're also lying to us about the existence of Jesus Christ being a real exactly what he is proclaimed to be 100% and this headline sort of embodies both of those things well the crazy pieces to like I remember I sent you a video uh youtube link but it's like every day do they're finding more and more more more evidence is coming out um about Jesus his existence and like dude they they they just discovered it's not even a new discovery they've known about it but it's just now starting to come back up like all these things are going to come out now well look they've though what I'm saying is they're lying to us they're keeping this shit secret and the reason it's starting to come out could be a couple different reasons one um you know they the the stuff is starting to leak because we have whistleblowers and different declassifications happening that's part of it that's part of it yeah two it could be two distract everybody from something else like I don't know a world war um three uh you know it could be the that they are going to do a a project blue beam okay and a project blue beam if you don't know what it is it's it's a holographic technological false flag that either simulates the arrival of aliens or the second coming of Jesus Christ yeah so I would like to believe that this is just genuine information coming to the surface but that's hard to believe after 2000 plus years of them trying to cover it right so but yeah dude astral projection remote viewing these are real things that our government has been using for years and years and years decades and then they pretend like it doesn't like it doesn't exist and humans just you know they're little marching ants right you know it's weird man it's wild stuff and I think uh it's just weird like I mean like the you know in the bible in Exodus it talks about you know the the the Pharaoh of Exodus right the first you know time is Israel Israel lights were removed right and and banished off and uh that Pharaoh he he actually met with Moses in the bible talks about this in Exodus he met with Moses and Moses blew up some dust right and uh and everybody broke out with these like boils on their fucking skin well they have his like they found a mummy and and the olive kings and he's the only mummy they've ever found with fucking boils still on his skin bro yeah dude very with his son that was killed in the you know the plague of the first like dude it's I mean that doesn't mean for sure but I mean because people have boils but you know I mean look it's kind of weird and it's also kind of weird that you know you have the world's foremost experts on quantum meditation and and quantum physics and a law of attraction which is a simplified version of explaining a whole lot of science that is real um you know we have the foremost experts saying that this all comes from source energy through your pineal gland and then you have I don't know fluoride put in everybody's water to calcify pineal glands so I think these people have gone to great lengths to really limit not only what people think they're capable of or know they're capable of but also their physical ability to do these things no for sure bro I mean like the stuff in this I mean like the files are all there the summaries the reports and all of this stuff was this included in the JFK shit is that where this was or I don't know I think I think this was just a time declassification that came out the the CIA's vault I don't think it was attached to the JFK stuff but this was in 1988 what did it have to say they said they found it in 88 right yeah right Saudi Arabia yeah yeah 100% and it's just like I mean do it it's just it's wild it's still there is what they're saying I don't know I don't know yeah I mean it's weird but like the guy reviewed it you know they described it being uh let's see here it is um viewer 032 attained excellent site contact doing very well with stage four structure viewer also exhibits the ability to keep a oil to a minimum have to be careful with editing though this does not seem to be a problem at this time just something to watch for target training target this is the 0209 so that means there was 208 we were more viewing done before this one but yeah they marked this one as as arc of the covenant and I mean do it's just wild it's wild target is a container the container has another container inside of it the target this fashion of wood gold and silver target of similar in shape to aol a coffin decorated with serifium seasca I mean the shits wild and also to look the target is located somewhere in the middle east as the language spoke about the individual's presence seemed to be Arabic visuals of surrounding buildings indicated that the presence of mosque domes individuals in the area were clothed and virtually all white have black hair and dark eyes one figure I honed in on war a mustache the target is hidden underground dark and wet were all aspects of the location of the target the purpose of the target is to bring people together it has something to do with ceremony memory homage and the resurrection there is an aspect of spirituality information lessons and historical knowledge far beyond what we know now bro the truck the target is protected by entities and can only be opened by those who are authorized to do so this container will not cannot be open until the time is deemed correct once it is time to open the container the mechanics of the lock system will be found to be fairly simple individuals opening the container by prying or striking are destroyed by the containers protectors through the use of a power unknown to us basically the exact same scene that happens in Raiders of the Lost Ark at the end of it bro where they open the they open the the Ark and these spirits come out and melt everybody you probably never seen that I haven't seen that I haven't seen that one no but I mean do the shits crazy yeah well if you want to know Raiders of the Lost Ark is them trying to find the Ark of the Covenant the you know all of these movies seem to be some sort of I don't know like foreshadowing yeah foreshadowing on what's actually happening yeah you know uh the last crusade was about him finding the the uh cup of Christ you know from the last supper yeah the holy grail bro like you I think all this shit is out there bro and they're totally lying to us 100% well I mean do they also made me think of two like you know we talked about the pyramids and shit and the stuff they found them the pyramids yeah so I found the article I found some pictures and stuff they they kind of like digitalized the diagrams and stuff but here's that visual representation you were talking about yeah all the pillars and stuff going down well that can't be the scale because those pillars are like what a 1.6 miles long yeah and then the the boxes are only 250 feet by 250 feet so I mean that's yeah that's that's not the scale the box are too big but yeah it's looks something like that it's crazy man yeah crazy shit man I don't know I thought I mean just you know getting kicked off with some conspiracy I don't think it's conspiracy I think the conspiracy is that they lied to us about it yeah I mean if you think about all the things that humans have been capable of throughout history and then you look at like how fast things moved over the last 300 years there's nothing to say that that 300 year period of accelerated growth that led to the extinction or almost virtual extinction of human history hasn't happened many times yeah because it's the natural result of technology right and it could be where different times and civilizations had created different technologies that destroyed them in different ways you know there could be a lot of different things that that are true but like I could tell you this what they tell us about history and the way it is and all this shit is bullshit okay there's a lot of shit they know that they're not telling us and that's it you know that's that's at the end of the day that's what it is and Devils advocate do you think it's because they don't want us to destroy ourselves no I think it's because they know that if we knew what the fuck we were capable of they wouldn't have power and control over us and I think that we deal with a human characteristic or trait that is very naturally occurring in humans which is the addiction of power and control and wealth at the expense of other people and I think that you know when we look at the possibilities I think they're I think they're almost endless with very few consistencies and by the way there was a study that came out just in the last two weeks that reinforced the idea that all human life came from one man and one woman and that everybody is actually related in some way shape or form and then they went back through time and they found that there was a bottleneck meaning that most of earth's population had genetically genetically been killed yeah right and it started over again yep and i.e. Noah's Ark or or fucking dude who knows I think this could have happened many times you know there's there's so much different architecture there's so many different there's so much difference but similarities and everything it seems to me like a logical you know way to think about it would be that each time this happened some of the technology survived that was consistent with civilizations across time but dude I mean I'm sure they know I mean you go to you go to Tibet you go to these eastern countries and they have libraries that are fucking 10,000 years old that nobody's allowed to fucking access right so what's in there you know what I mean like I think I think the Vatican holds a lot of that shit too I think we live legitimately in a representation of the matrix that is yeah it's not like the matrix where we're plugged into shit but the atmosphere in the environment serves the same purpose and I don't think we're told any truth I think the truth that actually exist would shake people to their core and and shatter their reality but you know I don't know man I don't know if we'll ever know the truth at at in our lifetime but it does seem like more and more stuff's coming out it does man yeah and and if we're thinking about it dude like that is the the definition of apocalypse or revelation is the truth right and when we talk legitimately at first of all it's important to realize that the the Israelis that occupy Israel now are not the biblical Israelis that they talk about in the Bible so like let's take this this blackmail situation that we talk about with the you know the Israel uh uh the top level of Israeli government um it's my personal belief that they have the information on every single human being ever every picture every text every every conversation it's that's done within the distance or hearing distance of a microphone on your TV or computer and your phone they know I feel like they I think they've hijacked the information system there's evidence that someone has there is a backup internet these are things that exist and I think they pull it when they need it I think they go back and pull the information when they need it and when you really think about how to defeat somebody like that who has everybody's information and blackmail them into compliance you end up with with a revelation um and in apocalypse meaning the truth is going to be exposed which backs up all of the sayings in the Bible so when we talk about like the truth being exposed you know the only way to defeat someone who has the blackmail and everybody is for everybody to have their truths exposed you know I'm saying and then say hey tough shit doesn't matter anymore and then they're they don't have any of that loves no power so like dude this you know and and I know that we're just tossing things around here but I think it's I think it could be much deeper and much more spiritual and much more real than most people think or can even tie together no 100% guys you I want you guys to jump in on this conversation that's not down in the comments what you guys think about all of this um because more stuff is coming out well I mean is that you know I mean it makes sense to me I don't know like if I mean Broadway this also could be you know totally off but I mean I don't know man makes sense to me does it does it yeah 100% there's only way to defeat someone who has the information of blackmail every person on earth is for everybody to sound care yeah I'm just as perfect as you are here I'm just as imperfect yeah exactly and what did Jesus teach mm-hmm so like these are these are biblical very biblical parallels happening right now for sure bro why I think we I've said that I mean I know we've talked about on the show but bro I mean it's hard to even argue like at this point it's very apparent this is spiritual warfare going on I think there's definitely a massive element of that and all of the stuff that they're doing you know I'm saying that like it is spiritual warfare and I think you know the moment like you said every moment people get to the point where it's like I yeah I mean you lose all they lose all power yeah that's right that's all there's need to and that would be a revelation 100% man well guys like I said jump in on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the commentary with that being said let's get into some of our headlines and start cruising these things remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go

no it's man absolutely is but let's get into some meat and potatoes uh let's just keep it at that yeah let's keep it at that I want to show a couple of headlines up here um very quickly what's the most you're right we're at one time oh oh most out every okay actually you know what because I had a time hop video uh the the fucking picture came up with it I made uh some burgers yeah but the bonds were grilled cheese sandwiches okay so yeah I got it right grilled cheese look bro no shame I'm gonna tell you what I did my shit was real bad two of those that's the most you ever ate and then a

good guy yeah two orders of Toaster Ravioli and she sticks the whole thing good lord yeah that's impressive yeah I went to work good lord ain't I was still ready for more bro I mean I've done I've done I've done I've put a few pizzas down you know the truth's gonna come out because my shit was why I was just thinking like those grilled cheese fucking burgers brother they were big yeah I mean I'm just saying dude you know like I don't know when go there I know I was gonna say you know like it's not because it's not funny but like people would believe me they'll eat fucking 20 thousand calories they'll hurt they'll they'll binge so fucking hard like yeah and you will never know because they throw it all up and they're skinny for real crazy bro I know someone who had to live in a hospital for almost a year for it is fucking I'm about to be at this detrimental it becomes uncontrollable where the automatic reaction is the vomit and they become malnourished yeah well not only that I mean the fucking they burn in their esophagus with exactly that super damaging yeah for sure bro but dude if those people didn't purge because of the amount they eat they'd be four five hundred fucking pounds because then you got to retrain your body how much you can eat it's just it's very sad all of those eating disorders like bulimia and anorexia and shitter they're hard to watch for sure bro but I want to bring up some headlines I just want to show you these headlines because there again there's weird stuff happening so let's talk about them there's been three major hits today from our court system as first headline federal judge denies trump administration's effort to ban transgender people from military so that got they came out today the radical ninth circuit court agrees with lower court tells trump to reinstate thousands of fired probationary employees then most recent one also just came out today appeals court denies trump DOJ requests to lift boastbergs block on alien enemies act deportation flights so you got three major rulings all just came back back to back to back and we got to talk about them because I don't know what's happening here I really don't let's go I mean look this is communist judges legitimate communist judges still trying to hang on to what was done over the last four years and they're trying to protect what they think is progress right what we what we see distribution yeah right right 100% what and what their excuses are like you mean this latest one with the deportation flights right so they got to the appeals court there's three judges it was voted down two to one George Bush appointee judge and Obama appointee judge and then the Trump appointee judge who obviously was the only one that voted with it but judge Henderson who is the George Bush appointee heard to send said that the Trump administration failed to justify claims of invasion or predatory incursion okay so what level of justification would it take to get her to realize that that's true she keep going yeah I mean like I mean that that was my exact question I was about to ask you I mean what more proof do we need it it doesn't matter what the proof is because they don't give a fuck they don't care about the proof yeah just like the whole entire time they were invading the last four years 17 to 20 million mostly military age males without their families without their wives have come here and the previous administration lied over and over and over but they completely denied it was happening they said they had control of the board look man we have to I I know we like our listeners but I'm talking about society as a whole they need to quit with this attitude of I can't believe they did it bro these people fucking hate you like you're the one making the mistaken perception that they actually care about you at all they don't they fucking hate you and it shouldn't surprise you that everything they do is designed to make your life more difficult so we have to get away from this I can't believe they're doing this or could you hear them say this or you're arguing against people that have no morals no remorse no integrity at all and you're arguing with an art a standing of I have integrity I have morals I know what's right and wrong they don't care what's right and wrong okay and when you're fighting against someone who doesn't care what's right and wrong you cannot fight them with a set of rules that you have that they don't okay you have to just draw it what it is and you say these motherfuckers got to go and you get rid of them yeah and that's what the fuck it takes and nobody wants to say that and I think a lot of people don't realize that I think a lot of people think like oh well clearly they're just stupid or you know they're just making mistakes or you know I can't believe they're doing this no dude that's what they want you to say that's what they want you to think they want you to look at them just like we looked at Joe Biden not me not these guys but a lot of people and they look at Joe Biden they say fuck he's seen how he doesn't know what he's doing no dude they put him in that position just so you would say that and they could get away with all of this shit so we're dealing with people who these judges and these other members of the whatever you want to call it the deep state or the establishment you know these people they don't care if you think it's right or wrong they don't care if it hurts you they don't care if they're hypocrites they don't care if they say something today and they said something opposite yesterday that none of that makes sense to us but they're operating on a level with with no rules and no integrity and no right and wrong and no no care and you can't fucking defeat an enemy like that playing by your moral standard of rules when they don't fucking have any yeah okay so there's gonna become a time where it's gotta get fucking dirty and you gotta say hey you know what this guy won't stop fucking with me so i'm gonna fuck with him back and if that were to happen all of this shit would end real talk immediately immediately it's the people saying we've seen an Instagram comments i can't believe they said this i can't believe they did this what when is this gonna stop it's gonna stop when you fucking stop it that's every fucking individual in this country standing up and saying no fucking more work done with you they come to our houses they fucking who asks us they do all this shit it wouldn't take a rocket science to figure out what would actually get them to stop these people are fucking people just like everybody else they threaten us they fuck with us and you know what's gonna stop them from fucking with us getting a taste of their own shit back and that time is coming very quick very soon man but that's my that's my thing man it's like you know you need more proof even though we just arrested the fucking MS 13 ring leader right and fucking Virginia they just got him i mean Lincoln Riley i mean you can you look man there's no denying it's there no we're we're making a that's what i'm saying we're making a case against people that do not necessarily care if they have a case or not yeah like we can say i can't believe they're doing this look what they did and they're over there saying yeah look what we did and these fucking idiots are not fucking doing shit about it not doing anything man i think that leads me to my guess my next question is like okay so like what what does Trump do in response to that right because i mean it's not there there's a precedence for defying court orders right Biden did it multiple times yeah Biden student loanboast the Supreme Court didn't stop me this is a CNN article here how Biden is continuing to cancel student loan debt despite Supreme Court ruling i mean he's done it multiple times there is something seriously wrong here's another thing i brought up to that i thought was interesting did you see this this article came out a third of all DC district judges not even born in the United States to me there is something listen i'm all for natural you know immigration i'm all for naturalization simulation into our culture 100 percent but i think there is something to be said that for somebody who is supposed to be inherent like you know inherently unbiased reading a law how it is i mean you would think that that person would be a natural like a naturally born citizen of this country and a third of of all DC judges were not even born here you know i'm saying but these are the same people that are you know determining the fabric of our of our country and what's what's legal or not yep that's a problem i agree that's a problem but we got i might have a fix for that a little bit later uh you know a fix for that we got a fix for it um but in other news last little bit i want to bring up in here uh jasmine crockett she's a hard lady to fucking you know like there's some good news though uh she's a accused of assaulting a journalist in the capital and apparently at the time of the recording assault charges have actually been filed against jasmine crockett have you did you see the video of her of her doing this no there's a video of it let's check it out go on this one crockett you recently on a Tesla take down call call for valentine to $29 you like to clarify your comments Congress we can don't buy we can have violence at the time i mean is that assault i buy they are standards as assault look like an insurrection to me yeah me too i mean it's not really assault i mean get the fucking camera out of my fit whatever dude we live in a pacified society so maybe it is not me but wouldn't that be planned by their rules yes it would be let's do it yeah i i i can't believe that someone of of that caliber is even serving in our government at all um she is a total fucking idiot you know and she's ghetto as fuck she's not but see that she's not no she's not well people are fucking tired of that shit bro you know they're tired of these people just yelling and screaming and fucking being assholes and fucking making a mockery of our government and you know she's laughing at all the critics and she's laughing at everybody like dude look man these things always end the same way whether that's a year from now whether that's five years from now these people should be really careful about how they fucking position themselves right now because people are on the fucking edge of a revolution and that's that's not me making some sort of statement that's just reality dude and that's the natural progression of corruption you know corrupt corrupt corrupt revolution pure pure pure pure corrupt corrupt revolution this has happened over you know this is a cycle yeah and a lot of these people clearly don't understand history because they're not treating their job with respect they're not treating the American citizens respect and um you know these people historically usually end up uh unalived that's real man that's real guys jump in on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think uh without being so let's go cruise some of these comments yeah we got some good ones today you know that was a uh it was a real or a short youtube short that went out and uh I guess you guys caught me daydream or something yeah about cheeseburgers yeah well they got something for you with uh with grilled cheese fucking button I think a lot of the shit was fired though I bet it was pretty fucking good um this first comment is uh from at low low 70 at 87 says uh Andy's daydream would be corn and boil chicken I mean I'm not much on boil chicken corn's pretty good now I don't like boil chicken bro shit gross me the fuck out boil chicken I even know you could boil chicken until I was remates with Chris he's throwing him on the bus yeah that's fucking boiled chicken all the time dude you throw some fucking salt and pepper

gonna do this in this in this just wait I'm like oh really like you know say him like why would you do that yeah why would you why would you fork at people like transparency mm-hmm I'm like okay well

them know your next move they would ever yeah fucking ever like ever like these people want to they want to fucking you know they want to broadcast their business strategy or their their plans and it's like dude it's like you want credit for it before you do it and then you're I don't know man I mean I guess keep doing it but just know like I don't think that's a very smart thing no it's not

the best and I'm confident that my shit being the best will be your best I'm when it was last time I took an L even my L's are fucking W's I don't know the last time but I know the next time yeah never it'll be this PB&J contest yeah guys we appreciate you for being a real ass fans appreciate you guys let's keep this cruise cruise and we got a second set of headlines um let's dive into these um this is an interesting topic and this is where the real AF exclusive comes in we did some some behind the scenes research um and we're gonna let some sinks in today and uh let's dive through this so I mean everybody's talking about it they're really trying to make a big deal out of these uh the signal leak chats yeah okay like that's a that's a big topic for another reason let's dive into some of this because it wasn't just the signal leak checks apparently now um this headline reads how did this happen Mike Waltz exposed hundreds of contacts after leaving VIMO public national security advisor Mike Waltz left his VIMO account wide open to the public until Wednesday afternoon exposing hundreds of personal and professional contacts uh to potential exploitation a so-called analysis by the leftist tech outlet wired revealed that the account listed under Michael Waltz with the profile photo of the man himself connected to names tied to the Trump administrations and the circles names like Susie Wiles white house chief of staff and walker uh barrett a national security council staffer um in total it was 328 people including military officials political strategist prominent journalist and even other members of the Trump administrations and a circle um now that came out now it's interesting because VIMO shit's not new Biden also did it a couple of years ago uh even though they you know forget to bring that type of stuff up um Joe Biden's VIMO account discovered in less than 10 minutes um but again nobody talks about that but it wasn't it wasn't just this there's also a massive data breached that's happening right now um private contact info and passwords of Trump's top secret officials including Mike Waltz tolcy Gabbard Pete Hickseth uh were reportedly just found online via hack data and search engines um this is this is crazy so uh it's a bombshell report that comes from Germany's their spygo which confirmed that the personal phone numbers email addresses and even passwords of these high level officials cannot be accessed by virtually anyone including foreign uh intelligence agencies um according to the news outlet the reporters use commercial people search engines along with hack customer data that has been published on the web according to the report national security advisor Mike Waltz director of national uh intelligence tolcy Gabbard uh sect death Pete Hickseth or among those who personal data was discovered in online leaks so um you have a lot of this this this crazy shit going on um hostile intelligence services could use this publicly available data to hack the communications of those affected by installing spyware on the devices it is thus conceivable that foreign agents were privy to the signal chat um in which Gabbard Waltz and Hickseth discussed a military strike according to the german news outlet um and they found other stuff there was WhatsApp signal accounts um phone numbers uh drop box Microsoft teams linked in and even fitness apps that were all linked to these individuals and in the passwords were reused across the services some of which were found in over 20 separate breaches um it's it's it's it's wild right um and uh you know the the piece that that that's interesting here right because you got all of this stuff coming out and you know I was getting the sense like damn this feels pretty fucking coordinated you know them saying like all of this stuff comes out at once right and we we're gonna I'm gonna go somewhere real quick um because we have a freshman representative okay branding yield annihilates NPR CEO exposes her blatant hypocrisy and a firing grilling I'm gonna show you how this makes sense here shortly okay so she's the the CEO of NPR NPR um is on its way to get dismantled it's on its way to get defunded it's a funded propaganda machine for the fucking left 100% now out of out of all the stuff with the USAID etc correct now and then this is not like a new thing that just started right like it's been in the works for months now okay um and so captain mayor okay she's this radical leftist CEO of NPR um she was subpoena to to to the capital um and grilled essentially right and I'm gonna show you this clip this is uh this is Brandon Gale freshman representative let's check this clip out do you believe that america is addicted to white supremacy um I believe that I tweeted that and I as I've said earlier I believe much of my thinking has evolved over the last half it has evolved why did you tweet that I don't recall the exact context sir so I wouldn't be able to say okay do you believe that america believes in black plunder and white democracy I don't believe that sir you you tweeted that in reference to a book you were reading at the time apparently the case for reparations I don't think I've ever read that book sir you tweeted about it you said you took a day off to fully read the case for reparations you put that on twitter on january of 2020 apologies I don't recall that I did okay I know I'd note out that you're you're tweet there is correct but I don't recall okay do you believe that white people inherently feel superior to other races I do not you don't you you tweeted something to that effect you said I I grew up feeling superior how how wide of me why did you tweet that um I think I was probably reflecting on what it was to be to grow up in an environment where I had lots of advantages it sounds like you're saying that white people feel superior I I don't believe that anybody feels that way sir I was just reflecting on my own experiences you think the white people should pay reparations I I've never said that sir yes you did you said it in january of 2020 you tweeted yes the north yes all of us yes america yes our original collective sin and unpaid debt yes reparations yes on this day I don't believe that was a reference to fiscal reparations are what kind of reparations was it a reference to I think it was just a reference to the idea that we all owe much to the people who came before us that that's a bizarre way to frame what you tweeted um okay how how how many how many repar how much reparations have you personally paid uh sir I I don't believe that I've ever paid reparations okay just for everybody else I'm not asking anyone to be what you're suggesting do you believe that looting is morally wrong I believe that looting is illegal and I refer to it as counterproductive I think it should be prosecuted you believe it's morally wrong though of course of course then why did you refer to it as counterproductive uh the very different very different way to describe it it is both morally wrong and counterproductive as well as being it's hard to be mad about protests in reference to the BLM rotett protests not prioritizing the private property of a system of oppression you didn't condemn the looting you said that it was counterproductive NPR also promoted a book called indefensive looting do you think that that's an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars uh I'm unfamiliar with that boxer and I don't believe that was at my time it I'm not you read that book but I don't believe that I did read that so just so we're clear what you're watching and hearing is what I described earlier it's someone with no morals no integrity no standard who is willing to lie when pressed on the things that they've said because they understand that the things that they said put their position of influence and jeopardy so you are looking at someone who even though we have written evidence that this is what they believe we have multiple tweets that says this is what they would believe is legitimately denying that they believe any of those things so that their position of influence can be preserved and if you go back and read marks or rules for radicals from a lensky or any of these books this is exactly what they talk about oh she's a communist yeah 100% full blown comments 100 and 50% bro and at the expensive allegedly I mean at the expense of us right like she you know she takes it out of taxpayer dollars pushes out all this fucking bullshit propaganda shit by the way what demographic does she fit into oh she's that whitebruncher no shit upper middle class right fucking never had any fucking hard chips never had anybody fucking robber or dealt with anything that had to do with anything that regular people have to fucking deal with 100% man now and then by the way they think they have the moral standard to demand that everybody see the world the way they see it you know what I'm saying right right dictates us how we should be like you're the last person that should be dictating anything to anybody literally yeah like you probably couldn't fucking handle your own shit at all and by the way who do these people call when they get in trouble who do these people you know it's all the same people they condemn all the fucking time 100% you know what I'm saying well well maybe we should stop fucking defending people like this I think we should I mean they you know when when they went to what was it ashville they avoided houses with Trump signs maybe we should stop just helping anybody like this when bad things happen to them we just say oh sorry yeah sucks yeah sucks a suck yeah sucks a suck can't arrest the people you know they're your people why will we arrest them here's the thing right to DJ like DJ Andy like what what what what does this lady have to do with any of this signal link shit and you know what you know yeah yeah that was a cool grilling you know I'm saying Prikudos to fucking you know Brandon Gil great yeah it's it's okay like school I mean yeah but like we're gonna have to move on from from growing and strongly worded letters to make a change 100% this lady deserves to be in jail I mean that's putting it lightly very lightly with the amount of lies and propaganda that she and her network has been responsible for for years mm-hmm it's very like agreed but here's where it gets juicy though dude like I said this isn't nothing new right MPR has been on the chopping blocks since USAID was discovered all of these different things and I'm like man like who is this Catherine lady right like who is she you know I'm saying like you know at at her direction I mean the signal leak thing it just is weird right and like this is an MPR headline that was just released days after the signal link the pittagon more in the app was the target of hackers right well I mean you know it's been known in most people who are plugged in that signal is highly accessible by the NSA and CIA for sure like anybody anybody who's been plugged into anything the last four years aware of that 100% yeah so there's no there's no it's no security let's dive into signal a little bit right because signals signal is it's a company right it has you know members and leadership and a board of directors mm-hmm guess who sits on the board of directors for signal probably that lady fuck yeah this lady does yeah so is that weird is that weird no so you so I want and this is this is all speculation there but let's just try to paint a picture here so a world economic form young global leader oh man yeah all tight it yeah so your organization that you've been stifling and stealing and exploiting the American people to then shove propaganda down their fucking throats is now at risk of being destroyed correct you sit on the board of directors for this fucking organization signal I'm like man how can we get the heat off of less and get some of these people out the way cause some damage somehow oh I know let's leak their fucking group chats allegedly right that were never actually fucking like it's possible and by the way let's talk about this okay let's talk about the moral responsibility of the reporter who was allegedly included of on the group chats right at what point should he have said hey guys yeah right that you guys I'm not supposed to be here I think I should be in this right but he didn't he didn't go fucking communist fuck would do and he let them lay out all the shit or whatever which by the way I read it all wasn't wasn't really much layout yeah but you know layout all these these things and didn't say he didn't have a responsibility to say hey I don't belong in this or hey you guys this is not good that shows you where they stand they don't stand in the security of our information or our country or anything they stand to destroy it and by his silence and then bring it to the public that's exactly what he was trying to do which is completely it's malicious and that's right it's anti-Americans malicious and it could be considered treasonous because you are you are the one leaking the quote unquote information if we were to hold that motherfucker accountable and say hey you're guilty of treason for leaking the information that you shouldn't leaked you know what he's going to say uh you know it wasn't that big of information you're right right that's why I leaked it right so he's going to go against what he's saying now so let's put that motherfucker in the heart in the hot seat let's see how he changes too because these people work on what's convenient for them in the moment right just like any manipulator does or any liar does that woman is completely lying bold faced in the House of Congress and she's going to walk out of there and say fuck those people and do whatever she can to keep moving these people look we had Curtis powers on the shows probably the biggest expert on communism and how they implemented alive today multiple books higher life multiple documentaries these people are committed that's what people do not understand bro they are committed they are committed do you know what commitment means in this situation they're willing to die for it so they don't have fear of the law or fear of repercussions or it's what can we do no matter what to destroy this country and people like you and me and every working you know class normal fucking quote unquote American person out there so yeah I mean it's it's possible that that's what happened dude I'm just putting the dots out probably probable I mean you don't think she gave a fucking nudge hey how can we get these guys you know I don't think it's just her no but I mean it's it's it's crazy now now I want to I want to finish this I think those people are stupid for using signal like what the fuck yeah like people regular people know that signals compromised allegedly allegedly allegedly now here's the thing right like speaking of communists because this also just came out I thought this was interesting details revealed inside the CCP's united front work in Minnesota so this just came out in many anapolis Minnesota I'm sorry in St. Paul Minnesota on the 1300 block of justice street Tim and the drive from the governor's mansion sits a brutalist brick building that houses a secret Chinese Communist Party front operation that serves several functions for the CCP none of them good for the United States out of this building CCP operatives curry favor with politicians like Minnesota governor Tim Walls and provide various service for Chinese Americans and Minnesota who are still loyal to Beijing including hosting meeting greets with CCP diplomats and dignitaries businesses registered at this address receive six figure grants from American taxpayers the building has been associated with a web of businesses and groups including the alliance of Chinese culture and arts the center for community service and the alliance of Minnesota Chinese organizations it's also the home of the overseas Chinese service center of Minnesota which apparently works under the umbrella of the CCP's quote unquote united front um this just came in I mean in like you know pictures of being fucking released there's Tim Walls with one of the leaders there I mean there he is again right Tim Walls is fucking huge fucking oh he's big time China yeah big time China I mean the fuck they're 10 minutes from his house you know I'm saying but all of this is say there might be some silver lining could you see that video him saying he kicked Trump supporters ass he said he could kick Trump supporters asses this fucking turd you only kicking nobody's ass bitch you know they fucking ain't happening you know like dude dude we uh but here but here there's a silver lining here okay there may be a silver lining here um because this also just drop um enters the why do we allow these people here why do we allow these people to fucking set up shop why do we allow open communists to exist in our country why they wouldn't allow us to exist no let's go open up a real American freedom sensor in this fucking China yeah they would fucking kill you you know I'm saying yeah not only that why do we allow people who openly hate this country to serve in Congress to have organizations here to own property here that should be completely you know and we walk a fine line right like well you can't criticize the US government or you know otherwise that's communism like look dude that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about people who are actively working against the interest of the country from inside why are they allowed to be here from any race any country any organization well and you percent well we got to start somewhere which is where the silver lining that um I want to introduce into the show representative Thomas Massey who is doing trying to do some good work he just posted this um on Instagram said yesterday I introduced house resolution 2356 the dual loyalty disclosure act if we continue allowing dual citizens to run for federal office candidates should disclose suit voters all countries in which they hold citizenship thank you can uh co-sponsors representative Andy Biggs major retailer green and Clay Higgins and um this is the press release from from his website uh the dual loyalty disclosure act um which would require candidates for federal office to disclose both their possession of dual citizenship and also the foreign country in which their dual citizenship is hailed the disclosure of dual citizenship status would appear publicly in the statement of candidacy filed when political candidates seek election to federal office um duals quote dual citizens elected to you united states congress should renounce citizenship in all other countries uh representative Massey said uh quote at a minimum they should disclose their citizenship in other countries and abstain from votes specifically benefiting those countries if we're going to continue to allow members of congress to acquire and retain citizenship in other countries they should at least be required to disclose the voters all countries on which they consider themselves to be citizens that's obvious but the rule should be that nobody can serve in a federal position of any sort whether it be employee judge prosecutor congressman senator state level federal level doesn't fucking matter if you are working within a government agency office that is funded by united states tax payers funds you should not be able to be a citizen of any other country or hold dual citizenship of any other country um um period it's very simple it's very simple it's the only way to ensure that most of america's uh employees servants are working with our best interests in mind and right now they know they're all working for their own best interests which is how these guys come in with nothing and leave with a hundred million dollars so it's greed it's power it's corruption and it's deep and you know it's funny that Massey's the one guy that Trump said he's going to get him primarily and get him out uh well i mean real talk i haven't heard Trump say anything about this i haven't heard Trump fucking say that we should have american serving in office you know if you're so fucking american first then why haven't you said that you should be supporting a hundred percent that should be a main a main initiative of the Trump administration is to rule out any other foreign interference uh at all not just financing but also actual citizenship or dual citizenship dude it's so crazy that he really is american first bro that's how it should be it's how it should be and it's like and so crazy because you'll have people on the communist side saying oh what you know rushes interfering our elections okay well let's keep them out but let's also keep out china yeah let's also keep out israel let's also keep out Ukraine let's also keep out all any other fucking country that has i mean this is considered influence in my fucking elections yes it israel the israel supporters like no it's Qatar okay Qatar too yeah Qatar too yeah fuck pop a new guinea i don't give a fuck all of them that's what they don't understand dude it's not just one it's not just israel we're talking about everybody anyone any one of those fucking countries but especially is but especially guys i said it makes people mad guys jumping on this conversation man let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our third of final uh set of headlines we got headlines number three um this is interesting um doge has revealed its next target right so they've done USAID um they've done they've done a few things right um and Elon Musk is announcing his next target and he also announced the eye popping amount he saved each American so far the next agency that is going to be under the microscope is going to be the EPA environmental protection agency um the administrator Lee zeldin announced his decision to terminate a two billion dollar grant to stacey abrams uh to a linked non-government organization with the support of doge let me ask you something do you think that stacey abrams would figure out how to steal most of that money for herself already that's the thing i mean like yeah the truth is bro that the money that they be allocating bro that shit's it's already gone before it even hits the account it's already gone let's give stacey abrams fat ass two billion fucking dollars for angio okay when before she barely was getting hundred dollar donations you know the he says quote the doge fbi investigating the money uh and the money has been frozen he announced it is insane that the Biden admin would give two billion dollars to an organization that previously only received a hundred dollars zeldin responded to a social media message from president Donald trump who complained about the grant and ordered his government to get back the money so we'll see we'll see what happens we'll see if if any fruit comes out of that um you know in other news other things going on in the government right now rfk jr uh he's planning to slash twenty thousand hhs jobs and the latest doge inspired purge um he just made an announcement today um saying that he's gonna bring the total staff count from eighty two thousand people to sixty two thousand people did the it is insane to to think of the fact that you have our federal government we have agencies within our federal government that have more employees than most american companies in this country no it's not that's what they do like it's just bureaucracy bro it's it's no different here's what they did it's a scam so nobody has to fucking actually work all right when people work without a real budget or a budget that's so big there might as well be no budget right what they do is instead of actually being productive or doing the work they hire more people they say well we need three more people to do this job well that's your job well yeah i don't we need them to do it right and then when those people get enough responsibility to have budget decisions they hire three more people each okay because they don't want to do the fucking job right and that's why when we show up in any any government agency the service is so fucking terrible because nobody cares there's no repercussions there's no pressure to do a good job there's no incentive to do a good job and um you know that's what we're dealing with here we're dealing with a massively bloated system uh that is filled with entitled people that have no incentive to do an effective job or a quick job or to serve the people who pay their salaries and then on top of it those people generally and my personal experience are pretty disrespectful when you go into those places um i have not personally had a good experience 99% of the time that i've gone into a government building for a license or a permit or fucking anything i mean what about you guys have you guys had tremendous experiences and my wayoff track what what about you guys in this room good or bad you know i was on the call that one time with the lady fucking four fucking hours bro that's that's absurd and then it gets turned around they can replace all these people with with a with an effective system that is legitimately automated to to hand you can tell me you can't automate license plate renewals or permits or any of the shit that really dude the real talk the reason they do this shit is so that the governments that are in control of the quote unquote economy at that time can brag about how many jobs that they actually created when in reality those aren't in the private sector those aren't considered jobs those are government jobs that we pay for it doesn't help us but they serve it to us as if it does so you know it look man there was a close like 25% of all new jobs created or something like that yeah it was crazy amount but like then they turn to us they say look at all the jobs we created well all they did was put us in a bigger hole because they spent our money to do that government doesn't make money doesn't create they do make money they make sense like pronoun you know producing but that's why that's another way how they steal from us yeah they produce way more money they drive the value of the doubt bro look if we made a hundred dollars ten years ago it was worth a lot more correct everybody understands that right okay so if a hundred dollars is worth less now because they printed so much money and it's worth half of what it was what is that to the average person is that any different than stealing from them no it is steel that's right it's intentional handicapping of their financial power again they do this intentionally so that people have a very hard time getting wealthy because wealthy people are harder to control so it's all about control it's all about stifling you know what they see is the enemy there's nothing about serving that that you know nothing they do is to serve us you know to be completely honest about this you know we don't even need 62,000 no no you know and like dude people who work for the government are all riled up about this shit but dude you know let's let's be real about what you guys have actually fucking done and and you knew there was a reckoning coming at some point there had to be you know just get a free ride on everybody's fucking tax dollars no and then produce absolutely have nothing to show for no other things going on with RFK junior he's also planning that to change up some of the foodstip stuff which is irritating some people interestingly enough yeah I mean those are the people you see crews around Walmart on the fucking carts on the little go carts yeah just like they do from Texas yeah they're not they're quote their quote unquote disabled because you know they're 700 fucking pounds they're on government assistance and they're buying candy and fucking coke cola and in Pepsi and you know all these things they're filled with massive amounts of fucking chemicals and sugars they get unhealthy then they you know become customers of the healthcare system which you know is all a scam as well like bro it's all about like they don't want to they want to allow this because it actually makes them money in a long run because the damage that it creates for sure and the craziest part about it dude is the people who develop entitlement to it you know like check this lady out bro okay y'all just mad because I get three can fools now so what I get all kind of snacks while I'm sitting here chilling or whatever paying no bills no bills I'm all government assistance my son that was his next government assistance three can't fool yeah well I hate to bring it to you lady but we're all pretty fucking tired of that and your days of doing this and rubbing it everybody's fucking face are numbered I could promise you that because if these motherfuckers won't do it the next administration will because the next administration is going to be run by people like me and we're gonna fucking take all that shit away and make your fucking fat ask it a motherfucking job three K a month yeah it's fucking insane bro they they've made it they've look they've removed the incentive for people like this to work okay why would you work if you can get three K a month on food stamps they've taken the lowest class the least ambitious the most entitled class of people and basically told them you don't have to do anything okay and then they've taken all the working class who pay all these taxes and then they say you have to support people like this why are the fuck would any of us want to support someone like that what are they creating in society besides bad shit tell me what is she could hold on go back let's watch the video again okay yeah just mad because I get three can't fool them so what I get all kind of snatched while I'm sitting here chilling or whatever paying no bills no fairs I'm all government assistance my son back that was his dad government assistance three can't fool all right what is that person contributing to the United States of America beg radiation I agree it's about it okay nothing good now why should that person be allowed to fucking vote I'm asking you ask questions the real question why should that woman be able to vote if all she's doing is taking off of the system what do you think she's gonna vote for you gonna vote for a fucking food stamp can you kind of vote for more of our shit right to go to her so all of you working it doesn't matter if you're black white yellow red Christian Jewish fucking anything you by your government's demand are forced to support someone like that how does that make you feel do you feel good about that because I don't I think there's a lot of people that would actually benefit from government assistance if it wasn't abused by people like this okay she's not you know that woman could do things there's you know there's things that she could do right but she chooses not to because the system is so corrupt and if we take a system that is so corrupt that people can earn close or even more than what they can earn working a lower paying entry level job then what's the incentive ever to work they remove the incentive they create voters for the leftist communist propaganda and then by the way when communist getting control you know what they do these people they fucking kill them they're coming first that's right they come first dude you know it's dude it's you know for me like watching this bro like it is it pisses me off bro we need a fucking sledgehammer in office bro and I'm gonna be real like we ain't there yet no we ain't there yet we ain't got it yet no we don't we ain't got it yet dude but it pisses me the fuck off right in this shit and fucking one minute dude people be freaking out look at this fucking guy blah blah blah in six months the entire shit would be fixed and to think that it goes to shit like that makes me fucking sick when I see people who are young who are ambitious who are working low paying jobs that could use a little bit of help yeah for sure right why don't we help those people a little bit why don't we help the people who are working at the low paying jobs and just give them a little bit of boost but no we we sponsored these worthless non-contributing people okay and they're look how entitled she is to it entitled bro because she wanted to have seven kids by seven different dudes and the government oh yeah we'll pay remember when we were in that remember that story I told you about that certain place I was at where I got in the elevator with some a certain somebody yeah and I was talking about paying taxes and he fucking looked at me and said well somebody's got a fucking pay him yeah bro I wanted to beat that dude's ass right there in that elevator in front of fucking everybody like oh so so I can work but you can't right right fuck you man nah bullshit bro is bullshit especially like knowing that like the average American bro like that bro they're struggling right now bro you don't think they want like bro it's insane but then they can say like this yes that's what I'm saying why are we not reallocating the listen that woman maybe at one time she was in a position where she needed help sure I get it we've all been there but listen absolutely yeah but here's the point because I don't want people on assist because there's a lot of people on assistance that are really fucking trying yeah okay and I know a lot of people including some people that work here that were on assistance growing up who are working hard to break out of that so they're we can't villainize all of them but there should be certain standards bro you should have to pass a drug test you shouldn't be able to smoke weed and chill and fucking take drugs and all this shit you know I want to smoke weed fucking I get to because you know why I pay my mother fucking shit all right but her she should be drug tested and she should be forced to get a job and there should be a term limit on how much government assistance one can collect over the course of their life it'd be very and then yeah and then if you get in the situation where you don't have any money we'll we'll create some sort of fucking you know we'll take California and we'll make it a fucking we'll make an area like a sort of like a prison but a little nicer you go live there that would be an incentive for them to get their fucking asses into being productive don't you think I think so I think so bro it's the entitlement piece for me bro hey it yeah it's gross it's disgusting fucking gross I mean real talk bro like and again like I'm sorry not to cut you out but like it's even okay cool like get food stamps great but you're not spinning that shit on fucking actual fucking food you're filling it with you're filling your carts with fucking Reese's cups and fucking all it is well that's because they had they get too much money dude they're getting too much if they got lost they fucking prioritize on the shit they need bro it's no different than like wick right like wick assistance for example right helping you know it's funny bro what I don't know any I don't know any wealthy people they fucking eat like that no at all no anyway we're gonna say about no I was just like it's like wick like there's only you can only get certain shit on the wick program you know I'm saying it's meant to get the nutrients and shit to the set up the same fucking boundaries bro set up the same fucking boundaries if you really need help and you really need the assistance and you really just you need food for your fucking family cool Reese's cups ain't a part of that bro I'm sorry it just ain't it shouldn't be look man and this is coming from somebody who grew up on food fucking food stamps to be very clear shouldn't be fucking no bullshit bro bullshit well look dude here's the reality there's many many business owners in this country that employ many many people provide careers for many many people and if they weren't tax so heavily their business would grow and provide more careers and more jobs and many of these people at these companies are taxed millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of dollars a year I'm not talking about the Amazon's and the e-bays they got ways around that I'm talking about the mid-sized businesses that are you know they're over a hundred million they're over three hundred million but they're less than a billion right you know I'm saying the the companies that are big in your town that support the fucking projects and the t-balls and the baseball teams and the community cleanups and they build homes in your in your local community those other companies ain't doing that and the harshest most aggressive tax code is geared at that person and I'm sure that there are plenty of people that pay all of those taxes that would much rather their tax money go to people who maybe are at the entry level of their career but they are struggling and help push them up in life rather than supporting people that would sink anyway and that's the reality of it. Dude it is really listen you cannot operate the country out south look the worst thing that ever happened in this country is getting all these fucking feelings involved by people who you know have never been exposed to reality you can't run an effective country without operating in reality and here's the reality there's people that contribute and there's people that don't and people that don't should should we take care of them for a certain a period of time in their life I'm my heart says no because I've seen what they do but most people say well okay a reasonable thing would be a certain amount of time. Sure right and the rest of that money should go towards actually improving things for the people to pay the motherfucking tax so no vote none of this shit you know like be fixed real quick it's gross dude she's not going to vote for fucking cuts and ever on food she's never gonna vote for what's best for the country it's only gonna be best for her.
